    JUDGMENT1. These are applications by Mr Simpson on behalf of the accused El Mostafa to reject evidence tendered by the Crown or for me to rule that such tendered evidence is inadmissible. What is proposed to be tendered by the Crown is the product of two telephone intercepts legally obtained in which it is admitted by Mr Simpson his client, Mr El Mostafa, was a participant. 2. For the purposes of the voir dire I have had tendered and admitted into evidence a transcript of both of the relevant telephone calls. They are transcripts prepared by the defence. I also admitted into evidence some documents concerning another charge faced by Mr El Mostafa and which was dismissed. 3. Mr Simpson accepts the following propositions: that the translations are those recently obtained by the defence; that the intercepts are relevantly short in duration; that each of the calls contained his client's voice; in each call his client is referred to as MV 1 and that the telephone intercepts were lawfully intercepted. 4. I will deal first with VDA and VD2 which are both transcripts of a telephone call which is referred to as call number 5 and occurred on 23 March 2005. Mr Simpson's first submission is that any reference to his client being called Abu Fajer by the other caller should be inadmissible because I have previously given a ruling that evidence of an admission by his client given during a police interview is inadmissible. That admission was to the effect that he is known as Abu Fajer. 5. Mr Simpson argues that it would be unfair and inappropriate for the Crown to try to get in evidence of a similar admission in another way. I reject that submission. The ruling I gave was in another context and concerned an admission allegedly made in the context of a police interrogation. I do not regard it as inappropriate for the Crown to tender other evidence of admissions to the same effect which may not be affected by the same difficulties. It seems clear to me from this particular telephone call that it is open to the jury to infer that the person identified as MV1 adopts the reference to him by the name Abu Fajer. 6. The second point in respect of call number 5 is in respect of material making reference to the American government and terrorism, and the third point concerns references by the other caller, an unidentified person, critical of the Shiia. The Crown prosecutor before and also during the course of the argument indicated that he would not press any material touching upon those aspects and therefore there is no need for me to rule. 7. The fourth aspect of call number 5 objected to by Mr Simpson occurs in a sequence of the telephone conversation commencing on page 3 of VD 2, about six lines in and finishing at the top of page 4 two lines in. Mr Simpson drew my attention to a charge which his client faced arising from events on 4 February 2005, that is some five days after the alleged riot. The charge against him was brought by a person in the Arabic community in Auburn. That charge went to court and was dismissed by the magistrate. Mr Simpson's point in respect of that part of call number 5 which I identified earlier is that it would be unfair to admit that component because it is not entirely clear that the issues which his client was discussing in that component are necessarily referable to the events which occurred on 30 January 2005, which is the subject of this trial, or whether they might refer to the other charge. 8. However, in my opinion there is no doubt that that part of the telephone conversation was referring to the events on 30 January 2005 because of the references to the event, the topic of the conversation at that part of the transcript being reported on television including in Iraq and on foreign channels. 9. In my opinion there is no risk (and this component of the application was made under s135 and s137 of the Evidence Act 1995) of any confusion. I therefore rule in respect of call number 5 that references to Abu Fajer by the other caller adopted by Mr El Mostafa are admissible as is that component of the call which I referred to earlier and which is in fact better identified, because of some further amendments made by the Crown during the course of argument, by reference to VDA. The unexcised portions over pages 6 and 7 in my opinion are admissible and I so rule. 10. Just returning to call number 5 Mr Simpson made a submission about references to Muslims towards the end of that call but that is no longer pressed by the Crown. 11. Turning to call number 16 which was made on 25 June 2005 Mr Simpson objects to references to his client as Abu Fajer. In my opinion it is open to the jury to infer that references to Abu Fajer during the course of that telephone conversation were adopted by the accused. 12. Additionally Mr Simpson made objection to references in that call to books and publications concerning the Shiia and also to any references by the other caller who was unidentified critical of the Shiia. Once again the Crown Prosecutor either before or during the course of argument has agreed to the deletion of those portions touching upon those topics and there is no need for me to rule. 13. Mr Simpson's final point in respect of call number 16 is that it will be confusing to permit evidence to be led of that part of the telephone conversation relating only to the riot because part of the telephone conversation material related to the court case. I agree that part of the telephone conversation clearly related to the court case or at least to the prosecution of Mr El Mostafa which was dismissed. However, the Crown Prosecutor is pressing those components of the transcript which are only referable to the events which are the subject of this trial. He is not pressing any component which expressly or impliedly may refer to the other court proceedings which were dismissed against Mr El Mostafa. 14. There is in my opinion, as the Crown submits, a division within the transcript of the call amongst the various topics which are discussed. In my opinion the transcript which is now VDB, as amended by the Crown, leaves in only components which are relevant to the issues in this trial. I acknowledge that if Mr Simpson wished to cross-examine anyone on those components by reference to the other court case then there may be some difficulty. This is not a difficulty I think which is unfair. It is a difficulty faced by many defence counsel in running a trial. It is difficult to imagine a line of cross-examination which may wish to touch upon issues to do with the other court case but, even if they did, the prejudicial value in my opinion would be reduced by the fact that Mr El Mostafa was acquitted and by the sounds of it fairly convincingly in those proceedings. 15. Accordingly in my opinion those components of VDB which are not excised are admissible and I so rule. 16. I would add that Mr Simpson has reserved his position so far as a component of one of the telephone transcripts which has been excised by the Crown which he may wish to be part of the evidence and, if necessary, I will hear him another time on that if there can be no agreement reached.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant Wayne Anthony Trindall seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed on him in the District Court on 21 April 2006 for 17 offences. He pleaded guilty to each offence which were as follows: 
     
      
     Three counts of detain for advantage and cause substantial injury contrary to s 90A Crimes Act 1900 (now repealed) – maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment. 
       
     One count of aggravated detain for advantage (inflict actual bodily harm) contrary to s 86(2)(b) – maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment. 
       
     One count of detain for advantage contrary to s 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty 14 years. 
       
     Six counts of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act. – maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 
       
     Three counts of sexual assault contrary to s 61I Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment. 
       
     One count of inflicting actual bodily harm within intent to have sexual intercourse contrary to s 61K(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment. 
       
     Two counts of robbery contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment. 
       
    2 In all the 17 charges involved 7 different victims, the offences being committed over a period of 9 years from 1995 to 2004. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was originally sentenced on 21 April 2006. By reason of the multiplicity of offences the sentencing process was complicated. As it happens some “slips” occurred and on 24 April 2006 the Court reconvened to correct a number of errors. The Crown asserted that some errors were not corrected and, although the sentencing judge identified a document which his Honour said would comprise the written record of the corrected sentences, suggested that it also contained typographical errors. However, the intention which his Honour expressed in making the corrections on 24 April was to reduce the overall term and non-parole period which his Honour had originally imposed by 6 months and provide a non-parole period of 21 years and 6 months and an overall term of 23 years and 6 months.  
     
      
    4 The applicant does not complain of errors in the individual sentences and having regard to the issues raised by the applicant many individual sentences are not relevant in the resolution of this application. Nevertheless, the Crown has prepared a table which incorporates a reference to the offence, original sentence imposed, corrected sentence and the sentence apparently intended by his Honour having regard to his further remarks. For completeness I include that table below:

       Sentence intended by his Honour as stated at ROS 24.4.06 at p 1, ie a 6 month backdate to the start date for each sequence from sequence 31 onwards, without changing the length of any of the sentences as stated in ROS 21.4.06

        ""Victim 1 LC 
         
        29 September 1995 
         
        Charge number H22001138-28, 30, 31. 
        
       
       
        
        Around 8.30pm on the evening of Friday 29 September 1995 LC was walking in the vicinity of Yurong and Francis Streets, Darlinghurst. LC worked in this general area as a prostitute, however on this evening was not working. 
        
       
       
        
        Around this time Wayne Anthony Trindall (""the offender"") approached LC and engaged her in conversation offering to pay her $150 for posing for photographs to be used in a calendar. The offender advised LC that these photographs would be done in York Street, Randwick and LC agreed to go with the offender and travelled in a taxi to that general area. 
        
       
       
        
        From here the offender took LC through a wooden fence into a secluded area where she requested payment and the offender took out his wallet showing her a large quantity of cash. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender dropped the wallet onto the ground and charged at LC grabbing her around the neck with his arm. The offender punched LC a number of times to the face and ribs. As a result of being punched to the face LC sustained a black/bruised right eye. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown relies on the injury to the victim's eyes as proof of substantial injury in sequence 28 detain for advantage, and cause injury to victim charge. The Crown does not rely on this injury as proof of another offence in itself. 
        
       
       
        
        Charge Sequence 28 - Section 90A

        Detain For Advantage and Cause Substantial Injury to Victim 
        
       
       
        
        The offender produced a number of ties from his pocket and tied LC’s hands behind her back and placed a gag in her mouth. The advantage obtained by the offender by this action was control of LC to enable him to commit a sexual assault. 
        
       
       
        
        Charge Sequence 30 - Section 61J

        Aggravated Sexual Assault 
        
       
       
        
        Circumstance of Aggravation: That at the time of the commission of the offence the offender inflicted actual bodily harm on the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender placed some lubricant on his fingers and then penetrated LC’s vagina with his penis. LC did not consent to this action. 
        
       
       
        
        Charge Sequence 31 - Section 61J  
        Crimes Act  
        Aggravated Sexual Assault 
        
       
       
        
        Circumstance of Aggravation: That at the time of the commission of the offence the offender inflicted actual bodily harm on the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender then said ‘I'm going to do anal sex.’ LC replied ‘I'd rather you didn't'. The offender then inserted his penis into the anus of LC. LC did not consent to this action and the offender's actions caused immediate pain and discomfort. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender put his trousers back on and allowed LC to sit up and gave her a cigarette. At this point the offender stated that he was going to walk 30 metres away to recover her clothing and warned her not to move. The offender walked away and did not return. 
        
       
       
        
        LC was able to free herself of the bindings and hail down a passing motorist and said ‘I've been raped'. This motorist took LC to her mother's house in Darlinghurst. LC did not shower and both police and ambulance were notified and attended her location. 
        
       
       
        
        The matter was reported and LC was taken to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where a sexual assault examination was conducted. From this examination a number of swabs were obtained. 
        
       
       
        
        Actual bodily harm was inflicted on LC in the course of the commission of the sexual assault charged in sequence 31.

LC provided investigators with a statement about this matter on 3 October 1995. At the time a number of photographs were taken of LC showing bruising to her right eye, cuts and abrasions to both her knees and an abrasion to the knuckle of the middle finger on her right hand. 
        
       
       
        
        Victim 2 FH 
         
        31 May - 1 June 1997 
         
        Charge Number H22001138 - sequences 4, 8, 9, 36, 37. 
        
       
       
        
        During the evening of 31 May 1997 FH was working as a street prostitute in the vicinity of William Street, Kings Cross. At this time FH was approximately seven months pregnant. 
        
       
       
        
        Towards midnight the offender approached FH while driving a red sedan. A conversation ensued where FH detailed the prices of her services and the offender negotiated a fee of $200 for the offender to take FH to his house at Sutherland and engage in sexual acts and then return her to the city. 
        
       
       
        
        FH entered the offender's vehicle and he drove towards Sutherland where the offender engaged FH in general conversation. The offender told FH he was taking a short cut through the Royal National Park whereby he parked the vehicle in a secluded area near Audley. At this time FH began to cry, fearing for her safety. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender took hold of FH’s hair and shook her head and told her to stop crying. FH pleaded for her safety with the offender striking her across the right side of her face with the back of his hand. The offender motioned as if reaching from an item in the driver's door pocket while stating ‘I'm not going to have any problems from you'. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender got out of the car and went to the boot before going to FH’s door as she opened it. The offender took hold of FH’s arm and directed her to take her shoes off. FH complied with this direction and the offender directed her to walk a distance into the bushes. The offender has grabbed FH around her throat and pushed her back against a tree. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown concedes that the offender's criminal acts encompassed in paragraphs above are referable only to the sequence 4 offence of detain for advantage and cause substantial injury and the Crown does not rely on these facts as proof of or aggravation of any other offence. 
        
       
       
        
        Charge Sequence 36 - Section 94  
        Crimes Act  
        Robbery 
        
       
       
        
        At this time FH had a bum bag around her waist containing a Motorola brand mobile telephone, various make-up and personal items. The offender took the bum bag from FH and rifled through it taking the mobile phone and putting it into his own pocket whilst maintaining his grip on her throat. The offender directed FH to remove her top which she did whilst he pulled her pants and underpants down to her ankles. 
        
       
       
        
        The deprivation of the victim's liberty encompassed in the above paragraph is not relied upon by the Crown as a circumstance of aggravation of the robbery but is proof of the sequence 4 offence of detain for advantage and cause substantial injury. 
        
       
       
        
        Charge Sequence 4 - Section 90A

        Detained for Advantage and Cause Substantial Injury to Victim 
        
       
       
        
        The offender took a rope from his pocket and tied FH’s hands behind her back around a tree as well as looping the rope around her feet and tree. The advantage obtained by the offender by this action was control of FH to enable him to commit a sexual assault. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender kissed and bit FH on her neck and breasts in particular biting her right nipple breaking the skin and causing it to bleed.

        The offender picked up a stick approximately 1 centimetre thick and forced it into her vagina manipulating it causing FH severe pain and discomfort. The offender forced FH to squat down while still tied to the tree and forced his erect penis into her mouth a number of times before ejaculating on her face. The offender untied FH and turned her around so that she was facing the tree and again tied to the tree.

        Aggravated Sexual Assault 
        
       
       
        
        Circumstance of Aggravation: That at the time of the commission of the offence the offender inflicted actual bodily harm on the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender moved his penis from FH’s vagina and forced it into FH’s anus. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender loosened the rope on FH and grabbed her by the hair and threatened to kill her should she report the matter to the police before running off and driving away. FH complied with the offender's actions as she was fearful for her safety and the safety of her unborn child as well as being of the belief that the offender was armed with a weapon. This matter was reported to the police that same evening and a medical examination was conducted. 
        
       
       
        
        Actual bodily harm was inflicted on FH in the course of the commission of the sexual assaults charged in sequences 8 and 9. A medical examination was conducted on the victim on the night of the offences by Dr Emmanuel Karantanis, a gynaecology fellow at the St George Hospital. 
        
       
       
        
        Dr Karantanis noted the following abnormalities: 
        
       
       
        
        - the victim complained of severe anal and vaginal pain and cramps in the lower abdomen 
        
       
       
        
        - there were two lots of 1 centimetre diameter bruises just above her elbow on the back of her arm 
        
       
       
        
        - there was a bruise on the left knee and a 4 centimetre scratch above the right knee and a 1 centimetre bruise at the left shin 
        
       
       
        
        - there was a red area and a 3 centimetre scratch on the right upper quadrant of the victim's uterus 
        
       
       
        
        - the fourchette was very tender as was the perineum and anus

        30 January 2000 
         
        Charge Number H22001138 - Sequences 14, 38, 39 
        
       
       
        
        In the early hours of 30 January 2000 KN was in Craigend Street, Darlinghurst when she was approached by the offender who engaged her in conversation and offered to take swimsuit photographs of her for $100. 
        
       
       
        
        KN agreed and went with the offender in a taxi. The offender directed the taxi to Anzac Parade near Allison Road where they together walked into Centennial Park. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender directed KN through a clump of trees where he grabbed her by the arm and produced a knife placing it to her throat. A struggle ensued and the offender punched KN to her left cheek causing both of them to fall to the ground. The offender placed KN face down and forced her face into the ground threatening to kill her. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown concedes that the offender's criminal acts encompassed in the above paragraph are referable only to the sequence 14 offence of detain for advantage and cause substantial injury and the Crown does not rely on these facts as proof of aggravation of any other offence. The Crown does not rely on the offender's threat to kill the victim as proof of an actual intent to kill or proof of any offence in itself.

        Whilst sitting on KN’s back the offender tied her hands together around a tree. The advantage obtained by the offender by this action was control of KN to enable him to commit a sexual assault. 
        
       
       
        
        Substantial injury was sustained by KN in the course of the commission of the offence charged in sequence 14. A physical examination was conducted on the victim at around 7.50pm on 30 January 2000 by Dr Wendy Thornwaite who was at the time employed as an after hours sexual assault service medical officer for the Eastern and Central Sexual Assault Service.

        The offender removed KN’s g string, underpants and put another pair of underpants on her pulling them down to her ankles. The offender spat in her vagina and penetrated her vagina with his fingers. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender removed his fingers from KN’s vagina and penetrated her vagina with his erect penis from behind, thrusting a number of times before ejaculating inside her vagina. Whilst penetrating her vagina with his penis the offender said he wanted her to be his girlfriend. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown relies on the offender's digital penetration of the victim's vagina and the offender's penile penetration of the victim's vagina as unlawful sexual intercourse constituting the sexual assault. 
        
       
       
        
        Around this time the offender's mobile telephone rang and he stood up and had a conversation. KN attempted to untie herself and the offender returned and laid on top of her. The offender pushed her face into the ground stating ‘you better be quiet the guy who is coming is not as nice as me'.

        Heading Detain Person With Intent to Obtain Advantage and Occasion Actual Bodily Harm 
        
       
       
        
        The offender and RP went to Centennial Park in the early hours of Monday 26 January 2004. The offender forced RP to the ground where he then tied a rope around her wrists and tied her arms to a tree. At this time RP was on her back and has attempted to defend herself and the offender produced a knife and said 'if you do that again I'll fucking slit your throat'. The advantage obtained by the offender by this action was control of RP to enable him to commit a sexual assault. 
        
       
       
        
        RP sustained actual bodily harm during the course of her detention as charged in sequence 33. This included redness to the wrists, a bite mark to the neck and bruising to the nose.

        Crimes Act  
        Sexual Intercourse Without Consent 
        
       
       
        
        The offender then tore RP’s clothes from her and inserted his penis into her vagina without her consent. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender removed his penis from RP's vagina and rolled her onto her stomach and then he said 'I'm going to do it to you in the bum'. The offender then forced his penis into RP's anus without her consent causing her immediate pain and discomfort. While the offender forced his penis into RP's anus he pulled back on her head extending her neck. At this time RP felt that her life was in danger. 
        
       
       
        
        After the offender removed his penis from RP's anus he said to her ‘don't move or I'll kill you'. The offender then fled the scene. RP waited a short time and managed to free herself and seek assistance from a passing cyclist. From there police and ambulance were called and. attended the scene. 
        
       
       
        
        RP was conveyed to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where a sexual assault examination was conducted. From this examination a number of swabs were obtained. 
        
       
       
        
        Further police conducted a forensic examination to the scene and a number of exhibits were located. 
        
       
       
        
        I am going to interrupt the recitation of the agreed statement of facts at this point to quote from the only victim impact statement before me, that of RP. 
        
       
       
        
        RP said this of her experiences at the hands of the offender: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It is hard to express how I feel since the rape happened. I honestly thought that was it, I was going to lose my life. I didn't think he would do what he did. I have never felt this way ever before. I can't explain the pain I experienced and at the time I wished I was dead than go through the agony. Since this happened my life has not been the same. The nights are now long and I'm always locked inside my house and I have bad dreams about being raped. I often cry and cry and get depressed. My doctor has tried to help by giving me anti-depressants but I don't feel any different. Nothing can take away how I feel about what has happened to me. Since that night I feel like I have been branded for the rest of my life and it won't go away. I'll never be the woman I was before, I try but it hurts too much. This took my womanhood away from me. I cry so much I can't say any more. God was with me that night and always will be. I got anxiety attacks and migraines so bad, so sad, I couldn't walk for weeks and to go to the toilet I screamed, it was torture. It is now late, I now hate the night time.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        I return now to the statement of facts.

        Charge Number H22001138 - Sequences 40 and 23 
        
       
       
        
        On the evening of 17-18 May 2004 JE was at a hotel in Surry Hills with her de facto when she met the offender. She entered into an arrangement to accompany the offender to a unit at Randwick for the purpose of obtaining cannabis. At this time JE was approximately seven months pregnant. 
        
       
       
        
        JE went with the offender in a taxi towards Randwick where JE and the offender entered Centennial Park. JE followed the offender into Centennial Park where he directed JE towards a secluded area bounded by trees. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender grabbed JE around the throat and pushed her backwards with the offender producing a knife, pressing the blade of the knife to the side of her neck telling her to be quiet. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown relies on the offender's pressing of the blade of the knife on the victim's throat and the accompanying instruction to be quiet is a circumstance of aggravation in the sequence 23 aggravated sexual assault charge, in that, it constitutes a threat to inflict actual bodily harm by means of an offensive weapon immediately prior to the commission of the sexual assault.

        Detain person with Intent to Obtain Advantage. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender directed JE to sit down and he took a length of cord from his jacket and tied her hands together at the front. The advantage of detain by the offender by the action was controlling JE to enable him 
          
        to commit a sexual assault.

        Circumstance of Aggravation: That immediately before the commission of the offence the offender threatened to inflict actual bodily harm on the victim by means of an offensive weapon. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender pulled his pants down and pushed JE onto her back, pushed up her skirt and cut her underpants open with a knife. The offender attempted to force JE's legs open and put the knife to her throat and JE pleaded for her safety and her unborn child's safety. The offender put the knife to the ground and penetrated JE's vagina with his erect penis causing immediate pain and discomfort. 
        
       
       
        
        JE freed herself and sought immediate assistance and the police were alerted, locating her with her hands still tied together. The matter was reported to the police and a medical examination was conducted. JE submitted to the actions of the offender due to the presence of a knife and the belief that should she not comply, the offender would have harmed either her or her unborn child.

        The victim TP first met the offender on 5 August 2004 at the Alfred Park Lodge located at Cleveland Street Redfern. This is a budget hostel that caters for persons requiring temporary accommodation. At the time TP and the offender were staying in separate rooms and became friends. They went for coffee and lunch on separate occasions. They did not however, have an intimate relationship. 
        
       
       
        
        On Thursday 26 August 2004, TP was asked to leave a women's refuge due to conflict with other residents. At about 5pm that evening, TP walked to the Alfred Park Lodge and saw the offender at the front of the building. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender offered TP that she could stay overnight in his room due to her currently being homeless for the evening. An agreement was made that TP and the offender were to remain clothed in bed and would not touch each other. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender's room contained two single beds pushed together, a table, wardrobe, lounge and a small television. 
        
       
       
        
        That night, TP stayed in room 76 at the Alfred Park Lodge with the offender. The offender and TP watched television until around 10.30pm, they both fell asleep. 
        
       
       
        
        At approximately 6am the following morning, Friday 27 August 2004, an alarm clock sound and the offender and TP began to wake up. 
        
       
       
        
        Shortly after this TP rolled onto her back still fully clothed but this time she felt the offender on top of her. The offender was wearing a t-shirt and no pants. The offender was holding TP's arms above her head. The offender was attempting to force TP's legs apart. 
        
       
       
        
        TP could feel the offender's penis pushing up against her leg. TP told police that the offender was trying to put his penis into her vagina. No penetration was made. TP continued to resist the offender and a wrestle ensued. TP tried to push away the offender's penis. TP took hold of the offender's penis and noticed that he was not wearing a condom. 
        
       
       
        
        TP said ‘you're a better man than this, what are you doing? You don't know what diseases I have, you haven't known me for that long. You're a small man'. In an attempt to prevent being raped TP further said ‘I'll give you a hand job', to which the offender replied 'no'. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender rolled off TP. TP exhausted from wrestling with the offender was laying on the bed in shock. The offender used cream from a bottle of moisturiser and rubbed this on his erect penis. The offender said 'I want a dry root'. The offender began to rub his penis on TP's bottom. TP told the police the offender was attempting to push his penis into her anus. She stated that no penetration was made. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender said 'I've got to go, I want to blow my load before I go to work'. The offender ejaculated on TP's bottom, hip and underwear. The offender handed TP a towel to wipe the semen off her body and TP used it for that purpose. The offender fell asleep and TP lay in the bed exhausted and in shock. Later that morning, the offender and TP left Alfred Park Lodge and had no further contact.

        Following the electronically recorded interview, a forensic procedure (buccal swab) ,was obtained from the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender was charged in relation to the FH, KN, DM and JE matters.

        As a result of the ongoing enquiries into these matters, confirmation was received from the Division of Analytical Laboratories (DAL) on Thursday 10 February 2005. The swabs taken from LC following her report of sexual assault to police in September 1995 were linked to the DNA profile of the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        Following previous instructions from the offender's legal representative, the offender declined to be interviewed in respect of those allegations. Fresh charges were laid on 21 February 2005.

        In early December 2004, investigating police received notification from the Division of Analytical Laboratories in relation to a DNA link between the offender and a sexual assault investigation kit in the name of RP relating to an alleged assault on 26 January 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        Charges were laid in relation to victim RP on 12 April 2005"". 
        
       
       
      The remarks of the sentencing judge 
       
      
    6 The sentencing judge described the applicant as a serial sexual predator: 
     
      
       
        
        “preying upon mostly working women who because of their occupation were vulnerable to such persons. Most offences took place in a secluded location far away from available help for the victims, sometimes the offender used a rope to secure his victims. In some instances, he threatened them with a knife. In a number of instances, his victims sustained significant physical injury. Many offences involved humiliation and degradation of his victims which appears to me to have been a significant part of the offender’s motivation. Two of his victims were in advanced stages of pregnancy.”  
        
       
      
    7 His Honour described the experience of the victims as terrifying ordeals. Apart from the two robberies, his Honour concluded that every one of the offences was well up in the range of objective seriousness for an offence of the particular kind. As there were so many offences, each of which justified a significant sentence, his Honour recognised that if the total sentences were not adjusted for totality the applicant would probably receive a sentence greater than the remainder of his anticipated life. Accordingly, his Honour concluded that there would need to be a large degree of concurrency in the sentences, although some aggregation was required. 
     
      
    8 As I have indicated the applicant pleaded guilty. His Honour recognised the value of this plea. His Honour was conscious of the need to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence in accordance with the principles in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624. His Honour was also mindful of the fact that some of the offences were committed after 1 February 2003 requiring a sentence to be imposed in accordance with s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    9 The transcript of the sentencing hearing included a discussion between counsel and his Honour of matters relevant to a potential finding of special circumstances when sentencing the applicant. In his remarks on sentence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Gilson submitted that because this is the offender’s first gaol sentence that I would not only be entitled to but should find special circumstances within the meaning of s 44 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        . I have given careful thought to the question of special circumstances. Although, I could find special circumstances, I do not propose to do so in the circumstances of this case. One significant reason for that is that I propose to make a large adjustment to the offender’s total sentence by substantial concurrency of sentences. He will have, on the basis of these sentences, I propose to impose a period of two years on parole following his release. Because of the substantial adjustment I have made for reasons of totality, I do not see the need for and in my view, nor is inappropriate for me to further reduce the time the offender must actually spending custody on account of special circumstances. Mr Gilson submitted that the offender is likely to serve the whole of his sentence in some form of protection. I acknowledge that that is a real possibility. I have taken that into account.” 
        
       
      
    10 The context makes it clear that in the above passage “appropriate” rather than “inappropriate” was the word his Honour meant to use. 
     
      
    11 After expressing these conclusions his Honour identified the sentence he considered to be appropriate for each offence and at the same time expressed conclusions in relation to matters of concurrency and accumulation. 
     
      
    12 It is a normal incident of sentencing for a judge to reflect on the minimum term an offender should serve in actual custody and this whether or not one or more than one offence is the subject of consideration. Commonly in that exercise consideration will be given to the overall length of the sentence and to the length of its component parts but once his Honour concluded that there should be no reduction of the time to be spent in custody below that at which he arrived then his Honour faced a choice between 2 courses. He could impose the balance of term that he did or he could have increased the length of the applicant’s sentence by imposing a longer balance of term. By not taking that approach, his Honour provided a benefit to the applicant which his counsel, when offered the alternative, did not want to lose. 
     
      
    13 When fixing the individual sentences his Honour supplemented his previous discussion in relation to special circumstances and stated that he intended to “preserve at least some reasonable … parole period to allow the offender when he is eventually released back into the community some measure of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service.” 
     
      
    14 After imposing individual sentences with respect to each offence and allowing for accumulation and concurrency, his Honour initially imposed an overall sentence of 24 years of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 22 years backdated to 6 October 2004. However, as I have indicated, on 24 April 2006 the court reconvened and his Honour, applying the “slip rule” imposed the overall sentence to which I have referred. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    15 The applicant advanced two grounds of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: the learned sentencing judge erred in his application of s 44  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999 in not finding that special circumstances existed when fixing partly cumulative and partly concurrent sentences. 
       
      
    16 As I have indicated the question of special circumstances was the subject of discussion between counsel and the sentencing judge. In the result his Honour declined to find special circumstances for the reasons which I have already identified. In most cases his Honour provided a non-parole period for the individual sentences at 75% of the total term but, because of the impact of partial accumulation of the sentences, the overall non-parole period was 91.49% of the overall sentence. The applicant submitted that this figure is such a significant departure from the “normal ratio” that reasons ought to have been articulated for it. 
     
      
    17 In my opinion this complaint is entirely without justification. 
     
      
    18 The resolution of appropriate parole and non-parole periods in circumstances similar to the applicant’s have been considered on a number of occasions. In R v Gill (2002) NSWCCA 93 Dunford J said at [12]: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no magic in the 75 percent. Section 44(2) requires that the non-parole period must not be less than ¾ of the term of the sentence unless there are special circumstances. It does not provide that in the absence of special circumstances it must not be any more than ¾ of the term of the sentence.” 
        
       
      
    19 (see also R v Swann (2005) NSWCCA 252; R v So (2004) NSWCCA 362; Musgrove v R (2007) NSWCCA 21). 
     
      
    20 In the present case his Honour concluded, after careful consideration, that the minimum term he provided was appropriate. His Honour then determined the overall term, acknowledging that the statutory ratio would not be preserved. His Honour indicated that this was a deliberate decision made to ensure that the applicant’s time in custody was appropriate but also that the overall term was within the appropriate range of sentence. In my opinion if the statutory ratio had been maintained it would have inevitably led to an increase in the overall term rather than any reduction of the non-parole period. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The learned sentencing judge erred in his application of the principles of totality in  
      Pearce v The Queen  
      in giving insufficient consideration to the overall effect of the partly concurrent and partly cumulative sentences as it related to the ratio between the non-parole and parole portions of the overall sentence. 
       
      
    21 I have already included the passage from his Honour’s remarks on sentence when he addressed the question of totality (see [8]). For the reasons his Honour stated he provided a significant adjustment of the individual sentences to produce an overall sentence which his Honour believed was appropriate. His Honour concluded that it was necessary to provide a large degree of concurrency. To the extent of the concurrency provided this was a benefit to the applicant. 
     
      
    22 The offences committed by the applicant were extremely serious. I have included both the maximum sentences and where appropriate the standard non-parole periods provided by statute. The objective seriousness of the offences demanded a significant period of full time custody. The applicant committed his crimes over a prolonged period targeting his victims separately, inflicting gross indignities on some, and physical injuries on others. Each of his victims must have been seriously traumatised. The objective seriousness of the offences demanded a significant period of time in custody. Two of his victims were in an advanced state of pregnancy and the applicant used a stick to penetrate FH.  
     
      
    23 I am satisfied that the total non-parole period and overall sentence which his Honour imposed were appropriate. Although compared with the non-parole period, the applicant’s period on parole will be modest, as I have already indicated in my view, if a greater parole period was required the only appropriate course would have been to increase the overall term of the applicant’s sentence. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    24 Although I would grant leave to appeal in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    25 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    26 HISLOP J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the opportunity of reading the judgment of Simpson J in draft. I gratefully adopt her Honour’s account of the Crown case. I agree with her Honour’s conclusion in relation to the grounds she has considered and with her Honour’s reasons. I propose to deal with ground 2 in each of the appeals by Derbas and Rustom. The grounds of appeal are otherwise common to each appellant. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two: the trial judge erred in the directions he gave in respect of the evidence of Roy Butler (Rustom appeal) 
       
      
    2 Roy Butler was a drug and alcohol counsellor at Parklea Prison. He gave evidence at the trial. He said that he had spoken to Rustom on 10 January 2002 and, as best he could recall, Rustom used words similar to: 
     
      
       
        
        “it’s their fault not mine. It took some one to die to get me out of here, but I am moving. They’re responsible not me.” 
        
       
      
    3 In his written report compiled within 15 minutes of his conversation with the appellant Mr Butler wrote that the appellant first said: 
     
      
       
        
        “well I am moving, it took someone to die to get me out of here. But I am going” 
        
       
      
    4 And then “a few minutes” later the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I keep being told to take responsibility for my actions, they are responsible, not me. I told them to get me out of here.”  
        
       
      
    5 Mr Butler said that he replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “there are better ways to move, you know” 
        
       
      
    6 and the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I chose this way. It was better than one of them.”  
        
       
      
    7 As the appellant said the latter words Mr Butler said he gestured towards two prison officers. 
     
      
    8 When cross-examined, referring to Rustom’s demeanour at the time, Mr Butler said that “flippant is a word that could be used to describe the way he was being.” It was put to Mr Butler in cross-examination that the appellant had said “it took someone to die to get me out of here” but that he had not “precisely” said “take responsibility” or “I chose.” Mr Butler responded “anything is possible.” The possibility was also raised with Mr Butler that the appellant had said something more along the lines of “that is the way it happened” or “that is the way it is happening” but Mr Butler rejected those suggestions.  
     
      
    9 Mr Butler also confirmed that a psychologist, Miss Isabelle Stepanik, was present during this conversation. Miss Stepanik was called to give evidence but said that she had no recall of the conversation. She said that if she had heard the words she would have considered them to be important and believed that it would be likely that she would have noted them. 
     
      
    10 Defence counsel asked the trial judge to give a warning to the jury in relation to Mr Butler’s evidence. Counsel indicated that he had in mind s 165(1)(f) of the Evidence Act. However, his Honour ruled that because Mr Butler had not been engaged in official questioning of Rustom, he was in fact conducting a survey of inmate facilities, s 165(1)(f) did not require a warning. 
     
      
    11 The warning which counsel sought at the trial had two foundations. Firstly, it was submitted that because Mr Butler had not responded to Rustom at the time and had not told him what he believed he heard Rustom say, Rustom was denied an opportunity to respond to Mr Butler’s version or make his own note of the conversation. Secondly, it was submitted that the trial judge should draw the jury’s attention, in the form of a “standard type of direction”, to the fact that Miss Stepanik did not corroborate Mr Butler’s evidence. 
     
      
       
      The issues at the trial 
       
      
    12 The submissions on the appeal put the need for a warning and its content on quite different basis to those advanced at the trial. Before considering the appeal it is necessary to appreciate the issues in relation to Mr Butler’s evidence which were raised at the trial. 
     
      
    13 When Mr Butler was cross-examined by Rustom’s counsel he was asked to confirm that the note he made of the conversation was made fifteen minutes after the conversation. He confirmed that it was. As I have indicated he also agreed that Rustom’s demeanour during the conversation could be described as “flippant.” 
     
      
    14 Counsel then asked Mr Butler about the precise words Rustom used. The following exchange took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “BEALE: Q. Now the dealings that you had had with him, did they cause you to believe that his vocabulary was not a particularly big one, by the standards of an educated man like yourself? 
         
        A. I had never questioned or worried about the extent of his English vocabulary, I didn’t know what other vocabulary he had. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is it possible that the notes that you made, both shortly afterward and in the officer’s report, were your, just your best recollection of what had been said in the context that it was said but not the precise words? 
         
        A. I suppose anything is possible -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can I take you to the first part of it -- 
         
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Did you finish your answer? 
         
        A. I was going to say anything is possible but I made notes immediately after the conversation because I didn’t intend to be able to recall the information this far down the track. To the best of my knowledge the words that I wrote were the words used. 
        
       
       
        
        BEALE: Q. Well, may I suggest to you that the expression “it took someone to die to get me out of here” were words that he said? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That is the sort of language the he would use? 
         
        A. That is the language he did use. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But as to the words “take responsibility”, is it possible they were not the precise words that were used by him? 
         
        A. Again, it is possible but I did make notes immediately afterwards. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The expression “I chose”, is that possibly not the precise word that he used in response to your question? 
         
        A. Again anything is possible but they are the words to the best of my knowledge at that point in time I believe he used. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is it possible the words were more along the lines of “that is the way it happened”? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Or “that is the way it is happening”? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    15 It is apparent from the cross-examination that defence counsel never asserted that Mr Butler had not had a conversation with Rustom. Although there was debate about the precise words used it was never suggested that Mr Butler had been entirely mistaken about the conversation. As a consequence the evidence of Miss Stepanik was largely irrelevant. She had no recollection of any conversation and accordingly, could neither confirm nor deny Mr Butler’s account. 
     
      
    16 When counsel addressed the jury he took a similar approach to Mr Butler’s evidence. He never suggested that the jury should conclude that a conversation between Mr Butler and Rustom did not occur. Rather he argued that Mr Butler had not accurately remembered the conversation and recorded it in a manner which did not adequately reflect the context. Instead of submitting that Miss Stepanik did not recall the conversation because it did not happen, counsel suggested that the jury may think that “some of the words used and the juxtapositioning are more those of an educated man, like Mr Butler. Miss Stepanik did not recall it because it happened in little bits and pieces and part of the note was made at one time and part was made some time later on. Perhaps he is (sic) just putting down what he thought, what he thought he should have.” Counsel did not suggest that if the jury accepted Mr Butler’s evidence as to the words said by Rustom they did not constitute a relevant admission.  
     
      
    17 When summing up his Honour referred to Mr Butler’s evidence on more than one occasion. At an early stage his Honour, although counsel had not himself raised the matter, invited the jury to consider whether Mr Butler was lying and, if not, consider whether his recollection was accurate. The complete discussion was: 
     
      
       
        
        “One other preliminary matter before I go on. In relation to what the Crown claims is an admission or confession by the accused Rustom to the welfare officer Mr Butler, and you will recall there were submissions made about the manner of cross-examination, let me just say this: It is possible to draw appropriate conclusions from counsel’s conduct of cross-examination, but it is a process of reasoning which is fraught with peril, and it should, therefore, be used only with much caution and circumspection. 
        
       
       
        
        There may be many explanations for the omission to put in cross-examination some matter as to which counsel subsequently relies on. Counsel may have misunderstood his instructions witnesses may not have been fully cooperative in providing statements, there may have been some delay in an allegation being communicated to the accused such as to render his instructions limited by lapse of memory or the passage of time. Forensic pressures may have resulted in looseness or inexactitude in the framing of questions. The matter might simply have been overlooked. Information on which a witness’ credibility can be challenged might have arrived late in the day and therefore it is difficult to use the conduct of counsel as a basis for drawing inferences of fact, in particular because a barrister is not merely some kind of mouthpiece for his client conducting the case in accordance with the client’s directions. In fact, a barrister is ordinarily instructed on the implied understanding that he is to have complete control over the way in which the case is conducted, including the calling and cross-examination of witnesses and deciding what points to take. With regard to all matters that properly relate to the conduct of the case, counsel has unlimited authority to do whatever he considers best in the interests of his client. 
        
       
       
        
        In other words, you should not draw an adverse inference against Rustom from the fact that counsel did not accuse Mr Butler of lying and made the suggestion that he had confused or mistaken the evidence, and it may be that the fact that it was suggested that he had confused or mistaken the evidence, rather than that he had lied, may be based on the fact that the accused Rustom was not shown his notes at the time and not given an opportunity to comment on it at the time. There may be many other reasons why counsel put the questions in cross-examination in the way that he did and you should not speculate on that.” 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour concluded this discussion of Mr Butler’s evidence with a clear instruction as to the approach which the jury should take to the evidence suggested to be “confessional material”. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “What I do say in relation to any confessional material or any form of admission, before you can convict by acting on an oral confession, you must be satisfied, firstly, that the confession was made and, secondly, that it was both truthful and accurate.” 
        
       
      
    19 Later, in the summing up his Honour reminded the jury, in some detail, of the evidence of Miss Stepanik. Amongst other matters his Honour read from the transcript where Miss Stepanik stated that she had no recollection of a conversation between Mr Butler and Rustom. His Honour concluded that discussion with the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “In fact she couldn’t recall any of the conversation. She agreed she made a habit of making detailed notes of important events. She had made detailed notes of a meeting she had on 7 January with Mr Lehn and Mr Butler. She had made a note and it was a detailed note but the conversation that had been put to her allegedly between Mr Butler and the accused Rustom she had no note of that. If she had heard that she would have considered it quite important and she made notes of anything that was important.” 
        
       
      
    20 A short while later when dealing with the Crown case his Honour referred to the evidence of Mr Butler saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Then you have the evidence of Mr Butler who is familiar with Rustom. He made two records of the conversation, not one, but within 15 minutes he had made two records of the conversation and noted the words ‘I chose this way, it is better than one of them.’ The Crown submits that is evidence of an admission by Rustom of his guilt in relation to these matters.” 
        
       
      
    21 Finally when addressing the defence case his Honour reminded the jury of counsel’s submissions saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to what was said by the accused to Mr Butler, he points out that it was six days later, and says that Butler cannot vouch for the sequence in which the things were said, and he though it was a flippant remark. Also, he relies on the evidence of Miss Stepanic and she did not recall it, although Butler said she was there and she would have recorded it if it had have been said because she would have regarded as important. She did not record it. We know Butler did record it twice.” 
        
       
       
      The submissions on and resolution of the appeal 
       
      
    22 Counsel for the appellant in the appeal did not press the basis for the suggested warning argued by counsel at the trial. It is clear that Mr Butler was not engaged in official questioning and accordingly s 165(1)(f) did not require that a warning be given. 
     
      
    23 However, it was submitted that once an application had been made for a warning under s 165(2) the section was engaged and if any subsection of s 165 applied the trial judge was required to give a warning, unless there were good reasons for not doing so (ss (3)). It was submitted there were many reasons why a “warning” that the evidence may be unreliable or, at least, directions beyond those which his Honour gave in relation to Mr Butler’s evidence were required. They included the following: 
     
      
    · his Honour should have provided further directions in relation to the apparent conflict between Mr Butler’s account and that of Miss Stepanik. 
     
      
    · his Honour should have drawn the jury’s attention to the fact that the words relied upon by the prosecution could have been spoken for reasons other than an acceptance by Rustom of his guilt and may merely have been said out of a desire to “big note” himself or be “flippant.” 
     
      
    · his Honour should have warned the jury of the need to exercise caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it: R v Fowler (2003) NSWCCA 321; 151 A Crim R 166; Brown, Barwick, Brown v R (2006) NSWCCA 69 at [40] and [45]. 
     
      
    24 Section 165 of the Evidence Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “165 Unreliable evidence 
        
       
       
        
        (1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:  
         
          
          (a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies, 
          
         
        (b) identification evidence, 
         
          
          (c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like, 
           
          (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding, 
           
          (e) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer, 
           
          (f) oral evidence of official questioning of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant, 
           
          (g) in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person—evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive. 
          
         
         
        (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:  
         
         
          
          (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and 
           
          (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 
           
          (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
          
         
         
        (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. 
         
         
        (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. 
         
         
        (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury. 
         
         
        (6) Subsection (2) does not permit a judge to warn or inform a jury in proceedings before it in which a child gives evidence that the reliability of the child’s evidence may be affected by the age of the child. Any such warning or information may be given only in accordance with section 165B.” 
        
       
      
    25 The obligations of a trial judge when asked to give a warning pursuant to s 165 were comprehensively considered by this Court in Fowler – a joint judgment of Tobias JA, James and Howie JJ. At 204 [186] their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where a party has requested a warning under s 165 about a particular witness or a particular piece of evidence, the trial judge must consider what issues (if any) were raised during the course of the trial about the reliability of the witness or the evidence, in order to determine whether a warning is required by the section and what the content of any such warning should be. If there was no issue raised about the reliability of any aspect of the evidence, then no warning should be given, notwithstanding that it might otherwise have fallen within the ambit of the section.” 
        
       
      
    26 Their Honours also said at 204 [187]: 
     
      
       
        
        “A warning is not required where, even though it falls with [sic] the ambit of s 165(1)(a), the evidence is not “ 
        of a kind that might be unreliable 
        ” (applying  
        Clarke  
        (2001) 123 A Crim R 506), or where there are good reasons for not giving a warning (applying s 165(3)). If the accused denies making the statement relied upon by the Crown, the question of whether a s 165 warning is required will depend upon the nature of the attack made upon the evidence of the making of the disputed statement.” 
        
       
      
    27 The court concluded (at 205 [190]): 
     
      
       
        
        “We are of the opinion that, applying  
        Clark 
        , 
         the evidence was not “ 
        of a kind that might be unreliable 
        ” within the terms of the section, notwithstanding that it was an admission under s 165(1)(a). We note that her Honour appropriately told the jury that the issue was one of Mr Doran’s credibility.” 
        
       
      
    28 It is important to appreciate that although evidence may fall within one of the categories identified in s 165(1) it does not follow that a warning is necessarily required. The evidence must be of a kind that may be unreliable. Although in some cases confessions allegedly made to police officers have, regrettably, been shown to be unreliable (necessitating legislative response to ensure they are recorded) evidence of the type given by Mr Butler is of a different character. Evidence of an alleged confession made to someone with an “interest” in the matter, a police officer with an interest in obtaining a conviction, a friend or relative who may be seeking vengeance – there will be other interests - may justifiably be categorised as potentially unreliable. However, Mr Butler had no identifiable interest which could justify a conclusion that, because he gave evidence of an alleged confession by the appellant, his evidence may be unreliable.  
     
      
    29 In the present case only two questions arose for the jury. Should they accept Mr Butler’s account of the conversation and, if they did, the inference which it supported.  
     
      
    30 His Honour’s directions were given having regard to the manner in which the issues relating to Mr Butler’s evidence had developed during the trial. They had the effect of clearly identifying for the jury the fact that Mr Butler’s evidence was not corroborated by Miss Stepanik. They also raised for the jury’s consideration the precise terms of the statement by Rustom of which Mr Butler gave evidence and counselled the jury that, before they could convict by acting on an oral confession, they must be satisfied “that the confession was made” and that it was “both truthful and accurate.” 
     
      
    31 As I have recorded, his Honour also reminded the jury of the defence case with respect to Mr Butler’s evidence, including the challenge made to the sequence of the conversation and the description of Rustom’s remarks as flippant. 
     
      
    32 It is true that his Honour did not direct the jury in terms that they could not use Rustom’s evidence as a confession to murder, unless they were satisfied that he was admitting to an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to Assad Barakat. This is explained by the fact that his Honour was not asked to give a direction in these terms. It was never suggested that, if Mr Butler’s evidence was accepted, Rustom was doing other than confessing to the murder.  
     
      
    33 In these circumstances I am satisfied that a warning pursuant to s 165(2) was not required and his Honour otherwise appropriately dealt with the evidence of Mr Butler and Miss Stepanik. The jury were made aware of the potential deficiencies in Mr Butler’s evidence and were directed as to the care they should take before accepting and using it as evidence of a confession. No more was required. 
     
      
       
      Ground two – the evidence by way of the video was wrongly admitted (Derbas appeal) 
       
      
    34 Evidence was admitted at the trial from Mr Arryn Smith who was an inmate at the Parklea Correctional Centre when the relevant events occurred. At the time he was giving evidence he was held in custody in New Zealand, pending sentence on a number of charges. Application was made to the trial judge for his evidence to be taken by video link from New Zealand.  
     
      
    35 The application was apparently made in accordance with Pt 4 of the Evidence & Procedure (New Zealand) Act 1994 (Cth). Pursuant to that Act the trial judge determined that he was satisfied that the only manner in which the evidence of Mr Smith could be received was by video link in view of the fact that he was in custody in New Zealand (see s 25(2)(b) of the Act). His Honour was also satisfied that the necessary facilities were available for the evidence to be given from the High Court of New Zealand building in Auckland. This in fact occurred. The power to make the appropriate order for receipt of the evidence was not challenged at trial or on this appeal. 
     
      
    36 However, before the evidence was received the parties were made aware that because of technical difficulties there would be a delay between the receipt of the picture image and receipt of the words spoken by the witness. Because of these problems the trial judge was asked to deny the Crown the opportunity to provide Mr Smith’s evidence by video. 
     
      
    37 His Honour rejected the submission and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “These imperfections in the process are unfortunate but, in my view, of minimal significance. The delay between image and sound can be explained and easily understood by the jury, and they can take any delay into account in assessing the witnesses’ credibility.” 
        
       
      
    38 On the hearing of this appeal this determination by his Honour was challenged. It was submitted that because Mr Smith gave evidence which identified Derbas’ role in the relevant events his evidence was critical and the identified deficiency in the transmission had resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    39 There may be circumstances where imperfections in a video transmission will have the consequence that evidence which is proposed to be received by a video link should be excluded. However, I am satisfied that this was not such a case. His Honour was careful to explain the potential difficulty in the transmission to the jury before Mr Smith was called. A short delay between the receipt of the picture image and the words was readily capable of being accommodated by the advocates and the witness. I do not believe it would have caused a relevant distortion of the evidentiary process nor allowed the witness an advantage in cross-examination. I also do not believe it would have caused any difficulty for the jury in assessing Mr Smith’s credit. 
     
      
    40 Although the objection was taken before Mr Smith was called, no further complaint was made about the process by which his evidence was received and no further submission was made that the process had in fact resulted in any unfairness to the appellant. 
     
      
    41 The fact that no further complaint was made is testament to the fact that his Honour was correct to conclude that the minor problem with the video reception did not cause the trial to miscarry. 
     
      
    42 In my opinion this ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    43 In my opinion both appeals should be dismissed. 
     
      
    44 SIMPSON J: On 28 September 2004, after a lengthy trial, each of the appellants, Iyman Derbas and Mohamed Rustom, was convicted by a jury of one count of murder and one count of assault. Each was sentenced on the murder charge to imprisonment for 24 years, commencing 24 June 2004 (Derbas) or 9 June 2004 (Rustom), with a non-parole period of 17 years, which will expire on 23 June 2021 (Derbas), or 1 June 2021 (Rustom); and, on the assault count, to a wholly concurrent fixed term of imprisonment for two years. Each now appeals against the convictions. Neither seeks leave to appeal against the sentences. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    45 The Crown case may be stated with relative brevity. It alleged that, on 4 August 2002, each appellant was an inmate in Parklea Correctional Centre. On that date cousins Nader and Assad Barakat were transferred to the Parklea Correctional Centre. Within ten minutes of their being released into the prison population they were attacked by a group of 12 to 15 inmates, which included both appellants, who were previously known to the Barakats. The attack lasted only a few minutes. A prison officer, Michael Johnstone, assisted Nader Barakat into a back office. He then went to try to assist Assad Barakat. He was unable to afford significant assistance. Assad Barakat was killed in the incident. He was later found to have sustained a number of blunt force injuries and two deep stab wounds, one to the pulmonary artery and one to the lower abdomen. The wound to the pulmonary artery was found to be the cause of death. 
     
      
    46 Nader Barakat was not injured. He is the victim of the second count, of assault. He gave evidence in the trial. 
     
      
    47 No murder weapon was ever found. A medical practitioner who performed a post-mortem examination of Assad Barakat was of the opinion that his wounds were caused by a knife or bladed instrument. 
     
      
    48 There was evidence in the Crown case that directly implicated Derbas in the injury. Nader Barakat said that he saw Derbas pull out from under his shirt a long straight dark-coloured object, about 10 to 15 cm in length, approach Assad Barakat, try to kick him and then stab him in the upper chest and arm. Both he and a Corrective Services officer also identified Rustom as having struck Assad Barakat with a pool cue. 
     
      
    49 Notwithstanding the evidence that was clearly capable of permitting an inference that Derbas was the person who had wielded the weapon that inflicted the fatal blow, in respect of the charge of murder, the case against each appellant was presented in three alternative ways. They were: 
     
      
       
      (i) that he was a principal in the first degree and caused the death of Assad Barakat by stabbing him in the chest with the intention of killing him or inflicting upon him grievous bodily harm (obviously, this could succeed against one or other, but not both, of the appellants); 
       
      (ii) that some other person (whether one of the appellants or another person) actually stabbed Assad Barakat and that the appellant was a principal in the second degree, present, aiding and abetting the person who did the stabbing; 
       
      (iii) that the appellant was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise at least to inflict grievous bodily harm upon Assad Barakat, and Assad Barakat’s death was a consequence of that joint criminal enterprise. 
       
       
      The trial 
       
      
    50 On 9 August 2004 an indictment was presented naming each appellant, charging the two offences I have already mentioned, that is, murder (of Assad Barakat) and assault (of Nader Barakat). Also arraigned on the same indictment were Ahmed Cheikho (on a charge that he was an accessory after the fact of murder) and Shan Zreika (on the same two charges as the appellants). The trial proceeded over several weeks. In this short outline I propose only to mention that part of the evidence, and certain events that occurred after verdict, that are relevant to the specific grounds of appeal. There are four aspects of the trial, two of them evidentiary and two procedural, raised by the grounds of appeal. Two of these – evidence given by Mr Roy Butler, and evidence given by video link from New Zealand – are dealt with in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL, which I have read in draft, and with which I agree. 
     
      
    51 The remaining matters concern directions given on accessorial liability, and events which occurred in the court following the delivery of the verdict, but which gave rise to a suggestion that there may have been some form of interference with a juror during the course of the trial. I will deal with each of these. 
     
      
       
      1. directions on accessorial liability 
       
      
    52 The trial judge gave the jury both oral and written directions with respect to the Crown case on accessorial liability. These pertained only to the charge of murder. It will be remembered that the Crown presented its case against each appellant in this respect in three alternative ways. At an early stage in the summing up the transcript records his Honour as saying this: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the context of this case, an accused can being (sic) guilty of murder in any one of three ways. Firstly, as the principal; secondly, as an aider and abettor; and thirdly, as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise. 
        
       
       
        
        The first alternative is as the principal, and the principal is the person who actually did the stabbing which caused the fatal wound. That is a very simple proposition and requires no further explanation. 
        
       
       
        
        A person may also be guilty of a crime if he is an aider and abettor. An aider and abettor is a person who is present at the time a crime is committed by another person and who intentionally aids or gives encouragement to that other person in the commission of the crime. The law regards such an aider and abettor as just as guilty of the crime as the person who actually committed it. The mere presence of an accused at the scene of a crime is not sufficient to make him an aider and abettor. It must be shown that there was also intentional aid or encouragement of that other person in the commission of the crime. Such encouragement is established if the Crown satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was both present and ready to give aid to the person actually committing the crime, if required. Such readiness to give aid, if required, amounts to an encouragement to that other person to commit the crime and makes the accused an aider and abettor. 
        
       
       
        
        First of all, you must be satisfied that the crime of murder was committed before you can be satisfied that an accused was an aider and abettor to its commission. If the Crown has satisfied you that the crime of murder was committed, you must then consider whether at the time when the crime was being committed the accused was both present and intentionally giving either aid or encouragement to its commission. Before you could find that an accused intentionally gave either aid or encouragement in the commission of the crime, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such accused knew all the essential factual circumstances that have to be proved by the Crown to show that the crime was committed by the principal offender,  
        including that the particular accused knew that the principal was intending to kill or do really serious physical injury to the deceased 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        The third way in which an accused may be guilty of the murder is if that accused was part of a joint criminal enterprise. The law is that if two or more persons set out upon some joint criminal enterprise then each of them is legally liable for everything done in the furtherance of that joint criminal enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by each of the accused. A joint criminal enterprise exists when two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between then that they will commit a crime…” (SU 45 – 46, italics added) 
        
       
      
    53 A little later, his Honour continued this theme. He is recorded as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “So what does all that mean in the present case? It means that the accused Derbas, Zreika and/or Rustom are guilty of murder if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by evidence or admission that the particular accused stabbed the deceased, that is, as a principal; or secondly,  
        if you are satisfied that the particular accused was an aider and abettor, that is a person present at the time encouraging the person doing the stabbing and ready to assist if required with the intention that the deceased should be killed or receive grievous bodily harm 
        , that is really serious physical injury; or thirdly, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the particular accused was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased and kill him or cause him really serious physical injury; and in relation to that, the joint criminal enterprise is an agreement to take part in criminal activity. … Secondly, that the object of the joint enterprise was to kill or cause really serious physical injury may be established by the nature, ferocity, extent or other surrounding circumstances of, or the numbers involved in, the attack, or by you being satisfied that the particular accused contemplated that a knife or other weapon capable of inflicting grievous bodily harm would be used, or foresaw the possibility that such a knife or weapon might be used. 
        
       
       
        
        Thirdly, the Crown must establish that the particular accused contemplated death or grievous bodily harm as part of a joint criminal enterprise or saw the possibility that it may result…” (SU 53-54, italics added) 
        
       
      
    54 Shortly after, his Honour handed to the jury written directions which he described as “a checklist of the various elements of the various offences”. That part of the document concerned with the count of murder was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown must establish: 
         
        1. that the stabbing was a deliberate and voluntary act 
         
        2. that it was done with intent to kill or cause really serious physical injury 
         
        3. that each particular accused either: 
         
          
          (a) was the principal offender, i.e. did the stabbing, or 
           
          (b) was aiding and abetting, i.e. present encouraging the principal offender and ready to render assistance if required, or 
           
          (c) was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to kill or cause really serious physical injury to Assad Barakat.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    55 The following day, again referring to the document as “checklists of the essential ingredients of various of the charges”, he directed the jury to add to paragraph 3(c) the words: 
     
      
       
        
        “… and had that subjective intent.” 
        
       
      
    56 Thus, in its final form, the direction with respect to joint criminal enterprise was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “3. that each particular accused … : 
         
         … 
          
          (c) was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to kill or cause really serious physical injury to Assad Barakat and had that subjective intent.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      2. interference with a juror 
       
      
    57 On 28 September 2004 the jury foreman advised the trial judge that the jury was unable to agree upon verdicts in relation to the two charges against Shan Zreika. The trial judge discharged the jury in respect of that accused. The jury then delivered a verdict of not guilty with respect to the single count against Ahmed Cheikho, and a guilty verdict in respect of each of the two charges against the two appellants. 
     
      
    58 It seems that, on delivery of the verdicts, a disturbance occurred in the public gallery of the court. Exactly what happened does not appear to have been fully recorded. A transcript of proceedings on 28 September records that the judge remanded Zreika for further trial and discharged Cheikho. There was then some discussion about the further proceedings in relation to the two appellants. The transcript records that, as the court was about to adjourn, a person identified in the transcript as Omar Rustom said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am asking questions about the murder.” 
        
       
      
    59 The judge then formally convicted each appellant and remanded them in custody. The transcript then records (the appellant) Rustom as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thanks [female first name]. Thank you very much [the same female first name].” 
        
       
      
    60 It then records Omar Rustom as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “[Same female first name], did you or did you not ask me about my brother being guilty of the murder? Yes, you did [the same female first name]. Look at me in the light and tell me yes or no. Please, [the same female first name], this is my brother’s life. Did you? At least give me the benefit of the doubt and tell me, [the same female first name]. Look at me, look at me, thank you. Thank you.” 
        
       
       
      and a person identified in the transcript as “Mrs Derbas” saying: 
       
       
        
        “[The same female first name], please, [the same female first name].” 
        
       
      
    61 There followed some discussion concerning these events. Mrs Derbas is recorded as protesting at the verdicts, and proclaiming Derbas’ innocence. Omar Rustom appeared (represented by a lawyer who happened to be in the court complex), and apologised for the outburst. Omar Rustom was charged with contempt but was not required immediately to enter a plea. His Honour expressed concern that both Omar Rustom and Mrs Derbas apparently called out the first name of a juror. 
     
      
    62 As a consequence of these events the trial judge sought the assistance of the Sheriff in investigating whether anything untoward had occurred with respect to any member of the jury. 
     
      
    63 On 30 November 2004 an officer of the Sheriff interviewed a female member of the jury, who was identified by her jury panel number. This juror told the officer that, at about the sixth week of the trial, she recognised, as somebody with whom she had been acquainted, a woman who on two or three occasions was present in the public area of the court. The juror gave the woman’s name as Donna Saad. The juror thought Ms Saad’s boyfriend might have been a friend of one of the accused. The juror knew Ms Saad because they had, as teenagers, worked together in a takeaway restaurant. 
     
      
    64 The juror told the Sheriff’s officer that, during the course of the trial, Ms Saad had telephoned her, and then called at her home. She said that the two initially engaged in small talk, and that then Ms Saad said to her: 
     
      
       
        
        “They’re not guilty, they didn’t do it, the guilty ones are walking the street” 
        
       
       
      and that the juror said to Ms Saad: 
       
       
        
        “Stop there, I don’t want to hear it, I am going to make my own decision” 
        
       
       
      and: 
       
       
        
        “I am taking this seriously, if they were my family members, then I would want justice done as I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I didn’t do the right thing.” 
        
       
      
    65 The juror said that Ms Saad made further efforts to contact the juror by mobile phone. This was unsuccessful because the juror refused to take the calls. Ms Saad then sent about ten or fifteen text messages, some of them, apparently innocuous, enquiring after the juror’s family; others, however, were inquiries such as: 
     
      
       
        
        “Which way are you going?” 
        
       
       
      and: 
       
       
        
        “I need to know which way it is going.” 
        
       
      
    66 Ms Saad asked to have personal contact with the juror, but the juror declined. The juror did not convey any of these events to any other member of the jury until after the disturbance in the court that followed the verdicts. She then told at least one other member of the jury of the approaches, but said (as she told the Sheriff’s investigators) that she had refused to discuss the trial with Ms Saad. 
     
      
    67 At some stage the juror was told by her cosmetician that “someone” had made an approach, looking for a person by her first name. The juror had not asked for a description of that person because: 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t want to know anything about it.” 
        
       
      
    68 When asked why she had not drawn the approaches to the attention of the authorities, the juror replied that the trial had at that time continued for six weeks, it was almost finished, and she did not feel threatened. 
     
      
    69 She said, however, that when the courtroom was disrupted after the verdict, she was in shock, but that she did not recognise the (male) person who was shouting her name. She then added: 
     
      
       
        
        “I thought I was doing the right thing, it didn’t affect me, and I knew they weren’t going to influence me. If there was any threat or bribe, I was going to the Sheriffs, but at that stage there weren’t any.” 
        
       
      
    70 The Sheriff’s officer also interviewed the jury foreperson. He/she said that, during the course of the trial, no other juror had mentioned being approached by friends or family of any accused. After verdicts had been delivered, after jury had been discharged, and after the disturbance in the court, another juror had said that she did not know any of the accused, but recounted that a person had telephoned her; as soon as the caller mentioned the trial, the juror had refused to discuss it. This juror did not give the foreperson any names. When asked which juror had made this report, the foreperson mentioned a female first name, which is the same name as that which had been used by those involved in the post-verdict events. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    71 The grounds of appeal concern these four aspects of the trial. Each appellant pleaded and argued the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. His Honour failed to direct the jury sufficiently with regard to accessorial liability, occasioning a miscarriage of justice; 
        
       
       
        
        2. There has been a miscarriage of justice in that a juror was criminally influenced.” 
        
       
      
    72 Derbas pleaded and argued an additional ground: 
     
      
       
        
        “3. That the evidence by way of video was wrongly admitted.” 
        
       
      
    73 Rustom pleaded and argued the following additional grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        “4. That the trial judge erred in the directions he gave in respect of the evidence of Roy Butler” 
        
       
       
        
        “5. A miscarriage of justice arose from apprehended bias on the part of a juror.” 
        
       
       
        
        “6. A miscarriage of justice arose from the failure of a juror to inform the trial judge that she had been approached during the trial by a person who attempted to discuss with her the issues in the trial.” 
        
       
      
    74 I propose, firstly, to consider ground 1, concerning the directions given with respect to accessorial liability, and then with those grounds concerning the attempted interference with the juror. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: accessorial liability 
       
      
    75 This ground is directed only to the murder convictions. Specifically, it concerns the directions given about liability as principal in the second degree, and also the directions given about liability as principal in the first degree. These directions were given on three separate occasions, twice orally, and once in writing. All have been set out above. In part, the ground focuses upon a discrepancy between the directions given orally, and those given in writing. It was submitted that the written directions omitted a critical aspect of the law with respect to aiding and abetting (that being the knowledge in the person accused as accessory of the intention of the principal offender). Further, it was submitted that, even if the oral directions, in some places at least, correctly incorporated this aspect, other errors permeated those directions. 
     
      
    76 The principles of criminal complicity were comprehensively explained by McHugh J in Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; 197 CLR 316. His Honour distinguished/ identified two bases upon which a person who is present at the scene of a crime , but is not the actual perpetrator, may be fixed with criminal liability. Depending upon the circumstances, such a person may be categorised as a principal in the first degree or a principal in the second degree. 
     
      
    77 A principal in the first degree is a person who is present at the scene of the crime, by reason of “preconcert” or agreement with the actual perpetrator to commit the crime that is committed. It then does not matter which of the two or more participants does the act that constitutes the crime: all are liable because the act is done, with the knowledge of the other or others, pursuant to the common intention. This is now commonly referred to as joint criminal enterprise. It is a form of criminal complicity that is the subject of the written direction in para 3(c). 
     
      
    78 An alternative means of fixing a person who is not the actual perpetrator with criminal liability for the crime is as principal in the second degree. McHugh J described this liability as derivative, dependent upon the established guilt of the actual perpetrator. This is liability of the kind sometimes called accessorial, or constituted by aiding and abetting the principal offender. It is liability of the kind referred to in the written directions in para 3(b). 
     
      
    79 Accessorial liability was also explained by Hunt J (as he then was) in R v Stokes & Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25. At p 37 his Honour set out the essentials of proof that a person is guilty as an accessory by aiding and abetting – in the language used by McHugh J, a principal in the second degree. The Crown must establish: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) the commission of that crime by the principal offender,  
        and 
          
         
        (2) that the accused was present at the time when the crime was committed,  
        and 
          
         
        (3) that … the accused knew all the essential facts or circumstances which must be established by the Crown in order to show that the crime was committed by the principal offender …,  
        and  
         
        (4) that, with that knowledge, he intentionally assisted or encouraged the principal offender to commit that crime.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour then added: 
       
       
        
        “The accessory's intention to assist or encourage the principal offender must be based upon that knowledge. … Although some of the older authorities suggest that the accused need be aware of only the physical acts done by the principal offender, it is now clear that he must be aware also of the existence of any state of mind on the part of the principal offender which must be established by the Crown to show that the crime was committed by him.” 
        
       
      
    80 The focus for the purpose of the present argument is the need for the Crown to prove that the alleged aider and abettor knew, not only of the essential facts and circumstances that establish the physical commission of the crime by the principal offender, but also of that offender’s state of mind or intention – that is, that that offender intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. This is an essential element in proving the guilt of that offender. That element was absent from the written direction. It was not absent from the oral direction first extracted above, where (in that part of the passage that I have italicised) his Honour carefully told the jury that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants knew all of the essential factual circumstances that had to be proved by the Crown to show that the crime was committed by the principal offender, including that the appellants knew that the principal offender intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on Assad Barakat. It must here be re-emphasised that the relevant intention is that of the principal offender, not the person accused of aiding and abetting. Because liability in this sense is derivative, depending upon the established guilt of the actual perpetrator, proof of that person’s intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm is essential; as is proof that the person charged as accessory knew of that person’s intention. That is not to say that the intention of the person charged as accessory is irrelevant: it is, of course, necessary for the Crown to prove that. But that intention is to do the act or acts that encourage, aid and/or abet the principal offender – with knowledge that the principal offender intends to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    81 Whether the correct oral direction given is sufficient to overcome the deficiency in the written direction is one of the issues raised by this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    82 But the question is not as simple as that. It was also argued on behalf of the appellants that the oral direction secondly extracted above had further deficiencies, and was apt to create confusion. That is for this reason. The relevant part of this oral direction was that the appellants were guilty of murder: 
     
      
       
        
        “… if you are satisfied that the particular accused was an aider and abettor, that is, a person present at the time encouraging the person doing the stabbing and ready to assist if required  
        with the intention that the deceased should be killed or receive grievous bodily harm 
          
        …”  
        
       
      
    83 The flaw in this direction, counsel argued, lies in that part of the direction that I have emboldened, and is that when read grammatically and logically, the intention in question is the intention, not of the principal offender, but of the person accused as accessory – that is, the direction focused upon an intention in the person alleged to be an aider and abettor (or accessory, or principal in the second degree), that the victim be killed or caused grievous bodily harm, but not upon the intention of the person alleged to be the actual perpetrator and the knowledge in the alleged aider and abettor of that intention. As I have indicated above, the intentions it is necessary for the Crown to prove are not co-extensive: in the case of the principal offender, the intention is to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, in the case of a person accused as accessory, the intention necessary to be proved is to encourage, aid and/or assist the principal offender to achieve that object. A separate element, also relevant to state of mind but not directly going to intention, is knowledge of the principal offender’s intention. 
     
      
    84 Thus, the argument went, on only one of three occasions when the jury was directed on this topic was the direction without defect. (It was accepted that the oral direction that included the reference to knowledge in the accused of the intention of the actual perpetrator was correct.) 
     
      
    85 It was not suggested that either the written, or the second oral, direction was erroneous or misleading in any respect except by omission of express reference to the need for the Crown to prove the appellant’s knowledge of what was the intention of the actual perpetrator. And that was explicitly covered in the first, correct, oral direction. One question posed on behalf of the appellants is whether the correct oral direction was sufficient to fill the gap in the written direction and the gap in the later oral direction. That presupposes that relevant error has been established. That presupposition itself does not stand up to scrutiny. 
     
      
    86 It is to be assumed that juries absorb and adhere to the directions they are given, both oral and written. The jury was clearly told (orally) that they could not find the appellants guilty of murder unless satisfied that they were aware of the intention of the actual perpetrators. It was not necessary for that to be repeated. If it were necessary to decide whether the correct oral direction was sufficient to overcome deficiencies in the second oral, and the written directions, I would, in the circumstances of this case, consider that it was. But, for reasons given below, I do not think it is necessary to reach that point. 
     
      
    87 The directions must be read in the light of the circumstances of the case. The essence of the written direction on liability as principal in the second degree was that the Crown had to establish that either accused was present, encouraging the principal offender and ready to render assistance if required. That requires some attention to what, on the Crown evidence, the principal offender was doing that that accused was encouraging, and prepared to render assistance in – it was using an implement to stab Assad Barakat. It could hardly be contemplated that presence, encouraging that activity, and preparedness to render assistance if required, did not entail knowledge that the principal offender had the requisite intention, that is, to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. Put another way, proof that either accused was present, encouraging and prepared to render assistance to the principal offender in stabbing Assad Baraket necessarily (in the circumstances of this case) implied proof that that accused knew that the principal offender intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    88 Juries must be credited, as they traditionally are, with common sense. No jury could possibly have concluded that either appellant was encouraging the stabbing of Assad Barakat, and ready to render assistance if required, without also concluding that the appellant knew that the person wielding the implement intended to kill Assad Barakat or cause him grievous bodily harm. Any technical deficiency in the directions is of no moment, and certainly could not conceivably have given rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    89 It is now convenient to deal with an additional criticism of the summing up. That concerns the (second) oral direction, concerned with joint criminal enterprise. I repeat the relevant part of that direction. It was: 
     
      
       
        
        “…or thirdly, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the particular accused was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased and kill him or cause him really serious physical injury; and in relation to that, the joint criminal enterprise is an agreement to take part in criminal activity. In the absence of expressed agreement it may be inferred from the circumstances and the actions of participants. Secondly, that the object of the joint enterprise was to kill or cause really serious physical injury may be established by the nature, ferocity, extent or other surrounding circumstances of, or the numbers involved in, the attack, or by you being satisfied that the particular accused contemplated that a knife or other weapon capable of inflicting grievous bodily harm would be used, or foresaw the possibility that such a knife or weapon might be used.” 
        
       
       
      Two criticisms were made of this direction. The first was that it “conflated” the concepts of joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise. The second was that it “elided” the elements of criminal complicity with the means of proving those elements. 
       
      
    90 I do not accept the first of these criticisms. The concept of extended joint criminal enterprise refers to what used to be called (in NSW) common purpose: it extends the liability of a person involved in a joint criminal enterprise to liability for any crime committed by parties to the agreed joint criminal enterprise in the course of carrying out that enterprise, that go beyond the express agreement, but that was contemplated as an incident of the express agreement. There is, in reality, no reference in this direction to liability in either appellant for acts of another person going beyond the express agreement to include criminal acts not the subject of that express agreement, but contemplated as a possible incident of the execution of what was agreed. 
     
      
    91 Alternatively, on the facts alleged by the Crown, the references to the concept of extended joint criminal enterprise were superfluous. The case the Crown sought to make did not depend upon, or incorporate, the notion of the commission of an offence by one participant that was outside the parameters of the agreement, but nevertheless contemplated as a possible incident in the execution of the agreement. Similar references were made later. 
     
      
    92 It might have been neater, and more focussed on the factual issue the jury had to decide, to have eliminated references to extended joint criminal enterprise. However, to my mind, what was alleged by the Crown was clear, and the jury’s attention was adequately directed to the issues it had to decide. 
     
      
    93 The second complaint, that the directions incorporated reference both to elements of criminal complicity and means of proving those elements, also has no substance: the direction commencing with the words “in the absence of expressed agreement …” and the direction that the object of the joint enterprise might be proved by the nature, ferocity and extent of the attack are directions about inferences the jury might draw from facts otherwise established by the evidence and therefore are concerned with the means by which elements might be proved. That does not affect the validity or accuracy of the directions. Those directions were perfectly correct: it was not necessary for them to appear in that particular part of the summing up, but it was no error on the part of the trial judge that he chose to place them there. 
     
      
    94 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 2, 5 and 6 
       
      
    95 In my opinion these grounds ought to be rejected. The comprehensive statement of events above establishes that the juror in question behaved with absolute propriety and considerable strength. Her initial response to the approach from the woman who contacted her was to tell her she did not want to hear what was being put to her and that she intended to make her own decision; that she was taking the trial seriously, that if she were in the position of the members of the Barakat family she would want justice done and that she would not be able to sleep at night if she did not do the right thing. She declined further contact, despite the persistence of the caller. She made it clear that, until the eruption in the courtroom, she was unaffected by the repeated contacts. Her participation in the verdicts was uninfluenced by what had happened. She did not disclose the approaches to any other member of the jury until after the verdicts had been delivered. That assertion is corroborated by the information provided by the foreperson to the Sheriff’s officer. 
     
      
    96 In my opinion this Court should accept that the juror responded as she said she did. There can, in my opinion, be no question that the juror discharged her duty in accordance with her obligations. 
     
      
    97 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    98 I propose that each appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    99 HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J, and with their Honours’ reasons. 
     
      
    100 As to the ground concerning the directions on accessorial liability, the case is a timely reminder that the concepts involved are not easy for lawyers, let alone jurors. It is essential that only so much of the law on this topic as is necessary for the case at hand be conveyed to the jury, and then in plain language. As Simpson J has pointed out, the Crown did not rely upon extended joint criminal enterprise in the present case and no direction about it was called for. 
     
      
    101 Moreover, I would also question the necessity for the Crown to have relied on both joint criminal enterprise and aiding and abetting. As is apparent from Simpson J’s reasons, there is a difference between those two bases of criminal liability and both were available on the facts of this case. However, in my view, either would have been sufficient. The interests of justice did not require that both be pursued, and to do so must only have made the jury’s task more difficult.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL and HOWIE J: We have received the considerable advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Adams J. We gratefully adopt his account of the evidence in the trial. 
     
      
    2 The parties conducted the trial on the basis that the jury verdicts would be the same for each count. The trial judge indicated to the jury, in the usual way, that the counts were separate charges and that there was no legal requirement that the jury bring in the same verdict for each count on the indictment. The trial judge, however, did tell the jury that they could take into account their findings in respect of one charge when determining another. Her Honour also told them that there was no logical reason why they would not find the same verdict on the first three counts on the indictment because the Crown’s evidence was the same for those counts. 
     
      
    3 The Judge said this: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Because the separate allegations contained in the charges are related, some of the factual findings that you must make based on the evidence will be relevant to a consideration of all of the charges or of some of the individual charges. A finding of fact made in respect of one charge may influence your determination of another charge. Putting count four to one side because it really stands on its own, and I will come to that when I set out the elements to you, but if you found that the accused did not possess the methylamphetamine in the bedroom then that finding can be used by you in considering whether he was knowingly concerned in the manufacture of the methylamphetamine as alleged by the Crown. The converse also applies. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused possessed the methylamphetamine in the bedroom then that finding can be used by you in determining whether he knowingly took part in the manufacture of the methylamphetamine, as the Crown alleges, in the shed or the garage. 
         
         
        Looking at it the other way round, if you found that the accused knowingly took part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine then that finding could be used by you in your consideration of count three. That is looking at what the Crown alleged is that he possessed the precursor, the hypophosphorous acid. If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the accused did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug then similarly that finding could be used by you in your consideration of count three, his asserted possession of the hypophosphorous acid and his intention to use it in manufacture of a prohibited drug 
         
         
        As a matter of practical reality, members of the jury, and this will probably be clearer to you when I take you to the elements or the ingredients of these charges which I'm about to do, you might think that your verdicts on counts 1, 2 and 3, as a matter of common sense and logic, would be the same. Really that is because the Crown relies on essentially the same evidence in respect of all those counts. If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of count one, that is the charge that the accused knowingly took part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine, it is difficult to see how you could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of count three. Now that is an expression of opinion by me, you are perfectly entitled to disregard that if you so want, but if you were to find different verdicts in respect of counts one and three for example there would have to be some logical reason for finding different verdicts in respect of those two counts, and as I say when I take you to the evidence and what the Crown has to prove it is essentially the same evidence that the Crown relies on [in] respect of those first three counts. 
        
       
      
    4 At the conclusion of the summing up there was no objection by defence counsel to these directions nor was any further direction or clarification sought. The jury initially raised two questions after their retirement: one about the absence of Ms Pickett, the person found at the house when police went there to search it, and the other about the directions given on possession. There is no issue arising from these questions or the answers given by the Judge. 
     
      
    5 Later in their deliberations the jury asked two further questions. The first is of no significance. The second was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In your Honour's summary there was some possibility to see the first three counts as related and that guilty on one count could lead you to be guilty on other counts. Could you please re-cover the points you made in relation to this?” 
        
       
      
    6 The answer to this question gave rise to some discussion between counsel and the Judge. Defence counsel submitted: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In my submission your Honour should direct them against the notion that guilt in relation to one somehow might assist them in finding guilt in relation to something else. It may well be in a credit case where there is a complainant with a number of counts relating to what the complainant says, that disbelief in relation to one may affect her credibility in relation to others. In this particular's case, a verdict of guilt in one does not and should not be seen as some basis upon which to find or ground guilt in relation to others. In my submission you should disabuse the jury of that notion. It may even be that your Honour might give them a direction that even if they found him guilty in relation to one, it would be impermissible to undertake by a process of tendency reasoning that they - or a process of reasoning that he is guilty of one therefore he is guilty of the others, that would be impermissible, and your Honour should direct them that that would not be an appropriate chain of reasoning, or appropriate course of reasoning.” 
        
       
      
    7 In answering the jury's question, the Judge said (our underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I am sure you are well aware that the first three counts are related because of the circumstances on which the Crown relies. They all deal with a prohibited drug methylamphetamine. It would be impermissible just because you came to a verdict of guilty on one count to reason from that that the accused must be guilty of the other counts involving methylamphetamine. I am completely putting count 4 to one side at the moment because it, as I said, stands on its own in terms of the evidence, and this does not relate in the same way as the first three counts do. 
         
         
        The charges are being heard together because they are related in time and surrounding circumstances. You need to consider each charge separately and independently, and I did say to you before that there is no legal requirement that the verdicts which you are required to give must be the same, although, as you would be well aware, both the Crown and [defence counsel] addressed you on the basis that you would find the same verdict in respect of each of the counts or charges. 
         
         
        Although it is impermissible to reason ""Well we have found the accused guilty of"" - for example - ""a count therefore he must be guilty of all three."" Or putting it the alternative way, ""We have found him not guilty of one count, we won't go any further, we'll find him not guilty of all three."" And I'm dealing with the first three counts. A finding of fact made by you in respect of the one count for example can be used when considering the evidence in another count. 
         
         
        And that's where I think the confusion might have come in, because I think I said to you that is a matter of commonsense and logic, if you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of count one, it will be difficult to see that you could be satisfied by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt of count three, which is the possession of the precursor, because in essence the Crown relies on exactly the same evidence, the same circumstances in respect of all of those three counts. 
         
         
        A finding of fact, if for example you came to the view you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the accused was guilty of count one, well that finding could be used by you when you are considering whether he was in possession of the precursor which is the subject of count three. And I think I gave other examples before, which I will not repeat at this stage.  
        So it is the findings that you make rather than the verdict that you come to. 
         The other way I think I said before lunch was that if you found that the accused was not in possession of the methylamphetamine in the bedroom, when he would not use that in any way when you were considering whether he was knowingly concerned in the - knowingly took part in the manufacture in count one. 
         
         
        I do not know what order you are dealing with them in, so it is difficult for me to anticipate which way you are dealing with them. But that is in a sort of global sense, that if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was in possession of the methylamphetamine in the bedroom well that could be used by you in consideration of count 1 and vice versa. If you are going through the counts chronologically, that is, in the sequence that the Crown has set them out on the indictment, then if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did knowingly take part in the manufacture, that is a finding that you could use in considering if he were in possession of the methylamphetamine in the bedroom. 
         
         
        The list of circumstances, as I said, I will not repeat, and the alternate list of circumstances pointing the other direction, unless you want me to do so, I do have them in a list here to remind you of those but I'm sure that they are reasonably clear in your minds.” 
        
       
      
    8 Ground two related to these comments by the trial Judge asserting that they were erroneous. It was contended, firstly, that the Judge failed to take into account the ""temporal difference"" between the second and third counts, on the one hand, and the first count, on the other. This was because counts two and three related to the date of the search of the appellant's premises, namely 4 September 2003, whereas count one covered a wide period of time being between 1 January and 4 September 2003. The extended time period in relation to count one arose because the clandestine laboratory situated in the shed could have operated at any time during this eight-month period. 
     
      
    9 In our view the difference in the time alleged in the counts did not mean that the jury could not use findings made on count one in relation to another count or vice versa. A finding that there was in the bedroom of the appellant a large amount of methylamphetamine was not irrelevant to a determination of whether he had permitted his property to be used for the manufacture of that same type of drug in the relatively recent past. As a matter of common sense, it must follow that the fact that a person has a close connection with a large amount of methylamphetamine in premises which he owned and occupied “rationally affected’ the probability that he was involved in the manufacture of such a drug on the same premises: see s 55 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    10 The second basis upon which it is said that these comments were erroneous was because the Crown was not relying upon the fact that the drug found in the bedroom could be linked to the laboratory. It was submitted, therefore, that the only basis upon which the finding in relation to the possession by the appellant of the methylamphetamine in the bedroom could be related to the other two counts relating to the manufacture of methylamphetamine was by way of propensity reasoning, that is that it showed that the applicant had some tendency in relation to methylamphetamine. Further, it was argued that the count alleging that the applicant was in possession of the precursor stated that it was for use by the appellant “or another person”. Therefore, so the argument runs, the Crown accepted that the manufacture of methylamphetamine might have been by some other person. 
     
      
    11 We do not accept that, simply because the methylamphetamine in the bedroom was not linked to the shed, it follows that it was irrelevant to the issue of whether the appellant had some involvement in the manufacturing of methylamphetamine in the shed. It is not a case of propensity reasoning. It is merely the recognition that it was improbable that a person who had a large amount of methylamphetamine in his possession, on a property that he owned, was unconnected with the manufacture of that drug on the same property. Similarly the fact that a precursor to the manufacture was found in the shed was relevant to both the issue of whether the appellant was involved in the manufacture and whether he had methylamphetamine in his possession. The Crown alleged that the precursor was for use of the appellant or some other person because it could not show what role the appellant had in the manufacture. However, the relevant facts were that methylamphetamine had been, and could in the future be manufactured in the shed which the appellant owned and could access. 
     
      
    12 Thirdly it was contended that the comments made by the Judge that ""verdicts on counts 1, 2 and 3, as a matter of commonsense and logic would be the same"" did not take into account the different elements of the offences as well as ""the different evidentiary basis"". This asserted error is based upon the fact that, in relation to the count alleging that the appellant was in possession of the drug found in the bedroom, the Crown had to exclude the reasonable possibility that Ms Pickett was in possession of that drug, whereas, in respect of the count alleging that the appellant was in possession of the precursor, no such possibility was raised. 
     
      
    13 The ground of appeal was summarised in written submissions on behalf of the appellant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Accordingly, her Honour's invitation was beset by the danger that the jury would conflate their consideration on the three counts and engage in circular reasoning, rather than consider each charge separately.” 
        
       
      
    14 We do not consider that this ground of appeal has been made out. Her Honour was referring to the relevance of findings of fact made in determining one count to a finding of fact on another count rather than to any verdict given on one count determining the verdict on another count. That is clear from the underlined passages of the answer given to the jury’s question. There was no suggestion of propensity reasoning either expressly or impliedly arising from these comments. 
     
      
    15 The Judge was doing no more than indicating how the case had been presented to the jury by the parties in a practical rather than a technical way. There was no possible basis for suggesting that the jury would “conflate” the three counts. Written directions were given to the jury indicating the elements of each offence and the Judge clearly told the jury what the Crown had to prove before the jury could find the accused guilty on each count. 
     
      
    16 As has been noted, defence counsel took no objection to these directions when they were first given. His objection, when the jury asked the question, was only a concern that the jury might reason that, if the appellant was guilty of one of the three counts, he was guilty of them all. Otherwise he did not indicate that there was anything wrong with the comments the Judge had made and certainly did not suggest that the case was not left on the basis by each of the parties, that logically the verdicts on the first three counts should be the same. As has been noted, the judge cured the possibility that the jury thought she was referring to verdicts rather than findings. Her Honour made it plain that the jury could not reason that a verdict on one count should result automatically in the same verdict for the other two counts. All the Judge was indicating to the jury was that, in the way that the Crown had conducted its case, it was relying upon the same evidence to prove the first three counts and, therefore, the verdicts would probably be the same. 
     
      
    17 The first ground of appeal was that the Judge ought to have directed a verdict of acquittal at the end of the Crown case on counts 2 and 4. The ground was not argued at the hearing of the appeal and counsel for the appellant was content to argue that the verdicts were unreasonable. Clearly that was, with respect, a sensible and practical way to proceed because, if there was no case on any of the counts, the verdict of the jury must have been unreasonable. 
     
      
    18 We are not persuaded that the verdicts were unreasonable. It is not appropriate in our view to look at each of the first three counts in isolation and consider whether the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt on any or all of those counts. That is not how the matter was left to the jury by counsel or the Judge. Clearly the first and third counts were so connected that the verdicts of the jury on those counts had to be the same. The allegation that the appellant was knowingly involved in the manufacture of amphetamine in the shed to whatever degree and the fact that there was the precursor for the manufacture of amphetamine in the shed stood or fell together. The Crown’s case was that the appellant who owned the property and had a key to the shed was in effect in possession of the contents of the shed. As we have already noted, the allegation that he knowingly took part in the manufacture was because the Crown could not say what role he had in it. But it alleged that he at least permitted or suffered the shed to be used for that purpose. 
     
      
    19 The jury were entitled to find, and we would find, that the contents of the shed showed that the laboratory was still capable of being used to manufacture methylamphetamine and there were products for use in that manufacture in addition to the precursor with which the appellant was charged. There was evidence that the laboratory could be put together to make amphetamine in about an hour. 
     
      
    20 In our opinion the jury were entitled to use all of the evidence relating to methylamphetamine or its manufacture as evidence on each of the first three charges. We accept that, had the evidence of the presence of the methylamphetamine in the bedroom been the only evidence, the Crown might have had more difficulty in proving the appellant had possession of it, although we do not accept that the jury could not have found that it was in his possession having regard to all the evidence. The fact that his fingerprints might have been left on the jugs from some other occasion was a matter to be considered, but not in isolation. The location of the amphetamine, the way in which it was stored, the fact that the appellant was the owner and main resident of the premises were facts to be considered together with the presence of his fingerprints. We would not have concluded that there was a real possibility that Ms Pickett was in sole possession of the drug. 
     
      
    21 But the jury was also entitled to take into account all the circumstances surrounding the presence of the drug in the appellant’s bedroom, including what was found in the shed as well as the fact that the appellant was the owner of the premises and had a key to access the shed and a cupboard in the shed. There was also evidence of what he said about the shed and the lies he told about what was inside it. In our opinion the jury were clearly entitled to take into account the presence of the items for the manufacture of methylamphetamine in the shed and his knowledge of the presence of them when considering whether he was in possession of the drug in the bedroom. 
     
      
    22 We are of the opinion that the jury were entitled to find, and we would find, that the appellant was in possession of the amphetamine in the bedroom. 
     
      
    23 Once that finding was made there is little difficulty to our minds in concluding that the appellant was involved with the making of methylamphetamine in the shed. It defies common sense in our view that the appellant could be in possession of a significant amount of methylamphetamine, some of it of high purity, and yet not be involved in the manufacturing of such a drug in the shed on his property. Particularly as the laboratory was operative and, it can be inferred, would have been used in the future given the material found in the shed. 
     
      
    24 We would dismiss the appeal against conviction. There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    25 ADAMS J: On 15 June 2005 the applicant was convicted by a jury on all four counts on an indictment in the following terms –  
     
      
       
        
        (i) Between 1 January 2003 and 4 September 2003 at Penrith in the State of New South Wales, [the appellant] did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) On 4 September 2003 at Penrith in the State of New South Wales [the appellant] did supply a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine; 
        
       
       
        
        iii. On 4 September 2003 at Penrith in the State of New South Wales [the appellant] did have in his possession a precursor, namely an amount of hypo phosphorous acid intended by him for use and the manufacture of a prohibited drug by himself or another person; and 
        
       
       
        
        iv. On 4 September 2003 at Penrith in the State of New South Wales, [the appellant] did possess a prohibited weapon, namely a hand held device designed to administer an electric shock, not being authorised to do so by a permit. 
        
       
      
    26 On the day before the trial commenced, the appellant pleaded guilty to one count of possession of .22 calibre firearm, which was a prohibited firearm, not being authorised by a license or permit. 
     
      
    27 The appellant was sentenced on 28 October 2005 to an effective overall sentence of four years and five months with a non-parole period of two years eleven months. The appellant appeals from his convictions; there is no application for leave to appeal in respect of the sentences.  
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    28 In the early hours of 4 September 2003 the police went to 22 Hughes Avenue Penrith and conducted a search of the premises there. The appellant was found in the bed in a bedroom with a Ms, whose child was in the lounge room. The charges all derive from what was discovered by the police. There was some controversy about where precisely some of the relevant items were located and whether or not some of them were in a locked cupboard in a rear shed on the premises and some uncertainty whether the shed had a third door which may have been locked but these uncertainties – if such they be – do not matter. There was no doubt that the applicant had owned the premises for some years, and, though he occupied them on the date of his arrest, there was no evidence as to how long he had done so: as far as the evidence went, it might have been a matter of years or, perhaps, days. It is clear that he shared the premises on the day of the search with Ms and, very likely with another person who used another bedroom. Whether others had been in occupation of the premises at possibly relevant times is unknown. 
     
      
    29 The shed had plainly been used to manufacture amphetamine. In the shed was found, amongst other things, hypophosphorous acid, a precursor used to manufacture methylamphetamine. In the appellant’s bedroom were found two beakers containing methylamphetamine and, in a drawer, in a bedside table, a stun gun.  
     
      
    30 In my view, the determination of this appeal depends substantially on whether the appellant was in occupation of the premises when methylamphetamine was being manufactured in the shed, or whether, not being in occupation at that time, he knew that the manufacture was taking place and was a party to it in some way, whether the fact that the beakers containing methylamphetamine were found in his bedroom proved (with all the other evidence) that he claimed ownership or control over them sufficient to justify the inference that they were in his possession and whether he was aware if the presence of the stun gun in the bedside table. 
     
      
       
      The evidence 
        
       
      
    31 The premises comprised a single storey house with three bedrooms and a driveway leading to the shed at the rear. Police executed a search warrant at about 6am on 4 September 2003. The appellant cooperated fully with police during the execution of the warrant. As I have mentioned, he made no admissions either about the drugs or the stun gun. At the time police entered the premises the appellant was in bed in the main bedroom with Candice Pickett. As the officers went into the lounge room they noticed a small child who had been sleeping on the lounge and who sat up as they came through the door. 
     
      
    32 The shed was fitted with a roller shutter door and a door to the left. There was a door in the back of the shed. A handbag with identification belonging to Candice Pickett, keys to a Holden Commodore and the front door of 22 Hughes Avenue Penrith was found in the house. The door at the side of the shutter was secured with a padlock, a key to which was on a bunch of keys taken by the appellant from a backpack on the floor next to the right hand side of the bed (where he was when police entered the premises). The appellant also gave police a key to a small wooden cabinet inside the shed (called the “office”) to which the shed door gave access. Inside that cabinet was found a five litre plastic container that was holding about a litre of clear liquid. The liquid was not analysed and its nature is unknown. In another unlocked cupboard inside the doorway of the office area police found a backpack which contained the following items: a two litre plastic holding about 1.4 litres of clear liquid containing hypophosphorous acid; two electronic PH testers, the washers on which were found to contain methylamphetamine; a double-necked two litre round bottom reaction flask with traces of brown liquid containing methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine; a saucepan with two handles lined with aluminium foil and having a white solid residue on the base (not analysed); an orange funnel with black electrical tape around the end (not analysed); a glass elbow joint (no prohibited substance detected); a plastic bottle with a white lid and masking tape around the middle labelled H/P acid holding about 100ml of clear liquid which contained hypophosphorous acid; and a plastic container containing a grey granulated substance consistent with being iodine. In the same cupboard was found a one litre glass condenser in which was detected N-formyl-methylamphetamine, which is a by-product of the manufacture of methylamphetamine. On top of a desk in the office area was found a glass baking dish on which was a white powder residue containing pseudoephedrine. In a drawer under the office desk were found packets of Codral day and night tablets, Logicin sinus tablets, Zyrtec tablets, Telfast tablets, Demazin 12 hour tablets, and three documents labelled “cash stock cheque cashing facility” in the name of the appellant. In a cupboard in the office area was found a one litre black plastic drum with three ml of clear liquid in which was detected hydrochloric acid, a 375ml plastic water bottle half full of clear liquid with the words “ACE” and “TONE” written on the bottle, of which a sample was acetone (not a prohibited substance) and a four litre metal tin labelled “acetone full of liquid”. In the shower area were a number of sundry items including a four litre plastic container containing about 200ml of liquid containing ethanol and traces of pseudoephedrine and white sludge containing carbohydrate resembling a tableting agent, a full 500g plastic container of caustic soda. Swabs taken from the tiles on the walls of the shower contained methylamphetamine. Also found under a shelf in the middle of the garage was a twenty litre metal drum containing methylated spirits and another four litre metal tin containing acetone. On the work bench in the garage was found a set of large electronic scales.  
     
      
    33 A chemist from the Australian Forensic Drug Laboratory and an expert police officer experienced in the investigation of clandestine laboratories gave evidence that pseudoephedrine could be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine and could be extracted from pharmaceutical medications such as those found in the drawer of the desk. The tablets were ground down and mixed with a solvent such as methylated spirits which was then evaporated, thus producing almost pure pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. Residual pseudoephedrine could also be extracted from the solid residue of sludge left at the bottom of the vessel which had not been dissolved by the solvent. The type and variety of tablets found were commonly located in methylamphetamine laboratories. The liquid and white sludge in the plastic container found in the shower area of the shed represented the extraction of pseudoephedrine from pharmaceutical tablets using methylated spirits and, because the concentration of pseudoephedrine was low, the liquid was the second or subsequent extraction of the tableting agent. The pseudoephedrine was reacted with hypophosphorous acid and iodine, producing methylamphetamine. A heating process was necessary, which was typically done in a flask with a condenser attached to the top; a wok which was found in the shower was one of the heating devices sometimes used in order to heat the materials for the reaction. The round bottom reaction flask found in the backpack and the glass condenser in the cupboard inside the office area were almost certainly used for the manufacture of methylamphetamine from pseudoephedrine. After the reaction was completed, sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) was added to separate the methylamphetamine in the form of oil from the rest of the mixture by a process of distillation. (It will be recalled that a full 500g container of caustic soda was found in the shower area). The methylamphetamine oil was then usually converted into a salt by being dissolved in acetone and adding hydrochloric acid. As the list of located materials shows, both of these chemicals were discovered in the garage. It is necessary to monitor the acidity of PH level of the mixture. It is obvious that the two testers found in the backpack were used for this purpose. Of course, a number of the chemicals found in the garage, such as acetone could be used for innocent purposes.  
     
      
    34 The shed could fairly be described as a laboratory and there was evidence that the items found in it could be used to manufacture methylamphetamine in less than forty hours. The conclusion that the shed had been used to manufacture methylamphetamine was inevitable. The crucial outstanding question, however, was when it had been so used, as to which there was no evidence. I return to the significance of this issue in due course.  
     
      
    35 In the main bedroom, where the appellant and Ms Pickett were found sleeping, were found a Pyrex 1000ml measuring jug with a metal spoon and brown powder substance weighing 3.4 grams of which 11.1% was methylamphetamine. On this jug was found a print of the appellant’s right middle finger on the bottom and his right thumb on the inside. This jug was on the shelf on the north eastern corner of the bedroom. On the bedside table on the side of the bed on which the appellant was sleeping was found another Pyrex 1000ml measuring jug with a metal spoon, containing an orange brown crystalline powder weighing 17.4 grams of which 73.7% was methylamphetamine. The appellant’s right thumb was identified on the inside of the jug and a print of someone other unknown person was also identified. The evidence of the fingerprint expert was that the fingerprints on the jugs could have been there even before they were washed so that it could not be inferred that, at the time they were evidently handled by the appellant they contained any amphetamine. 
     
      
    36 Twenty-four tablets of Serapax and four tablets of Mogadon, a white powder and small resealable plastic bags were found in a blue cosmetic bag on the floor next to the appellant’s side of the bed. Also found in the bedroom was a set of electric pocket scales.  
     
      
    37 The material discovered in the bedroom, taken together, might have justified a finding that the methylamphetamine contained in the jugs was intended for supply but the Crown case in this respect was that the quantity was such that it was deemed to be possessed for supply. The crucial question was whether the methylamphetamine was in the possession of the appellant. The stun gun was found in a black case in the bottom drawer of the bedside table on the appellant’s side of the bed. It was not disputed that the appellant was not licensed to possess such an item. The gun, operated with a battery, was in working order. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    38 Ground One: There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the learned trial judge’s failure to direct verdicts of not guilty on Counts 2 and 4;  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury that it could use a finding in relation to any Count (other than Count 4) in coming to a conclusion on any other count. 
       
       
      Ground 3: The verdicts of the jury are unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
       
      
    39 If the appellant succeeds on Ground 3 it is not necessary to consider either of the other grounds, whilst if he fails on Ground 3, he must a fortiori fail on ground 1. Accordingly, I propose to consider Ground 3 first. 
     
      
    40 Counts 2 and 4 depended upon proof beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was in possession of the jugs and the stun gun in the bedroom where he was found when the police entered the premises. The starting point is the link between the appellant and the premises. As I have already mentioned, the applicant was in bed when the premises were entered by police. Following a conversation with police, the appellant obtained from a backpack on the floor near the bed on the side where he had been sleeping keys which, amongst other things, opened the padlock to the door of the garage.  
     
      
    41 The appellant was arrested shortly after a search of the house and cautioned. A little after half an hour later a conversation occurred between the appellant and Constable Rubelj. None of that conversation was elicited by the Prosecutor. However, in cross-examination the following was elicited. He was asked whether the bedroom he was in when the police entered the premises was the main bedroom and he answered, “Yeah”. Constable Rubelj then asked, “This is where you sleep?” and was told, “I sleep and a few other people, yeah”. Constable Rubelj asked, “Who are the other people?” and the appellant replied, “Well I’m not mentioning any names but just other people”. The appellant then identified a toilet bathroom and another bedroom which he said belonged to a Jessie. Just before the appellant was taken by Constable Rubelj to the garage, he was asked, “Alright Steve we’ll just go out the back of the premises and you’ve got a key to the back shed have you?” to which the reply was “Yeah” and the appellant provided a key as already mentioned. As they walked to the back of the workshop area in the shed Constable Rubelj asked, “What is exactly in there” and the appellant replied, “Engine reconditioning, mechanical”. Thus was manifestly untrue. The officer asked, “You do most of your work here or --?” and the appellant replied, “Yeah, when I’m working”. The officer asked, “What are you employed as at the moment?” and received a reply which, however, was not transcribed but contained the word “adjusters”. The officer asked, “Right, and is this just a hobby?” and the appellant replied, “Oh yeah. Basically. It’s what I used to do you know”. Constable Rubelj then asked him, “What is in the back room over there mate?” to which the appellant replied, “Toilet, shower”. He was asked, “Alright. Is that unlocked or--?” and the appellant said, “No, no…open it”. The appellant said of the equipment that it was “a beer brewing kit for brewing home brew”. Again, this was manifestly untrue. There was some other immaterial conversation. 
     
      
    42 The Crown tendered a title search showing the registered proprietor of the property to be the appellant together with a transfer showing that he had acquired the property in February 1996. There was no evidence as to when he was in occupation of the house except, of course, that he was clearly in occupation when police entered the premises. 
     
      
       
      The function of this Court 
      
     43 If I may say so, a useful summary of the relevant considerations applying in this appeal may be found in the decision of this Court in R v Micallef (2002) 136 A Crim R 127 Dunford J (with whom, as to this point, Sully and Bell JJ agreed) said –  
     
      
       
        
        “[39]. In  
        Plomp v The Queen 
         (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 243, Dixon CJ repeated what he had said in  
        Martin v Osborne 
         (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 375 as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘If an issue is to be proved by circumstantial evidence, facts subsidiary to or connected with the main fact must be established from which the conclusion follows as a rational inference. In the inculpation of an accused person, the evidentiary circumstances must bear no other reasonable explanation. This means that,  
          according to the common course of human affairs 
          , the degree of probability that the occurrence of the facts proved would be accompanied by the occurrence of the fact to be proved is so high that the contrary cannot reasonably be supposed.’  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
       
        
        [40] After referring to the type of matters which cannot be taken into account, such as character, reputations, associations etc., his Honour went on: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘But the class of acts and occurrences which may be considered includes circumstances whose relation to the facts in issue consists in the probability or increased probability,  
          judged rationally upon common experience 
          , that they would not be found unless the fact to be proved also existed.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (Emphasis added.)  
         
          
         
        See also  
        Knight v The Queen 
         (1992) 175 CLR 495; 63 A Crim R 166. 
        
       
       
        
        [41] It is also important to bear in mind that in considering a circumstantial evidence case, it is not the individual circumstances that need to be considered, but the combination and totality of the circumstances taken together; and the jury can draw an inference of guilt from a combination of facts, none of which viewed alone would support that inference:  
        Chamberlain v The Queen 
         (No. 2) (1984) 153 CLR 521 at 536. 
        
       
       
        
        [42] There is often a tendency in cases of this nature to consider whether each individual circumstance can be separately explained away as being consistent with innocence; or to consider whether a path, however tortuous, can be found through a combination of the circumstances, which as a matter of strict logic, is capable of being reconciled with a conclusion of innocence. The correct test, however, as explained by Dixon CJ in the passages quoted above, is whether, judging the matter rationally in the light of the common experience of human affairs, the combination and totality of the facts proved are consistent with innocence. 
        
       
       
        
        [43] The question for this Court is whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty; and in answering that question it must not disregard or discount the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence; but if this Court concludes that, even making full allowances for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent man has been convicted, the court is bound to act and set aside the verdict:  
        M v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-494; 76 A Crim R 213 at 216-217.” 
        
       
      
    44 (See also MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606.) 
     
      
    45 In this case, no material question of credibility arose; the jury thus enjoyed no advantage over this Court. However, its status as the primary deciders of guilt or otherwise must not be overlooked. 
     
      
       
      Were the verdicts unreasonable? 
       
      
    46 It is clear that, at the time of the search the appellant and Ms Pickett were in occupation of the house although, of course, at least one other person, Jessie, may have been normally present and, as it happened, not present at the time. It was submitted by the Crown that the presence of the fingerprints on the inside of the jugs is strongly indicative of his control of the contents, in particular of that jug which was located on his side of the bed. In light of the fingerprint evidence, this submission must be viewed with some scepticism. So far as the stun gun was concerned, the Crown relied on the fact it was located in a bedside drawer on the appellant’s side of the bed in a house that he owned and occupied and therefore should be regarded as subject to his control. The crucial question here in my view boils down to whether the evidence justified the conclusion that the appellant knew of the presence of the stun gun.  
     
      
    47 Although the Crown did not argue that the drugs found in the bedroom were the product of the laboratory in the garage, it is relevant to consider, when looking at the question of the possession of the drugs in the bedroom, the fact that the appellant had keys and access to the shed on his premises which had plainly been used for the manufacture of amphetamine. Furthermore, a locked metal cabinet in the office area was opened with a key provided by the appellant; the fact that there is nothing that suggests the connection of the five litre container found in it or the liquid in it with the manufacture of amphetamine does not qualify the inference of control implied by possession of the key. Even so, it is self evident that the mere fact that the appellant had a key could not justify a conclusion that no other person had a key and hence access both to the house and to the garage.  
     
      
    48 In my view, the inference that the appellant, at the least, was aware that the shed was used for the manufacture of amphetamine at one time or another is inevitable and it is reasonable to take this conclusion into account in considering the question of the appellant’s possession of the drugs in the bedroom. The mere presence of those drugs in the jugs in the form they were in strongly suggests a close connection between them and the manufacturing process of which they were the result, even if (as the Crown conceded) it could not be inferred beyond reasonable doubt that that manufacture took place in the garage. Once it is accepted that the appellant was aware that the shed had been used for the manufacture of amphetamine, it is an inevitable conclusion he knew that the matter in the jars was amphetamine. The crucial question, to my mind, is whether there was a reasonable possibility that the appellant was not exercising control over them. The fact that others might have exercised control over them is of course relevant but does not establish that the appellant did not. However, it is not necessary for the defence to establish that he did not exercise any control over the drugs but for the Crown to exclude the reasonable possibility that, although he plainly had access, he also had a sufficient measure of control to amount to possession. 
     
      
    49 In R v Amanatidis (2001) 125 A Crim R 89, Giles JA said (Hulme J not commenting, Adams J agreeing) at 90- 
     
      
       
        
        “[9] 
          
        Possession of a thing in the criminal law involves physical control or custody of the thing plus knowledge that you have it in your control or custody ( 
        He Kaw Teh v The Queen 
         (1985) 157 CLR 523 at 537-539, 546, 585-587, 599-600); 15 A Crim R 203 at 212-214, 219, 248-249, 258-259). The physical control or custody may be shared, but must be control or custody to the exclusion of other persons or persons other than those with whom it is shared ( 
        R v Dib 
         (1991) 52 A Crim R 64 at 66-67). It is not enough, however, that you are one of a number of persons with access to the thing to the exclusion of other persons – that does not constitute your physical control or custody of the thing or physical control or custody shared with the others of the number of persons. So in  
        R v Filipetti 
         (1984) 13 A Crim R 335 finding drugs in the lounge room of a house occupied by six persons, to which all six had access, did not establish physical control or custody of the drugs by one of the occupants, because any physical control or custody of the one occupant was not to the exclusion of the other occupants and shared physical control or custody could not be inferred; see also  
        R v Bazley 
         (unreported, NSWCCA 23 March 1989) and  
        R v Sobolewski 
         (unreported, NSWCCA 21 April 1998). 
        
       
      
    50 Had the drugs been found elsewhere in the house, I would be minded to think that the Crown could not, on the evidence in this case, have excluded the reasonable hypothesis that the applicant merely had access rather than physical control over the drugs. There was no doubt that he was not the only occupant of the premises. In the circumstances here, it seems inescapable that the appellant permitted or, at least, agreed that the drugs could be placed in the bedroom. If that permission or agreement were necessary, the appellant would have had sufficient control at all events to constitute possession in the circumstances. That leaves open the question whether it is reasonably possible that he was simply indifferent to the placing of the drugs in the bedroom and thus exercised no control over them. It seems to me that the facts that the drugs were in his bedroom on clear display, that he must have been aware of their nature, and that by far the larger part was found on the bedside table in his immediate physical proximity demonstrated that he had sufficient knowing physical control of the jugs and their contents to warrant the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that he was in possession of their contents, even though that control might well have been shared with Ms Pickett. I am not persuaded that a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs, at least at that quantity on the bedside table, was in the appellant’s possession was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.  
     
      
    51 Possession of the stun gun, it seems to me, falls into a different category. It was not on clear view. It is not known how long it was in the bedside table nor how it came to be there. It is not known how long the appellant had occupied the premises or, for that matter, how long he had occupied the bedroom. The fact that it was in the bedside table on his side of the bed is certainly strongly suggestive that he knew of its presence. However, it seems to me that the evidence could not justify a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that he was aware of it. In my view, therefore the verdict in respect of Count 4 is unreasonable. 
     
      
    52 I now move to Count 1 of the indictment. I have already said that it is inescapable to my mind that the appellant was aware that the garage had been used for the manufacture of amphetamine. However, there is no evidence that permits any inference to be drawn as to when the manufacture of amphetamine occurred, nor any evidence as to when the appellant became aware that it occurred. If he was aware only after the event, then he could not be guilty of the offence. If he was aware of the manufacture at the time that it occurred, he is not guilty of the offence unless there is some evidence that he was concerned in the manufacture. It is unnecessary to consider whether, in that event, (say) payment of rent by the occupants undertaking the manufacture would amount to being knowingly concerned in the manufacture since there is simply no evidence that, at that time, the applicant was aware that it was happening. Mere ownership of the premises and knowledge of the manufacture could not be sufficient to establish a knowing concern in the manufacture. If there was evidence that manufacture of the amphetamine occurred at the time of the appellant’s occupation of the premises, then that he was knowingly concerned in it might well be inferred. But there is no evidence justifying this inference. I cannot see how the fact that there were beakers of amphetamine in the appellant’s bedroom can support any inference about when the manufacture of the amphetamine occurred or whether the appellant was aware, at the time of manufacture, that it was occurring. Nor does that the fact that he owned the premises at the time of manufacture shed any light on when the manufacture occurred or when he found out about it. These matters taken together do not fill these gaps in the Crown case. With respect, I do not see how common sense makes the required links. To the contrary, common sense demonstrates that it is not known when the manufacture of amphetamine occurred or whether the appellant was aware of the manufacture at the time it was occurring and, hence, that it is unknown whether he was knowingly concerned in the manufacture of amphetamine.53 It seems to me that the problem for the Crown in this case arises from its inability to prove neither when the appellant was in occupation of the premises nor when the manufacture of amphetamine occurred. This problem is not resolved by the wide range of dates in the indictment. Even if it be accepted that the amphetamine in the jars in the bedroom was very likely to have been manufactured in the shed, it does not follow beyond speculative suspicion that the appellant was in occupation at the time of that manufacture. This is not a matter that depends upon the credibility of any witness. It follows that the verdict of guilty in respect of the first count must be set aside as unreasonable.  
     
      
    54 So far as the third count is concerned, namely the possession of hypophosphorous acid, that was contained in the backpack with a number of other items that had been used for the manufacture of amphetamine and, of course, might well be used again for that purpose. As with the other items, there was no evidence as to when the acid was placed in the bag nor when the bag was placed in the cupboard in the shed nor, for that matter, whether it was placed there by the appellant. There was some inconsistency in the evidence of the police officers as to whether the cupboard in which the backpack was found was locked. The evidence of the officer who located the backpack, although unqualified in chief, was somewhat less clear in cross-examination. To my mind, nothing depends on this point. Certainly the appellant produced a key to the cupboard in which, in the Crown case the backpack was found. In my view, the jury were entitled to conclude that the backpack was indeed in the cupboard and that the appellant had a key to that cupboard which he produced to the police.  
     
      
    55 More difficult for the Crown in respect to this count seems to me to be the necessity to establish, beyond reasonable doubt in the circumstances here, that the appellant was aware of the nature of the substance. I do not think that it was essential that he be aware that it was hypophosphorous acid but I think that it essential that he should be aware that it was a precursor chemical for the manufacture of amphetamine. This follows from the terms s24A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 which gave rise to the offence. That provision is on the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        24A  
        Possession of precursors for manufacture or production of prohibited drugs

        1) A person who has possession of a precursor intended by the person for use in the manufacture or production, by that person or another person, of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence. 
        
       
      
    56 It seems to me that, to make out the offence, the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the person knew that the substance is a precursor for the (in the circumstances of this case) manufacture or production of amphetamine. It is unnecessary to consider refined arguments concerning the nature of knowledge required for the purposes of establishing possession, given the terms of the section itself. In this case, however, even if the prosecution proved that the appellant was in possession of the bag and was aware that the substance in the container in the bag was a precursor, in my view the evidence could not justify the conclusion that the appellant intended to use the acid for the purposes of manufacturing or producing amphetamine or that he intended that another person should do so. The mere fact, if it be the fact, that some of the acid in the container had been used for the manufacture of amphetamine (which I think might readily be inferred) does not mean that the remaining acid was intended by the appellant to be used for that purpose either by him or by another. Accordingly, the verdict of guilty upon this charge was unreasonable. 
     
      
    57 Having regard to the grounds upon which the convictions on Count 1, Count 3 and Count 4 must be quashed, it seems to me that verdicts of acquittal must be entered with respect to those Counts. 
     
      
       
      Ancillary  
      matters 
       
      
    58 The appellant was sentenced as follows –  
     
      
       
        
        Count 4: imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months to date from 26 October 2005 and expire on 25 October 2006; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months to date from 24 April 2006 and expire on 25 April 2007; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months to date from 26 October 2006 and expire on 27 October 2007; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 1: non-parole period of eighteen months imprisonment to date from 26 October 2006 and expire on 25 April 2008 with a total term of three years imprisonment to expire on 25 October 2009. 
        
       
      
    59 The effective overall sentence was therefore a total term of four years and five months with a non-parole period of two years and eleven months. 
     
      
    60 The learned sentencing judge made it clear that she approached the sentencing of the appellant by fixing what her Honour regarded as appropriate sentences for each offence and then adjusting the extent of accumulation having regard to the principle of totality. 
     
      
    61 The sentences on the present indictment commenced on the expiration of the sentence for possession of a prohibited firearm upon which the appellant was convicted before trial and to which I referred at the outset of this judgment. Accordingly, the sentence for count 2, the only remaining count on the indictment for which he was tried must commence on 26 April 2006. The appellant was sentenced on this count to a fixed term of imprisonment for twelve months expiring on 25 April 2007. Although the learned judge did not expressly say so, I think that this fixed term was imposed as a reflection of a non-parole period which otherwise would have been imposed had the appellant not been sentenced on count 1 to a non-parole period of eighteen months imprisonment dated from 26 October 2006 and expiring on 25 April 2008 which sentence, apart from the initial six months, wholly included the sentence passed in respect of count 2.  
     
      
    62 It therefore seems necessary to vary the sentence on count 2 by converting the fixed term into a non-parole period but imposing a total term which will provide for a period on parole. This would, of course, be both technically and practically an increase of the sentence passed on count 2. The Court has the power to do so under s7(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The learned sentencing judge did not find that there were any relevant special circumstances except those that applied where sentences were being accumulated in order to ensure that the overall sentence reflects the statutory ratio in s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I would agree with this finding: there are no other special circumstances that would justify a variation of the statutory ratio. If count 2 were considered by itself, therefore, it appears that the appropriate sentence would be a non-parole period of twelve months to date from 26 April 2006 and expire on 25 April 2007 with a total term of one year and four months. The picture, however, is complicated by the fact that the sentence on count 2 was accumulated upon the sentence, not only for count 4 (now quashed) but also partly on the sentence imposed for possession of the prohibited firearm. However, I would not adjust the commencing dates of the sentences because I regard the effective non-parole period of 1 year and seven months as being the minimum sentence capable of reflecting the appellant’s criminality in respect of these two offences. Nor would I think it appropriate to extend the total sentence imposed for count 2 in order to comply with the statutory ratio.  
     
      
    63 These matters were not the subject of submissions by the parties and, because the effect of my proposed orders would be to increase the penalty on count 2, I think that the Court should first consider any submissions which the parties, in particular the appellant, wishes to make upon this point.  
     
      
    64 Accordingly, I would propose that the convictions in respect of counts 1, 3 and 4 of the indictment be quashed and verdicts of acquittal be entered and the question of sentence be deferred to permit the parties to make written submissions.

      2006/2387 PN v R 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 9 February 2007 an indictment was presented against both LAL and PN for the murder of Mr Youbert Hormozi on 31 January 2006 with an alternative count of manslaughter. Both offenders pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. These pleas were accepted by the Crown in full discharge of the indictment. The offenders must now be sentenced. 
     
      
    2 The crime of manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    3 I am also required and shall have regard when sentencing to two matters which have been included on a Form 1. Those matters are larceny of one CDMA mobile telephone being the property of Youbert Hormozi and larceny of a motor vehicle. Both of these matters arose from the circumstances of the manslaughter offences. 
     
      
    4 The Crown and the offenders have been able to agree to the facts which I should find when sentencing. Those agreed facts are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 31st January 2006 Mr Youbert Hormozi (the deceased) was a taxi driver. He suffered from significant coronary artery disease. The medical material shows that he suffered from a myocardial infarction in 2003, a stroke in 2004 and a further non ST elevation myocardial infarction in 2005. As a result of the stroke the deceased had a paralysed left arm and the taxi he drove was specially modified for his disability. The taxi was owned by Mahmood Yousaf. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 1.42 am (according to the taxi records) on 31 January 2006 the deceased collected a fare from a taxi rank in Cabramatta. Video security footage of Cabramatta CBD shows LAL and PN in the area at that time. The last time either girl is seen on the footage is at 1.41 am when LAL is seen riding a bicycle in the direction of the taxi rank. While it cannot be seen on the footage it is clear that the two girls got into the deceased’s taxi at this time. 
        
       
       
        
        At 1.47 am Paul Board, who lived at 19 Parklea Parade, Canley Heights, was awoken by noises outside. Mr Board heard dogs barking and people’s voices. Mr Board got out of bed and looked out through his blinds – he could see the front lights of a car at the other side of the road in front of his house. The engine of the car was running. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Board heard a noise ‘that sounded as though a kids toy or scooter was being dragged along the ground for a very short period.’ He also saw a plump figure standing close by and he saw this figure walk into a nearby reserve away from the location of the car. At this time Mr Board heard a female voice say, ""Did he hit you?"" The figure walked into the reserve and about 10 seconds later walked back out again and approached the car. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Board then saw the silhouette of someone walk from the driver's side of the car, around the front of the car to the passenger's side, before returning to the driver's side. This silhouette stopped near the front driver's side wheel of the car and appeared to put something on the ground before disappearing out of Mr Board's sight. The car drove off a few seconds later and it was at this time Mr Board saw that it was a taxi and the interior light was on. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Board could see an object on the road which he thought was a bag. He got a torch and his mobile phone and went outside to investigate. When he shone the torch on the object he realised that it was a person. This person appeared to be unconscious and Mr Board could see facial injuries to him — he called ‘000' using his mobile phone. During this ‘000' call Mr Board said, ""I saw what I thought was a lady and a kid on a scooter going up the park, then they came back from the park there's a car with its lights on. They dragged something around the front of the car, it was obviously this man, they dropped him and they've driven off, it was a taxi and they still had the interior lights on as they drove off ... And I think the female might have been of Polynesian appearance. I can't swear that. It was sort of a set sort of person thick set sort of person."" 
        
       
       
        
        A short time later police and ambulance arrived and found the deceased lying on his left side. At approximately 2 am the deceased arrived at Liverpool Hospital. On examination the patient's heart rhythm was asystole and there were no signs of life. The deceased was pronounced dead at 2.37am. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 2 am a number of people who lived on or near Humphries Road, St Johns Park heard the sound of a crash. The deceased's taxi had been driven into a parked car. A witness saw someone get out of one of the passenger side doors of the taxi. Another witness saw two people running away from the taxi. At one point one of these people stopped and a female voice with an islander accent was heard shouting, ""Just keep running."" Another witness, who had been driving along Humphries Road at about 2 am, saw the taxi stopped at the side of the road. This witness saw one girl walking on the footpath of Humphries Road and a second girl running across Humphries Road. 
        
       
       
        
        A bicycle was found in the back seat of the taxi — this was later identified by PN's father as belonging to his son. 
        
       
       
        
        The telephone calls — admissions 
        
       
       
        
        Tasipale Perelini was a youth leader with the ""Tree for Life Worship Centre"" which was attended by LAL and PN. At about 2 am on 31 January 2006 Mr Perelini got a call to his mobile phone from a private number and he recognised PN's voice. PN said, ""The cops are after me and LAL because we done a runner on a taxi ... We are running away from the taxi."" Phone records show this call was made from the deceased's phone. Phone records also show that up until about 3:42 am the deceased's phone made at least six unsuccessful attempts to call Mr Perelini. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 6:30 pm on 31 January Mr Perelini received a call from PN. When asked ""was that you two who killed the taxi driver"", PN said ""Was it on the news?"" Mr Perelini replied ""Yeah it was on channel nine, seven and ten"", PN said ""What time did it come on?"" Mr Perelini replied ""I heard it on the radio this morning about the taxi driver in Canley Heights. What did you do to him?"" PN said ""we were drunk"", Mr Perelini replied what do you mean drunk?"" PN said ""We got drunk and caught the taxi and never paid the fare"". Mr Perelini went to the police with this information later that night. 
        
       
       
        
        When at the police station, at about 10:32 pm, he received a call from PN's mobile phone. When asked to explain how the deceased had died PN said, ""When we got to the corner of LAL's house, I went out of the car and grabbed my brother’s bike we brought with us and LAL told the taxi driver we were not going to pay, so he grabbed LAL and we both kicked him and punched him, kicked him and punched him and then we drove the taxi to crash."" When Mr Perelini told PN that they had killed an innocent man PN said, ""It was an accident."" 
        
       
       
        
        Kris Toilolo also attended the youth group and was a friend of LAL. At about 2:07 am on 31 January Mr Toilolo received a call from LAL. LAL said, ""I just hit a taxi driver. My cousin and I hit him because he punched me. I just want to say goodbye."" When asked if she was drunk LAL said, ""Yeah, a bit."" LAL then said, ""I just want to say goodbye as I will be going to Juvi. I hit him with a rock."" Phone records show this call was made from the deceased's phone. 
        
       
       
        
        TN is a half sister of PN and PN had lived with TN from around November 2005, but had moved out a few days before the offence. TN says that she knew that PN and LAL would catch taxis and run off without paying the fares. TN knew this because on occasions taxi drivers had come to her door asking if two young girls lived there as they'd just run off without paying. 
        
       
       
        
        Sometime early in the morning on 1 February 2006 TN received a call from PN. TN heard LAL call out in the background, ""Just fucken tell her, we wasted a taxi driver."" LAL then spoke on the phone and said, ""Yeah we fucken killed him."" The call ended shortly thereafter but PN called back a few minutes later and said, ""The taxi driver tried to grab LAL so we dragged him out ... He wanted something from LAL he wanted to rape her ... I grabbed him from behind and LAL dragged him out of the car, we beat him up, we jumped into his car and reversed into a pole ... We took his mobile and some money from him."" 
        
       
       
        
        Further admission 
        
       
       
        
        On 1 February 2006 PN and Noah (sic) borrowed a mobile phone from a passenger travelling on a city bound train at about 9pm. After borrowing the phone one of the girls said, ""Do you watch the news, I've been on the news ... We killed the taxi driver."" 
        
       
       
        
        The arrest 
        
       
       
        
        Later on 1 February 2006 RailCorp transit officers apprehended LAL and PN at about 9:20 pm in relation to other matters. While waiting for the police to arrive the girls made a number of comments to the transit officers. LAL said, ""What would happen if I murdered someone?"" and, ""Will I go to juvie for murder?"" 
        
       
       
        
        When police arrived PN said, ""I killed someone and will kill again. I'm not afraid ... I'm a murderer, not a killer ... I killed someone."" PN also said, ""You are after us for the murder on the radio ... For the murder of the taxi driver. That was us, me and my cuz, we do everything together."" LAL said, ""I killed the fucken taxi driver ... You don't know who I am, I killed the taxi driver I will fucken kill you ... I fucken killed the taxi driver, don't you watch the news."" 
        
       
       
        
        Fingerprints and DNA 
        
       
       
        
        A DNA profile matching PN's DNA was obtained from various swabs which were taken from the deceased's taxi. PN's fingerprints were also located on the taxi and LAL's fingerprints were located on a diet coke bottle which was found near the deceased's body. 
        
       
       
        
        Shoe imprint 
        
       
       
        
        A pair of ‘Converse' brand All Star track shoes, size 8 belonging to PN and a pair of `Nike' brand track shoes, size 8 belonging to LAL were examined and compared to a post mortem photograph of a contusion to the right side of the deceased's face. The pattern on the toe guard of the ‘Converse' shoes corresponds in size and design with contusion pattern on the right side of the deceased's face. 
        
       
       
        
        ERISPs 
        
       
       
        
        Both girls participated in interviews with police. At the beginning of her interview LAL said, ""But do youse have any evidence that we killed him, ‘cause we didn't."" She then refused to answer further questions. PN said she knew nothing about the incident with the taxi driver and then refused to answer further questions about it. 
        
       
       
        
        The medical evidence 
        
       
       
        
        The direct cause of death in the pathologist's report is ""acute myocardial ischaemia"". The antecedent cause is listed as ""coronary atherosclerosis"" and other conditions possibly contributing to the death are ""hypertensive heart disease"" and ""recent blunt force head trauma"" 
        
       
       
        
        There were several bruises and abrasions on the deceased's arms, legs and body but the most serious injuries were to the face and head. 
        
       
       
        
        A 13 x 6 cm bruise was seen above the left ear/forehead area. A ""blotchy superficial"" bruise of about 15 cm was seen on the right temple/right cheek area. Of note, a strip of bruised skin with a crisscross pattern was located on this bruise — this strip was approximately 7 mm wide and 5 cm long. The pattern has been compared to the soles of PN's shoes and found to be similar. Swelling and reddened bruising were also located on a fairly extensive area around the right half of both lips. 
        
       
       
        
        In the commentary to his report Dr Ellis says, ""Death was due to acute heart failure. This was brought on by the effects of narrowing of the coronary arteries on heart muscle. Additionally the heart was enlarged, possibly as a result of high blood pressure and this would have increased the susceptibility of the heart to irregular rhythm brought on by the lack of sufficient coronary artery blood flow. There was evidence of blunt force trauma to the head. It is not possible to exclude this trauma from having contributed to death by precipitation acute heart failure and/or dysrhythmia in a diseased heart."" 
        
       
       
        
        A statement has been provided by the deceased's own doctor, Dr Kritharides. Dr Kritharides briefly reviews the deceased's medical history and says that when he last saw the deceased, on 21 November 2005, the deceased's condition was stable, he was making good progress and was able to return to normal duties. Dr Kritharides also said, ""Mr Hormozi had severe coronary disease. He was therefore at risk of cardiac arrest due to either cardiac arrhythmia or myocardial infarction, with or without external provocation. I am informed that the death occurred soon after his assault. There is medical literature indicating that the risk of cardiac arrest is increased by acute physical and or emotional stress. As Mr Hormozi's assault is likely to have caused such stress, it is my opinion that the assault is likely to have increased his acute risk of suffering a cardiac arrest."" 
        
       
       
      A factual dispute 
       
      
    5 Although the circumstances of the offence were agreed there was an issue which remained unresolved prior to the sentencing hearing. The post mortem examination of the deceased indicated that he had a number of superficial injuries including: 
     
      
    · An area of bruising with abrasion on the left forehead and adjacent scalp. 
     
      
    · An area of patterned bruising on the right temple and cheek. 
     
      
    · Swelling and bruising of the lips. 
     
      
    · An area of bruising on the left buttock. 
     
      
    · An area of bleeding into the skin and fat of the back. 
     
      
    · A number of small grazes on the side of the left knee. 
     
      
    · A brush-type graze on the tip of the left elbow. 
     
      
    6 Internal examination did not reveal any injury to the deep structure of the face or skull and there was no traumatic brain injury. 
     
      
    7 The controversy at the hearing was as to the mechanism by which bruising to the head, lips and cut to the eye of the deceased were occasioned. The Crown’s position was that the patterned abrasion on the right forehead and adjoining facial region could have been caused by a shoe imprint because of the presence of linear parallel bruises on the forehead. 
     
      
    8 The offenders called Associate Professor Johan Duflou, a forensic pathologist. His opinion was that the pattern of injury on the forehead was not consistent with it being caused by the sole of the shoe although it could have been caused by a thick shoelace or similar item. However, in his opinion if it was assumed that the abrasion bruise on the forehead was due to a shoe imprint then the injury on the left side of the face was consistent with impact against a rough surface most likely the road pavement. 
     
      
    9 Dr Duflou believed that the injuries occasioned to the deceased were at most the result of a moderate amount of force although in his opinion the injuries were consistent with force which was considerably less than moderate. The deceased was taking medication which could be expected to increase bruising and the observable facial injuries may have been less in a person who had sustained the same amount of force without being on that medication. The deceased had no deep bruising and there was no fracturing of the bones of the skull, face or jaw. There was no laceration of the lips or other oral structures as a result of the impact between the lips and the teeth.  
     
      
    10 Although LAL had suggested to Mr Toilolo that she had hit the deceased with a rock Dr Duflou found no observable injury consistent with a rock being used. 
     
      
    11 Dr Duflou also gave evidence about the other injuries observed on the deceased’s face. He was of the opinion, although he could not be certain, that some of these injuries may have been caused by the attempts of ambulance officers to resuscitate the deceased. 
     
      
    12 I accept Dr Duflou’s evidence. I am satisfied that although the offenders joined in a violent attack on the deceased only a moderate degree of force was used. I cannot be certain that a shoe was applied with any force to the deceased’s head. The force with which the deceased was attacked was sufficient to traumatise him and trigger the heart attack from which he died. He was suffering a significant coronary condition and was vulnerable to the attack upon him by the offenders. 
     
      
       
      Manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act 
       
      
    13 As I have indicated both girls have entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter. It was entered on the basis of the commission of an assault of Mr Hormozi, during which he was struck and fell to the ground and suffered a cardiac arrest which led to his death. This category of manslaughter involves an unlawful and dangerous act which carries with it an appreciable risk of serious injury. It is referred to by the law as involuntary manslaughter. It does not involve an intention on the part of the offender to cause death or grievous bodily harm to the victim which would constitute the offence of murder 
     
      
    14 The mental element in this class of manslaughter relates to the unlawful and dangerous act. It must be willed and not accidental. The relevant intention is to do the act that was unlawful and dangerous and which inadvertently causes death. Before the offence can be committed the circumstances must be such that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised that he or she was exposing another to an appreciable risk of serious injury. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing for manslaughter 
       
      
    15 The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years: s 24 Crimes Act 1900. No standard non-parole period is provided by the legislation. The criminal law has recognised that there are a wide variety of circumstances in which the offence of manslaughter may be committed. Although a most serious crime, the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various and the range of degrees of culpability so wide that it is difficult to identify an established sentencing tariff which can be applied to these cases.  
     
      
    16 When, as happened in the present matters, the offence is committed by children a court is faced with a complex and difficult sentencing task. 
     
      
    17 In R v MD, BM, NA, JT [2005] NSWCCA 342 the Court of Criminal Appeal looked at the sentencing statistics of the Judicial Commission in relation to the sentencing of persons for manslaughter during the period January 1998 to December 2004. They revealed that not all persons convicted of manslaughter received custodial sentences. Of those that did the sentences imposed ranged from 18 months to more than 20 years. In relation to the non-parole periods or fixed terms, the range varied between 1 year and 16 years. The middle 80 percent of cases fell in the range of 2 years to 8 years. In respect of persons under 18 years of age there were few examples but the head sentence ranged between 5 years and 8 years and the non-parole periods between 30 months and 5 years. 
     
      
    18 In R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 the court again looked at the sentencing patterns in relation to manslaughter. In that case the Chief Justice said at [133]-[135]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As has frequently been stated, manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence. (See in particular the observations of Gleeson CJ in  
        R v Blacklidge 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, esp pp2-3.) In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder ( 
        R v Weinman 
         (1987) 49 SASR 248 at 252;  
        R v Hoerler 
         (2004) 147 A Crim R 520 at [39]).  
         
         
        It is also relevant to recognise that, although manslaughters can be characterised in different ways, particularly in the various contexts which may reduce what would otherwise be a murder to manslaughter, the degree of variation  
        within  
        any such category is generally also over a wide range. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter. 
         
         
        For example where diminished responsibility is relied upon, the extent to which culpability is ‘diminished’ can vary considerably from case to case. Similarly, although it is possible to characterise a number of cases as “child-killing by a parent or carer”, it may never be possible to identify a sentencing pattern or tariff from the whole body of such cases. (See  
        Hoerler 
         supra.) This is not only because the number of cases in a particular category may be too few to establish a pattern or tariff. It is also because, within any such category, the relevant circumstances can vary over a wide range. This is also true in the case of manslaughter by reason of excessive self-defence (see  
        R v Trevenna 
         (2003) 149 A Crim R 505).” 
        
       
      
    19 In Forbes the appellant was on bail at the time of the relevant offence. He had a significant record for offences including drug dealing, burglary, armed robbery and assault. In that case the offender was sentenced in relation to two killings. The appeal in relation to one was dismissed and the other was upheld. In relation to the appeal which was upheld the offender was sentenced for his involvement in a melee when the victim was killed with a knife. The offender was not the person who actually inflicted the wound. The offender was allowed a discount of 12½% for his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    20 On appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal reduced the sentence imposed by the trial judge and resentenced the offender. The Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept that the permissible sentencing range for manslaughter must be regarded as particularly wide. Nevertheless, I have come to the conclusion that, in all of the circumstances, the sentence his Honour imposed on this occasion was manifestly excessive. The facts agreed before his Honour stated that the appellant knew that one of his friends ‘may have been armed with a knife’ and that he appreciated that there were ‘risks’ that one of his friends ‘might have used a knife while fighting with others.’ These agreed facts indicate a level of possibility, perhaps even a probability, with respect to both the possession of the knife and its use. There is nothing, however, to indicate precisely how probable was the appellant’s reason to expect either of these matters. In particular, it is not clear how certain he was that one of his friends had a knife at the time.” 
        
       
      
    21 The Chief Justice found that the appellant’s subjective case was so weak as to be virtually non-existent and determined that a head sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months was appropriate. His Honour said of this sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentence is still a heavy one and compared with the pattern of sentencing for manslaughter I give considerable weight to the need for general deterrence of persons with a proclivity to engage in brawls carrying knives. Personal deterrence is also entitled to significant weight. I agree with Hulme J that the prospects of rehabilitation are weak.” 
        
       
      
    22 The NSW Judicial Commission has collected some statistics in relation to manslaughter involving an unlawful and dangerous act being an assault by persons under 18 years of age. Eighteen cases have been collected. 12% of all offenders received a suspended sentence or periodic detention. The range for full terms of imprisonment was between 4 years and 8 years. Non-parole periods range between 2 years and 5 years.  
     
      
    23 As would be expected the statistics for all manslaughters show a significantly greater range with longer full term sentences and non-parole periods. 
     
      
       
      The relevance of alcohol 
       
      
    24 It is apparent that both offenders were greatly affected by alcohol and marijuana at the time of the offence. There can be no doubt that they had consumed quantities of both substances which would have significantly affected their behaviour and judgment.  
     
      
    25 The fact that an offender is affected by alcohol or drugs is generally not regarded as a circumstance mitigating the seriousness of the offence. “Alcohol and drugs are not a licence to commit crime.” In many cases the voluntary ingestion of alcohol by an offender will exacerbate the offending. In other cases it will be a neutral factor. However, where an offender commits an offence which is out of character and is at the time significantly influenced by alcohol, a court may conclude that the ingestion of alcohol has diminished the offender’s capacity to reason and make a judgment about the appropriateness of their actions.  
     
      
    26 In the present case neither offender had previously come to the attention of the authorities. Although the evidence indicates that they had each taken up drinking and the consumption of illicit drugs from an earlier time there is no doubt that their judgment on the night in question was seriously affected by the alcohol and drugs which they had consumed. The offence which they committed was devoid of any significant preplanning and was an opportunistic response to the circumstances in which they found themselves. I shall have regard to these matters when determining the appropriate sentence.  
     
      
    27 Each offender was exposed to the abuse of alcohol by members of their family from an early age. Both girls lacked appropriate parental supervision and guidance in the use of alcohol and drugs and it was almost inevitable that they would take up the consumption of both at a young age. In the sense referred to by Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [273] their use of alcohol and drugs was not entirely a matter of personal choice. 
     
      
       
      The seriousness of the offence 
       
      
    28 I have already related the circumstances of the offences. The offenders combined in attacking the deceased and although applying a moderate degree of force this was sufficient to cause the heart attack which led to his death. The deceased was vulnerable being a taxi driver. Having assaulted the deceased the girls abandoned him on the roadway and left in his taxi. 
     
      
    29 The offences were committed when both girls were seriously affected by alcohol and drugs, as I have indicated, and were opportunistic rather than significantly planned criminal activities. 
     
      
    30 I have already referred to the fact that the crime of manslaughter covers an extraordinary broad range of offending. Although the attack on the deceased took advantage of his vulnerability and led to his death it could not be classified as the most serious case of manslaughter. However, in all the circumstances, in my opinion, the offences were objectively serious. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing children 
       
      
    31 The Legislature has made special provision for the sentencing of children. Under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 a child is defined as a person who is under the age of 18 years. Section 6 of the Act provides principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction with respect to children. The section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction 
        
       
       
        
        A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 
        
       
       
        
        (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.” 
        
       
      
    32 Section 17 provides that a serious children’s indictable offence must be dealt with according to law. Manslaughter is such an offence. 
     
      
    33 The law recognises that when sentencing young offenders considerations of punishment and general deterrence should generally be regarded as subordinate to the need to foster rehabilitation. However, this principle will have less weight where the offending behaviour is such that the young person has conducted themself in a way that an adult does. When extreme violence has been used or the crime otherwise exhibits activities normally associated with an adult the need to protect the community may mean that deterrence and retribution must be given greater weight than might otherwise be the case. Age will be less of a consideration as offenders approach the age of 18. 
     
      
    34 In my view both the need for punishment and personal deterrence must be given significant weight in the present matters. General deterrence is also an important matter. Every member of the community must be reminded of the vulnerability of other people to acts of violence. Some, as was tragically the case in relation to Mr Hormozi, will be more vulnerable than others with the consequence that even a moderate degree of force will have a profoundly tragic outcome. Although I remain mindful that both the offenders were children of a relatively young age the sentence imposed must appropriately reflect these matters. 
     
      
       
      Considerations relevant to LAL 
       
      
    35 LAL was born on 5 October 1991 and was 14 years and 4 months old at the time of the offence. She is now 15. The court has received considerable evidence in relation to her family circumstances and upbringing. Her parents are Samoan. Prior to the offence she was residing with her mother and siblings in the family home at Canley Heights. 
     
      
    36 LAL is the eldest of four children and has two sisters and a brother. Although born in Sydney her family has lived, at various times, in New Zealand. Her father is a violent man and has abused all of the family members particularly LAL’s mother. He displayed such violence that her mother would flee the family home from time to time and with her children spend time in women’s refuges. LAL’s father has consistently abused alcohol. 
     
      
    37 LAL’s mother and her children lived with her father in Wellington, New Zealand in 2004. However the relationship between the parents broke down (this was not the first occasion in which it had broken down) and the mother and children returned to Sydney. There has been no contact with LAL’s father since that time. 
     
      
    38 LAL’s education has been disrupted as a result of the violence at home and the frequent moves of the family. She attended a number of primary schools both in Australia and New Zealand. She was in Year 9 at the time she was taken into custody. 
     
      
    39 LAL’s mother reported to a psychologist that LAL’s behaviour had declined in the years after their return from New Zealand. She often stayed out at night without permission and stayed away from home more frequently in the school holidays. She was disrespectful to her mother and refused to accept a curfew. 
     
      
    40 Since being taken into custody LAL’s behaviour reportedly moderated and she has apparently responded well to the structure and boundaries that have been placed around her. When she was first incarcerated she would act impetuously and with little thought for the consequences of her actions. The psychologist who interviewed her believed this was due to her inadequate maturity. However, now that she has been provided with assistance, support and trust LAL has become more openly responsive and reportedly shows more empathy for others. She has been attending school where her behaviour has stabilised and her school reports note an improvement in her behaviour and learning. She is currently enrolled in Year 11 and plans to complete her Higher School Certificate and then explore a TAFE course in either hair dressing or fashion design. 
     
      
    41 LAL told the psychologist that she first began drinking alcohol when she was 13 and was drinking most weekends before her incarceration. She told the psychologist that she would consume approximately 1 case of “Woodstock”. “Woodstock” has a standard equivalent of 1.7 drinks per can. On the night of the offence she reportedly consumed a half case which is the equivalent of 20 standard drinks. 
     
      
    42 Because of her reportedly high use of alcohol the psychologist administered the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT). A score of 8 to 10 on this test indicates problematic consumption of alcohol and a score of 19 and over indicates dependency. LAL scored 23 which is consistent with a high level of alcohol abuse prior to her admission into custody. 
     
      
    43 LAL began smoking cannabis in approximately 2005 at the age of 12. She told the psychologist that she would use cannabis on average twice per fortnight. She does not recall using any other illicit drug. 
     
      
    44 The psychologist discussed the circumstances of the offence with LAL. The psychologist reported that LAL has rather a confused memory of the events of that night. She expressed remorse about killing the taxi driver and told the psychologist that she had not wished to hurt him. 
     
      
    45 Various tests were administered by the psychologist who identified a low level of verbal skill in LAL. However, her non verbal skills were higher making it difficult to assess LAL’s general intelligence. The psychologist concluded that LAL has good non verbal reasoning skills and reduced verbal competence. As a consequence the psychologist believes that her development of self awareness and self control have been inhibited. The psychologist is of the opinion that “on tasks requiring social problem solving and communication, her skills will appear grossly reduced. LAL’s low verbal competence is likely to make her vulnerable to seemingly irrational and impulsive behaviour, which is consistent with her presentation during assessment and also her general history of escalating externalising problems.” 
     
      
    46 The immaturity displayed by LAL was apparently evident in her earlier appearances in court. The psychologist formed the view that she had displayed a degree of emotional disconnection and would laugh and behave in a manner inappropriate to the seriousness of the occasion. The psychologist believed this revealed an inability for mature self regulation and “highlights her poor emotional development” as a result of her experiences as a child and lack of appropriate nurturing.  
     
      
    47 The psychologist concluded her report in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “LAL’s early history indicates consistent exposure to paternal violence, and failure on the part of her mother to meet her developmental needs for safety and stability, which led to significant disruption to LAL’s schooling and general stability. The constant relocations appear to have prevented community agencies or schools engaging with the family to reduce the harms her abusive family environment were engendering. As a consequence, LAL appears to have become used to violence or aggression as a communication strategy, its use being normalised and even rewarded within the family environment. Whilst she describes feelings of animosity towards her father, her respect for her mother following her parents’ separation in 2005 appears to have dissipated also. Such loss of respect is probably associated with the natural inclination towards independence and autonomy found in adolescence, but also with the realisation that her mother’s lack of protective behaviours had exacerbated the difficulties she found herself in. LAL’s behaviour is reported to have become increasingly disruptive and oppositional from that time, and she was staying away from home for days at a time around the time of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        It is evident that there was inconsistent parenting modelled to LAL throughout her upbringing, and her mother specifically modelled erratic behavioural control. It is likely that LAL responded by simply doing what she wanted because her mother was being ineffective and perhaps self-absorbed, and there was no countervailing socially appropriate influence. As a result of the poor supervision and disruptive family environment, LAL reports an early initiation into substance use. Some use may have been for self-medication purposes but her account implies a person whose behaviour deteriorated as a result of the opportunity to do so. LAL was intoxicated at the time of the offence. Whilst she says that she did not plan to hurt the victim, her conduct shows an impulsive pattern to it that highlights her poor maturity level. Indeed, her maturity level is also affected by her poor emotional development and general detachment to her emotional state, as evidenced by her inappropriate display of affect at times for example. 
        
       
       
        
        Since being in custody and in a secure and stable environment, LAL’s behaviour has calmed considerably and she has been able to better engage with people around her, and she has also re-engaged with education. In terms of her clinical functioning, she presents as emotionally immature but this is something that has evidently improved since her admission into custody. There are no current features of mood disturbance or a psychiatric illness. LAL appears to be a young woman who has begun to externalise any distress she experiences, modelled to her by her abusive early experiences, however again, this has moderated in the last year. Whilst she is at risk for future problems to her psychological functioning, early and consistent intervention could improve her prognosis considerably.” 
        
       
      
    48 The psychologist made the following recommendations: 
     
      
       
        
        “LAL is due to undergo assessment under the Department of Juvenile Justice Violent Offender Program (VOP), and she is likely to receive supervision by a counsellor in this program as part of any sentencing order received. Intervention related to her offending behaviour is required, in addition to assistance with regards to improving her maturity, anger control and impulsivity levels as noted earlier. LAL could achieve such skills acquisition under a cognitive-behavioural therapeutic framework. Additionally, drug and alcohol counselling should continue and LAL reports a good response to this so far. Indeed, it is my opinion that LAL will continue to respond well to consistent supervision and treatment once rapport has been established. It is noted that a lengthy custodial sentence will negatively affect LAL’s prognosis and her motivation levels to some extent. Moreover, she will probably experience further detachment from her family and specifically her mother, which will affect her eventual adjustment to the community upon her release. 
        
       
       
        
        Furthermore, LAL should remain in a juvenile facility for as long as is possible, so that she can maintain access to consistent supervision, therapy and also education. Supervision should continue upon her release into the community, in order to assist with her reintegration and longer-term adjustment.” 
        
       
      
    49 LAL has been interviewed on four occasions by a counsellor of the NSW Department of Juvenile Justice. LAL told the counsellor that on the night of the offence she had consumed a significant amount of alcohol and cannabis with the co–offender and a group of males in the hours preceding the offence. She told the counsellor that she had consumed “the equivalent of approximately 10 standard drinks followed by a significant amount of cannabis in the space of 1 hour.” LAL told the counsellor that it was she who initiated the physical assault on the taxi driver “and when he allegedly retaliated by assaulting her and her co-offender, they responded by assaulting the victim further.” Before fleeing the scene LAL believed the taxi driver was still alive as she could hear him moaning. She said that she did not call an ambulance as she was fearful of being caught, was not thinking clearly and her immediate impulse was to escape. 
     
      
    50 LAL told the Juvenile Justice counsellor that it was not until she spent her first night in custody that she realised the full implications of what she had done. She said that she “felt real bad, guilty, that I took someone else’s life.” The counsellor accepted that LAL demonstrated genuine remorse and empathy for her victim. LAL said that she “started praying full on” hoping that the victim would forgive her and that her mother would still love her after the shame she has caused her family. The counsellor is of the opinion that LAL has accepted responsibility for her involvement in the offence. 
     
      
    51 The counsellor has reported the history of LAL’s time since she was taken into custody. That report is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “LAL was admitted to Juniperina JJC on the 02.02.2006, where she has remained until the present time. Perusal of departmental file notes and consultation with LAL’s primary workers indicate that she experienced difficulty settling into the routine, which may have resulted from the stress of being incarcerated and being separated from her family. Departmental notes indicate that LAL’s behaviour fluctuated from being compliant with staff, to demonstrating oppositional and aggressive behaviour (refusing to follow staff directions, abusive language and intimidating behaviour towards staff and other detainees) for which she received minor misbehaviour reports and was placed on behavioural management plans. LAL also became involved in an altercation with another detainee and was charged with ‘Common Assault’, for which she received a 6 month Probation Order. Perusal of the Background Report dated 20.02.2007, prepared by Juvenile Justice Office for sentencing on this matter, indicates that LAL acknowledged the inappropriateness of her actions and demonstrated remorse for her involvement. 
        
       
       
        
        Departmental records indicate that staff have assisted LAL in addressing her inappropriate behaviour through case management, individual counselling and group programs. Reports from staff indicate that LAL’s behaviour has markedly improved over recent months, she has been interacting with staff in a more respectful manner and actively participates in group activities and unit programs. Staff reported that LAL’s behaviour appeared to deteriorate in the days leading up to her various court appearances. Through case management and counselling it was identified that LAL experienced significant anxiety and fear about attending court, which was reflected in her behaviour on the unit. LAL reported that her fear manifested in inappropriate behaviour during court proceedings, such as giggling and smiling, and thus she has sought assistance from her counsellor to develop strategies to manage her anxiety more appropriately. 
        
       
       
        
        LAL’s participation in individual counselling has also focussed on addressing anger-management issues, as staff observed that LAL would react impulsively and aggressively when challenged by other detainees. Over recent times it appears that LAL has made a significant improvement in managing her reaction to conflict and stressful situations. 
        
       
       
        
        Perusal of Departmental records indicate that LAL has also participated in the following group programs: Alcohol and Other Drug group, Managing Emotion Regulation group, Stress Management Group, and Ending Offending group. Departmental notes indicate that LAL generally participates well in programs, actively communicating and contributing to group discussion. LAL stated that overall she has found the group programs helpful, though she experienced difficulty with the Managing Emotion Regulation group, as she was not comfortable expressing her feelings or accustomed to sharing personal information. LAL stated that she has learnt to express her feelings in a more open manner and to manage the feelings that are evoked from this process, which has been confirmed by staff reports. 
        
       
       
        
        As previously mentioned, LAL is also pursuing her education and is currently undertaking Year 11 subjects with the goal of obtaining her Higher School Certificate. Departmental notes indicate that LAL is a bright and capable student who achieves high marks on her assessments and exams. As well as attending school on a daily basis, LAL participates in general unit activities, which involve developing appropriate life skills, such as cooking and cleaning.” 
        
       
      
    52 Notwithstanding the reported improvement in LAL’s behaviour since she was taken into custody the counsellor was of the opinion that LAL would benefit from counselling in relation to grief, loss and trauma, anger management, alcohol and other drugs, peer association and refusal skills and issues relating to family relationships. The counsellor was also of the opinion that she would benefit from continuing her education, pursuits and participating in age appropriate activities. 
     
      
       
      Considerations relevant to PN 
       
      
    53 PN was born in New Zealand on 21 January 1992 making her just 14 at the time of the offence. She lived in New Zealand until she was aged about 4 when she came to live in Australia with her parents and five older brothers. She has a younger sister. 
     
      
    54 When interviewed by a psychiatrist PN reported a very violent household, although she characterised it as a stable family life. Her father worked regularly. Her brothers apparently fought a lot and could be violent toward each other. Although her father would scream at the children her parents were not generally violent towards each other. 
     
      
    55 Although she reported attending different schools it was only in Year 5 that she began getting into trouble at school. She received many detentions for arguing with teachers or fighting with other children. She reported to the psychiatrist “we just grew up with violence. If there was trouble you smashed someone or you get a belting.” She apparently accepted that this behaviour was “normal” in Samoan families: “if you do something wrong you get smashed.” 
     
      
    56 PN apparently coped reasonably well with schoolwork during primary school but was less successful in high school. She found the work difficult and her behaviour deteriorated. She had numerous suspensions and was constantly in fights with other girls and was giving “a lot of mouth” to teachers. She began to truant and received suspensions for fighting. 
     
      
    57 PN reported that she began using alcohol and tobacco in the second half of Year 8. She would be absent from school and stay out with one of the boys and drink “until we got pissed.” She reported that she may drink a dozen cans of a bourbon and coke mix in one afternoon. 
     
      
    58 PN’s mother developed a mental illness when PN was in Year 6. PN reported that “she’d go out on the road and the cops would bring her home and she made up stories about dad cheating on her and saying he has another family and that the other woman is going to come and pick us up tomorrow and that we’d have a new house.” Her mother received treatment but has not always coped with her condition. She has spent periods in hospital and has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.  
     
      
    59 By the end of the school year in 2005 PN was spending considerable time away from her family home smoking marijuana and drinking. She spent that Christmas at a friend’s house and stayed out from Christmas until New Year drinking with friends. This behaviour continued throughout most of the following January.  
     
      
    60 The psychiatrist presented a picture of a chaotic household where there were a few organised meals and a lack of structure. There was a lot of violence and drinking. 
     
      
    61 The psychiatrist reported that PN has expressed sorrow for the death of the taxi driver and the pain caused to his family. She says that some nights she goes over and over the events which she pictures in her mind and cries. 
     
      
    62 PN’s parents have remained supportive of her although her mother is handicapped by her mental illness. During her time in custody PN has been cooperative, participates in programs and has not displayed aggression. 
     
      
    63 The psychiatrist is of the opinion that PN is suffering from a Major Depressive Disorder which is “manifest in severe irritability of mood more than depressed mood, which is characteristic of depression in adolescence.” She has “severe sleep disturbance, apathy, a poor concentration, lack of interest, and motivation and anhedonia.” 
     
      
    64 The psychiatrist also reports that PN “has post traumatic stress symptoms” as a result of chronic family violence. She said that “hyperarousal, impaired cognitive processes, poor affect and impulse regulation and disturbed interpersonal or attachment relationships that are typical of children raised in such traumatic environments.” 
     
      
    65 As a consequence of her experiences the psychiatrist believes that PN is “especially prone to serious disturbance.” She apparently suffered a severe beating from her father in the year prior to the offence which the psychiatrist believed had a significant impact upon her personality. 
     
      
    66 The psychiatrist was of the opinion that PN needed treatment with anti-depressant medication. She also requires counselling in relation to dealing with her feelings of frustration and violence. The psychiatrist believed that PN feels considerable remorse about her actions and “expresses remorse and concern for the family of the victim.” Because she has adjusted to detention the psychiatrist believes that PN is capable of “becoming socialised in an adequate way.” 
     
      
    67 PN was also been interviewed by a psychologist.  
     
      
    68 When interviewed she reported that she had commenced using alcohol at 13 years. She said that she was drinking alcohol every day mostly of an afternoon and evening and with the expressed purpose of becoming intoxicated. She also began smoking cannabis at the same age and reported smoking with friends on a daily basis if the drug was available. She reported smoking on average 5 “cones” a day.  
     
      
    69 The psychologist reported that PN was shocked when she heard that the taxi driver had died. The psychologist believed PN had displayed genuine empathy for her victim and expressed both regret and remorse for “the impact upon the man who died, but also for his family.” 
     
      
    70 When tested PN revealed verbal intelligence falling in the low average range and a non-verbal intelligence in the average range. She was assessed with overall intellectual capacity in the low average range. She was found to have above average skills in coping with time pressures and her profile was not consistent with attention deficit symptomatology.  
     
      
    71 The psychologist made the following recommendations in relation to PN: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the basis of this assessment, the most salient criminogenic issue for PN to address lies in her limited self-regulation and emotion management skills, in addition to undersocialisation and idealisation of criminality. These issues are best addressed with offence-specific psychological treatment, which is available within the Department of Juvenile Justice Detention Centres and, in particular, the Violent Offender Programme, which offers services to young people detained in custody and those in the community. Referral to this programme would allow for a continuum of care for PN as she transitions to the community. 
        
       
       
        
        PN has a history of substance abuse and, although this does not appear to be particularly entrenched in the sense of dependence, she would benefit from education around the consequences of drug and alcohol use, in addition to the provision of harm minimisation skills. This is further highlighted by the fact that her alcohol and drug abuse was significant and regular, within a relatively brief period of time, and also contributed to her offending behaviour. Such treatment is available through Juvenile Justice resources and it is important that PN accesses this service as substance abuse remains a risk for her. 
        
       
       
        
        PN is only young and, now in custody, she is being exposed to further delinquent and antisocial norms. It is important that she be well supported as she transitions to the community, as it will likely be very difficult for her to reintegrate into the community after a period of incarceration. In addition to supervision with the Department of Juvenile Justice, it may be appropriate to refer her to a mentoring support service for Pacific Islander youth. 
        
       
       
        
        In many ways, PN is a likeable young girl, who seems socially immature and relatively dysfunctional psychologically. It is regrettable that her early trajectory and psychosocial vulnerabilities culminated in the offences before the Court and it is important that she be offered appropriate treatment and support to allow her to make the best of her current incarceration so that she might engage in services and interventions that offer her a chance for a future after custody.” 
        
       
       
      Pleas of guilty 
       
      
    72 Both offenders were arrested on 1 February 2006. They have remained in custody ever since. Although when arrested they made admissions, they did not plead guilty until arraigned on 2 February 2007. Notwithstanding their earlier admissions when interviewed they denied killing Mr Hormozi. Before being arraigned each offender was committed following “a paper committal” when no witnesses were called. In December 2006 the offenders’ solicitors wrote asking whether consideration could be given to the Crown accepting a guilty plea to the charge of manslaughter. 
     
      
    73 In these circumstances the offenders each submit that their delay in entering a plea has not occasioned significant inconvenience to the Crown. It was submitted that given the age of each offender and the complex cause of death of the deceased the delay in offering to plead to the charge of manslaughter is understandable. It was submitted that it was a plea at the earliest opportunity to the appropriate charge. 
     
      
    74 I am satisfied that each offender is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of their pleas. However, that discount must be less than the maximum, the opportunity being available from an early time to offer a plea to a manslaughter charge. In my opinion an appropriate discount is of the order of 15%. 
     
      
       
      Contrition 
       
      
    75 I am satisfied that each offender has expressed genuine remorse and regret for the death of the deceased. Although both suffer from significant psychological problems which have been manifested in inappropriate behaviour at various times when they have been present in court the psychological evidence is that both of them are genuinely contrite. LAL has written to the deceased’s family expressing her regret. I shall have regard to these matters when imposing the sentence. 
     
      
       
      Victim Impact Statement 
       
      
    76 Anna Hormozi, the daughter of the deceased, read a statement to the court on behalf of herself and her mother. Although the deceased and his former wife had divorced there remained a bond between them. Ms Hormozi has been greatly affected by the loss of her father.  
     
      
    77 The loss of Mr Hormozi is a tragedy for his family. The death of a loved family member is always difficult but when it occurs in violent circumstances it brings additional grief. On behalf of the court I express my sympathy to the family in their terrible loss. 
     
      
    78 The courts have on many occasions emphasised that the protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the criminal justice system. An understanding of the personal qualities of a victim of an unlawful homicide will serve to focus attention upon this important aspect of sentencing law. “The qualities of a particular victim may serve as a useful reminder of the quality of human life itself, and of all that is involved in taking it away.” 
     
      
    79 The courts have said on other occasions that one of the purposes of reading the victim impact statement publicly in the sentencing proceedings is to bring home to the offender and others who might act in a similar way the appalling consequences of their actions. However, the law also makes clear that a greater sentence cannot be imposed because of the impact of the crime on the victim’s family. 
     
      
       
      Prospects of rehabilitation 
       
      
    80 The psychiatric evidence in relation to PN and the psychological evidence in relation to both girls confirms the deprivation in their personal circumstances. It also suggests that the intellectual functioning of both girls is below average. They both need considerable supervision and counselling if they are to recover from their disadvantages and become mature and responsible members of the community. It is obviously in their own interests and that of the general community that the opportunity for their rehabilitation be maximised. This Court said in MD, BM, NA, JT at para 74: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, as we have indicated, when imposing sentences, apart from considerations of punishment and deterrence a court must assess the offender’s capacity to reform and return to and make a contribution to the community. This must be of particular concern with young offenders where the opportunity to rebuild a life is more likely to be available. Unless the punishment recognises these possibilities and the circumstances of the incarceration made conducive to rehabilitation, some benefits to the community which may come from appropriate sentencing will be lost.” 
        
       
      
    81 In the case of both girls the evidence indicates that since they were arrested and taken into custody they have made progress towards rehabilitation. Although each girl required a period of adjustment to their altered circumstances they have both responded to the discipline and care which has been provided. There is every reason to believe that they will benefit from a further period of incarceration in circumstances where their schooling can continue and they can receive counselling and guidance in relation to the use of alcohol and drugs and acquire behavioural patterns which exclude violence as a response to stressful situations. 
     
      
       
      The appropriate sentences 
       
      
    82 The sentencing of any person for an offence involving the loss of another’s life is a difficult task. For many in the community when a person dies through no fault of their own but because of the actions of another a very lengthy prison term is required. That view is normally expressed out of a perception of the need to punish the offender and extract retribution for the harm which has been done. General deterrence is also a factor which weighs heavily in many people’s minds when considering the appropriate sentence for an offender who has been responsible for the death of another. 
     
      
    83 However, although these matters are of great significance, a court when sentencing must also balance a number of other matters. Regard must be had to the circumstances of the offence and the culpability of the offender. Consideration must also be given to the subjective features relevant to the offender, any prior criminal history, the extent to which personal deterrence is required and the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation. Depending on the circumstances of the case, there may be other matters which require consideration. 
     
      
    84 The present offences were serious and a custodial sentence is inevitable. However, the sentences should reflect the fact that they were committed by young people whose judgment was impaired by alcohol and drugs. Although the injuries inflicted upon the deceased were sufficient to bring upon a heart attack they probably would not have led to the death of a person whose health was not already seriously compromised. The crime is more significant because the girls attacked a taxi driver who was driving them late at night and was vulnerable to attack. The courts are particularly concerned to deter others from committing similar crimes. 
     
      
    85 It may be that some members of the community will consider the sentences I am about to impose to be inadequate. Mr Hormozi’s family may feel that much greater punishment should be imposed on those responsible for his death. 
     
      
    86 The sentencing task is one of the most difficult obligations which a judge must discharge. The court is required to sentence in accordance with statutory and common law principles which have been developed to ensure that justice is fairly administered. This, as I have indicated, requires the balancing of the many factors to which I have referred in these remarks in order to arrive at a sentence which is appropriate for the offence and the circumstances of the offender. 
     
      
    87 The sentences which I propose may have the consequence that both offenders will be in custody beyond the age of 18 years. If this was to occur unless an order is made under s 19(3) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 the balance of any sentence may have to be served in other than facilities for a juvenile offender. In my view in relation to both offenders this would not be appropriate and may seriously compromise both girls’ prospects of rehabilitation. The background report and other evidence in relation to both offenders indicates that they have already made real progress towards rehabilitation. To interrupt that progress towards the end of any period of incarceration and require them to complete their sentence in an adult prison would risk the progress which they may have already made. Accordingly, for the purposes of s 19(3) of the Act I find that there are special circumstances justifying the detention of both offenders in a juvenile detention centre. 
     
      
    88 I am also satisfied that each offender would benefit from a period of extended supervision upon being released on parole. However, the need to provide an appropriate non-parole period limits the extent to which an extended period on parole can be provided. 
     
      
    89 Having regard to all of these matters, including the matters on the Form 1, in my opinion each of the offenders should be sentenced to a total term of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three and a half years.  
     
      
    90 LAL I sentence you to a non-parole period of 3 years and six months commencing on 2 February 2006 and expiring on 1 August 2009 with a further term of two years and six months expiring on 1 February 2012. 
     
      
    91 PN I sentence you to a non-parole period of 3 years and six months commencing on 2 February 2006 and expiring on 1 August 2009 with a further term of two years and six months expiring on 1 February 2012. 
     
      
    92 I find that there are special circumstances under s 19(3) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and I direct that each of the offenders serves her sentence prior to release to parole as a juvenile offender.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, The Commissioner of Fair Trading, Department of Commerce, commenced proceedings by way of notice of motion dated 20 December 2006 and filed on that date. The motion was returnable on Monday 5 February 2007 and it came before me in the duty judge list. 
     
      
    2 The orders sought were as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (a) That the defendant be adjudged guilty of contempt of this Court and that he be dealt with in such manner as the Court considers proper. 
       
       
      (b) That the defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs in these proceedings. 
       
       
      (c) Such other orders as the Court deems necessary. 
       
      
    3 The plaintiff also filed, on 20 December 2006, a Statement of Charges in which the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was guilty of contempt of this Court in knowingly breaching orders of the Court. The statement recorded that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) On 19 June 2006, this Court made orders against the defendant. Attached to the Statement of Charges was a copy of the orders made by this Court on 19 June 2006. The terms of the orders were as follows:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that the defendant, whilst not being the holder of a licence or certificate under Part 3 of the  
          Motor Vehicles Repairs Act 1980 
           … be restrained until further order, whether personally, in partnership, through a corporate structure, through the agency of another or through an employee, contractor or otherwise from:- 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) carrying on or advertising that he carries on or is willing to carry the business of a repairer in respect of any repair work as defined in s.4(1) of the  
            Motor Vehicle Repairs Act 1980 
            ; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    (ii) doing any such repair work in connection with the business of a repairer as defined in s.4(1) of the Act; and 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iii) representing, by advertisement or otherwise, that he does or is willing to do repair work as defined in s.4(1) of the Act. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs of this motion.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    4 On 5 February 2007, when the notice of motion was first returnable before me, there was no appearance on behalf of the defendant when called. The plaintiff relied, in support of the notice of motion, on the affidavits of Kenneth Buscombe sworn on 8 December 2006 and the affidavit of John Kenny also sworn on 8 December 2006, together with the affidavits of service of the notice of motion and of the statement of charges and of the two affidavits to which I have referred. 
     
      
    5 At the hearing on that date, an Evidentiary Certificate was tendered under s.78(2) of the Motor Vehicle Repairs Act 1980 (NSW) dated 8 January 2007 (Exhibit A). 
     
      
    6 On 6 February 2007, I proceeded to receive evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. The evidence in support of the notice of motion established beyond reasonable doubt that, on 6 September 2006, an inspection of the defendant’s premises revealed that the defendant had continued to carry on the business of a motor vehicle repairer within the meaning of the Act. 
     
      
    7 In particular, the affidavit evidence relied upon by the plaintiff established, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Kenny’s conclusion stated in his affidavit (paragraph 19) that he believed the defendant had been carrying on work as a motor mechanic, panel beater and spray painter contrary to the Motor Vehicle Repairs Regulation 1999 (NSW) was well supported. 
     
      
    8 The evidence also established that the defendant had never been the holder of the requisite licence or tradesperson’s certificate and had not been exempt under s.5 of the relevant Act. 
     
      
    9 Accordingly, the plaintiff’s evidence on the application supported findings that the defendant, contrary to the order made by Whealy J on 19 June 2006, had continued to carry on work as a motor mechanic, panel beater and spray painter contrary to the abovementioned provisions of the Motor Vehicle Repairs Regulation 1999 (NSW). 
     
      
    10 On 9 February 2007, I adjudged the defendant to be guilty of contempt of this Court, in that he knowingly breached the Court’s orders made on 19 June 2006 by the following conduct:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) On 6 September 2006 at premises at Unit 6, 3-11 Flora Street, Kirrawee, the defendant did carry out repair work for reward being wheel bearing and steering rack repairs on a Ford Mondeo registration number AXT 10M owned by Rebecca Carol Pollock, the repairs being in the class of repair work of a motor mechanic as defined in section 4(1) of the Motor Vehicle Repairs Act 1980 (‘MVRA’). 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) On 6 September 2006 at premises at Unit 6, 3-11 Flora Street, Kirrawee, the defendant did carry out repair work for reward being repairs to rust around the rear window and the quarter panel of a Holden Commodore registration number AI 94 SU owned by Glenn Michael Clough, the repairs being in the class of repair work of a panel beater as defined in section 4(1) of the MVRA.” 
        
       
      
    11 On 9 February 2007, the following orders were also made:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The Defendant David Clive Jenness attend the Supreme Court Law Courts Building, Queens Square located at 184 Phillip Street, Sydney at 2.00 pm on Tuesday 13 February 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        2. In default of an appearance at that time and place, the Plaintiff will be at liberty to obtain an order for the arrest of the Defendant without further notice to the Defendant. 
        
       
       
        
        3. A copy of these orders be served on the Defendant by no later than 4.00 pm on 9 February 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Plaintiff has leave to request proceedings be re-listed at short notice at which time the Defendant is to be brought before the Court in the event that he does not appear on Tuesday 13 February 2007 at 2.00 pm and such request to be made to my Associate. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Costs are to be reserved.” 
        
       
      
    12 On Tuesday 13 February 2007, the proceedings were again listed. The defendant appeared unrepresented. On that occasion, Ms Griswold, on behalf of the plaintiff, handed up a document setting out costs orders sought by the plaintiff. On the same day, I determined that the proceedings should be stood over in order to permit the defendant the opportunity of putting on any evidence. The question of costs was reserved. The proceedings were stood over for hearing on 1 March 2007. 
     
      
    13 The finalisation of the proceedings were further deferred on 1 March 2007 to enable a pre-sentence report to be received from the Probation and Parole Service. A pre-sentence report has now been received (dated 25 April 2007). It was tendered at the resumed hearing on 27 April 2007 (Exhibit C). 
     
      
    14 The sources of information relied upon for the purposes of that report included interviews with the defendant. There was no independent information provided in respect of police facts and criminal history. The author of the report, Mr Peter Ikin, Acting District Manager, Sutherland District Office, also had access to New South Wales Department of Corrective Services records. 
     
      
    15 The report indicates that the defendant first came to the notice of the Probation and Parole Service when he was placed on a supervised Bond on 7 December 1989 to be of good behaviour for two years following his conviction for assault police. 
     
      
    16 On 9 May 1991, he appeared on a matter of drive high range prescribed concentration of alcohol before the Sutherland Local Court. A community service order of 150 hours was imposed with a four year disqualification from driving. His community service order was completed in November 1991. 
     
      
    17 The pre-sentence report reveals that the defendant came from a family background which was marked by argumentation between his parents and to the eventual separation of his parents when he was 15 years of age. 
     
      
    18 The defendant spent time in Yasmar Juvenile Detention Centre for being uncontrollable and two years as a patient in the Arndell Unit at North Ryde due to hyperactivity. It is also said that he spent a period of time in former Chelmsford Private Hospital when he received electro-convulsive therapy at the age of 12. According to the defendant, he is estranged from all members of his immediate family. 
     
      
    19 The defendant obtained his school certificate at age 15 years and undertook an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner with the Royal Australian Navy. It appears that he was a successful employee with that service for some seven years. Subsequently, he obtained employment servicing various types of vehicles as well as performing body repair work to vehicles. 
     
      
       
      Assessment of subjective factors 
       
      
    20 The defendant is presently aged 36 years (date of birth 21 May 1969). He has not previously been convicted of any serious criminal offences. He has had somewhat of a disrupted upbringing, although, as noted above, he has managed in his earlier life to obtain qualifications and has held employment. 
     
      
    21 According to the pre-sentence report, the defendant showed some contrition for his offence, admitting that he now realised that he should have attended court when required. What has been assessed as a somewhat resolute but inflexible character is attributed, at least in part, to his early development having to fend for himself in his teenage years. It is stated that he did not appear to be a malicious person. 
     
      
    22 The pre-sentence report states that the defendant is unlikely to benefit from the supervision by the Probation and Parole Service, but that he has been assessed as suitable for a Community Service Order in accordance with the provisions of s.86(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and he has signed an undertaking as required by s.88(1)(e) of that Act. 
     
      
    23 The pre-sentence report also states that the defendant is eligible and has been assessed as suitable for a Periodic Detention Order in accordance with the requirements of s.65A and s.65B of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Periodic and Home Detention) Act 2002 (NSW) and s.66(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and he has signed an undertaking as required by s.66(1)(f) of that Act. 
     
      
    24 I have considered the question as to whether the contempt committed by the defendant requires the imposition of a custodial sentence, given the evidence which establishes wilful disobedience by the defendant of an order of this Court. 
     
      
    25 The contempt committed by the defendant is to be seen against the background of prior convictions against him for contraventions of the Motor Vehicle Repairs Act 1980 (NSW) (on 1 May 2003 and 5 December 2005). In this respect, copies of certificates of conviction have been tendered and are comprised, in part, as Exhibit E. The conduct which constitutes the contempt of this Court, again, reflects the defendant’s disregard of the law and of the order made against him by this Court on 19 June 2006. 
     
      
    26 The legislation contravened by the defendant is plainly designed to protect and advance the public interest. The order made by Whealy J on 19 June 2006 directly imposed an additional legal obligation on the defendant which the defendant chose to completely disregard. There is no evidence of any mitigating circumstances which would reduce the objective culpability of his conduct. The rule of law in our society is premised, in part, upon those who are bound by such orders obeying them. Wilful disobedience of such orders can usually be expected to attract a custodial sentence. 
     
      
    27 In the present proceedings, I have had regard to both the objective circumstances and the subjective circumstances as revealed in the pre-sentence report and the assessment made in that report of the defendant. 
     
      
    28 I have also taken into account that the defendant is not represented and, had he been represented, on might expect there to have been evidence adduced on his behalf. 
     
      
    29 In Commissioner for Fair Trading v Partridge [2006] NSWSC 478, Bell J identified the matters to be taken into consideration when sentencing for the offence of contempt. The following matters were there discussed:- 
     
      
       
      (a) the seriousness of the contempt proved; 
       
       
      (b) whether the contemnor was aware of the consequences to himself of what he did; 
       
       
      (c) the reason for the contempt; 
       
       
      (d) whether there has been any apology or public expression of contrition; 
       
       
      (e) general and personal deterrence; 
       
       
      (f) denunciation of the contempt; 
       
       
      (g) the character and antecedents of the contemnor. 
       
      
    30 The principles applicable to the punishment of contempt, accordingly, are well established. In Manian (No 2) (1992) 26 NSWLR 309, Kirby P (as he then was) stated the rationale for punishing a contemnor at 314 as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A conviction of contempt of court is a conviction of an offence, criminal in nature. Punishment of the convicted contemnor must therefore take into account the considerations normally applicable to the punishment of crime and apt to uphold the purpose of this jurisdiction, namely, the undisturbed and orderly administration of justice in the courts according to law. Thus, in determining the punishment which is apt to the circumstances which have led to a conviction of contempt, it is appropriate to bear in mind the purposes of punishing the contemnor, deterring the contemnor and others in the future from committing like contempts, and denouncing the conduct concerned in an appropriately emphatic way: see  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v J John Fairfax & Sons Limited 
         (1987) 8 NSWLR 732 at 741.” 
        
       
      
    31 I have borne in mind the importance of specific and general deterrence in determining the sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    32 Considerations such as these are to be examined in the context of s.3A and s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 
     
      
    33 I have considered the mitigating and aggravating factors in the present circumstances. I have referred earlier to the deliberate defiance of the order of the Court, being an order ultimately directed to the protection of consumers. On the other hand, there is no evidence of consumers in fact having suffered actual prejudice by the offender’s conduct. Similarly, the contempt offences do not involve interference with the administration of criminal justice. These matters having been said, the deliberate defiance of the Court’s order constitutes the offenders’ conduct a serious offence. He has not expressed any contrition or remorse directly to this Court. 
     
      
    34 Section 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires that a sentence of imprisonment not be imposed upon an offender unless the Court is satisfied, having regard to all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. 
     
      
    35 Section 5(2) of that Act requires that a Court sentencing an offender to imprisonment for six months or less must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so, including its reasons for deciding that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. 
     
      
    36 I have taken into account the factors arising under s.21A of the Act which require attention in the circumstances of the present proceedings. I do not consider that there are any specific aggravating factors arising under s.21A(2) to which regard must be had. 
     
      
    37 I have had regard in this respect in particular to the following:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The offender’s expression of contrition to Mr Ikin. 
       
       
      (b) The offender’s prior history which includes offences under the  
      Motor Vehicle Repairs Act 1980 (NSW) 
       but does not, otherwise, however establish the offender as having a significant criminal history. 
       
       
      (c) The assessment of the offender as reflected in the pre-sentence report dated 25 April 2007. 
       
      
    38 I have considered the application of the provisions of s.5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In particular, s.5(1) provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    39 I have, as required, considered whether or not the defendant’s contempt may be appropriately punished by way of the imposition of a monetary penalty and whether or not appropriate punishment in the form of an order requiring the defendant to undertake community service work is appropriate. 
     
      
    40 In determining that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate, I have had regard to the wilful and persistent nature of the contempt committed by the defendant by the conduct to which I have referred and the absence of any evidence or material which mitigates the seriousness of that offence. The affidavit evidence of Kenneth Buscombe sworn on 7 March 2007 reflects the defendant’s attitude to the conduct constituting his contempt. On 1 March 2007, the defendant provided an undertaking to this Court (Exhibit D), inter alia, to refrain from undertaking any repair work as defined in s.4(1) of the Motor Vehicle Repairs Act 1980. Mr. Buscombe’s last-mentioned affidavit indicates that, on 6 March 2007, the defendant was undertaking motor vehicle repair work. The plaintiff does not seek a finding that the defendant was in breach of the undertakings given on 1 March 2007. I am, accordingly, aware of the limitation upon the use to which this evidence may be put, and, accordingly, simply note that it does not reflect any contrition on the defendant’s part and it does not augur well for his rehabilitation.  
     
      
    41 I have been provided with a number of what are said to be comparable cases involving contempt and I have derived particular assistance from them: Department of Fair Trading v O’Keefe [2002] NSWSC 398; Director-General of the Department of Fair Trading v Yang (2002) 132 A Crim R 438; Commissioner for Fair Trading v Oliver [2004] NSWSC 732; Commissioner for Fair Trading v Elasaad [2005] NSWSC 414; and Commission for Fair Trading v Partridge (supra). Ultimately, however, each case turns on its own facts and I must exercise my discretion in the present case upon the material which is before me.  
     
      
    42 The sentence to be imposed must reflect the law’s concern that the effectiveness of the courts in authoritatively determining disputes is not undermined by the deliberate defiance of orders which are made by them. Notwithstanding the matters which are properly to be taken into account in the offender’s favour, I am of the view that the criminality displayed by the offender warrants the imposition of nothing less than a custodial sentence. 
     
      
    43 The report of Mr Ikin does address sentencing options, in particular, as I have stated, the defendant’s suitability for supervision by the Probation and Parole Service, his suitability for a Community Service Order under s.86(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and his suitability for a periodic detention order in accordance with s.66(1) of that Act. 
     
      
    44 I have given close consideration as to whether or not a community service order is appropriate. The history in this matter reveals the defendant’s complete disregard for the law as expressed in the Motor Vehicle Repairs Act 1980. I do not consider a community service order would be appropriate, given the nature and the circumstances of the offence which I have earlier mentioned. 
     
      
    45 I am obliged to consider the issues of specific and general deterrence in determining the appropriate sentence. I am of the opinion, in particular, as far as specific deterrence is concerned, that a term of imprisonment is warranted. I have considered all possible alternatives and, having done so, I remain of the opinion that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. In that respect, I propose that the sentence to be imposed be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    46 I am of the opinion that the appropriate sentence is that the defendant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six months, the term of that sentence to commence from 11 May 2007, the defendant not having been in custody prior to today. I set a non-parole period of four months to commence on 11 May 2007 and to conclude on 10 September 2007. Such sentence is to be served, as I have stated, by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    47 In accordance with the provisions of s.66(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I am satisfied that:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The defendant is a person above the age of 18 years and is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of periodic detention. 
       
       
      (b) That it is appropriate in all the circumstances that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. 
       
       
      (c) That there is accommodation available at a periodic detention centre for the offender to serve the sentence by way of period detention. 
       
       
      (d) That the offender has signed an undertaking to comply with the offender’s obligations under the periodic detention order. 
      
     
     
      
      Orders 
      
    48 In respect of the charge of contempt, the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of four months to commence on 11 May 2007 and to expire on 10 September 2007, with a balance of term of two months to expire on 10 November 2007.49 I direct that the above sentence be served by way of periodic detention. I note that the offender has been assessed as suitable for periodic detention and has signed the requisite undertaking pursuant to s.66(1)(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.50 I direct the offender to report to Parramatta Periodic Detention Centre on Friday 11 May 2007 at a time to be advised by Sutherland Probation and Parole Service.51 I order that the offender pay the plaintiff’s costs.

       to cross-examine Emmanuel Aivaliotes concerning Exhibit C95, Tabs 11, 74 and 75 - see page 1326 of transcript)  
       
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: The Crown has called as a witness in its case Emmanuel Dimitrios Aivaliotes. In the course of evidence-in-chief of Mr Aivaliotes, application is made by the Crown under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 for leave to question Mr Aivaliotes as though the Crown was cross-examining the witness.  
     
      
    2 The Crown seeks leave to cross-examine Mr Aivaliotes about evidence that has been given by him that is “unfavourable” to the Crown (s.38(1)(a)) and about whether Mr Aivaliotes has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement (s.38 (1)(c)).  
     
      
       
      Exhibit C95, Tabs 11, 74 and 75 
       
      
    3 The application relates to three areas, being evidence given by Mr Aivaliotes concerning a number of documents which may be shortly described as Exhibits C95, Tabs 11, 74 and 75. It is not necessary, for the purpose of this ruling, to provide any detailed explanation of those documents. It is sufficient to say that these documents comprise, in each of Tabs 11 and 74, an application for an Advance Opinion and an Advance Opinion purportedly given on behalf of the Australian Tax Office. Tab 75 contains an application for a Private Ruling and the Private Ruling apparently given on behalf of the Australian Tax Office.  
     
      
    4 In each case, the Advance Opinion or Private Ruling shows, as the contact officer, the name of Mr Aivaliotes. However in Tab 11, his name is misspelt and appears in lower case type. In Tabs 74 and 75, his name appears in lower case type but is correctly spelt. These features are significant for the purpose of the present application.  
     
      
       
      Evidence of Mr Aivaliotes on 3 May 2007 
       
      
    5 In the course of the examination-in-chief of Mr Aivaliotes yesterday, in the presence of the jury, he was asked about the documents lying within Exhibit C95, Tab 11 (T1299.7-1301.1, 1301.48-1302.15): 
     
      
       
       
        
        “Q. Could I just go back then, somewhat out of order, to some of those rulings by asking you to look at documents which are part of exhibit C95 which follow the schedule, C94. Would you go to the first volume of those three comprising exhibit C95 and go to the document behind tab 11.  
         
        A. Yes, sir.  
         
         
        Q. Hopefully consistent with the schedule, that is a request dated 16 February 1998 from Productivity Incentive Australia?  
         
        A. Yes, sir.  
         
         
        Q. For an advance opinion for the Superannuation Retirement Plan No 1. Do you see that?  
         
        A. Yes, I do.  
         
         
        Q. There follows, I think, what appears to be an advance opinion dated 6 April 1998 for that plan. Do you see that?  
         
        A. Yes, I do.  
         
         
        Q. Did you issue that ruling?  
         
        A. Yes, I did.  
         
         
        Q. You note that you were shown as the contact officer?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. Is there anything about the format in which your name appears there which occurs to you?  
         
        A. Just my name is in lower case and there is a misspelling of my name.  
         
         
        Q. Do you normally misspell your name?  
         
        A. No, sir.  
         
         
        Q. What is your practice normally in terms of displaying your name as a contact officer?  
         
        A. I usually do it in capitals.  
         
         
        Q. Can you explain why your name is spelt incorrectly and in lower case?  
         
        A. The only thing I can offer is it was either my error not my error, sorry. Sometimes work comes in on disks and I may not have seen that or I was in a hurry.  
         
         
        Q. What do you mean work comes in on disks?  
         
        A. Well, it is the practice of lawyers and accountants with ruling applications to include a computer disk, and now that we have the facility they can send in what they consider in the body of the ruling they set out what they consider the ruling should be and we sometimes request that now by email as an attached file so that we can save ourselves a lot of work. We can make any changes we wish to the draft that they have sent.  
         
         
        Q. Back in 1998 what was the practice about supplying things on disk?  
         
        A. Some of the applications came in with computer disks attached.  
         
         
        Q. From whom?  
         
        A. From either the accountants or the lawyers concerned, and we had for that purpose on our floor what's called a disk transfer station so that you could transfer work from any disk you had on to the tax LAN.  
         
         
        Q. Did Productivity Incentive Australia send you material on disk?  
         
        A. I can't say for certain, sir, but I would say yes, that's more than possible.  
         
         
        Q. So what did you do when this application came in for an advance opinion for the superannuation retirement plan?  
         
        A. Well, as was my practice I looked through it all, I looked at the law, looked at academic texts, thought about the matters and then came up with what I thought was the correct view.  
         
         
        Q. What did you do then?  
         
        A. Well, produced this and fixed the stamp the Jim Killaly facsimile stamp.  
         
         
        Q. You are saying this came in with a disk?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. And when the disks came in, they actually had your name as contact officer so it would fit on to ATO letterhead, did it?  
         
        A. I think I may have reconstructed it. I'm not sure, sir, I am not sure how it was done. Once it is on the system we can change things around, as anyone can on computer. I'm sorry, sir, I don't have such a precise recollection of what occurred.  
         
         
        Q. Did the disk come in with the reference above your name on it, SIA/LB&I?  
         
        A. Again, I am sorry, I can't recall things from nearly 10 years ago.  
         
         
        Q. Just skimming the letter from Productivity Incentive Australia, in paragraph 5 on the first page it does contain this statement: ‘PIA respectfully requests that the wording of the advance opinion be in accordance with the enclosed draft opinion.’ Do you see that?  
         
        A. Yes, I do.  
         
         
        Q. I don't think we have the draft. Do you recall whether you made any changes to the draft opinion that was apparently forwarded with the correspondence?  
         
        A. No, sir, I can't recall anything like that. 
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you just look at the covering letter from Productivity Incentive Australia dated 16 February 1998 addressed to your attention. Do you see that?  
         
        A. Yes, sir.  
         
         
        Q. Your name appears there as Mr Emmanuel Aivaliotes, does it not?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. Is the spelling correct there?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. If we go to the ruling or the advance opinion dated 6 April 1998 where you are shown as contact officer E/Aivaliotes, is that spelling correct or incorrect?  
         
        A. Is this 6 April 1998? 
         
         
        Q. Yes.  
         
        A. It's E S at the end. It should be, rather, E S.  
         
         
        Q. And it is spelt I S?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. Do you know why the solicitors were able to spell it correctly in their letter but it doesn't appear correctly there?  
         
        A. I have no idea, sir.” 
        
       
      
    6 Soon after in examination-in-chief, Mr Aivaliotes was asked about the documents contained in Exhibit C95, Tab 74 (T1302): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can we move to volume 3 of exhibit 95. Can you go to the documents behind tab 74?  
         
        A. Sorry, the folder is bent. I have to do it in small parts so it doesn't fall apart. I don't want to risk that.  
         
         
        Q. Do you have any recollection of the application in this case dated 25 March 1998 submitted by Ashley Cain Pty Limited for an advance opinion for a Superannuation Retirement Plan No 1?  
         
        A. Well, looking at this, yes, some recollection.  
         
         
        Q. What is your recollection of the circumstances in which you received the application?  
         
        A. Again I can only say that I received it in one of the ways that I have spoken of.  
         
         
        Q. Then there is an advance opinion dated 18 December 1998. Do you see that?  
         
        A. I'm sorry, sir, what page does that begin on?  
         
         
        Q. It is behind the same tab. At the conclusion of the application there should be an advance opinion dated 18 December 1998.  
         
        A. Yes, sir, that's right.  
         
         
        Q. Did you produce that advance opinion?  
         
        A. Yes. Again I notice that my signature sorry, my name as contact officer is properly spelt, however, it is in the lower case.  
         
         
        Q. Were you in the practice of using lower case when you issued documents at the tax office?  
         
        A. Not generally, sir.  
         
         
        Q. Did you ever issue documents in lower case?  
         
        A. I may have, yes.“ 
          
        
       
      
      
     
      
    7 After that evidence had been given by Mr Aivaliotes, the Crown indicated that a matter of law arose as to which submissions should be made in the absence of the jury. Thereafter, the jury left the Court and the Crown made the s.38 application by reference to the evidence given by Mr Aivaliotes concerning Exhibit C95, Tabs 11 and 74.  
     
      
    8 It became apparent during submissions that the same issue would arise with respect to the documents contained within Exhibit C95, Tab 75. It was agreed by counsel, and I considered it to be the most appropriate course, that rather than basing any s.38 ruling upon a presumption as to what Mr Aivaliotes may say, the appropriate course was to take evidence from him on a voir dire in the absence of the jury.  
     
      
    9 Mr Aivaliotes was asked on the voir dire with respect to Exhibit C95, Tab 75 (T1310.5-1311.5): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr Aivaliotes, would you go to the documents behind the last tab in Volume 3 of Exhibit C95?  
         
        A. Is that number 75?  
         
         
        Q. 75, yes, which appears to comprise, firstly, an application by Ashley Cain Pty Limited dated 25 March 1998 marked for your attention?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. In relation to a private ruling for a noncomplying superannuation fund. Do you see that?  
         
        A. Yes, sir.  
         
         
        Q. Do you have any recollection of being involved in the processing of that application?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. What is your recollection?  
         
        A. Well sir, that I received it, and then processed it. I am sorry, did you want anything more specific than that, sir?  
         
         
        Q. Did you draft a response for the advance opinion, the private ruling?  
         
        A. Yes I believe so, sir.  
         
         
        Q. Would you look at that document which is behind the application, the same part of Exhibit C95, noting that it appears to be dated 18 December 1998 addressed to Mr Ashley Cain?  
         
        A. Yes, sir.  
         
         
        Q. Do you see that? Did you draft that response?  
         
        A. I think so, sir.  
         
         
        Q. Do you see how your name appears as contact officer?  
         
        A. Yes, I do.  
         
         
        Q. Does that indicate anything to you?  
         
        A. Well again sir, my name is in lower case.  
         
         
        Q. Does that indicate something to you?  
         
        A. Well, it stopped me. I think that was unusual for me but I can't say much more than that.  
         
         
        Q. Do you have any recollection of how you became aware of this ruling being issued?  
         
        A. I am sorry, how I became aware?  
         
         
        Q. Yes?  
         
        A. Um, no sir, I don't.  
         
         
        Q. Do you remember sending the ruling out?  
         
          
         
        A. Not specifically, no sir.  
         
         
        Q. Did Mr Petroulias have any involvement in the production or sending out of the ruling?  
         
        A. I am not sure sir, I am sorry.” 
        
       
      
    10 Thereafter, Mr Aivaliotes was stood down and the argument continued upon the basis that the Crown’s s.38 application applied to each of the three classes of evidence.  
     
      
       
      Evidence of Mr Aivaliotes at First Trial in May 2005 
       
      
    11 In support of the application, the Crown referred me to the examination-in-chief of Mr Aivaliotes at the first trial of the Accused before Sully J and the jury in 2005. That trial concluded with the jury unable to agree and with the jury being discharged.  
     
      
    12 It is appropriate for the purpose of this application, to set out extracts from the evidence-in-chief of Mr Aivaliotes at the first trial.  
     
      
    13 In examination-in-chief on 17 May 2005, Mr Aivaliotes was asked concerning Exhibit C95, Tab 11 (T871.45-872.21): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. The document which constituted the application is said to be dated 16 February 1998 and the opinion granted or made was on 6 April 1998. Would you just have a look at those documents? While the exhibit is coming perhaps I can ask you to look at the copies in the copy folder behind tab 11. Does that seem to be the application for the advance opinion on the Superannuation Retirement Plan No. 1? 
         
        A. Yes, it does, sir. 
         
         
        Q. Is there behind that the advance opinion of 6 April 1998? 
         
        A. Yes, that's right. 
         
         
        Q. Were you involved in processing that application and making that advance opinion? 
         
        A. No, sir, I wasn't. 
         
         
        Q. Does it bear your name or initials? 
         
        A. It does have my name as contact officer; however, it is in the lower case and my name is misspelt. 
         
         
        Q. In relation to the lower case in which your name is printed, what is the significance of that? 
         
        A. It was my habit to put my name in capital letters. 
         
         
        Q. Are you generally in the habit of spelling your name correctly? 
         
        A. Yes, that's right. 
         
         
        Q. So do you have any recollection of any involvement in the receipt of the application and the granting of the advance opinion? 
         
        A. No, sir, I don't.” 
        
       
      
    14 With respect to the documents contained in Exhibit C95, Tabs 74 and 75, Mr Aivaliotes was asked in-chief on 17 May 2005 (T877.18-878.11): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can I take you to the end of the schedule to item 74 and item 75. Item 74 refers to an application for an advance opinion for the Superannuation Retirement Plan No 1 by Ashley Cain Pty Limited dated 25 March 1998 and then an advance opinion on the Superannuation Retirement Plan No 1 dated 18 December 1998. Do you remember dealing with that application? 
         
        A. No, sir, I don't. 
         
         
        Q. Would you have a look at it? 
         
        A. Yes. Again, I'm sorry; it's number? 
         
         
        Q. Number 74.  
         
        A. No, sir, I don't remember. 
         
         
        Q. The advance opinion shows your name as contact officer, does it not? 
         
        A. Yes, it does. 
         
         
        Q. Is there anything about the form of that entry which is significant to you?  
         
        A. Again my name is not all in capitals. The surname has lower case to it; however, the spelling is correct. 
         
         
        Q. What does that indicate? That  
         
        A. I was not the producer of this, 
         
         
        Q. Did you become aware of the advance opinion at some stage when you were working in SIA? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
         
         
        Q. In what circumstances? 
         
        A. Mr Petroulias came to my workstation and handed it to me and asked me to file it. 
         
         
        Q. Then the last item on the schedule refers to an application for a private binding ruling for a non complying superannuation fund by Ashley Cain Pty Limited and the private binding ruling is dated 18 December 1998. Do you have any recollection of being involved in processing that application? 
         
        A. No, sir, I don't. 
         
         
        Q. Do the details of the contact officer on the ruling indicate anything to you? 
         
        A. Again the lower case is used, and the spelling is correct, which indicates to me that it's not my work. 
         
         
        Q. Do you have a recollection of becoming aware of the ruling during the time that you worked in SIA? 
         
        A. Yes. Mr Petroulias came to my workstation, handed this to me for filing.” 
        
       
       
      Is s.38(1) Triggered? 
       
      
    15 The Crown submits that there is a similar inconsistency between the evidence given by Mr Aivaliotes in his examination-in-chief concerning Tabs 11, 74 and 75 in May 2005 and that given by him in evidence yesterday. The Crown submits that each of s.38(1)(a) and (c) is engaged.  
     
      
    16 Mr Sutherland SC, for the Accused, does not submit to the contrary. He accepts that s.38(1) is triggered, in the sense that the evidence given by Mr Aivaliotes on the two occasions involves a prior inconsistent statement. Accordingly, the issue that falls to be determined is whether the Court, in the exercise of discretion, ought accede to the Crown's application under s.38. Mr Sutherland SC submits that the application should be rejected on discretionary grounds.  
     
      
    17 I am satisfied that s.38 (1)(a) and (c) are engaged by the inconsistency between the evidence given by Mr Aivaliotes in his examination-in-chief on these topics in May 2005 and yesterday.  
     
      
    18 I note that the word ""unfavourable"" in s.38 (1)(a) of the Act does not mean ""adverse""; it means ""not favourable"" to the Crown. In this respect, see the authorities gathered helpfully by Whealy J in R v Ronen [2004] NSWSC 1298 at [49]. 
     
      
       
      Relevant Statutory Provisions 
       
      
    19 The factors which bear upon the exercise of discretion where application is made under s.38 are not confined. However, there are express statutory factors referred to in s.38 (6) and s.192 Evidence Act 1995. In addition, I note that in R v Le [2002] 54 NSWLR 474 at 493 [90], Heydon JA (Dunford and Buddin JJ agreeing) observed that, in a s.38 application, the Court ought give consideration to s. 137 Evidence Act 1995, whether or not the parties make submissions with respect to that provision. 
     
      
       
      History of Mr Aivaliotes’ Evidence Concerning these Documents  
       
      
    20 Before turning to factors relevant to the exercise of discretion, it is appropriate to note the following aspects of the history of the evidence of Mr Aivaliotes concerning the documents in Exhibit C95, Tabs 11, 74 and 75, and the manner in which the Crown has sought to present its case on this question.  
     
      
    21 These proceedings have a long history extending back to committal proceedings in 2001 and an earlier trial in 2005.  
     
      
    22 Mr Sutherland SC has referred me, during submissions, to evidence given by Mr Aivaliotes in cross-examination at the committal proceedings and the first trial. He submits that a complete picture of the evidence of Mr Aivaliotes on these issues should result in the rejection of the Crown's application.  
     
      
    23 It appears that at the committal proceedings, in accordance with the practice under the then applicable Justices Act 1902, the evidence-in-chief of Mr Aivaliotes was contained in a statement. That statement has not been placed before me, but it is apparent that, to the extent that the statement touched upon the documents contained in Exhibit C95, Tabs 11, 74 and 75, what Mr Aivaliotes said was broadly consistent with his evidence-in-chief at the first trial in May 2005 (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). 
     
      
    24 So much is apparent from the committal proceedings transcript, at which Mr Richter QC, then appearing for the Accused, cross-examined Mr Aivaliotes challenging his account with respect to these documents. It is not necessary to incorporate in this judgment the parts of the cross-examination to which I have been referred. I note that I have been taken to pages 92-95 of the transcript of 20 November 2001 and pages 6-9 of the transcript of 21 November 2001.  
     
      
    25 The result of that cross-examination appears to be that Mr Aivaliotes accepted the possibility at least that he had been involved, in some way, in the issue of the Advance Opinions and the Private Ruling which are contained behind Exhibit C95, Tabs 11, 74 and 75.  
     
      
    26 At the first trial, the evidence-in-chief of Mr Aivaliotes is as I have set out earlier in this judgment (paragraphs 13 and 14). Whatever concessions had been made by Mr Aivaliotes in cross-examination at the committal proceedings, it is apparent that he maintained the position in his examination-in-chief at the first trial that he, for the reasons explained by him in his evidence, did not believe that he had been involved in the issue of the relevant Advance Opinions and Private Ruling.  
     
      
    27 Mr Aivaliotes was cross-examined concerning these documents at the first trial on 18 May 2005 concerning these documents by Mr Livermore, junior counsel then appearing for the Accused (T937.38 to 939.53): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I have a couple of questions for you about rulings you identified yesterday where the typing of your name was not consistent with your usual practice of typing your name out in capital letters as the contact officer.  
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Do you recall being shown some of those? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. The first one of those is behind tab 11 of the three folder volume of rulings. I'm not sure of the exhibit number. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: C95, I think. 
         
         
        LIVERMORE: Thank you, your Honour. 
         
         
        WITNESS: That is behind which tab?  
         
         
        LIVERMORE: Q. Tab 11, I think. This is the one that you identified as having your name in lower case and also a misspelling of your name? 
         
        A. Yes, that's right. 
         
         
        Q. It is for that reason alone, is it not, that you expressed doubts as to whether you prepared that ruling or not? 
         
        A. Yes, that's right. 
         
         
        Q. There is nothing else about the document to indicate to you that you did not prepare it.  
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. At some stage during the course of the investigation the police executed a search warrant on your house, didn't they, Mr Aivaliotes?  
         
        A. Yes, they did. 
         
         
        Q. And they seized a quantity of documents? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And you had at home a mixture of some Tax Office material being material that you had at your home because you had been working on particular matters from home, as you indicated in your evidence? 
         
        A. Yes, I was either working on that material or it was part of a statement that I made. 
         
         
        Q. One of the documents we are told was seized is this document and I'll ask you to compare this document with that one behind tab 11.  
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Can I suggest to you this possibility in relation well, first of all, the document that I've just handed you is a copy of that ruling behind tab 11.  
         
        A. Yes, without the part of the letterhead isn't there. 
         
         
        Q. What I want to suggest to you as a possibility is this, and you tell me if this is realistic or not, that the reason that that copy of that final draft of that ruling was found at your home was because you had been working on it, and that the reason for the spelling mistake may well be because the applicant, as was not uncommon, had provided you with a draft of the ruling they wanted and had included your misspelt name in lower case as the contact officer. Do you accept that's a possibility of how that ruling came to be issued? 
         
        A. Yes, I do. 
         
         
        Q. And the fact that you had a draft of that ruling at your house in your mind convinces you that you did actually prepare that ruling? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. The other two rulings are those behind tabs 74 and 75. Those were the ones I think you had doubts about because I think your name was spelt correctly but in lower case? 
         
        A. Sorry, sir, that was which tab? 
         
         
        Q. Tabs 74 and 75. I think they are rulings relating to Ashley Cain.  
         
        A. I've only got up to 25 here. 
         
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Could I see the document that was recently shown to Mr Aivaliotes?  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. It should be marked for identification. 
         
         
        MFI #36 DOCUMENT SHOWN TO WITNESS  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Mr Aivaliotes, what is it that you have been looking at, the material from behind tab 74 or tab 75, or both? 
         
        A. It is part of 75, your Honour, all in one. It's the request. 
         
         
        LIVERMORE: Q. Mr Aivaliotes, it is the fact that your name is in lower case on those rulings that leads you to suspect that you may not have been the author of those rulings.  
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Would you have a look at this document, please (shown)? Just read it to yourself, particularly the last paragraph on the first page.  
         
        A. Yes, I have read that. 
         
         
        Q. Do you now agree that you did produce those two rulings? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And the reason for your name being lower case may well have been the same reason that I indicated previously.  
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. The applicant may well have provided the draft with your name correctly spelt but in lower case.  
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And just so as not to keep the jury in the dark, the document you are looking at is a document that you wrote on 5 March 1999.  
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Where you indicated to your supervisor, Mr O'Neill, that you provided the Ashley Cain ruling?  
         
        A. Yes, it does, in that last paragraph.” 
        
       
      
    28 In this cross-examination, Mr Aivaliotes appears to have answered in a broadly similar way to his responses at committal proceedings in that he, when taken to various documents and when various propositions were put to him, accepted that he may well have been involved at least in the issue of the Advance Opinions and the Private Ruling.  
     
      
    29 Given an issue which has arisen during argument before me on this application, it is appropriate to note what was argued in closing submissions to the jury at the first trial and in opening to the jury in the present trial.  
     
      
    30 It is apparent from the transcript of the first trial that, on 30 June 2005 (T2667), the Senior Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury upon the basis that Mr Aivaliotes had stated that he had nothing to do with the three documents in question and pointed to the incorrect spelling and inappropriate use of lower case in his name as indicating that they were not his work.  
     
      
    31 In the closing defence address of Mr Clelland SC on 11 July 2005 (T2898-2899), the jury was understandably reminded of the concessions made by Mr Aivaliotes in cross-examination in this respect. Accordingly, issue was joined by the parties at the first trial on these matters. 
     
      
    32 In his opening address to the jury at this trial on 28 March 2007 (T126), the learned Senior Crown Prosecutor adverted specifically to this issue concerning the misspelling of the name ""Aivaliotes"". The Crown said (T126.20): 
     
      
       
       
        
        “I have mentioned this already as being one of the indicia used by Mr Aivaliotes to indicate to him that he hadn't issued some of the rulings himself, because of the way in which his name was printed.” 
        
       
      
    33 I am informed by the Crown that no conference took place between the Crown and Mr Aivaliotes prior to him being called to give evidence at this trial.  
     
      
    34 In the course of his evidence-in-chief yesterday, when asked similar questions to those asked in examination-in-chief at the first trial in May 2005, Mr Aivaliotes responded differently, and in significantly different respects, to his responses in evidence-in-chief at the first trial.  
     
      
       
      Consideration of Discretionary Factors 
       
      
    35 I turn to factors which are relevant to the exercise of discretion.  
     
      
    36 Section 38(6) nominates two factors, without limiting the factors which may be taken into account on a s.38 application. Section 38(6)(a) requires the Court to consider whether the party, in this case the Crown, gave notice at the earliest opportunity of its intention to seek leave.  
     
      
    37 The application for leave occurred in the manner which I have outlined, after Mr Aivaliotes had given certain answers yesterday. The absence of notice, it seems to me, does not bear in any significant way on the present application. Mr Aivaliotes had given evidence-in-chief at the first trial in accordance with that anticipated by the Crown and referred to, once again, in the Crown opening at this trial. Mr Aivaliotes gave that evidence, although he had been cross-examined at committal proceedings in a manner broadly consistent with the manner in which he was cross-examined at the first trial.  
     
      
    38 The issue having arisen in the way in which it did yesterday, it seems to me that the notice factor does not weigh heavily on the present application. Insofar as the defence has submitted that the Crown failed to confer with Mr Aivaliotes before giving evidence, and that this bears on the discretionary exercise, it does not seem to me that this factor carries any particular weight on the notice issue.  
     
      
    39 The matter was argued yesterday afternoon and counsel have had the opportunity overnight to consider the application and to advance such submissions as they saw fit.  
     
      
    40 I turn to s.38(6)(b), which requires the Court to take into account the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been or is likely to be questioned by another party. The particular issues which are the subject of this application are relatively confined. To the extent that s.38(6)(b) requires consideration of past questioning of Mr Aivaliotes at the committal proceedings and at the first trial and the likely future questioning at this trial, it does not seem to me that these matters operate against the Crown application. 
     
      
    41 I turn to s.192 Evidence Act 1995. This section is engaged, as the authorities make clear, because the Court is asked to give leave in this case to the Crown. Without limiting the matters which may be taken into account in the exercise of discretion, the Court is required to take into account under s.192 (2)(a), the extent to which the grant of leave would be likely to add unduly to or shorten the length of the hearing.  
     
      
    42 It is fair to say that the grant of leave is not likely to shorten the length of the hearing. The issues on the application in this case are relatively confined. This is not an application where (and no submission has been made to this effect) additional witnesses will be required to deal with this issue if the Crown's application is allowed and where because of those additional witnesses, the hearing would be unduly extended. The issue is essentially an internal one relating to the evidence of Mr Aivaliotes.  
     
      
    43 It is likely that there will be some extension to the hearing time if the application is allowed because of the time which the Crown will take in asking questions, and the additional cross-examination that may arise as a result. Although some extension of the hearing time would flow if the application is granted, in my view it is not an unduly lengthy extension and, in the context of this application, this factor does not operate against the application for leave.  
     
      
    44 Section 192(2)(b) requires the Court to consider the extent to which a grant of leave would be unfair to a party or to a witness. In this respect, Mr Sutherland SC submits that it would be unfair both to the Accused and to Mr Aivaliotes. He submits that the issue has the appearance of Mr Aivaliotes accepting, as his current view in this area of evidence, the account given by him in cross-examination at the first trial. He submits that to take him back to what he said in-chief, and to engage in further questioning in that respect by way of a grant of leave to the Crown, would be unfair to Mr Aivaliotes.  
     
      
    45 Mr Sutherland SC also submits that it would be unfair to the Accused. Mr Aivaliotes has, in his evidence in chief at this trial, said something different to his evidence in chief at the first trial, but there is some explanation for that and, in these circumstances, to allow the present application would operate unfairly to the Accused.  
     
      
    46 Mr Sutherland SC also submits that to accede to the Crown’s application would effectively allow it to depart from the case as previously particularised with respect to the first count. That count alleges a crime under s.29D Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and relevantly alleges that the Accused “defrauded the Commonwealth in that, while an officer of the Australian Taxation Office, he did put the revenue of the Commonwealth at risk by causing private binding rulings and advance opinions to issue to taxpayers by dishonest means.” 
     
      
    47 Mr Sutherland SC refers to particulars provided at an early stage in the litigation and contends that the Crown case has been that the Accused caused Mr Aivaliotes to issue the Private Binding Rulings and the Advance Opinions and not that (with respect to these three documents) the Accused himself issued them, albeit under the name or under the guise of Mr Aivaliotes.  
     
      
    48 Accordingly, it is submitted that to allow the present application would permit the Crown to depart from the case as particularised.  
     
      
    49 The Crown submits that there is no unfairness arising from the present application. Insofar as further evidence will emerge from Mr Aivaliotes if leave is granted, cross-examination of Mr Aivaliotes is the means by which the Accused may test the evidence.  
     
      
    50 Further, the Crown submits that it has consistently advanced evidence concerning the documents in Exhibit C95, Tabs 11, 74 and 75 through Mr Aivaliotes’ statement at committal, and his evidence-in-chief at the first trial. In the closing address to the first trial jury and in the opening address to this jury, the Crown has made clear its case with respect to these three documents, namely that Mr Aivaliotes was not involved in the issue of the Advance Opinions and Private Ruling but that, inferentially, it was the Accused who issued them directly.  
     
      
    51 The Crown submits that the concept of “causing” referred to in the first count is sufficiently broad to accommodate this variation, which has been clear in the Crown case for years and in no way could take the defence by surprise.  
     
      
    52 I have considered the submissions made with respect to the fairness issue. It does not seem to me that it would be unfair to Mr Aivaliotes to permit this application. He has given evidence, certainly in varied ways at different stages in these proceedings. This is a factor which is appropriately explored, in my view, and no unfairness arises to him.  
     
      
    53 With respect to suggested unfairness to the Accused, I am satisfied that the manner in which any suggested unfairness can be met is by the ability of the Accused to cross-examine Mr Aivaliotes. I note, in this respect, that the majority (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ) in Adam v The Queen [2001] 207 CLR 96 at 107 [30] observed, in the particular circumstances of that case, that there was no unfairness because the defence could test the evidence by cross-examination. The Accused can test the evidence of Mr Aivaliotes by cross-examination in this case.  
     
      
    54 Accordingly, I do not consider that any unfairness is demonstrated to the Accused or to Mr Aivaliotes.  
     
      
    55 Section 192(2)(c) requires the Court to consider the importance of the evidence in relation to which leave is sought. The Crown submits that this is important evidence. I am satisfied that it is. It will of course be a matter for the jury in due course to determine what conclusions may be reached by reference to it, but this is not a minor or passing aspect of the Crown case.  
     
      
    56 Section 192(2)(d) requires the Court to consider the nature of the proceedings. This is a criminal trial on indictment before a jury. The issues raised by this evidence are such that this aspect does not operate against a grant of leave.  
     
      
    57 Section 192(2)(e) does not seem to have any relevance to the present circumstances. 
     
      
    58 With respect to the s.38 application generally, I have considered the various discretionary factors which have been identified individually and collectively. In R v Parkes [2003] 147 A Crim R 450, at 464 [83] Ipp JA (Hulme and Bell JJ agreeing), referring to the question of unfairness for the purpose of s.38, observed that the grant of leave in that case led to the result that a “truer picture of the situation was presented to the jury than would have been the case had the Crown been refused leave to cross-examine”. His Honour observed that “this is the very purpose underlying s.38”. These observations have particular application in this case. 
     
      
       
      Section 137  
      Evidence Act 1995 
       
      
    59 It is necessary that I consider the terms of s.137 Evidence Act 1995. That section provides that, in criminal proceedings, the Court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. I take that section, in the present application, to involve consideration of the Crown's adducing evidence by way of cross-examination of Mr Aivaliotes with respect to what he said at the first trial. I note that Mr Sutherland SC did not advance a separate submission by reference to s.137, but relied upon the submissions which he made generally on the present application. 
     
      
    60 Having considered the matters raised on the application, I am not satisfied that the evidence which the Crown would adduce as a result of a grant of leave under s.38, would be such that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused. I do not propose to refuse the admission of the evidence by application of s.137. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    61 Accordingly, I am satisfied that the Crown should be granted leave under s.38(1) Evidence Act 1995 to question Mr Aivaliotes, as though the Crown was cross-examining him, about evidence given by him at the first trial with respect to the documents contained in Exhibit C95, Tabs 11, 74 and 75. The application by the Crown is allowed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I agree with Rothman J.  
     
      
    2 ROTHMAN J: The applicant, Samuel Kutchera, appeals against the sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Marien SC on 6 December 2006.  
     
      
    3 The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment being a non-parole period of nine months to commence on 6 December 2006 and to expire on 5 September 2007 and a balance of term of nine months to commence on 6 September 2007 and expire on 5 June 2008.  
     
      
    4 That sentence was imposed on the applicant after a plea of guilty to an offence under section 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) namely obtain valuable thing by deception the date of offence being 27 October 2004. The applicant had been on bail between 14 April 2005, the date he was charged, and the date of his sentence. The applicant, who was represented before Marien DCJ but was unrepresented before this Court seeks to appeal on two grounds. They are: 
     
      
       
      “(i) no pre-sentence report ordered to consider other sentencing alternatives; 
       
       
      (ii) failing to give sufficient weight to significant delay between the applicants charge and sentence with having regard to his rehabilitation during the period of 22 months on bail.” 
       
      
     In submissions to this Court the applicant requests that this Court order a pre-sentence report “to assist in reviewing the appeal against the severity of sentence imposed.” It is conceded that the period on bail was 20 months. 5 I will deal with the matters in order but before doing so, I need to briefly state the facts giving rise to the offence and make some comments on the remarks of Marien DCJ.  
     
      
    6 The essential facts were that the applicant together with others presented a stolen Commonwealth Bank cheque, which cheque was known to be stolen by the applicant, in order to obtain a motor vehicle being a $415,000 Lamborghini Gallardo. 
     
      
    7 There are a number of other aspects to the factual circumstance including unrelated issues associated with defrauding the revenue but it is not alleged that the applicant had any connection with that scheme.  
     
      
    8 One of the applicant’s co-conspirators was granted immunity in relation to this particular offence for the giving of evidence against the applicant and in the prosecution of other persons in the wider scheme to defraud the Office of State Revenue.  
     
      
    9 The intention of the applicant was to obtain the motor vehicle and sell it for an amount, presumably significantly discounted, and the money would then be shared between him and his co-offender.  
     
      
    10 To say that the plan was flawed is probably an understatement given that the registration of the car which they had purchased was not in the name of either the applicant or his co-offender and it would have been difficult if not impossible to transfer registration. Given that the car continued to be registered (which was part of the conspiracy to defraud the Office of State Revenue) in the name of the motor dealer, even an attempt to impersonate and/or forge the identity and signature of the owner would have been extremely difficult. But the impossibility of realising the profit is not an answer to the charge under section 178BA. Nor did the applicant attempt to defend the charge. As already stated, the applicant pleaded guilty and was given a significant discount for the utilitarian value of that plea of guilty. That discount was at the lower end of the range (ROS 17) because of the timing at which the guilty plea was made.  
     
      
    11 The sentencing judge took account of his plea of guilty and what his Honour described as genuine expressions of remorse and contrition.  
     
      
    12 His Honour came to the view, with some hesitation, that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend but, the hesitation was caused by the lack of rationality of a first time offender at the age of the applicant committing an offence of this kind. It was described by his Honour as “an ill conceived and naïve criminal enterprise” which was an expression (ROS 16) taken from the submissions of counsel representing the applicant except that counsel utilised the term “escapade” rather than “enterprise” (ROS 13).  
     
      
    13 The applicant is a US citizen having been born in New York and arrived in Australia in 1999. He was married to an Australian and divorced in 2004. There was, at the time of sentencing before his Honour a hope for reconciliation. The most likely explanation for an offence of this kind by a person who has no prior criminal record in New South Wales and, it seems, nowhere else, and is otherwise a man of good character, seems to have been the applicant’s view that his life had “fallen apart”.  
     
      
    14 Because the applicant is unrepresented on appeal I have examined more carefully than might otherwise be the case the proceedings below and the remarks on sentence to ascertain whether there is in any way a suggestion of error.  
     
      
    15 Judge Marien SC, who is an extremely experienced sentencing judge, has, on the face of his remarks, committed no error of principle in the sentencing process and, with one possible exception to which I will return, has given the applicant the benefit of all of the criteria he could in exercising his discretion.  
     
      
    16 Sentencing is an exercise of discretion. The normal restrictions on an appellate court to ground a review of the exercise of the discretion apply and the text book example is one relating to sentencing: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. Those restrictions require that an appellate court cannot merely substitute its opinion as to the appropriate sentence for that of the sentencing judge. There must be an error disclosed, whether identifiable or manifest. The error to be identifiable requires the application of a wrong principle or the misapplication of principle, an error of law or fact, the consideration of an irrelevant criterion, or the failure to consider a relevant one. None of those errors are disclosed in the sentence imposed on the applicant. Nor is the sentence imposed outside of the range available to his Honour and it does not disclose manifest error.  
     
      
    17 The sentencing judge correctly refused to take into account the use of a false instrument: De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 389.  
     
      
    18 However, his Honour did take into account the lack of planning or sophistication in the offence, the fact that there was, ultimately, no damage suffered and the vehicle was recovered. 
     
      
    19 The sentence is at the very low end of the range of sentences of imprisonment that could have been imposed.  
     
      
    20 The applicant essentially relies upon the failure by the sentencing judge to obtain a pre-sentence report. Pre-sentence reports are an important tool in the process of sentencing. In the present proceedings his Honour (transcript 6 December 2006, page 2) discussed with counsel for the applicant the need for a pre-sentence report and in the process of that discussion the following exchange occurred (transcript 6 December 2006, page 2-3): 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour: You’re requesting a presentence report? 
        
       
       
        
        [Counsel for the applicant]: I’m not requesting one but it’s a matter, as I said, for the court whether the court wants one as well but we’ll – their own report I should say but we’ll be I should say obtaining a background report.  
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: Are you able to say what your ultimate submission is going to be as to what the penalty should be? 
        
       
       
        
        [Counsel for the applicant]: I will be submitting that a full time custody would be appropriate but that it be suspended. Alternatively, perhaps your Honour might hear me on community service but given the amount of money involved.  
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: Then I would need a presentence report wouldn’t I? 
        
       
       
        
        [Counsel for the applicant]: I think that’s right your Honour even for a suspended sentence.  
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: I don’t know if it’s outside the realms of possibility but -- 
        
       
       
        
        [Counsel for the applicant]: I think it’s -- 
        
       
       
        
        [Crown]: Such a penalty as one my friend has intimated he would seek is within your Honour’s range and if that’s a matter which -- 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: What a community service order or suspended sentence? 
        
       
       
        
        [Crown]: No, suspended sentence.  
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: Yes. I obviously don’t need a presentence report for a suspended sentence but there was an indication of possibility of a submission for community service.  
        
       
       
        
        [Crown]: Your Honour would need a report for that.  
        
       
       
        
        [Counsel for the applicant]: I think that would be – I’d have to concede your Honour that would be fairly optimistic from the defence point of view but I think suspended sentence is certainly where we’re aiming at.  
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: It’s a matter for you. Are you asking for a pre-sentence report or not?  
        
       
       
        
        [Counsel for the applicant]: No, I’m not.  
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: You’re not, all right. I will obviously not be part heard in the matter, I’ve just taken the plea. So when do you want to go over to? … 
        
       
       
        
        [Counsel for the applicant]: I just spoke to my client and on the basis that I won’t be directing my submissions towards a community service order, we could proceed to sentence now. I can get the evidence that I would be going to get from a background report, I can get that from him in the witness box. It’s a matter for your Honour but I’d probably prefer an adjournment before I do that even if it just for half an hour but we can proceed to sentence – on that basis we can proceed to sentence today and the only reason I say that your Honour is because I haven’t taken any proof of evidence from him but I can – I mean it’s quite simple. I just wanted to give your Honour a bit of his background and that will only take ten or 15 minutes.” 
        
       
      
    21 It is obvious from the above exchange that his Honour was prepared to order a pre-sentence report (and grant an adjournment for that and other purposes) but that report was waived and the right to the adjournment waived by counsel on behalf of the applicant. In those circumstances it is inappropriate for the applicant to complain about the failure of his Honour to obtain a pre-sentence report.  
     
      
    22 A pre-sentence report must (see section 86 and section 80 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)) be obtained before a sentence of community service or home detention is imposed but otherwise it is a matter of discretion and practice bearing in mind the attitude of the parties.  
     
      
    23 It is usual for an adjournment to be made and an order issued for the preparation of a pre-sentence report because it is, as previously stated, a useful tool in the sentencing process, but it is always a discretion to be exercised judicially by the sentencing judge. In circumstances, such as here, where the applicant has, through his counsel, specifically requested that a pre-sentence report not be obtained because they oppose an adjournment, it was not an error for the sentencing judge to proceed. There was no possibility, given the nature of the offence in question, that the applicant would be ordered to serve his sentence by way of home detention.  
     
      
    24 The other grounds raised in the notice of appeal are wholly without merit.  
     
      
    25 The difficulty involved in sentencing has been the subject of much comment and the result of the exercise of a sentencing discretion will differ, within an applicable range, and still be correct. It is, as earlier stated, an exercise of discretion and while ever it is consonant with consistency of approach and accords with the statutory regime, as much flexibility as possible must be allowed: Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at 618[5]; Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 at [27].  
     
      
    26 It is this exercise of discretion which allows for the capacity of the court to tailor a sentence to the individual that is before it and the offence that has been committed. An experienced sentencing judge, such as Marien DCJ, balances overlapping and sometimes contradictory goals including deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation.  
     
      
    27 In the current proceedings the applicant relied upon the alleged “significant delay” between the charge and sentence. While there was initially some contest concerning the level of delay, it is accepted that there was a delay of 20 months between the date of the arrest and charging and the sentence before Marien DCJ. Such a delay is not, of itself, so extraordinary as to warrant appellate intervention. While any delay is regrettable, in this case the delay worked to the advantage of the applicant because he was able to show a return to what was his otherwise good behaviour. This Court commented on the question of delay and its effect in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517. At 519, Street CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Moreover, where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach — passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner.” 
        
       
      
    28 The above comments and approach have been endorsed by the High Court of Australia in R v Mill (1988) 166 CLR 59.  
     
      
    29 Nevertheless, as earlier stated, the amount of delay (20 months) is not such that it would ordinarily warrant consideration beyond that which Marien DCJ has given it. The sentencing judge took into account his good behaviour and the fact that the behaviour was out of character. The sentence was a less severe sentence than may have otherwise been imposed. The earlier remarks relating to sentencing being a balancing exercise must be reiterated. When dealing with deterrence, one must remember that it is not only aimed at the individual (specific deterrence) but general deterrence for the community at large.  
     
      
    30 During the course of the remarks on sentence Marien DCJ did not specifically mention the period between charge and sentence. During that period, the applicant was subject to conditional liberty. The conditions of reporting, when they existed, were not particularly onerous.  
     
      
    31 The applicant was admitted to bail by the Police when arrested on 14 April 2005. The conditions of that bail required daily reporting between 8am and 8pm, the surrender of his passport and therefore a restriction on his return home. On 13 May 2005 the reporting conditions were reduced to twice weekly and on 20 October 2005, the reporting condition was reduced further to a requirement to report only once per week (each Tuesday). While there may have been one technical breach of the bail condition which warranted no further action, those conditions remained in force until 29 March 2006. On that date, reporting conditions were deleted. He then remained on conditional liberty, without the need to report, until the date of his sentence, 6 December 2006.  
     
      
    32 During the course of the oral argument before the Court the applicant relied upon an alleged agreement with the Crown as to the severity of the sentence to be imposed. That agreement has not been properly proven, or proven at all. It cannot be taken into account in these proceedings and could not have been taken into account by the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    33 Assuming, without deciding, that the belief in such an agreement infected the plea, it is a matter that can affect only the plea and that is not an issue in these proceedings. While sentencing after a plea of guilty may sometimes involve a degree of informality, the system of justice operating in this State requires that it is the prosecutor, and the prosecutor alone, who decides the charge to be preferred against any accused. Further, it is the accused, only, who decides whether to plead to any charge. Further, it is the sentencing judge, and only the sentencing judge, that decides the sentence to be imposed: GAS v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198. It is both inappropriate and improper for the Crown and the accused to purport to reach agreement as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed. I am not suggesting that such an agreement was reached in this case. Further, I do not suggest that the Crown were even aware of such a suggestion until this appeal. Further still, there is no suggestion that the sentencing judge was aware of any such agreement or any understanding as to the nature of the sentence to be imposed.  
     
      
    34 Lastly, the request for this Court to order a pre-sentence report is misconceived. The use of such a report would arise only if and when the Court would otherwise move to re-sentence. Since, I am not persuaded that intervention is appropriate, a pre-sentence report is not now useful.  
     
      
    35 The terms of the document sought to be relied upon recite that “the Crown will not be asking for a penalty of more severity than an 11 month suspended gaol term” on the plea. In fact, the Crown did not submit to the contrary to his Honour.  
     
      
    36 As earlier expressed, the subjective circumstances of this applicant are to his credit. He spent 20 months under conditional liberty and, but for this offence, the whole of his life without ever being involved in criminal activity or otherwise coming to the attention of the police. While the offence was serious, and the value of the motor vehicle significant, it was, ultimately, the non-violent stealing of a motor vehicle in circumstances where the motor vehicle was returned to its owners in the same condition. He has the support of family, employment and an otherwise exemplary life. His Honour described him as having “an exemplary character in the past”.  
     
      
    37 The seriousness of the offence required a custodial sentence. But a custodial sentence does not necessarily mean a full-time custodial sentence and does not eliminate the possibility of a suspended sentence. A suspended sentence is not an alternative to the imposition of a custodial sentence: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 (per Howie J, with whom Hodgson JA and Levine J agreed). A sentence cannot be suspended until it has been imposed. A suspended sentence is the suspension of the execution of the sentence and is not, therefore, classified as a non-custodial term. The suspension of the sentence also means that the offender continues on conditional liberty and any breach of the law will result in the imposition of the sentence originally imposed and the suspension ceasing.  
     
      
    38 The sentencing judge considered these aspects. As one would expect, his Honour referred to the judgment of Kirby J in Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321. In dealing with the matters to be taken into account in determining whether a sentence should be suspended, Kirby J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first is the primary determination that a sentence of imprisonment, and not some lesser sentence, is called for. The second is the determination that such term of imprisonment should be suspended for a period set by the court. The two steps should not be elided. Unless the first is taken, the second does not arise. It follows that imposition of a suspended term of imprisonment should not be imposed as a ‘soft option’ when the court with the responsibility of sentencing is ‘not quite certain what to do’.” ( 
        Dinsdale 
        , per Kirby J at [79]) 
        
       
      
    39 In Dinsdale¸ Kirby J classified the approach of the Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal as too narrow in the reasons for suspending a sentence for imprisonment. His Honour referred to the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal had addressed their attention, mainly and specially, to the question of the appellant’s rehabilitation. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In this, with respect, the focus which he adopted was too narrow. The primary judge, on the other hand, had looked at the matter more broadly. He was obviously influenced in his decision about suspension by the prospects of rehabilitation on the part of the appellant, which he regarded as promising. But he also appears to have been influenced by all the circumstances and information available, including the nature of the particular offence, the low likelihood of the appellant’s re-offending, and the impact which a prison sentence, immediately served, would have on the appellant and his family. The primary judge also mentioned the ‘social stigma’ which necessarily followed the conviction, quite apart from a prison term. In my view, all of these were considerations available and proper to the decision of whether or not to suspend the term of imprisonment.” ( 
        Dinsdale 
        , per Kirby J at [88]) 
        
       
      
    40 The sentence imposed by his Honour was within range. Indeed, but for the unique subjective factors that tell against condign punishment and specific deterrence, the sentence would be light. However, in these peculiar circumstances, as the Crown’s submissions below makes clear, a suspended sentence was also within range. Below, the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour: Yes, Mr Crown. It’s been conceded that a custodial sentence is appropriate but [counsel for the applicant] submits that it could be suspended.  
        
       
       
        
        [Crown]: My submission would be that that is not outside the range although the range is something very difficult to ascertain with these types of offences …” 
        
       
      
     [The Crown continued with an analysis of the subjective and objective elements for and against the applicant and had previously referred to the suspended sentence being within range (Transcript p. 2).]41 In dealing with the capacity of the Court to suspend the sentence, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have carefully considered the submissions of Mr Trevallion and whilst I accept that there is a low likelihood of the appellant re-offending, in my view the nature of the particular offence and the circumstances in which it was committed effectively in my view take the offence outside a proper exercise of sentencing discretion by suspension, if I have not made that clear which I suspect I have not. In my view, to suspend this sentence would be an erroneous exercise of my sentencing discretion and that is principally because of the nature of the particular offence here before me and the circumstances in which it was committed. The nature of the offence I have described I have taken into account all the objective factors relevant to its assessment which Mr Trevallion has referred to. But as I say at the end of the day the case relates to a very valuable item. In my view, the community would be affronted if in relation to an offence relating to an item so valuable that the matter was to be or the sentence was to be a suspended sentence only.” (Remarks on Sentence p. 20) 
        
       
      
    42 To describe, as did his Honour, the suspension of the custodial sentence imposed as being “an erroneous exercise of my sentencing discretion” and as “outside a proper exercise of sentencing discretion” is to treat a suspended sentence in his case as outside the range available. As I have made clear, it was not outside the range, as the Crown conceded.  
     
      
    43 To preclude consideration of an available outcome is an error of law. To treat a suspended sentence as an unavailable result, when it is within range, is an error capable of being remedied on appeal. His Honour has erred in treating the suspension of the sentence as out of range.  
     
      
    44 The above should not be taken as a counsel of perfection. This Court is not unmindful of the pressures on District Court judges and it is not appropriate to comb through remarks on sentence or judgments, especially those delivered ex tempore, looking for infelicitous expressions. However, there is a fundamental difference of approach between a determination, in the circumstances of a particular case, not to suspend even though it is within range and the determination of a sentence on the basis that, after “carefully considering” submissions, a suspended sentence would be “outside a proper exercise” or an “erroneous exercise” of the discretion available. I find error and I am required to deal with the provisions of section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  
     
      
    45 It is insufficient, of itself, to show an error in sentencing. The Court must form the opinion that “some other sentence; whether more or less severe, is warranted.” 
     
      
    46 Once there is error (either manifest or identifiable) such as to enliven the jurisdiction of the Court to overturn an exercise of discretion, the statutory requirement imposed by section 6(3) must be satisfied: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79]; R v Boulghourgian (2001) 125 A Crim R 540 at [34].  
     
      
    47 As is clear from that which follows I am of the view that a lesser sentence is and was warranted, being a sentence his Honour precluded himself from imposing.  
     
      
    48 This is a most unusual, if not peculiar, situation. Were I sentencing afresh, I may have imposed a longer sentence than that which was imposed by his Honour but subjected it, on the information we now have available, to an alternative other than full-time custody. Because I am sitting on appeal, I do not intervene in the length of the sentence. I bear in mind that the applicant has in fact served most of the sentence imposed. In all of the circumstances of this particular and peculiar appeal, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) leave to appeal be granted; 
       
       
      (ii) appeal be granted in part; 
       
       
      (iii) the sentence imposed by his Honour Marien DCJ be confirmed save and except that the execution of the whole of the sentence be suspended until 5 June 2008 and that the applicant be released from custody on condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond for a term expiring on 5 June 2008.  
       
      
    49 The effect of the above order is that the applicant is entitled to immediate release upon entering into a good behaviour bond. However, if, prior to 5 June 2008, he breaches that good behaviour bond, he will be required to serve the remainder of his sentence.  
     
      
    50 HARRISON J: I have read the judgment of Rothman J in draft. I agree with both his Honour's reasoning and conclusions. I only wish to add a few brief remarks of my own. 
     
      
    51 At page 20 of his Remarks on Sentence (quoted in full by Rothman J at [40] above), his Honour Judge Marien SC said that ""the nature of the particular offence and the circumstances in which it was committed effectively take the offence outside a proper exercise of sentencing discretion by suspension"". He went on to say ""to suspend the sentence would be an erroneous exercise of my sentencing discretion"". As Rothman J has observed at [41], his Honour appears, by the use of those words, to have treated a suspended sentence in this case as outside the available range of sentencing options. 
     
      
    52 In my opinion, the words used by his Honour strongly indicate that he actually foreclosed on the possibility that a suspended sentence was within the range of permissible options. It seems to me that this follows from his Honour's emphasis upon a suspended sentence being outside a proper exercise of the discretion that he had, and upon the fact that it would have been an erroneous exercise of his sentencing discretion, rather than upon the fact that it was a sentencing option available to him, but one which, in the proper exercise of his discretion, he determined not to impose. 
     
      
    53 There can be no doubt that it was open to his Honour to impose a suspended sentence upon the applicant if he had thought, in the circumstances of the case, that it was appropriate to do so. Correspondingly, there can be no doubt that it was equally open to his Honour to impose a sentence of which no part was to be suspended. However, if in the course of imposing a sentence, a judge exposes, in his Remarks on Sentence or otherwise, a process of reasoning which arguably has had the effect of erroneously excluding from his available choices a particular outcome that he should not have excluded, this will amount to an error of law that is amenable to correction by appeal to this Court. In my opinion, this has occurred in the present case. 
     
      
    54 I have had regard to the provisions of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. I agree that some other, less severe, sentence is warranted.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Ian Robert Chalmers appears for sentence today on two matters. The first and most important results from him being found guilty by a jury on one count of conspiring to import a commercial quantity of cocaine. The maximum penalty for that offence is life imprisonment. 2 He is also to be sentenced following his plea of guilty to an offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of 4.45 grams of ecstasy. The maximum penalty for that offence is fifteen years imprisonment. 3 I immediately note that the crown has suggested that an appropriate way for dealing with the State matter is by the imposition of a wholly concurrent sentence, given the gravity of the Commonwealth matter and the sentences imposed on the co-offenders in relation to the State matter.4 As far as the more serious Commonwealth matter is concerned, the offender had a long-term friend by the name of Sean North. In October 2004 he was involved in the successful importation into Australia of a substantial quantity of cocaine. Emboldened by that success, Mr North and others decided to repeat the operation, this time bringing into Australia a larger quantity of cocaine, namely thirty kilograms. The offender was not involved in the October 2004 importation but was, as the jury verdict clearly shows, involved in the latter operation.5 The method which the conspirators used in October 2004, and proposed to use in early 2005 was this - a courier or “walker” would travel from Australia to a South American location. There he would be given a suitcase containing the cocaine. When he returned to Australia he would check the bag in and travel on the same flight back to Sydney. Once he got to Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport, however, he would not clear customs. Instead he would transfer to an interline flight, which is a service whereby a passenger can travel domestically on an international flight.6 In the case of the October 2004 importation, the courier travelled from Sydney to Brisbane. In the case of the later operation involving this offender, the courier was to travel from Sydney to Melbourne. This interline transfer would mean that the courier’s bags would have to be unloaded from one aircraft and transferred to another aircraft, both aircraft travelling as international flights.7 The suitcase containing the drugs, however, would not be transferred to the second aircraft. Instead, baggage handlers who were involved in this criminal scheme would divert the suitcase with the drugs in it and remove it from the airport without it having to clear customs. This scheme obviated the need for the courier to have to walk through customs with a bag containing twenty or thirty kilograms of cocaine. The fact that the scheme involved corrupt baggage handlers became quite significant during the course of the trial.8 The offender’s role was to obtain and pay for the courier’s tickets. It was he who booked the courier’s flights from Sydney to Buenos Aires and return. He also booked the interline flight taking the courier from Sydney to Melbourne. Intercepted telephone calls revealed the offender making those arrangements with a friend of his - Bob Nicholl, who was a travel agent in Wyong.9 The accused was quite insistent that the tickets he booked had to include the flight from Sydney to Melbourne, and rejected without hesitation a suggestion from Mr Nicholl that an itinerary involving a direct flight from Auckland to Melbourne would be preferable. The offender of course rejected that suggestion because he knew the importance of the courier travelling through Kingsford Smith Airport, where he knew the corrupt baggage handlers were waiting.10 The telephone calls intercepted by police also revealed the efforts that the offender went to in order to obtain the ticket itself. Once having got the ticket he gave it to Mr North, so it could in turn be supplied to Mr Tyler, the courier. The accused claimed that he had no knowledge of Mr North’s activities as a drug importer until very late in the piece, but that assertion was clearly contradicted by the contents of the telephone calls.11 In particular, there was a telephone call made when Mr North was in South America, at a time when a great deal of publicity was being given to Shappelle Corby’s trial in Indonesia, and to the suggestion in that trial that there were corrupt baggage handlers at Sydney Airport. In the call between Mr North and the offender, the latter makes reference to “that bird in Indonesia” and says that ”they’ve traced it back to airport personnel”, which, despite the accused’s evidence in the witness box, can only be a reference to the corrupt baggage handlers. This was important because it revealed the accused’s knowledge of the precise plan for getting the cocaine into Australia.12 The crown case against the offender was a remarkably strong one. The accused had no satisfactory explanation, and at times no explanation at all, for many of the incriminating features of the intercepted telephone calls. The cross-examination by the crown prosecutor was particularly effective in demonstrating that the exculpatory version of events offered by the offender was, in the light of the contents of the telephone calls, fanciful.13 It is to be remarked upon that even now the offender maintains his innocence. He is not to be punished for that, of course, but the absence of any remorse for what the offender has done is a striking feature of this case. There is no acceptance of his responsibility for his criminal activities, apart of course from the plea of guilty to the relatively minor state matter.14 One of the factors which Mr Spencer relied on when addressing the jury was the absence of any evidence from the crown as to why it would be that a person like Mr Chalmers would get himself involved in the importation of a large quantity of cocaine. Given the accused’s relatively minor involvement in the overall operation, he could not have expected to obtain a great deal of money, or if he was to be paid in drugs, a terribly significant share of what was actually imported.15 One of the issues that has been addressed today concerned the benefit, if any, that the offender was going to receive from his involvement in this criminal conspiracy. The evidence at trial tended to suggest that he owed some money to Mr North, and that one way of repaying it was for the offender to obtain the airline tickets. There is no evidence that the offender was going to get any benefit, but by the same token there was equally no evidence that the offender had no expectation of receiving a benefit once the scheme achieved its objectives. 16 The offender was a drug user at the time he committed these offences. It would not have at all been surprising if the offender did have an expectation of receiving money or drugs once the large quantity of cocaine was imported. 17 Fortunately for the Australian community, police were well aware of what was going on. They had the accused, North, Tyler and many others involved in the scheme, under surveillance. The importation was never going to succeed and Mr Tyler flew back to Australia empty-handed.18 As I mentioned, the quantity of drugs that the conspirators hoped to import was around thirty kilograms. There is no evidence that the offender knew the precise quantity of drugs which were to be imported. The offender has been found guilty of involvement in a conspiracy involving a commercial quantity of cocaine, and so I am to sentence him on the basis that that involved the importation of more than two kilograms.19 Clearly, the offender would have realized that the scheme involved the importation of a substantial quantity of drugs from overseas. One does not involve many co-conspirators in a scheme involving international flights from South America and corrupt baggage handlers only to import insignificant quantities of drugs.20 I cannot say precisely what was in the offender’s mind as far as the quantity of drugs involved is concerned, but I can say, and say beyond reasonable doubt, that he well knew that a significant, substantial quantity of drugs was to be brought into the country.21 The offender was born in 1964. His parents separated when he was about fifteen and his mother formed a new relationship. That relationship, as far as the offender was concerned, was not a happy one. 22 The offender completed both high school and then a Bachelor of Commerce degree before moving to London, where he worked in the finance area for a number of years. He was very successful at what he did. The references tendered to me today suggested that he was an effective stockbroker who performed his job very well. Evidence at trial made it obvious that the offender had been successful, insofar as he lived an enviable lifestyle.23 The offender separated from his wife on a number of occasions before finally splitting up in 2002. It seems that leading up to and after that separation the offender became involved in drug use. The material suggests that he commenced using cocaine whilst in London, one of the reasons being no doubt, that he was earning so much money that he could afford to use drugs, and use them to excess.24 The material also suggests that the offender has for a number of years suffered from bipolar disorder. On top of that, once his marriage ended he entered a period of depression. Those factors tend to suggest that when he was approached by North with the proposal that he involve himself in this criminal conspiracy, he was less able than others to respond rationally to that invitation.25 The offender has no prior criminal convictions, and indeed there is material suggesting that he has done things in the past which are of benefit to various charities.26 As far as his character is concerned, however, I do note, as I noted earlier, his complete absence of any acknowledgment of having involved himself in this criminal conspiracy. And I note, also, that it was not submitted on the offender’s behalf that he was a man of otherwise good character.27 The crown today proposed to tender some material which, it suggested, would enable me to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had become involved in cocaine supplies. The crown wished to adduce that evidence to respond to any suggestion by Mr Spencer that these two matters for which I am to sentence the offender represent his only breaches of the law. When Mr Spencer indicated that he was not going to invite me to make that finding, the crown recognized the absence of a need to proceed with what it proposed.28 I should at this stage make reference to the issue of parity. Mr Tyler, who was the proposed courier, received a substantial discount for assistance and a plea of guilty. He received a sentence of nine years. Mr Chandler, who went to South America with Mr Tyler, received a period of imprisonment of ten years. The co-offenders in the State offences got suspended sentences. 29 I should emphasize that the law in relation to parity in sentencing is a law which only works one way, that is to the benefit of an offender. I have to ensure that the offender does not have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed upon him with the sentences imposed on others. The crown cannot claim it has a justifiable sense of grievance if there is disparity in sentencing. Instead, the crown is able to rely on the sentences imposed on Tyler and Chandler as sentences indicating the appropriate tariff for such conduct.30 The crown has made its position clear, when I assess the sentence to be imposed on this offender after comparing the sentence imposed on Tyler and Chandler. It makes some calculations involving Tyler’s assistance to the authorities, and says that I should impose a sentence in the order of fifteen years upon this offender.31 So differently do I view the position, that I have anxiously considered and reconsidered my approach. The crown’s submission is that the offender played a role at least equal to and perhaps even more important than the courier - Tyler - and the man who went to South America with him. I just cannot see that that is the case. 32 It is a very important factor to be borne in mind that people are to be sentenced for what they do. In this case the offender’s involvement was relatively limited. It was he who obtained the ticket for the courier. He did not travel overseas in the expectation that he would return with a substantial quantity of drugs in a suitcase. He did not get involved deeply with other co-conspirators. The only person he spoke to, I repeat, was North. He did not perform a role that required any particular gall or bravado.33 It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that the sentence must reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. I am satisfied that the offender’s conduct placed him at a significantly lower level than that of others who have been sentenced for their part in this conspiracy. 34 That is, of course, not to say that the offender’s conduct is minor or undeserving of substantial punishment. It clearly is a most serious criminal activity to become involved in a conspiracy to import a large quantity of drugs. Any involvement in that conspiracy is serious and deserving of significant punishment.35 The offender has assisted the authorities. I will say little about it, beyond noting that not much came of the offender’s assistance. In those circumstances, I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by approximately ten per cent. It may be that the assistance is one of the reasons that it is likely that the offender will spend further time on protection. He went into protection upon his arrest after it was suggested to him. It may be that his notoriety was one of the reasons, if not the reason, that it was suggested to him that it would be appropriate that he serve his sentence on protection. However, it is no longer the law that I should assume that everyone serving a sentence on protection does his time harder than those serving their time in the general prison population. The conditions of the offender’s protection are only made known to me by way of a hearsay statement in a report, and of course those conditions may change.36 In deciding the appropriate sentence, however, I will bear in mind that there is a risk that the offender will serve part or indeed all of his sentence on protection, and there is a risk that those conditions of custody will be harsher than would have been the case if the offender had served his sentence in the general prison population.37 There is a very important need to impose a sentence on the offender which contains a substantial component of general deterrence. The amount of money which can be made through the sale and distribution and importation of drugs is enormous. This conspiracy, of which I heard evidence, shows how relatively easy it was for a large number of people to decide to do something seriously criminal. I know about the men who were referred to in the evidence in the trial, and I know that there were other corrupt baggage handlers in on the scheme as well. The size of the conspiracy itself indicates the ease with which members of the community decide to involve themselves in an activity that all right-thinking members of the community regard as gravely criminal. And no doubt it is the profits to be made through drug importation and sale which is what persuades such large numbers of people to do that. For that reason, when people are detected, people such as the offender, and convicted of such offences, significant and indeed even harsh sentences of imprisonment are required.38 For those reasons these are the sentences I will impose. For the offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely ecstasy, that is the state offence, the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for one year. That will commence on 21 July 2006. It is agreed that that is the appropriate date on which to commence the sentence, to reflect a short period of custody before the appellant was granted bail. It is a fixed term because of the sentence I will now impose on the commonwealth matter.39 For the offence of conspiring to import a commercial quantity of cocaine, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for five and a half years. I set a non-parole period of three and a half years. That is also to commence on 21 July 2006 and expire on 20 January 2010.40 Mr Chalmers I am required to explain the sentence to you. What I have done is backdate your sentence to 21 July 2006, which is thirty-eight days before you actually went into custody following the jury’s verdict, because you had earlier spent thirty-eight days in custody. You are therefore to spend a further period in custody totalling three and a half years which will expire on 20 January 2010. You are eligible to be released to parole on that date. If you are released to parole you will continue serving your sentence in the community. If you fail to comply with the conditions of parole, you can be returned to custody and required to serve the balance of your sentence, which will all expire on 20 January 2012.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Campbell JA. 
     
      
    2 HODGSON JA: I agree with Campbell JA. 
     
      
    3 CAMPBELL JA: The appellants, Mr Nakhl Nasr and Mr George Nasr, are father and son. On Thursday, 26 October 2000 they were both arrested by police officers, taken to Burwood Police Station, and held there for around 6½ hours (a little less in the case of Mr Nakhl Nasr) before being released on bail. The charges that had been made concerning each of the men at the time of their arrest were ultimately withdrawn. 
     
      
    4 The appellants each brought an action against the State of New South Wales seeking damages for assault, false imprisonment and negligence alleged to have been committed by police officers at the time of the arrest and subsequent detention of each appellant. The State was sued on the basis (which it accepted) that it was vicariously liable for any tort that the police officers might be found to have committed. Her Honour Judge Balla heard the two actions together, over a period of 17 days from 23 May to 17 June 2005. She gave reasons for judgment on 28 November 2005, pursuant to which a verdict for the defendant was entered in each action. The present appeals are from that decision. 
     
      
    5 There are some uncontroversial facts concerning the incident on 26 October 2000. Ten police officers – Sergeant Craig Bennett, Constable James Taylor, Constable Brett Van Akker, Constable Gavin Dick, Constable Johnny Tadinac, Constable Cathy Gibson, Constable Amanda Bliss, Constable Peter Hilton, Constable Christopher Louis and Senior Constable Simon Telfer – were in Shakespeare Street, Campsie soon after 6:05 pm for a purpose unconnected with the appellants. Constables Gibson and Bliss left briefly. While the other police officers were still there, Sergeant Bennett noticed a truck that was driven by Mr Nasr Nasr (another son of Nakhl Nasr, and a brother of George Nasr). That vehicle was owned by Nasr Tiling Pty Ltd, a company of which both George and Nasr Nasr were then directors. Sergeant Bennett motioned to the vehicle to move towards him. It did so, and Sergeant Bennett indicated for the vehicle to stop, which it did. Nasr Nasr was of the opinion that the police were going to “defect” the vehicle. Soon afterwards, he telephoned George Nasr and asked him to come to Shakespeare Street. George Nasr was at his parents’ home, which was very close to Shakespeare Street. He left immediately to drive to Shakespeare Street, and was followed by his parents in another vehicle. 
     
      
    6 Soon after Nakhl and George Nasr arrived at the scene, each of them was sprayed with capsicum spray by Constable Taylor, and arrested. 
     
      
    7 Nakhl Nasr was charged with affray (Section 93C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900), refusing to comply with a direction given by a police officer in accordance with Section 28F(5) of the Summary Offences Act 1988, resisting officers in the execution of their duty (Section 58 of the Crimes Act), hindering Sergeant Bennett, and Constables Taylor and Van Akker in the execution of their duty (Section 546C of the Crimes Act) and carrying a cutting weapon (Section 353B of the Crimes Act). 
     
      
    8 George Nasr was charged with affray (Section 93C(1) of the Crimes Act), refusing to comply with a direction given by a police officer in accordance with Section 28F(5) of the Summary Offences Act 1988, resisting officers in the execution of their duty (Section 58 of the Crimes Act), and hindering Sergeant Bennett, and Constables Taylor and Van Akker in the execution of their duty (Section 546C of the Crimes Act). 
     
      
    9 Her Honour’s rejection of the appellants’ case was in large measure attributable to her preferring the evidence of the various police witnesses to the evidence of the appellants, and of their niece/cousin Maggie Nasr. The appellants submit that there were errors in the process by which her Honour came to those views about credibility that significantly undermine the credibility findings. 
     
      
       
      Position of Nasr Nasr’s Vehicle, Speed of Nasr Nasr’s Driving and Other Events Before Appellants’ Arrival 
       
      
    10 Her Honour said, concerning evidence about events at Shakespeare Street shortly before Nakhl and George Nasr arrived on the scene: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was lengthy evidence and detailed submissions from counsel for the plaintiffs as to the position of Nasr Nasr’s vehicle, the speed at which Nasr Nasr must have been driving and the sequence of the following events. I am not persuaded that any of these matters are relevant in any way to any issue to be determined by me.” 
        
       
      
    11 The appellants submit as their first ground of appeal, that her Honour should have considered that evidence expressly in her judgment, because of the light that it throws upon the credibility of Constable Van Akker and Sergeant Bennett.  
     
      
    12 Nasr Nasr gave evidence that he stopped the truck he was driving at the time on the corner of Brighton Avenue and Shakespeare Street to talk to his cousin Maggie whom he had seen on the footpath there. He took his seatbelt off while he was parked there. A policeman, who he saw in Shakespeare Street, signalled him to come forward, so he drove the vehicle slowly, in “just a normal way of driving a vehicle” up to the police officer, and stopped in front of him. The police officer asked for his licence, and asked him to step out of the truck, and while he was stepping out of the truck the door was slammed on his feet.  
     
      
    13 By contrast, the evidence of Constable Van Akker and Sergeant Bennett created a picture of the truck being parked at the corner, being called up, the driver revving the motor as the truck approached, Sergeant Bennett having some doubt about whether the driver would stop, and the driver then stopping abruptly. According to them, the driver flung the door of the truck open, and the door struck Constable Van Akker in the thigh. Even before opening the door, according to these two police witnesses, the driver had declined to produce his driver’s licence when asked, and told Sergeant Bennett “you’ve started a war now”. After getting out from his vehicle, the driver repeated his statement about starting a war, and when told to calm down said “you [expletive]s have started a war now. You don’t know what you’ve started”.  
     
      
    14 Nasr Nasr, in cross-examination, had denied saying anything to a police officer about having started a war, and had denied each of the various incidents recounted by Constable Van Akker and Sergeant Bennett. 
     
      
    15 It was a common theme in the evidence that it was very soon after Nasr Nasr pulled up where the police indicated he should pull up that he used his mobile phone to telephone George Nasr.  
     
      
    16 Her Honour referred to there being “an issue as to whether Nasr Nasr had said to the police, before the plaintiffs arrived, “you [expletive]s have started a war now”.” Concerning that, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In view of my findings below as to the reliability of the evidence of the defendant’s witnesses, I am satisfied that the words were said.” 
        
       
      
    17 The appellants’ second ground of appeal relates to this finding. They allege that it is erroneous, because her Honour failed to have regard to the evidence of Nasr Nasr on the topic, and failed to have regard to another piece of evidence from Sergeant Bennett, which the appellants submitted bore upon the probabilities of Nasr Nasr having said those words. 
     
      
    18 The third ground of appeal is that it is the combined effect of the alleged errors in the first and second grounds that her Honour’s credibility finding concerning the appellants’ witnesses by comparison with the police witnesses was affected by error, and that that error infected her entire disposal of the case. 
     
      
       
      Tests for Adequacy of a Judge’s Reasons 
       
      
    19 In Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 280 McHugh JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where the resolution of the case depends  
        entirely 
         on credibility, it is probably enough that the judge has said that he believed one witness in preference to another; it is not necessary “for him to go further and say, for example, that the reason was based on demeanour”:  
        Connell v Auckland City Council 
          
        [1977] 1 NZLR 630 at 632-633 per Chilwell J. The position will usually be different if other evidence and probabilities are involved. A superior court, considering the decision of an inferior tribunal, should not be left to speculate from collateral observations as to the basis of a particular finding:  
        Wright v Australian Broadcasting Commission 
         [1977] 1 NSWLR 697 at 701, 713. 
        
       
       
        
        If an obligation to give reasons for a decision exists its discharge does not require lengthy or elaborate reasons:  
        Ex parte Powter; Re Powter 
          
        (1945) 46 SR (NSW) 1 at 5; 63 WN 34 at 36. But it is necessary that the essential ground or grounds upon which the decision rests should be articulated. In many cases the reasons for preferring one conclusion to another also need to be given:  
        Wright v Australian Broadcasting Commission 
          
        (at 701, 713). In  
        Iveagh (Earl) v Minister of Housing and Local Government 
         [1964] 1 QB 395, Lord Denning MR, speaking of a Minister's duty under the  
        Tribunals and Inquiries Act 
         1958 (UK) to furnish “the reasons for the decision”, declared (at 410) that:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “… The whole purpose of the enactment is to enable the parties and the courts to see what matters he has taken into consideration and what view he has reached on the points of fact and law which arise.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The content of the duty of a judge to give reasons is not dissimilar from the duty of a party to give particulars of a claim or defence. In  
        R v Associated Northern Collieries Ltd 
         (1910) 11 CLR 738, Isaacs J said (at 740) that the fundamental principle concerning particulars was:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “… that the opposite party shall always be fairly apprised of the nature of the case he is called upon to meet, shall be placed in possession of its broad outlines and the constitutive facts which are said to raise his legal liability.”” 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 In Mifsud v Campbell (1991) 21 NSWLR 725 at 728 Samuels JA (with whose reasons Clarke JA agreed on this point) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is an incident of judicial duty for the judge to consider all the evidence in the case. It is plainly unnecessary for a judge to refer to all the evidence led in the proceedings or to indicate which of it is accepted or rejected. The extent of the duty to record the evidence given and the findings made depend, as the duty to give reasons does, upon the circumstances of the individual case. 
        
       
       
        
        Accordingly, a failure to refer to some of the evidence does not necessarily, whenever it occurs, indicate that the judge has failed to discharge the duty which rests upon him or her. However, for a judge to ignore evidence critical to an issue in a case and contrary to an assertion of fact made by one party and accepted by the judge — as the defendant's denial of having consumed alcohol — may promote a sense of grievance in the adversary and create a litigant who is not only “disappointed” but “disturbed” — to use the words which appear in the New Zealand case of  
        Connell v Auckland City Council 
          
        [1977] 1 NZLR 630 at 634. It tends to deny both the fact and the appearance of justice having been done. If it does, as in my opinion is the case here, then it will have worked a miscarriage of justice and have produced a mis-trial …” 
        
       
      
    21 In Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430 at 443 Meagher JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “First, a judge should refer to relevant evidence. There is no need to refer to the relevant evidence in detail, especially in circumstances where it is clear that the evidence has been considered. However, where certain evidence is important or critical to the proper determination of the matter and it is not referred to by the trial judge, an appellate court may infer that the trial judge overlooked the evidence or failed to give consideration to it:  
        North Sydney Council v Ligon 302 Pty Ltd 
         (1995) 87 LGERA 435. Where conflicting evidence of a significant nature is given, the existence of both sets of evidence should be referred to. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, a judge should set out any material findings of fact and any conclusions or ultimate findings of fact reached. The obvious extension of the principle in  
        North Sydney Council 
         is that, where findings of fact are not referred to, an appellate court may infer that the trial judge considered that finding to be immaterial. Where one set of evidence is accepted over a conflicting set of significant evidence, the trial judge should set out his findings as to how he comes to accept the one over the other. But that is not to say that judge must make explicit findings on each disputed piece of evidence, especially if the inference as to what is found is appropriately clear:  
        Selvanayagam v University of the West Indies 
         [1983] 1 WLR 585; [1983] 1 All ER 824. Further, it may not be necessary to make findings on every argument or destroy every submission, particularly where the arguments advanced are numerous and of varying significance:  
        Rajski v Bainton 
         (Court of Appeal, 6 September 1991, unreported).” 
        
       
      
    22 Not every matter concerning which a trial judge could have given better or more extensive reasons involves the type of error that warrants correction on appeal. As Meagher JA said in Beale at 444,  
     
      
       
        
        “It does not automatically follow that because the reasons for decision are inadequate then an appealable error has occurred. Examination of nearly any statement of reasons with a fine-tooth comb would throw up some inadequacies. Indeed, an appeal court will reserve any intervention to those situations in which it is left with no choice: where no reasons have been given in circumstances where there was an obligation to provide them and in circumstances where a statement of reasons is so inadequate as to constitute a miscarriage of justice. In other words, the statement of reasons must be looked at as a whole and the material inadequacies identified and considered.” 
        
       
      
    23 That view can also be arrived at by recalling that the appropriate form of appellate intervention when there has been the type of failure to give reasons that warrants correction on appeal, is an order for a new trial – failure to give adequate reasons is not the sort of error that a Court of Appeal is capable of correcting for itself. Part 51 Rule 23 Supreme Court Rules 1970 provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court of Appeal shall not order a new trial:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) on the ground of … error of law, 
        
       
       
        
        … or 
        
       
       
        
        (d) on any other ground, 
        
       
       
        
        unless it appears to the Court of Appeal that some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.” 
        
       
      
    24 I quote the rule in that form to make clear that, whether a failure of a judge to give adequate reasons is an error of law or not (cf Beale at 444), it should be corrected by the Court of Appeal only if that error has caused some substantial wrong or miscarriage. 
     
      
    25 In Richard Martin Tory v Michael Megna [2007] NSWCA 13 at [28]-[30] Spigelman CJ (with whom Beazley and Bryson JJA agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “28 When applying Pt 51 r23, this Court must have regard to s56 of the  
        Civil Procedure Act 2005 
          
        which relevantly provides:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            “56(1) The overriding purpose of this Act and of rules of court, in their application to civil proceedings, is to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (2) The Court must seek to give effect to the overriding purpose … when it interprets a provision of the Act or any of the rules.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        29 Section 56 has its origins in Pt 1 r3 of the  
        Supreme Court Rules 
        . Although Pt 51 remains in those rules and has not yet been transferred to the  
        Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 
        , the words “rules of court” in s56 encompass the  
        Supreme Court Rules 
         as well as the  
        Uniform Rules 
        .  
        
       
       
        
        30 Accordingly, when interpreting the words “substantial wrong or miscarriage” in Pt 51 r23, this Court is required by s56(2) to “give effect to the overriding purpose”. Where the Court is concerned with a word of such elasticity as “substantial” there may be more scope for applying s56(2) than would be the case in other interpretative contexts.” 
        
       
      
    26 The manner for the Court of Appeal to apply Part 51 Rule 23 was explained in Tory at [41]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that, where the Court concludes that the relevant error could not (or equivalent terminology) have affected the result, then the Court cannot be satisfied that there had been a “substantial wrong or miscarriage”. Nevertheless, there is authority which suggests that such a conclusion can be reached where the error involved a matter that was tangential in the way identified by Herron CJ (with whom Sugerman JA agreed) in

    27 In Tory, at [45]-[46], Spigelman CJ quoted what the High Court had said in Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [35]-[42] (314-316) concerning the proviso on a criminal appeal, and held that that reasoning should be adopted for the purpose of Part 51 Rule 23. With the modifications that are needed to take account of the fact that in the present case the appeal is from a judge sitting alone rather than from a judge and jury, and that the standard of proof is the civil standard, the following portions of paras [39] and [41] (224 CLR 300 at 315-316) of the judgment in Weiss are presently applicable: 
     
      
       
        
        “First, the appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. Secondly, the task of the appellate court is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks. It is to be performed with whatever are the advantages and disadvantages of deciding an appeal on the record of the trial; it is not an exercise in speculation or prediction. … 
        
       
       
        
        That task is to be undertaken in the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence [

      Did the Judge Err? 
       
      
    28 In my view, the position of Nasr Nasr’s vehicle, the speed at which Nasr Nasr must have been driving, and the sequence of subsequent events up to the time that George Nasr arrived on the scene were not in themselves topics of a kind that could be described as “important or critical to the proper determination of the matter”. Nor is evidence on those topics evidence “critical to an issue in a case and contrary to an assertion of fact made by one party and accepted by the judge.” It is true that it was contrary to some of the evidence of Constable Van Akker and Sergeant Bennett, but that evidence itself was not, in my view, critical to an issue in the case. The issues in the case all related to the manner in which the appellants had been dealt with by the police, and her Honour was entitled to take the view, in the circumstances of this case, that resolving the question of whether the appellants’ causes of action were made out did not require her to decide disputes about events that had happened before the appellants came to Shakespeare Street.  
     
      
    29 The topic of whether Nasr Nasr had said anything about starting a war was not itself one of the matters in issue in the elements of the appellants’ cause of action. Nor was it evidence critical to an issue in the case, in the sense of an issue that was important to whether an element in a cause of action or of a defence had been proved.  
     
      
    30 Even though her Honour referred to there being “an issue” about whether Nasr Nasr had said to police words about having started a war, there are several senses in which some matter about which there is disagreement can be an “issue”. One sense is that the issues in the case are those matters which are themselves elements of a plaintiff's cause of action, or a defendant's defence. It is in this sense that one says that the pleadings define the issues in a case. Another sense is that it is a matter concerning which there is disagreement at a trial, the resolution of which can bear upon the probabilities of one or more of the elements of a plaintiff's cause of action, or a defendant's defence, being made out. Issues in this second sense can be of varying degrees of relevance to the issues in the first sense. If in any case there is an issue in the second sense that is not of a sufficiently high degree of relevance to the issues in the first sense, evidence going to that issue does not count, it seems to me, as ""evidence critical to an issue in the case"", within the meaning of that expression in the extract quoted above from Mifsud v Campbell, nor does it count as ""conflicting evidence of a significant nature"", within the meaning of the extract quoted above from the Beale. In such a case a judge is not failing in his or her duty to give reasons if there is no express consideration of the evidence going to that matter.  
     
      
    31 This is borne out by the particular facts that were under consideration in those two cases. In Mifsud the litigation concerned a collision between two motor vehicles, one driven by the plaintiff and the other driven by the defendant. There were no independent eyewitnesses to the collision, and there was no conclusive evidence to establish a point of impact. The defendant had succeeded at trial, because the trial judge accepted the defendant's evidence about the speed and manner in which the defendant had been driving, and that he had not consumed alcohol. There was other evidence, that a person who came on the scene immediately after the accident found that a strong smell of alcohol came out of the defendant's car, that the defendant almost immediately fled from the scene, and the defendant could give no explanation of why are there was a smell of alcohol in his vehicle. The Court of Appeal ordered the new trial because the judge had not considered this evidence, nor the conflicting evidence about the point of impact. One can readily understand that the evidence that the trial judge had not considered in that case had a high degree of relevance to the issue that arose on the pleadings about whether the defendant had been driving in a negligent fashion. Beale involved an assessment of damages, in which the trial judge rejected a plaintiff's claim for one particular head of damage concerning long-term physical impairment and work incapacity, without considering the evidence of three witnesses that directly supported this aspect of the plaintiffs claim. Again, this was evidence that had a high degree of relevance to an issue on the pleadings. 
     
      
    32 Thus, the fact that her Honour referred to there being ""an issue"" about whether Nasr Nasr had said anything about starting a war is not determinative of whether she should have given any more extensive reasons than she gave concerning that matter. That matter was not totally irrelevant to the issues (in the first sense), but had the status of a scene-setter to events that were far more important to those issues. 
     
      
    33 The only references that her Honour made to the evidence of Nasr Nasr in her judgment are those I have identified at paras [10] and [16] above. It could not, however, be said that her Honour had overlooked the evidence of Nasr Nasr, because she explicitly said that in her view the evidence on some of the topics on which it was given was not relevant. Nor would I infer that the evidence of Nasr Nasr about the various “starting a war” allegations was overlooked – her Honour is hardly likely to have referred to there being “an issue”, and gone to the trouble of making an express finding about whether those words were said, unless she was conscious that there was disagreement about whether they had been said. Further, her Honour gave the reliability of the evidence of the defendant’s witnesses as her reason for making that finding. It is hardly likely she would have given that reason if she had not been aware that the evidence contained contradictory accounts of the event, concerning which the reliability of the evidence of the witnesses on one side could be a reason for prefering the evidence given by the witnesses on that side.  
     
      
    34 While her Honour did not, at the stage of her reasons for judgment at which the findings now in question were made, give any reasons for the reliability of the two police witnesses, she makes clear, by her reference to “my findings below”, that her reasons were to be found in later parts of the judgment, in which reasons are given for preferring the police evidence to other evidence concerning topics of central importance to the appellants’ causes of action.  
     
      
    35 There was a stark contast between the evidence of the two police witnesses and that of Nasr Nasr on those topics, and a stark contrast in evidence can sometimes cast light on the credibility of the witness or witnesses who give one version of the story, even if the evidence is on a topic different to those that make up elements of a cause of action or defence. But the evidence about what happened before George Nasr arrived is not of that type. There were ample other opportunities to test the evidence of Constable Van Akker and Sergeant Bennett, and the evidence of Nasr Nasr does not appear to be particularly strong. Very early in his evidence-in-chief, Nasr Nasr said that his memory of the events of the day in question was: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. A bit poor. It’s been five years. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember the order of events that occurred well now? 
         
        A. Bits of it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember things that happened to you better or worse than things that happened to others or about the same, how would you describe it? 
         
        A. I would describe it what happened to me I do remember better things about me than others.” 
        
       
      
    36 Nasr Nasr also gave some evidence about the circumstances of the incident that led to the arrest of the appellants. His evidence-in-chief, taking up the story from when his parents arrived at the scene, includes: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What did you see happen when they approached? Do you recall? 
         
        A. I can’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you recall your father speaking? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you know whether he spoke or he didn’t speak? 
         
        A. Not that I remember, no. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you observe, or if you didn’t hear anything, did you see what the police did in relation to your father and your mother? 
         
        A. At that time? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. 
         
        A. I can’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Could you see them clearly from where you were positioned? 
         
        A. No, not really. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I think at some stage Maggie appeared. Is that correct? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At some stage your brother George came back? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. As far as your recollection is concerned, do you remember any incident involving spraying? 
         
        A. The only thing I remember is my father and George were in agony of the spray. I didn’t actually see the spray get sprayed. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you see any incident where your father and George were arrested? 
         
        A. I remember they were on the grass on their stomachs, rumbled by police.” 
        
       
      
    37 His cross-examination was replete with answers, when questions were put to him, that he could not remember, or did not know. When the evidence of Nasr Nasr was based solely upon his recollection, and the status of his recollection was as exhibited in the passages of evidence just quoted, it was not appellably wrong for her Honour to not make an explicit decision comparing his evidence to that of Constable Van Akker and Sergeant Bennett, and deciding between them. 
     
      
    38 The appellant particularly criticises the failure of her Honour to refer to the following passage in the cross-examination of Sergeant Bennett. 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Let’s assume George Nasr hadn’t arrived. Just before George Nasr arrives, it was not a volatile situation, was it? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It was a nothing situation. Do you agree with me? 
         
        A. It was a traffic stop. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’ve described a nothing situation back on 4 December 2001 and I suggest to you that is a fair description of what was happening immediately before George Nasr arrived. 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. There was no volatile situation at that stage: 
         
        A. Prior to George arriving? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    39 However, six questions before then, Sergeant Bennett had given evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you agree that it was a nothing situation at that stage? 
         
        A. It was a potentially violent situation. It was a situation that was escalating.” 
        
       
      
    40 I do not see this evidence as inconsistent with Sergeant Bennett’s earlier evidence about the circumstances in which he came to stop Nasr Nasr’s vehicle, or with his evidence that Nasr Nasr referred to Sergeant Bennett (or perhaps the police collectively) starting a war, of a kind that was so important that the trial judge should have regarded it as casting doubt on the overall credibility of Sergeant Bennett. Read as a whole, these passages in the evidence of Sergeant Bennett are quite capable of being read as being consistent with each other. There was no exploration in the evidence of what Sergeant Bennett had meant when he had, on 4 December 2001, described the situation as “a nothing situation”. Clearly it did not mean that nothing at all was happening. It was not explored whether, by the expression, Sergeant Bennett meant that nothing out of the ordinary was happening, or nothing that he felt he could not handle was happening, or nothing that alarmed him was happening, or that nothing comparable to the melee that later developed was happening, or something else. The picture that the police evidence presented was one of a potentially violent situation prior to the arrival of George Nasr, that was not actually volatile at that time, but that became volatile upon George Nasr’s arrival. The evidence of Sergeant Bennett that I have quoted above does not, in my view, detract from that overall picture. Nor is it inconsistent with Nasr Nasr (who at that time was with no obvious allies – though other people who were not police officers were nearby – at a location where eight police officers were present) having made remarks about police having started a war. 
     
      
    41 I am not satisfied that the first three grounds of appeal are made out. 
     
      
       
      Failure to Analyse Evidence About Scratching of Constable Taylor’s Neck 
       
      
    42 Mrs Elmazer Nasr is the wife of Nakhl Nasr. She arrived on the scene at the same time as Nakhl Nasr. She was not called to give evidence about the course of events at the scene after her arrival.  
     
      
    43 With the forensic aim of undermining her Honour’s acceptance of the police witnesses, the appellants submitted that her Honour had not adequately considered the evidence of various different police officers concerning the time at which Elmazer Nasr came to scratch the neck of Constable Taylor. The appellants submit that the police evidence is inconsistent on that topic. Her Honour’s failure to consider that inconsistency, the appellants argued, in particular undermined the evidence of Constable Taylor. 
     
      
    44 One of the factual findings made by her Honour is to the effect that it was immediately after Constable Taylor sprayed George Nasr and Nakhl Nasr that Elmazer Nasr scratched the side of Constable Taylor’s neck. Her Honour did not make a finding in precisely those words – rather, her judgment included a series of dot points, each of which set out a fact that she found in relation to the incident. It is reasonably clear, however, that her Honour was intending to arrange those dot points in chronological order, and the dot point in which she refers to Elmazer Nasr scratching the side of Constable Taylor’s neck occurs immediately after the dot point in which she refers to Constable Taylor spraying George Nasr and Nakhl Nasr. 
     
      
    45 Various of the police officers who were present at the incident prepared written statements soon after the incident. Those statements were admitted into evidence. Constable Taylor’s statement, made on 27 October 2000, clearly places the scratching incident immediately after the spraying of George and Nakhl Nasr. 
     
      
    46 Another police officer who was present at the time the appellants were sprayed is Constable Amanda Bliss. Her statement, made on 31 October 2000, gives an account: 
     
      
       
        
        “Cst Taylor has then sprayed the defendants, George Nasr and Nakhl Nasr in the face area. The defendant, Elmazer Nasr has then struck out towards Cst Taylor and scratched him to the left hand side of his neck.” 
        
       
      
    47 Other police officers present at the time – Constable Van Akker, Constable Gibson, and Constable Telfer – also made statements, within days of the event, that related that Elmazer Nasr had scratched Constable Taylor’s neck immediately after the spraying had occurred. 
     
      
    48 Sergeant Bennett’s statement of 27 October 2000 refers to Elmazer Nasr, immediately before the spraying, “swiping with her open hands towards at Constable Taylor’s face and neck”. Sergeant Bennett, in that statement, gives no account of ever seeing Elmazer Nasr actually scratch Constable Taylor. 
     
      
    49 Constable Leith Kennedy arrived on the scene at 6:16 pm, after the spraying had occurred. In his statement made on 1 November 2000 he gives an account whereby, immediately he arrived, he assisted Sergeant Bennett in handcuffing a person. At that time there were three people in the rear of a caged police vehicle in Shakespeare Street. His statement continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “During all this my attention was drawn to the defendant Elmazer Nasr who was walking around and around the area. Numerous police directed her to move on and to leave. Despite this she yelled and screamed at police and in another language to others present. I saw Constable Taylor, Gibson and Bliss approach the defendant Elmazer Nasr. I saw Constable Taylor trying to take hold of her left elbow. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Constable Bliss said, “You have already been told many times to leave the area. Do it now”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The defendant Elmazer Nasr said, “Fuck off, don’t you fucking touch me”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        She yelled in a foreign language and was waving her arms wildly in the air. I saw one of her arms connect with Constable Taylor’s neck or face. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Constable Taylor said, “Look you did this to my neck” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The left side of Constable Taylor’s neck was bleeding. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Constable Taylor said, “I’m not going to arrest you if you leave now alright”.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Constable Kennedy was called, but not cross-examined. 
       
      
    50 When Sergeant Bennett was cross-examined concerning the timing of the scratching, his evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. There was also an incident – and I just want, in terms of time, to clarify your recollection of when it occurred, that is, when Constable Taylor, from your recollection, was scratched by Elmazer Nasr. Do you recall when that was? 
         
        A. Without reading the statement, no, I can’t recall. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can I put a couple of things to you to assist you, sergeant. On 4 December 2001, page 23 line 23: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. That was in terms of the sequence of events when one of the dog incidents was happening and Taylor was dealing with one of these dogs, and the mother grabbed Taylor, and you said, I think, afterwards, ‘No, that was the Nasrs’ mother.’” 
           
          A. Yes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Is that right? 
           
          A. Yes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. But in terms of the timing, in terms of the dog, that’s still the same. 
           
          A. That’s right. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. In other words, while Taylor was dealing with one of these dog incidents, you say, do you, that it was Mrs Nasr senior that had attacked Constable Taylor. 
           
          A. Taylor was scratched on the face by the lady. I can’t remember.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Then, moving on to page 33: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. You say you saw Mrs Elmazer Nasr raise her hand towards Constable Taylor, and sometime afterwards you saw a welt and some blood on his person. How long into that half hour period did you see that, did you see the hand being raised? 
           
          A. Probably 10 to 15 minutes.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Would that be about your recollection now? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        A. I can’t recall. It’s five years later. My best recollection is in the statement, if I can refer to that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In any event, what I’m suggesting to you, sergeant, is it was after the arrest of both Nakhl and George Nasr, including their handcuffing, that this incident with Elmazer Nasr allegedly occurred. 
         
        A. I can’t recall.” 
        
       
      
    51 To understand the reference to the “dog incident” in that evdience, it was part of the account given by various police officers that, very soon after the appellants had been sprayed, a man with a pit bull terrier that was behaving agressively approached Constable Taylor, and was also sprayed by him. While that dog reappeared at later times in the police account, its first appearance was after the spraying of the appellants had occurred. 
     
      
    52 Sergeant Rowland McGready also came onto the scene at a time when Nakhl Nasr and George Nasr had already been arrested. In cross-examination he gives evidence to the following effect. 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. However, you did, I think, witness a struggle between Mrs Elmazer Nasr and Constable Taylor. Is that correct? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I think you indicate that was some time after you arrived. 
         
        A. Some time, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you recall it being an incidence where it appeared that Mrs Elmazer Nasr was attempting to get water to George and Nakhl Nasr, who were against a wall? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You don’t recall that. What did you first observe of this struggle? 
         
        A. To my recollection, the lady was being arrested. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And in the struggle that I have described between Constable Taylor and Elmazer Nasr, did you notice whether Elmazer Nasr in this struggle scratched Constable Taylor on the neck? 
         
        A. Did I notice that at the time, sir? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did it appear that that could possibly have occurred as a result of this struggle you observed. 
         
        A. Quite possibly.” 
        
       
      
    53 The appellants submit that the evidence in cross-examination of Sergeant Bennett, the evidence in the statement of Constable Kennedy, and the evidence in cross-examination of Sergeant McGready all point to the scratching incident having occurred at a later time than Constable Taylor, and the various other police witnesses I have mentioned in para [47] above, said it occurred.  
     
      
    54 In assessing that submission, it is important that Constable Taylor’s statement also refers to an incident, after the spraying of the appellants had occurred, and after the pit bull terrier was on the scene, in which Elmazer Nasr, 
     
      
       
        
        “.. waved her arms around theatrically and yelled in Arabic. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I said, “Look you did this to my neck.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        I pointed to the lacerations on my neck. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I said, “I’m not going to arrest you if you leave now alright.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The Defendant Elmazer Nasr raised both of her arms before her and lunged at my chest, pushing me forcefully with the palms of both her hands. 
        
       
       
        
        I said, “You are under arrest for assault Police.” 
        
       
      
    55 Neither Constable Van Akker nor Constable Telfer give any account at all of the arrest of Elmazer Nasr. Constable Gibson’s statement says that, immediately before Elmazer Nasr was arrested, she: 
     
      
       
        
        “… began to wave her arms around in the air, screaming swearing in English and also speaking in a language not know[n] to myself. 
        
       
       
        
        Cst Taylor said, “Look, you did this to my neck” and at the same time Constable Taylor was indicating to some scratch marks that were on his neck which were inflicted by the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    56 I do not regard the evidence of Sergeant Bennett, Constable Kennedy and Sergeant McGready as casting any significant doubt on the accuracy of Constable Taylor’s account of when the scratching occurred. While they all gave evidence of seeing Elmazer Nasr behaving violently towards Constable Taylor, at a time well after the spraying of the appellants had occurred, none of them says that they saw her scratch him in the course of that violent behaviour. Constable Kennedy’s statement that he “saw one of her arms connect with Constable Taylor’s neck or face” is not saying that he saw her scratching his neck. Nor is the cross-examination of Sergeant Bennett and Sergeant McGready saying that either of them saw her scratching Constable Taylor’s neck. Constable Taylor’s own statement refers to the occasion immediately before the arrest of Elmazer Nasr when she attacked him a second time, immediately after which he drew attention to the lacerations that were already on his neck. On a fair reading of the evidence, the incident that Constable Kennedy, Sergeant McGready and Sergeant Bennett were referring to was the second attack referred to by Constable Taylor, not the first.  
     
      
    57 The appellants submit that it was all the more important for her Honour to consider the evidence of Sergeant McGready and Constable Kennedy in assessing the reliability of Constable Taylor and other police witnesses, particularly when a recurring theme of the appellants’ cross-examination and submissions at the trial was that the various police officers had not each prepared a statement totally independently of the other police officers. 
     
      
    58 Her Honour gave express consideration to that submission in her reasons for judgment, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I accept the explanation offered by the police officers. The effect of that evidence was that they met because the events had occurred over a short period, they needed to collectively work out the order of events that had taken place and to work out collectively who had been involved in what and who had arrested whom. Each of them denied simply copying from Constable Taylor’s statement and said that if there was something in his statement that he or she recalled, it was put in their statement.” 
        
       
      
    59 In these circumstances I am not satisfied that there is any appealable error in her Honour’s failing to expressly mention and consider the evidence of Sergeant Bennett, Constable Kennedy and Sergeant McGready in coming to her finding that Elmazer Nasr scratched Constable Taylor’s neck prior to the arrest of George and Nakhl Nasr. 
     
      
       
      Was the Detention of the Appellants Unreasonably Long? 
       
      
    60 Whether the appellants were detained for an unreasonably long time at the police station was relevant to their causes of action in two different ways. First it was relevant to their action for false imprisonment. Even if their initial detention had been lawful, it could have become unlawful at the time when they commenced to have been detained for an unreasonably long time: cf Cowell v Corrective Services Commission of New South Wales (1988) 13 NSWLR 714; Ruddock v Taylor (2003) 58 NSWLR 269. Second, it was relevant to their claim for negligence relating to the manner of their detention. 
     
      
       
      Time of Arrival at Police Station 
       
      
    61 The appellants were arrested at 6:14 pm, in Shakespeare Street. They were taken to the Burwood Police Station. Her Honour found that they arrived there at about 7:00 pm.  
     
      
    62 The appellants submit that they arrived around 6:45 pm. The basis for that submission is some evidence of Inspector Mitropoulos, an officer who was present at Burwood Police Station on the night in question. His evidence (in cross-examination) on that topic was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And they arrived at the police station at around about 6.30 or a little bit before that or started to arrive at that time I think. Clearly didn’t arrive all the same -- 
         
        A. You’d be right again there. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. On your arrival at the police station these people were in the cells at the back of the police station? 
         
        A. Yes, sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And your arrival, you said, was some time after 6, around about 6:45. Am I correct? 
         
        A. Yes, sir.” 
        
       
      
    63 The custody management records in relation to each of the appellants, completed at Burwood Police Station, record their time of arrival as 7:00 pm. Even though that custody management record was completed some time later, I am not persuaded that her Honour was in error in preferring the written record to Inspector Mitropoulos’ acceptance, years after the event, of a timing put to him in cross-examination.  
     
      
       
      Events After Arrival at Police Station 
       
      
    64 Her Honour’s findings concerning events after arrival at the police station are: 
     
      
       
        
        “They were processed by the custody manager. The custody manager complied with the requirements of the  
        Crimes Act 1900  
        in cautioning the plaintiffs and summarising the provisions relating to detention. The plaintiffs’ solicitor arrived at the police station shortly after 8:00 pm and stayed about 2 hours. In that time he spoke with the plaintiffs, members of their family and the police. The plaintiffs were searched and photographed. Charges and facts sheets were prepared. The charges were reviewed and accepted by the custody manager. A decision was made about bail. When Nakhl Nasr was initially told he could leave the police station he said he would not leave without his family. 
        
       
       
        
        Nakhl Nasr was discharged from the police station at 1:15 am on 27 October 2000 and George Nasr was discharged 1:30 am.” 
        
       
      
    65 Each of those discharges occurred at the time that the respective appellants signed bail undertakings, whereby each of them undertook to appear, in respect of the offences with which they were charged, at Burwood Local Court on 21 November 2000.  
     
      
    66 Her Honour found that: 
     
      
       
        
        “A number of other people were arrested at the scene and taken to Burwood police station. There were 24 people in custody at the police station on the evening.” 
        
       
      
    67 While that finding of her Honour is not attacked, it does not have as much specificity as the evidence would have justified. A total of nine people were arrested during the incident at Shakespeare Street, and taken to Burwood Police Station. Elmazer Nasr was issued with four Field Court Attendance Notices and was not charged at the police station. However the other eight people arrested at Shakespeare Street were all taken to the police station and in due course charged.  
     
      
    68 At the time the appellants arrived at Burwood Police Station, there were already three other people there in custody. Of the group of eight who arrived together from Shakespeare Street, it was the appellants who were released from custody first. The records in evidence identify another four people as coming into custody in the time between when the appellants arrived at the police station, and the time they were released. 
     
      
    69 On the basis of her findings about the events at Burwood Police Station on the night in question, her Honour found there had been no unreasonable delay in releasing the appellants. 
     
      
       
      Law on Time an Arrested Person Can Be Detained 
       
      
    70 At the time that the appellants were arrested, section 352 Crimes Act 1900 conferred a power of arrest. So far as presently relevant, that section then provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “352  
        Person in act of committing or having committed an offence  
        
       
       
        
        (1) Any constable or other person may without warrant apprehend,  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any person in the act of committing, or immediately after having committed, an offence punishable, whether by indictment, or on summary conviction, under any Act,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          and take the person, and any property found upon the person, before an authorised Justice to be dealt with according to law. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Any constable may without warrant apprehend,  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any person whom the constable, with reasonable cause, suspects of having committed any such offence,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          and take the person, and any property found upon the person, before an authorised Justice to be dealt with according to law. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (5) In this section:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          authorised Justice  
          means:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a Magistrate, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a Justice employed in the Department of Courts Administration.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    71 Section 352 “… has not been regarded in New South Wales as substituting its provisions for the common law, but as reinforcing the common law principles.”: Zaravinos v State of New South Wales (2004) 62 NSWLR 58 at 67, [26]. 
     
      
    72 Section 352(5) had been inserted in the form quoted above by the Criminal Legislation (Amendment) Act 1992 to clarify a question that the Court of Criminal appeal had considered in R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 98-99 concerning whether the previous provision in section 352 requiring the arresting officer to take the arrested person before a ""justice"" required the arresting officer to take the arrested person before a police officer who had power to grant bail.  
     
      
    73 In Bales v Parmeter (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 182, Jordan CJ said, at 189: 
     
      
       
        
        “the statute, like the common law, authorises him only to take the person so arrested before a justice to be dealt with according to law, and to do so without unreasonable delay and by the most reasonably direct route:  
        Clarke v Bailey  
        (33 SR 303). Any detention which is reasonably necessary until a magistrate can be obtained is, of course, lawful, but detention which extends beyond this cannot be justified under the common law or statutory power.” 
        
       
      
    74 Section 17 Bail Act 1978 confers upon certain police officers power to grant bail in accordance with that Act to an accused person who is present at a police station, unless that person has been arrested pursuant to a warrant. 
     
      
    75 Section 18 Bail Act 1978 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “18  
        Determination as to bail to be made after charge laid 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Where a person is charged by a police officer with an offence and the person is in custody, the proper officer shall, as soon as reasonably practicable:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) give the accused person such information in writing respecting the person’s entitlement to or eligibility for bail as is prescribed by the regulations and sign an acknowledgment in the prescribed form that he or she has given the accused person the information, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if the proper officer is:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) authorised to grant bail—determine whether or not bail should be granted to the person or bring the person or cause the person to be brought before a court, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) not authorised to grant bail—bring the person before a court or an authorised officer. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The authorised officer before whom a person is brought pursuant to subsection (1) (b) (ii) shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, determine whether or not bail should be granted to the person or bring the person or cause the person to be brought before a court. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) In this section:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a reference to the proper officer is a reference to:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) subject to subparagraph (ii)—the police officer who laid the charge against the accused person, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) where it is not reasonably practicable for the police officer referred to in subparagraph (i) to perform the duties prescribed by subsection (1)—the police officer for the time being in charge of the police station at which the accused person is in custody or, if the person is not in custody at a police station, a police officer who has custody of the person, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a reference to bringing a person before a court is a reference to bringing the person before a court for the purpose of having the court exercise its powers in relation to bail or for the purpose of the person being dealt with otherwise according to law.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    76 In Williams v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 278 the High Court held that the Tasmanian equivalent of section 352 Crimes Act gave no power to question an arrested person about the offence for which he had been arrested or other offences, and did not make justifiable a delay which resulted only from the fact that the arresting officer wished to question him. That situation had been modified, at the time of the events in question in this case, by Part 10A Crimes Act 1900, which conferred on the police certain limited power to detain a person who is under arrest for the purpose of certain investigations, and to that extent to delay the bringing of that person before a justice. Part 10A does not enter into consideration of the present case, for two reasons. The first is that it was not reasonably practical to bring the appellants before an authorised Justice in the period between their arrest at 6:14 pm and their eventual release at 1:15 am and 1:30 am of the following morning so no practical question arose of their having been delayed, by police investigations, in being brought before an authorised Justice. The second is that no investigation was carried out in the time that the appellants were detained at the police station so no occasion for the operation of Part 10A arose.  
     
      
    77 It was a consequence of the common law, as re-enacted in section 352 Crimes Act, that if a person was arrested after the hours during which courts sit, that person could be detained overnight until it was reasonably practicable to bring that person before the court – which would be, usually, first thing the next day. In operating that way, section 352 recognised that the duty to bring the arrested person “before an authorised Justice to be dealt with according to law” was one imposed on the arresting constable, and that the hours during which an authorised Justice was available conditioned what was reasonably practicable for the arresting constable to do in performance of that duty. Thus, in Williams, Wilson and Dawson JJ expressly recognised, at 313 that: 
     
      
       
        
        “What is reasonable will depend upon all the circumstances, including the availability of a justice … “ 
        
       
      
    78 Similarly, Gibbs CJ, at 283, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… what is reasonably practicable in a particular case is a question of fact. The answer to that question will depend on, amongst other things, the time when, the place in which and the conditions under which the arrest was made. It will be necessary to consider when and where a justice could have been found, whether police officers and transport were available and how long it would reasonably have taken for the necessary paperwork to be completed.” 
        
       
      
    79 Gibbs CJ went on to give examples of other factors that might influence what counted as a “reasonable time” that might have extended beyond what the majority in Williams would have approved, but the passage I have quoted seems to me to be consistent with the views expressed by other judges in Williams. 
     
      
    80 Section 18 Bail Act adds to the obligation of the arresting constable to bring the arrested person before an authorised Justice without unreasonable delay, an obligation on “the proper officer” to take the steps required by section 18 to enable a decision to be made about whether the charged person should be granted bail. If performance of the section 18 obligation results in the arrested person being freed after being granted bail, the obligation on the arresting constable to bring the arrested person before an authorised Justice ceases. 
     
      
       
      Error in Failing to Consider Each Appellant Separately? 
       
      
    81 The appellants submit that her Honour was in error in not posing the test of reasonableness in respect of each of the appellants separately, but rather “assessing the situation globally”. They criticise her for failing to consider for how long the solicitor for the appellants, Mr Hodges, spoke to each of them individually, rather than noting (as her Honour did) his overall stay of about two hours from 8:00 pm speaking with “the plaintiffs, members of their family and the police”. They draw attention to Mr Hodges’ evidence that he spent half an hour representing the interests of George and Nakhl Nasr at the police station.  
     
      
    82 The submission continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “Further, the search and photographing of the appellants would not have taken hours to conduct, nor should the charges and facts sheets in relation to the appellants have taken hours to prepare. The review and acceptance of the charges by the custody manager for the appellants likewise should not have taken hours. 
        
       
       
        
        Her Honour noted that there were 24 people in custody at the police station on the evening. The appellants contend that that was not a consideration which should have affected her Honour’s consideration of reasonableness. The proposition can be tested by posing the question that if there had been one hundred people in custody would a period of 20 hours have been reasonable to keep the appellants in custody? Clearly that question must be answered ‘no’. … If the resources of the police were not sufficient to cope with the large number of people in detention on that evening at Burwood then it was incumbent upon the police to bring in more resources, just as they did at the scene of the incident in Campsie.” 
        
       
      
    83 I do not accept those submissions. I do accept that when the court is considering whether more than a reasonable time passed before an arrested person was released on bail the court makes that decision in relation to each arrested person that is in question. To that extent, it is not appropriate to ""assess the situation globally"" concerning a group of people who are arrested together. However, it seems to me that what her Honour has done is to not regard there as being any factors that affected one appellant’s situation but not the other’s. On the appeal, counsel for the appellants has not sought to point to any such factors that affected one rather than the other, apart from the health of Nakhl Nasr, which I will consider separately below. 
     
      
    84 The transcript of Mr Hodges’ evidence shows that there was in no way any attack on his credibility or reliability. While he estimated that the time he spent representing the interests of George and Nakhl Nasr at the police station was probably half an hour, he also said that ""that period was probably spread out over the entire two hours that I was there."" He also gave evidence that he advised other members of the Nasr household or family whilst he was there. The members of the Nasr family who were at the police station that night included not only the appellants and Elmazer Nasser but also Ibrahim Nasr who was arrested at Shakespeare Street, and Antonios (or Tony) Nasr, who was arrested at the police station in connection with his conduct there. If Mr Hodges’ tasks in relation to the appellants were spread over the two-hour period he was there, her Honour was not in error in taking into account two hours as being the time that elapsed while he was carrying out functions that should properly be taken into account in deciding whether the appellants were detained for an unreasonably long period. 
     
      
    85 The submission that searching, photographing, allowing time for consultation with a solicitor, preparation of charges, preparation of fact sheets, and review and acceptance of the charges should not have taken over six hours is a submission that presupposes that the reasonableness of the time of detention of each appellant should be assessed on the basis that the police officers involved, acting reasonably, ought to have devoted time and attention to procuring the release of each appellant as promptly as was practicable, regardless of any other demands upon their time and attention. That presupposition is incorrect. 
     
      
    86 The obligation that is imposed by section 18 Bail Act is not an obligation imposed upon police officers generally. Rather, so far as any particular person in custody is concerned, it is an obligation imposed upon the particular person who is “the proper officer” at the time in question. What is reasonably practicable for that officer depends in part upon what resources are available to that officer at the time in question, and what other demands there are upon the time and attention of that officer, and the relative urgency of those demands.  
     
      
    87 Such an approach is evident in the decision of Allen J (with whom Smart and Levine JJ agreed) in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Michaels (1993) 70 A Crim R 78, at 81-2 concerning the obligation to take the arrested person before a Justice: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is appropriate that documentation be prepared so that the magistrate can deal with bail when the arrested person appears before him. Questions as to the availability of transport, consideration as to court sitting hours and as to when it can be reasonably anticipated that a magistrate would be able to deal with the matter, are all considerations necessary to be taken into account. Indeed, duties which police have, apart from matters relating to the person in custody, are not immaterial. If, for example, while the accused is in custody a serious riot breaks out requiring the immediate attendance of all available police from the relevant station in order to save possible loss of life, then that obligation on the police to protect life would have to take precedence to a reasonable extent over the speed at which an arrested person is to be brought before a court. All considerations, however, must be viewed in the context of the high importance which the common law and its statutory equivalents place upon the liberty of the subject.” 
        
       
      
    88 An appeal from that decision was dismissed, without any adverse comment on this passage: Michaels v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 117. While that case concerned a power arising under section 212 of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) enabling an arrested person to be detained “until such time as he can without undue delay be taken before a Justice” the joint judgment of Brennan, Deane, Toohey and McHugh JJ said, at 123: 
     
      
       
        
        “… undue delay should be seen as a composite expression which accepts that there may be an interval of time before a person is brought before a justice, so long as the lapse of time which ensues is not excessive in the circumstances. Undue delay has been treated as synonymous with the statutory expressions “as soon as is practicable” in s 34 
        a 
        (1)  
        of the Justices Act 1959 
         (Tas) and “without delay” in s 303(1) of the  
        Criminal Code 
         (Tas) respectively and with the common law expression “as soon as is reasonably possible”  
        Williams v The Queen  
        (1986) 161 CLR 278 at 300, per Mason and Brennan JJ; at 313, per Wilson and Dawson JJ.” 
        
       
      
    89 If, having made those remarks, their Honours had been of the view that Allen J had taken too wide a view of what could be relevant circumstances it would be surprising if they had not said so. In my view, just as external constraints on an arresting police officer, like when a Justice is available, and other demands on his time, or lack of resources, are taken into account in deciding whether the arrested person has been brought before an authorised Justice in a reasonable time, so such factors can be taken into account in deciding whether the proper officer has taken the steps required by section 18 Bail Act as soon as reasonably practicable. 
     
      
    90 It might sometimes happen that the resources available to a proper officer, at the time concerning which a question arises about whether that officer has done what was reasonably practicable in complying with section 18, include the possibility of diverting manpower from other places or tasks. It is a question of fact in any case whether other manpower was available to be diverted, if called for, and whether the procedures that needed to be gone through in processing any particular arrested person are such that the allocation of extra manpower would in fact have speeded up their processing. Inspector Mitropoulos was the senior officer present at the police station on the night in question, and Sergeant Drakos was, of the two custody managers on duty at the police station that evening, the one who had responsibility for the appellants. Both of those officers gave evidence. There was no cross-examination of either of them as to the practicability of speeding up the processing of the appellants, in the circumstances, by obtaining more manpower. Nor was there any other exploration in the evidence of any such possibility. In those circumstances, the point that it was reasonably practicable to call for more manpower, and that if it had been called for the appellants were likely to have been released sooner, is not available on this appeal. There was no attempt made on the appeal to argue that, with the resources available at Burwood police station on that night, and with the totality of the various tasks that the police officers there needed to perform in the course of the night, there was undue delay in releasing the appellants. 
     
      
    91 The custody management record completed in relation to Nakhl Nasr, after his arrival at the police station, recorded that he complained of soreness to the right wrist and right shoulder, and “complains of soreness as a result of arrest”. The appellants rely on those complaints as making unreasonable a delay of more than six hours between his arrival at the police station and eventual release on bail.  
     
      
    92 Those complaints, however, need to be seen in context. Nakhl Nasr did not request the police to provide any medical assistance, nor did George Nasr request medical assistance for his father. Mr Hodges, when asked, had no recollection of seeing any injuries on Nakhl Nasr. Mr Hodges made no complaints to a police officer regarding any assaults committed upon Nakhl Nasr or injuries sustained by him, and sought no form of medical intervention or assistance for his client. A police officer, on his own initiative, requested at 12:13 am that an ambulance attend the police station, even though Naklh Nasr had declined an earlier offer to call an ambulance. When that ambulance arrived at 12:27 am, Nakhl Nasr refused to see the ambulance officer, saying he wanted to see his own doctor. A video taken in the police station that night shows Nakhl Nasr moving without apparent difficulty – though in fairness it should be said that the video was shot from an angle, apparently high up in the room, that does not make observation of such matters as easy as it might be. In my view it has not been shown that the mere fact of the complaints being made, and such opportunities for observation of the medical condition of Nakhl Nasr as the police would have had, were such that, acting reasonably, they should have speeded up his release. 
     
      
    93 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Alleged Errors Concerning Findings About Nakhl Nasr’s Injuries, and Whether Police Used Excessive Force 
       
      
    94 Her Honour records Nakhl Nasr’s contention that at Shakespeare Street: 
     
      
       
        
        “… he had tried to get up but was pushed down by the police who started stepping on him. They put their feet on his head, back and arm and he was stepped on more than twenty times.” 
        
       
      
    95 Her Honour did not accept that evidence.  
     
      
    96 One factual finding that her Honour made was that immediately after Constable Van Akker told Nakhl Nasr he was under arrest,  
     
      
       
        
        “Constable Van Akker attempted to take hold of Nakhl Nasr’s arm, which he pulled away. Constable Van Akker, with other police officers, took Nakhl Nasr to the ground where he was handcuffed.” 
        
       
      
    97 At the trial, the appellants submitted that excessive violence had been used in the course of the arrest, in that the use of capsicum spray was in the circumstances not justified, and that the police had not done enough to relieve the distress that the use of the capsicum spray caused to the appellants. Those submissions were the principal ones on which the count of negligence had been based at the trial. Her Honour rejected them, and her doing so is not the subject of this appeal.  
     
      
    98 Her Honour then dealt with a submission that excessive force had been used in other ways: 
     
      
       
        
        “Counsel for the plaintiffs also submitted that the defendant was negligent in using violence or excessive violence in handcuffing the plaintiffs – in particular Nakhl Nasr who sustained an injury to his wrist. I am satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities this did occur during the handcuffing. 
        
       
       
        
        However I accept the submission made by counsel for the defendant that the fact that Nakhl Nasr was injured during the arrest does not mean that excessive force was used. I do not accept that, on the basis of my factual findings, excessive force was used. I am satisfied that, taking all the circumstances into account the steps taken by the police were reasonable and appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    99 The appellants submit that this passage demonstrates an error on the part of her Honour “in finding that during his arrest Mr Nakhl Nasr only sustained an injury to his wrist”.  
     
      
    100 There was clear evidence before her Honour, in the form of hospital admission records, that Nakhl Nasr was admitted to Canterbury Hospital at 3:27 am on 27 October 2000, after arriving there by ambulance. He was seen by a doctor, at 4:00 am, who recorded a problem of pain in the right arm, neck and back. He was diagnosed with a ruptured biceps tendon, which required surgical repair. That surgery was performed on 28 October 2000. 
     
      
    101 In the years after his arrest, Nakhl Nasr has suffered from medical problems relating to his right knee and back. Prior to his arrest, he had two operations for a back problem (in 1986 and subsequently in 1987), and suffered from disc lesions in the cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral regions. The first complaint he made to any doctor, concerning anything other than his right arm having been injured in the course of the arrest or while in police custody, was on 16 November 2000, when he told Dr Geoffrey Rosenberg, the orthopaedic surgeon who was already treating him in connection with his back problems, that he had suffered an assault at the hands of police, concerning which Dr Rosenberg expressed the view that “the recent assault has stirred his back up and also caused increased symptoms of numbness and discomfort in his leg”. When her Honour found for the respondents on liability, there was no need for her to decide about the correctness of that opinion, or to seek to evaluate what significance, if any, there was in Nakhl Nasr’s failure to complain to any doctor about any injuries other than to his right arm until three weeks after the day of the arrest. 
     
      
    102 The appellants submit that her Honour’s finding that no excessive force was used was based on her erroneous factual finding in relation to the nature of the injury. The particular injury that they submit her Honour should have considered, but did not, was the rupturing of the biceps tendon, which was reported to the hospital of the order of two hours after his release from the police station. 
     
      
    103 I simply do not read the portion of her Honour’s judgment quoted at para [98] above as a finding by her Honour that the only injury sustained by Nakhl Nasr in the course of his arrest and police custody, was an injury to his wrist. Rather, her Honour makes specific mention of the injury to the wrist in connection with the submission that handcuffing itself involved an unreasonable application of force that had caused a specific type of injury, namely to the wrist.  
     
      
    104 The question of whether excessive force was used in the course of an arrest depends upon an assessment of the situation that confronted the arresting officer at the time. Evidence about any injuries actually sustained by the arrested person can sometimes be relevant to the amount of force that was applied, or to the types of stresses or contortions his or her body would have had to undergo to sustain injuries of that type. In the present case, however, there was no medical evidence to the effect that a rupturing of a biceps tendon could only occur if some particular degree of force was applied, or some unusual bodily manipulation engaged in. The evidence of the police witnesses, that her Honour accepted, created a picture of Nakhl Nasr yelling at the police, waving at least one of his arms, ignoring a police direction to leave, and walking towards Constable Taylor at the same time as George Nasr “shaped up to Constable Taylor, raising his fists into a boxing stance”. According to the police evidence that her Honour accepted, even after the appellants were warned not to come any closer or they would be sprayed, they continued to advance.  
     
      
    105 Even if one assumes that the tear to the biceps tendon of Nakhl Nasr occurred at the time of arrest, the most likely time for it to have occurred is when Constable Van Akker was attempting to take hold of Nakhl Nasr’s arm, which he pulled away, or in the course of him subsequently being brought to the ground. Even if it were the case that the biceps tear occurred at that time, it does not show any error in her Honour’s conclusion that she was not satisfied that excessive force had been used, and that the steps taken by the police were reasonable and appropriate. 
     
      
       
      Illegally Obtained Evidence? 
       
      
    106 Close to the start of the cross-examination of George Nasr it was put to him that on 13 January 1993 he had been convicted at the Waverley Local Court on a charge of offensive language and two charges of resisting arrest, that he had been fined $200 in connection with the offensive language charge, fined $300 on each of the resisting arrest counts, and that he had been ordered to pay the court costs. He said he did not remember, and volunteered that there were about twenty George Nasrs. He confirmed, however, that 20 July 1965 was his date of birth. After giving this confirmation, he repeated his evidence that he did not remember having been convicted at Waverley Local Court in January 1993.  
     
      
    107 In her judgment, the trial judge referred to this evidence of George Nasr, and said that she did not accept his evidence in relation to that issue. Her Honour’s non-acceptance of his evidence on that issue was a matter that she took into account in forming an overall unfavourable view of his reliability as a witness. 
     
      
    108 The cross-examination was based upon the charge sheets of the Waverley Local Court. At a later point in the cross-examination he said he had once lived at 2 Karuah Street, Greenacre. 
     
      
    109 Those charge sheets were tendered in evidence, on the basis that they amounted to a certificate under section 178 Evidence Act 1995. There was no challenge, either in the court below or in this Court, to whether the charge sheets properly constituted such a certificate. The charge sheets confirmed that a George Nasr, who was a tiler, who had been born on 20 July 1965, and who lived at 2 Karuah Street, Greenacre had been convicted and dealt with in precisely the way that counsel for the Crown had put to George Nasr in cross-examination. 
     
      
    110 Counsel for the appellants objected to the charge sheets being received in evidence. Counsel for the Crown informed her Honour that the documents had been obtained when they were supplied to the Crown Solicitor’s Office by the Waverley Local Court, upon an enquiry being made to that court.  
     
      
       
      The Alleged  
      Criminal Records Act 
       Contravention 
       
      
    111 The basis upon which objection was taken to the tender of the documents arose from two statutes. The first of them is the Criminal Records Act 1991. Sections 7, 8 and 9 made provision for criminal convictions for various offences to become “spent” on completion of a ten-year period after the date of the conviction during which, in broad terms, the person has not been convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment, not been in prison, and not been unlawfully at large. The various offences that George Nasr had been convicted of on 13 January 1993 were all offences in relation to which a conviction was capable of becoming spent. He had not, during the ten-year period after being convicted of those offences, done any of the things that could cause the ten-year period to not run. Thus, those convictions had each become spent on 13 January 2003.  
     
      
    112 Section 13 Criminal Records Act 1991 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person who has access to records of convictions kept by or on behalf of a public authority and who, without lawful authority, discloses to any other person any information concerning a spent conviction is guilty of an offence.  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 6 months, or both. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) It is not an offence for the officer in charge of the Criminal Records Unit of the Police Service to make information relating to a spent conviction available to a law enforcement agency or to the holder of an office prescribed by the regulations. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) [irrelevant exception] 
        
       
       
        
        (4) It is not an offence for a law enforcement agency (or an authorised officer of a law enforcement agency) in the discharge of its duties (or of the authorised officer’s duties) to make information relating to a spent conviction available to another law enforcement agency or to a court in compliance with an order of the court. 
        
       
       
        
        (4A) [irrelevant exception]

          (l) the Director of Public Prosecutions, or a person performing a similar function, appointed under a law of another legislature in Australia,

    113 The Crown conceded before her Honour that the charge sheets had been obtained from the Waverley Local Court after 13 January 2003. In those circumstances, the appellants argued, the charge sheets had been obtained in contravention of section 13 Criminal Records Act 1991. 
     
      
    114 Section 138 Evidence Act 1995 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence that was obtained:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the probative value of the evidence, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the  
          International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
          , and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    115 It was submitted that her Honour should, in the exercise of her discretion, not permit the tender of the charge sheets. 
     
      
    116 Her Honour did not rule on this submission. Rather, she admitted the documents provisionally, on the basis that she would deal with the question of admissibility in her final judgment. 
     
      
    117 The final judgment made no mention of that dispute about admissibility. Nor does her Honour’s judgment say anything about why it is that she rejects the evidence of George Nasr about not remembering the three convictions. However, if part of the reasoning process was that the three convictions had indeed occurred, and being convicted and required to pay $800 plus court costs is not the sort of thing a person is likely to forget, then regard would have been had to the charge sheets. 
     
      
    118 Before us, it was argued that, for the same reasons as had been put below, the charge sheets were illegally obtained. Her Honour was thus called on, the argument goes, to exercise the discretion under section 138 Evidence Act about whether to admit the charge sheets, and she had manifestly failed to exercise that discretion. Thus, the argument goes, the charge sheets should not have been treated as being in evidence. If they were not treated as being in evidence, one of the bases upon which she formed an unfavourable view of the credit of George Nasr, was not available to her.  
     
      
    119 The appellants accept that if the charge sheets had been subpoenaed, section 13(4) Criminal Records Act would have the effect that complying with the subpoena by producing the documents in court would not involve an unlawful disclosure. Further section 16 Criminal Records Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Proceedings before courts 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Section 12 does not apply to proceedings before a court (including the giving of evidence) or the making of a decision by a court (including a decision concerning sentencing). 
        
       
       
        
        (2) However, a court before which evidence of a spent conviction is admitted must, in appropriate circumstances, take such steps as are reasonably available to it to prevent or minimise publication of that evidence.” 
        
       
      
    120 Thus, section 12 would not have excused George Nasr from answering questions in court about his convictions. Further, because production of the charge sheet to the court in compliance with the subpoena would not have been an illegal act, there would have been no occasion for the judge to exercise a discretion under section 138 Evidence Act about whether to receive the charge sheets in evidence.  
     
      
    121 However, the appellants say that, if the records of the conviction had been subpoenaed, the provisions of the then Part 29 Rule 6A District Court Rules would have required the Crown, as the party issuing the subpoena, to serve the appellants with a copy of the subpoena. In that way, George Nasr’s legal advisors would have obtained knowledge of the convictions before the hearing, and have the opportunity to seek his instructions about them. If that had happened, the cross-examination concerning those convictions would not have come as a surprise to both George Nasr and his legal advisors. The appellants contend that the illegal mode of obtaining the conviction records produced an unfairness in the trial, concerning which there was a reasonable possibility that her Honour, if she had considered the matter, would have exercised the discretion under section 138 Evidence Act to exclude the evidence. 
     
      
    122 There was no argument on this appeal about who had the onus of proving that some particular making available of information is not illegal because it falls within section 13(2) Criminal Records Act. Nor was there any argument on this appeal, or evidence in the court below, about whether the particular officer of the Crown Solicitors Office who received the conviction records from Waverley Court was an employee of the Attorney-General’s Department ""whose primary function is the institution or conduct of proceedings for offences"", within the meaning of section 13(5). In those circumstances, I shall assume, without deciding, that that officer of the Crown Solicitors Office was not a ""law enforcement agency"" within the meaning of section 13.  
     
      
    123 Nor was there argument on this appeal about whether the collection of records from which the charge sheets were obtained was a collection of records ""kept by or on behalf of a public authority"", within the meaning of section 13(1). In those circumstances, I shall assume, without deciding, that it is such a collection of records. 
     
      
    124 The argument before her Honour proceeded on the basis that the appellants alleged that there had been two separate “disclosures” of the convictions at Waverley court. The first of them was alleged to have occurred when some unidentified person in the police force disclosed the fact of the convictions to a solicitor in the Crown Solicitors Office. There was neither specific proof, nor admission, about any such disclosure having been made – her Honour was asked to infer that there must have been such a disclosure. The second alleged disclosure was when the keeper of the records at Waverley court provided the charge sheets to the solicitor in the Crown Solicitors Office.  
     
      
    125 In this court, the only alleged contravention related to the provision of the charge sheets. That was, no doubt, because there was no proof that, even if it were the case that a police officer had informed a solicitor in the Crown Solicitors Office about the convictions, that information was conveyed at a time before the convictions had become spent. Nor, when litigation relating to or arising from the circumstances of the arrest and detention of the appellants had been pending for years – Nakhl Nasr’s claim was begun in 2001 – was there any inherent unlikelihood in any such disclosure having occurred before the convictions had become spent. 
     
      
    126 The person who alleges that there has been a contravention of section 13 bears the onus of establishing that there has been such a contravention. When the purpose for which a litigant seeks to establish a contravention of section 13 is for the purpose of an argument about admissibility of evidence in a civil case, the standard of proof that needs to be achieved is not the criminal standard. 
     
      
    127 Section 13(1) is a section that prohibits certain types of disclosure of information. The essence of disclosure of information is making known to a person information that the person to whom the disclosure is made did not previously know: R v Skeen & Freeman (1859) Bell 97; 169 ER 1182 (“uncovering … discovering … revealing … imparting of what was secret … [or] telling that which had been concealed”); Foster v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1951) 82 CLR 606 at 614-5 (""... a statement of fact by way of disclosure so as to reveal or make apparent that which (so far as the ""discloser"" knows) was previously unknown to the person to whom the statement was made""); R v Gidlow [1983] 2 Qd R 557 at 559 (“telling that which has been kept concealed”); Dun & Bradstreet (Australia) Pty Ltd v Lyle (1977) 15 SASR 297 at 299; A-G v Associated Newspapers Ltd [1994] 2 AC 238 at 248 (“to open up to the knowledge of others”); Real Estate Opportunities Limited v Aberdeen Asset Managers Jersey Limited [2007] EWCA Civ 197 at [78] (“the revelation of information for the first time”). In my view, the provision by the keeper of the records of Waverley court of the records of the conviction would be a disclosure of information relating to a spent conviction only if the solicitor at the Crown Solicitors Office to whom that record was provided did not already know the information that was contained in it. When the conviction records were provided as a result of a request made by the relevant solicitor at the Crown Solicitors Office, I would not infer that the provision of the documents amounted to the disclosure of information relating to a spent conviction. There is simply no proof or concession concerning how much that solicitor knew about the convictions before obtaining the charge sheets, beyond the inference that is available from the conceded fact that she asked for the records that she knew enough about the content to make it worthwhile to ask for the records. Thus, in my view the appellants did not establish, even at the level of proof needed to establish an illegality for the purpose of a question of admissibility of evidence in a civil proceeding, that there was any contravention of section 13. 
     
      
    128 Her Honour was in error in having admitted the documents provisionally, on the basis that she would give reasons later, but never giving any such reasons. However, when the basis upon which the admissibility of the documents was opposed has no substance in law, that error is the sort of error that has not resulted in any miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
      The Alleged  
      Privacy Act  
      Contravention 
       
      
    129 Alternatively, the appellants submit that the release of the charge sheets involved a contravention of the Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (“the Privacy Act”). 
     
      
    130 Under section 4 of that Act, “personal information” means (subject to some exceptions not presently relevant): 
     
      
       
        
        “information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database and whether or not recorded in a material form) about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion.” 
        
       
      
    131 I shall assume, without deciding, that under that Act, the keeper of the records of the Waverley Court is a “public sector agency”. Section 18 of the Privacy Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Limits on disclosure of personal information 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A public sector agency that holds personal information must not disclose the information to a person (other than the individual to whom the information relates) or other body, whether or not such other person or body is a public sector agency, unless:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the disclosure is directly related to the purpose for which the information was collected, and the agency disclosing the information has no reason to believe that the individual concerned would object to the disclosure, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the individual concerned is reasonably likely to have been aware, or has been made aware in accordance with section 10, that information of that kind is usually disclosed to that other person or body, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the agency believes on reasonable grounds that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of the individual concerned or another person. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) If personal information is disclosed in accordance with subsection (1) to a person or body that is a public sector agency, that agency must not use or disclose the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which the information was given to it.” 
        
       
      
    132 For the same reasons as apply in relation to the alleged breach of the Criminal Records Act, I am not satisfied that making the charge sheets available involved any disclosure of information. 
     
      
    133 As well, the Crown submitted that there was no breach of section 18 involved in any disclosure by Waverley Court of the conviction records because of the provisions of section 6, or alternatively section 23(4) of the Privacy Act. Section 6 provides, so far as relevant: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Nothing in this Act affects the manner in which a court or tribunal, or the manner in which the holder of an office relating to a court or tribunal, exercises the court’s, or the tribunal’s, judicial functions. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) In this section,  
        judicial functions 
         of a court or tribunal means such of the functions of the court or tribunal as relate to the hearing or determination of proceedings before it, and includes:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in relation to a Magistrate—such of the functions of the Magistrate as relate to the conduct of committal proceedings, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in relation to a coroner—such of the functions of the coroner as relate to the conduct of inquests and inquiries under the  
          Coroners Act 1980 
          .” 
          
         
        
       
      
    134 I do not accept that section 6 would have applied, if there had been a disclosure by the keeper of the records of Waverley Court, of this conviction record after 13 January 2003. Any such disclosure would have occurred long after the court had ceased to perform its judicial functions in relation to these particular convictions, and would have no effect on the manner in which the Waverley Court thereafter performed its judicial functions. 
     
      
    135 However, section 6 has relevance in a different way that is independent of whether making the charge sheets available amounted to a disclosure of information. The District Court, hearing the trial involved in the present case, was in the midst of exercising its judicial functions. If the trial judge in the present case were to treat a breach of the Privacy Act as an illegality or impropriety, and hence as something that gave occasion for the exercise of a discretion under section 138 Evidence Act, that would involve the Privacy Act affecting the manner in which the District Court exercised its judicial functions. In my view, a consequence of section 6(1) is that any breach of the Privacy Act is not to be taken as an illegality or impropriety, for the purpose of section 138 Evidence Act. Thus, her Honour has committed no error by failing to consider whether to exclude the charge sheets from evidence, on the ground that they had been obtained through a breach of the Privacy Act. 
     
      
    136 Further, section 69 of the Privacy Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Legal rights not affected 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Nothing in Part 2 or 3 gives rise to, or can be taken into account in, any civil cause of action, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing in Part 2 or 3:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) operates to create in any person any legal rights not in existence before the enactment of this Act, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) affects the validity, or provides grounds for review, of any judicial or administrative act or omission. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1) is subject to sections 21 and 32.” 
        
       
      
    137 Part 2 of the Privacy Act runs from section 8 to section 28 inclusive. The proceedings before the District Court in the present case were, of course, a civil cause of action. If, in the course of trying it, the trial judge had taken into account any contravention of section 18 of the Privacy Act, she would have been acting contrary to section 69(1). This provides a further reason why there was no error in her taking the charge sheets into account notwithstanding the Privacy Act.  
     
      
    138 Under these circumstances, there is no occasion to consider whether section 23(4) provides a separate reason why her Honour was not in error in failing to conclude that a breach of the Privacy Act made the charge sheets inadmissible. 
     
      
    139 For the same reasons as applied in relation to the argument of illegality under the Criminal Records Act, there was no miscarriage of justice in her Honour's failure to consider the applicability of the Privacy Act in her judgment. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    140 I propose the following orders in each appeal: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal dismissed 
       
       
      2. Appellant to pay costs of the respondent of the appeal.

      JUDGMENT: on application for extension of time 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 25 March 2003 the plaintiff, Graham Ross Rundle, filed in this court a statement of claim naming the “Salvation Army (South Australia Property Trust)” as first defendant, and Keith Ellis as second defendant. The present proceedings involve only the first defendant, although, in finding and recounting the relevant facts, it will be necessary at times to make reference to the allegations against the second defendant. It will be seen that the first defendant is named as a particular legal entity. It will be at times in this judgment necessary to refer to “the Salvation Army”, which is not, as I understand it, co-extensive with the first defendant. The evidence was unclear as to the precise legal status (if any) of “the Salvation Army”. 
     
      
    2 The plaintiff claims damages for personal injury he alleges he suffered as a result of breach of a duty of care owed to him by the first defendant between 1960 and 1965, while he was a child in its care in a facility it conducted in South Australia. Having regard to the dates of the alleged breaches of duty, the plaintiff, at the same time as he filed the statement of claim, also filed a notice of motion seeking an extension of time (to 25 March 2003) to commence the proceedings. It is that application that is the subject of the present judgment. It will be convenient to continue to refer to the first respondent to the notice of motion as the first defendant (to the proceedings). 
     
      
    3 Since the events giving rise to the claim allegedly occurred in South Australia it is (it is common ground) the law of South Australia that governs the application: John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson [2000] HCA 36; 203 CLR 503. The first defendant has appeared by counsel to resist the application. The second defendant has not appeared or participated in the proceedings. 
     
      
    4 The relevant legislation is the Limitation of Actions Act 1936 (SA) (“the Act”). By s36(1) of the Act an action for personal injury must be commenced within three years of the date on which the cause of action arose; by s45, where the plaintiff is under a legal disability, that time is extended for the duration of the disability. 
     
      
    5 The plaintiff was born on 22 September 1952. On the facts asserted in the statement of claim (and not, for the purpose of this application, in issue) the cause of action pleaded arose over a period that began in 1960 and ended in 1965. By reason of the plaintiff’s age, and the definition of “disability”, he was, until 23 September 1973, under a disability. Accordingly, the limitation period would have expired on 23 September 1976. That is because until 1971 the age of majority in South Australia was 21. The plaintiff turned 21 on 23 September 1973. Any cause of action he then had would, as the law then stood, have become statute barred on 23 September 1976. 
     
      
    6 However, from 15 April 1971, the age of majority was reduced to 18. the amending legislation provided that a person between the ages of 18 and 21 at that time (as was the plaintiff) attained majority on that date – 15 April 1971. The limitation period thus expired on 15 April 1974. 
     
      
    7 S48 of the Act confers upon the court a power to extend the limitation period in the circumstances there specified. Until 1 May 2004 s48 was relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        48 General power to extend periods of limitation 
         
         
        (1) Subject to this section, where an Act, Regulation, Rule or by-law prescribes or limits the time for - 
         
         
          
          (a) instituting an action;  
          
         (b) … 
          
         (c) … 
         
        
        
         a court may extend the time so prescribed or limited to such an extent, and upon such terms (if any) as the justice of the case may require. 
         
         
        (2) … 
         
         
        (3) This section does not - 
         
         
          
          (a) …;  
          
         (b) empower a court to extend the limitation of time prescribed by this Act unless it is satisfied - 
          
           
           (i) that facts material to the plaintiff’s case were not ascertained by him until some point of time occurring within twelve months before the expiration of the period of limitation or occurring after the expiration of that period and that the action was instituted within twelve months after the ascertainment of those facts by the plaintiff; or  
           
           
           (ii) that the plaintiff’s failure to institute the action within the period of the limitation resulted from representations or conduct of the defendant, or a person whom the plaintiff reasonably believed to be acting on behalf of the defendant, and was reasonable in view of those representations or that conduct and other relevant circumstances, 
           
          
         
         
         and that in all the circumstances of the case it is just to grant the extension of time.” 
        
       
      
    8 On 1 May 2004 the section was amended by the insertion of sub-ss(3a) and (3b). Those sub-sections provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3a) A fact is not be regarded as material to the plaintiff’s case for the purposes of sub-section (3)(b)(i) unless - 
         
         
          
          (a) it forms an essential element of the plaintiff’s cause of action; or  
          
         (b) it would have major significance on an assessment of the plaintiff’s loss. 
         
        
       
       
        
        Example - 
         
        In a case involving personal injury, a fact might qualify as a fact material to the plaintiff’s case if it establishes -  
         
         
          
          (a) a substantial reduction of the plaintiff’s capacity to work; or 
          
         (b) that the plaintiff will require substantially more medical care than previously expected; or 
          
          (c) a significant loss of expectation of life. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3b) In determining whether it is, in all the circumstances of a case, just to grant an extension of time, the court should have regard to - 
         
         
          
          (a) the period of extension sought, and, in particular, whether the passage of time has prejudiced a fair trial; and 
          
         (b) the desirability of bringing litigation to an end within a reasonable period and thus promoting a more certain basis for the calculation of insurance premiums; and 
          
          (c) the nature and extent of the plaintiff’s loss and the conduct of the parties generally; and 
           
          (d) any other relevant factor.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    9 These subsections quite radically restrict the approach to be taken to the determination of (i) whether a fact or facts not ascertained by the plaintiff within the limitation period is or are material to his/her case; and (ii) whether it is just to extend the time for commencing proceedings. The parties are at issue as to whether sub-ss(3a) and (3b) apply to the present application. I will deal with this in due course. 
     
      
       
      The statement of claim 
       
      
    10 The allegations of fact pleaded in the statement of claim are, essentially, as follows. In 1960, when he was eight years old, the plaintiff was placed by his father in the full-time care and custody of the first defendant. The first defendant placed him in a home called Eden Park, in South Australia. The second defendant was employed by the first defendant as a full-time carer and supervisor at the home. Several months after arriving at the home, the plaintiff was sexually assaulted by another boy who was a resident. The plaintiff brought this to the attention of the second defendant, who took no action. Thereafter, until 1965, the plaintiff was regularly sexually assaulted by other boys at the home. After a time, the second defendant himself began to assault the plaintiff, and did so frequently thereafter. As a consequence of the assaults, the plaintiff suffered (at the time) physical injury; and he also suffered, and continues to suffer, psychological and/or psychiatric injury. 
     
      
    11 The plaintiff pleads that, by its failure to supervise other boys in the home, its failure to investigate or take any action in relation to his report of sexual assault, and its failure to implement a system or strategy to protect the plaintiff, the first defendant was in breach of a duty it owed him to take reasonable care for his safety. He also pleads that the first defendant is vicariously liable for the assaults committed on him by the second defendant; that the first defendant was in a fiduciary relationship with him; and that, by its conduct (or by its omissions), the first defendant was in breach of that fiduciary duty. He claims damages. 
     
      
    12 For the plaintiff to succeed in the present application, it is necessary that he establish: 
     
      
       
      (i) that a fact or facts material to his case was or were not ascertained by him until on or after 25 March 2002 (that is, within 12 months of the filing of the statement of claim, although the identification of the date is complicated by negotiations between the parties, as a result of which the first defendant formally agreed to a cessation of the running of time); alternatively 
       
       
      (ii) that his failure to institute the action within the time specified (that is, by 15 April 1974) resulted from representations or conduct of the first defendant, or a person whom he reasonably believed to be acting on behalf of the first defendant; and, in either case  
       
       
      (iii) that in all the circumstances of the case it is just to grant the extension of time. 
       
      
    13 The plaintiff invokes both alternatives: he claims that certain facts material to his case were not ascertained by him until dates after the expiration of the limitation period, but within the period that may be allowed under s48 (as modified by the agreement between the parties); and, additionally, that his failure to institute the proceedings was brought about by representations or conduct of the first defendant (or a person he reasonably believed was acting on behalf of the first defendant). Sub-ss(3a) and (3b), if they apply, cast light upon the approach to determining whether any one or more of the facts the plaintiff claims not to have been ascertained by him until some point within that time properly qualifies as “material”; and upon the question whether it is just in all the circumstances to grant the extension of time sought. 
     
      
    14 As the focus on “the justice of the case” makes clear, the remedy is, even if the plaintiff establishes the requisite ignorance of material facts, discretionary. It is necessary to have regard to any prejudice that might accrue to the first defendant were the order made. The onus lies on the plaintiff to negative any such prejudice. After such a lapse of time it ought to be presumed that the first defendant will have suffered some prejudice by reason of the loss of possible witnesses, or faded recollections, or other circumstances. In fact, in this case, the first defendant has set out to make a positive case that it would be significantly prejudiced if, after 40 years, the plaintiff were permitted to bring the action. 
     
      
    15 It is convenient here to set out a little of the evidence, much of which is uncontroversial for this purpose and which supports the allegations made in the statement of claim. For the purpose of the present application I am satisfied of the following facts. 
     
      
    16 As mentioned above, the plaintiff was born on 23 September 1952. At the age of about eight years, he was surrendered by his father (whose wife had left him some years earlier) into the care of the first defendant. The first defendant placed him at Eden Park Boys’ Home at Mount Barker, South Australia. The second defendant, Keith Ellis, was an officer of the first defendant, employed at Eden Park as a full-time carer and supervisor of children accommodated at the home. About a month after his arrival, the plaintiff was sexually assaulted by one of the older boys, with sufficient force to cause him to bleed quite heavily. The bleeding continued for about a week. The plaintiff recounted this event to other children, but received no assistance or advice. He therefore reported the assault to the second defendant. The second defendant told him not to cry, and not to be stupid. He replaced the plaintiff’s clothing and told him to have a shower. 
     
      
    17 Thereafter, sexual assaults became a regular event, occurring at least once or twice weekly over a number of years. The plaintiff calculated that he suffered at least three hundred or four hundred such assaults, at the hands of nine boys (some of whom he named). The assaults took the form of anal penetration, forced masturbation, and forced oral sex. 
     
      
    18 For the next year, the plaintiff did not make any further report of the assaults. Eventually, however, at the instigation of another boy, he again reported, to the second defendant, what was happening. He received some comfort. After another, brutal, attack by one of the older boys, the plaintiff again consulted the second defendant. The second defendant responded by himself sexually abusing the plaintiff. He did this regularly over the ensuing year. Initially, the abuse perpetrated by the second defendant took the form of masturbation, but escalated to penile anal penetration. After these events, the second defendant accused the plaintiff of leading him on, and physically assaulted him with a strap. The plaintiff came to believe that the abuse was his fault. Over time, the nature of the abuse changed, becoming increasingly more severe. 
     
      
    19 When the plaintiff was about 11 or 12 (that is, in 1963 or 1964) he was taken, on three occasions, by the second defendant with three other boys to Adelaide to sell badges. The group stayed at the home of the second defendant’s mother. There, after the boys had gone to bed, the second defendant perpetrated further, and much more sustained, abuse upon the plaintiff. He forced the plaintiff to masturbate him, participate in oral sex, and digitally penetrate his anus. He had penile/anal penetration at least twice during the night. 
     
      
    20 The plaintiff began to run away from Eden Park. He was regularly returned either by police or older boys. He was physically punished, by another officer, and locked up for two to three days at a time, in what amounted to an isolation cell, without food or blankets. The sexual assaults by the second defendant continued (with a brief pause) until the plaintiff was about 12 years of age, and about to begin high school. The assaults ceased when the plaintiff was 13 years of age. Once the assaults ceased, the second defendant became very nasty towards the plaintiff, giving him unpleasant tasks, falsely reporting misconduct, and physically beating him. On occasions the plaintiff was bruised, bleeding and his eyes were blackened. The beating was brought to an end by another, new, officer, to whom the assaults had been reported by other children. 
     
      
    21 Eventually, at school after a beating, the plaintiff reported the assault to his soccer coach, who in turn reported it to Eden Park. The plaintiff was then beaten by another officer who held the rank of Brigadier. 
     
      
    22 The plaintiff became concerned about the welfare of younger children and this eventually led him into confrontation with a number of Aboriginal boys in the home. The plaintiff was injured, requiring medical treatment to suture a wound. This precipitated another beating, as punishment for the trouble caused. 
     
      
    23 The above account of the plaintiff’s days at Eden Park is largely drawn from a statement made by him on 9 May 2001. He swore an affidavit on 19 March 2003, giving some detail of his life after leaving Eden Park. Again for the purposes only of this application, I accept the plaintiff’s evidence (which was not, in any significant way, challenged). There was also affidavit evidence from the plaintiff’s solicitor (Ms Julia Slape) and further affidavits sworn by the plaintiff and others. The plaintiff’s further evidence deals with his post-Eden Park history. Other affidavit evidence deals with the history of the plaintiff’s claim, and negotiations between his solicitors and solicitors representing the first defendant. In evidence also were reports of Dr Jonathan Phillips, psychiatrist, and Mr John Taylor, psychologist. 
     
      
    24 The plaintiff left Eden Park at the age of 16 and joined a circus. He has not, until recently, discussed or disclosed his experiences. He was socially isolated. He felt shame, and, while he seems to have recognised that his behaviour was different from that of others, he did not understand why that was so. 
     
      
    25 He undertook a variety of forms of employment, most of which he lost due to absenteeism. He held one position at Gosford Hospital for ten years, but was subsequently demoted, for the same reason, absenteeism.  
     
      
    26 He experienced sleep disturbances, and nightmares, involving the Eden Park years. He was not conscious that he was not functioning normally. In 1971 and 1974, at the ages of 18 and 22, he made attempts on his own life, firstly by trying to shoot himself, and secondly by cutting his wrist. 
     
      
    27 He married in 1982, but for many years did not reveal details of his early life to his wife. 
     
      
    28 In 1996 the plaintiff met, by doing some building work for him, a social worker called Graham Jackson who was also a priest of the Church of England. In 1999 he consulted Mr Jackson professionally, to discuss his personal issues. It was not, however, until late 1999 that he felt able to raise the Eden Park events and then it was only in general terms. 
     
      
    29 In about May 2000 the plaintiff’s wife spoke of the plaintiff’s history to Ms Rosanna Jones, who had some contact or affiliation with the Salvation Army. 
     
      
    30 On 5 May 2000 Ms Jones wrote to Major Lingard, the public relations secretary for the Salvation Army. The purpose of her letter was to draw the Salvation Army’s attention to the history of abuse of the plaintiff (and others). She declined to identify the plaintiff, but did identify Eden Park. The main point of her letter was to encourage the Salvation Army to acknowledge publicly the kind of treatment the plaintiff had experienced. Her letter was passed to Lieutenant Colonel Brian Hood, who identified himself as “Secretary for Personnel”, and who responded to Ms Jones’ letter on 5 July 2000. Lieutenant Colonel Hood, in effect, informed Ms Jones that she had communicated with the wrong branch of the Salvation Army. He told her that the Salvation Army is organised into two territories – the eastern and the southern – and that while the two cooperated with, they were independent of, one another. He said that Eden Park was in the southern territory and that, as he was employed in the eastern territory, he was unable to pursue the matter. He undertook to forward the letter to the appropriate officer in the southern territory. He also advised Ms Jones of the Salvation Army’s then operative procedures for responding to complaints of mistreatment. 
     
      
    31 Eventually, on 11 August 2000, Mr Philip Brewin (a director in the Melbourne firm Nevett Ford, solicitors who represent the first defendant) wrote to Ms Jones on behalf of the Salvation Army. It is of some significance that he identified the entity on whose behalf he wrote as “the Salvation Army Southern Territory”. He informed Ms Jones that the firm’s instructions were to investigate the complaint: 
     
      
       
        
        “in a compassionate and caring manner and to provide practical help to persons who claim to have suffered abuse”. 
        
       
       
      He invited Ms Jones to pass his letter on to the plaintiff with a request that he contact the writer in order to enable arrangements to be made with a view to obtaining a detailed statement. (Of course, at this stage Mr Brewin had no way of knowing the identity of the person the subject of Ms Jones’ letter and therefore of communicating with him directly.) 
       
      
    32 Ms Jones, however, did not give the plaintiff Mr Brewin’s letter nor tell him about it. He was unaware of it until he found it in February 2001 whilst assisting Ms Jones to clean a room in her house. 
     
      
    33 A few weeks later (on 26 March) the plaintiff did telephone Mr Brewin. As a result of the conversation, Mr Brewin formed the view that the plaintiff “was intent on pursuing” a claim for compensation against “the Salvation Army”. On 30 March 2001 Mr Brewin wrote directly to the plaintiff, saying that “the Salvation Army” had asked him to obtain a detailed statement concerning the plaintiff’s experiences at Eden Park. He asked the plaintiff to contact Messrs Harris, Hyde and Page, Nevett Ford’s Sydney agents. He named Mr Jonathon Harris as the solicitor to contact. On 20 April 2001 Ms Annette Wilson, acting in substitution for Mr Harris, also wrote directly to the plaintiff, with a similar request to that of Mr Brewin. On 4 May 2001 the plaintiff met Ms Wilson in conference. He provided information which was transcribed into a statement, eventually dated 9 May 2001. The statement is that to which I have earlier referred and is the source of much of the factual history already recounted. One matter may here be noted. A draft of the statement was sent to the plaintiff for his confirmation. He made one amendment to the draft, by deleting two lines thereof. He did not delete the last line in the draft, which reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do believe I should be given some sort of monetary compensation.” 
        
       
       
      I flag this because it became a matter of some significance, particularly in the cross examination of the plaintiff, and also in the argument advanced on behalf of the first defendant.  
       
      
    34 At the conclusion of the conference on 4 May Ms Wilson suggested that the plaintiff should seek his own legal advice. This was the first such suggestion that had been made to the plaintiff. He had not previously realised that he may have any actionable legal rights. However, on 22 May Ms Wilson advised Mr Brewin that, in her view, the plaintiff was “looking for compensation”. The plaintiff, in conference with Ms Wilson, made reference to an organisation known as “Clan” which was exploring the possibility of “a class action” (presumably against “the Salvation Army”); the plaintiff said that, while he did not then wish to be involved, he did, nevertheless, believe that he should receive “monetary compensation”; and he asked her for advice about his “legal rights” (which she, unsurprisingly, declined to give).  
     
      
    35 On 25 May 2001 Mr Brewin again wrote to the plaintiff. After thanking the plaintiff for recounting his experiences, and recognising the distress it must have caused to him, Mr Brewin informed the plaintiff that he had asked “the Army” to set in train investigation of the allegations. Specifically in response to the plaintiff’s claim for compensation, Mr Brewin said that he would like to obtain reports of counsellors, medical practitioners or psychiatrists from whom the plaintiff had received counselling or treatment as a result of his Eden Park experiences. He enclosed authorities for the plaintiff to sign if he agreed to this. 
     
      
    36 On 20 June 2001 the plaintiff contacted his present solicitors and gave them a copy of the statement he had made to Ms Wilson. 
     
      
    37 There followed a volume of correspondence between solicitors. On 1 August 2001 Mr Jackson provided the plaintiff with a report. After setting out some preliminary history, Mr Jackson provided an assessment of the plaintiff’s then position. He recorded that the plaintiff had revealed an extensive and extreme history of sexual and physical abuse at Eden Park and reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “My observations of his affect during these interviews and during my informal sessions with him clearly indicate a person who has been deeply damaged by his life experiences. I am fully confident that the expression of his emotions was and remains genuine, and, if anything he is repressing and suppressing emotions. These expressions of emotions cover extreme anger, suicidal ideation and unrealistic personal guilt. 
        
       
       
        
        15. In addition to the emotions exhibited during his interview it is clear that he is suffering from a number of standard symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. …” 
        
       
       
      The plaintiff sent a copy of this report to Ms Wilson on 9 August 2001. He also advised her that he had consulted Dr Peter Kemp, a general practitioner, who had treated him for approximately ten years. 
       
      
    38 On 20 August 2001 Mr Brewin responded to the plaintiff’s letter of 9 August. He identified the subject matter of the letter as “the Salvation Army”. Significantly, he wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “We have put your allegations to the officers named by you and also to Mr Ellis. We would like now to meet again with you in conference to discuss the various responses to your statements and also to the report of Mr Graham Jackson kindly provided to us by you.” 
        
       
       
      Mr Brewin confirmed that “the Salvation Army” would meet the reasonable costs of Mr Jackson’s report and also the plaintiff’s travelling costs for the meeting with Ms Wilson.  
       
      
    39 At the request of Mr Brewin, on 7 September 2001 a conference took place at the plaintiff’s home. Present were Mr Brewin, Mr Jackson and the plaintiff. At that conference Mr Brewin had in his possession and read from certain statements (which the plaintiff took to have been made by some of the officers at Eden Park at the time of his residency there). Mr Brewin said that these statements had been obtained for the purpose of investigating the plaintiff’s allegations. The plaintiff participated in the conference and answered questions that were put to him. 
     
      
    40 On 10 September 2001 and on 21 September 2001, again at the request of Mr Brewin on behalf of “the Salvation Army”, the plaintiff attended a meeting with Dr Doron Samuell, a psychiatrist. Dr Samuell then provided a report, dated 28 September 2001, to the plaintiff’s solicitors. Dr Samuell recounted, at some length, the plaintiff’s history, and his allegations. Acting on the assumption (as to which he did not imply doubt) that the allegations and history were accurate, Dr Samuell described the effects of the abuse as “protean”. He then set out the plaintiff’s symptomatology, and reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given Mr Rundle’s age when these traumas occurred it is reasonable to make a diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Personality Disorder, not otherwise specified. 
        
       
       
        
        The Post Traumatic Stress Disorder manifests itself with frequent re-experience phenomena, avoidance phenomena and hyper-vigilance. This Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is chronic and severe. It is unlikely to respond to any significant treatment. 
        
       
       
        
        With respect to the Personality Disorder, not otherwise specified, given Mr Rundle’s age when this abuse occurred, it has indelibly changed the course of normal character development. Once again, this is unlikely to be responsive to treatment. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Rundle is likely to experience most benefit from an acknowledgement, by both Sergeant Ellis and the Salvation Army, of the events that have transpired. Certainly, his social functioning is impaired on a full and permanent basis. His capacity for work is not fully impaired, and he is perhaps able to work at a level of 30-40% of what may be considered normal for a person in his circumstances who had not suffered the same extent of abuse.” 
        
       
       
      On 12 August 2002 Dr Samuell furnished a short supplementary report. It adds little to the original. 
       
      
    41 It was on reading Dr Samuell’s report that the plaintiff realised, for the first time, that there existed a link between his experiences at Eden Park and his subsequent, adult, behaviour, and that he was actually suffering a disability. 
     
      
    42 By September 2001, it is apparent, “the Salvation Army” and the plaintiff considered themselves to be in negotiations with respect to the plaintiff’s claim for compensation. For that purpose a “Deed of Confidentiality” was prepared, and eventually executed. (The evidence is quite unclear about the dates of its operation. The copy of the Deed that is in evidence is signed only by the plaintiff and not on behalf of the first defendant and is undated. On the plaintiff’s evidence, the Deed was returned signed by him, (with an amendment) to Nevett Ford on 19 October 2002. But a letter from Mr Brewin, accepting the amendment, is dated 15 January 2002). For present purposes, the most significant aspects of the Deed are: (i) that the Deed was expressed to have been made between the plaintiff and “the Salvation Army (Victoria) Property Trust (the Salvation Army)”; and (ii) that “the Salvation Army” agreed that it would not, in the event that negotiations did not result in a settlement of the plaintiff’s claim, invoke a defence under the Act “by reason only of time passing while negotiations are under way”. Negotiations did proceed. They did not result in a resolution of the plaintiff’s claims. The agreement represented by the Deed had the effect of suspending the running of the limitation period for a period from about 19 October 2001 (or alternatively 15 January 2002) until an (unspecified) date when negotiations ceased. 
     
      
    43 On 29 August 2002 an informal settlement conference took place in Sydney. It has, at times, been referred to as “a mediation”. It also did not result in resolution. 
     
      
    44 On 9 October 2002 the plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to Mr Brewin seeking certain information. This included the correct legal identification of the entity in whose custody and care the plaintiff was placed during his time at Eden Park. On 15 October Mr Brewin responded. He identified the “entity” as “the Salvation Army (South Australia) Property Trust”. He provided some additional information about the structure of the first defendant, which appears to be a statutory corporation. This was the first time the plaintiff knew of the correct nomination of the entity that had conducted Eden Park at the time of the plaintiff’s accommodation there. 
     
      
    45 I infer from these last two letters that, in about the middle of October 2002, the respective solicitors for the parties had concluded that informal resolution was unlikely, and that the plaintiff’s claim would proceed to litigation. There is, however, no clear evidence as to any date on which this occurred, and thus when the suspension of time provided for by the Deed came to an end. 
     
      
    46 The plaintiff, his solicitor Ms Slape, and counsel, conferred on 8 November 2002. It was recognised that, if the plaintiff were to proceed with a claim against the first defendant, an extension of the limitation period would be necessary. Counsel advised that additional evidence was required to support the application for extension of time. The steps recommended were taken. The statement of claim was filed, together with the application to extend time, on 25 March 2003. 
     
      
    47 Following service of the statement of claim, Ms Wilson began investigating the plaintiff’s allegations. On four occasions between April 2003 and February 2004 she requested further and better particulars of the claims. The information sought included the identities of various individuals mentioned by the plaintiff either in his statement of claim or affidavits; details of medical treatment sought or received by the plaintiff; details relevant to the history recounted by Dr Samuell in his reports; identification of a psychiatrist by whom the plaintiff claimed to have been treated; and details of the plaintiff’s employment history. 
     
      
    48 The plaintiff’s solicitors responded to each request, although they were not always able to provide the information sought. For example, the plaintiff was unable to remember the name of the psychiatrist, but said that he had practised from rooms in Mann Street, Gosford. 
     
      
    49 On 18 August 2003 a programme was televised on the ABC programme “Four Corners”. This was called “The Homies”. Its subject matter was victims of child abuse in Salvation Army children’s homes during the period 1950 – 1979. A spokesman for the Salvation Army, Mr John Dalziel, was interviewed. Mr Dalziel made some significant admissions of such abuse. Two questions and answers are said to be of considerable moment in relation to the present application. They were: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: I know that your whole impetus is to help the victims and you have said that most eloquently, tell me then why were the Salvation Army’s lawyers telling the victims that the statute of limitations would be brought up by them to prevent the men pursuing their claims in the civil court? 
         
         
        A: That’s the first time I’ve heard that and they should not have said it because, as I have previously stated, we have no statute of limitations applying to victims of the Salvation Army. 
         
         
        Q: Your lawyers have quoted the statute of limitations in defence of the Salvation Army position. 
        
       
       
        
        A: Well, the Salvation Army makes it clear that we will never close the book on any one who has gone through our care as long as they live, and I believe we’ve demonstrated that with the people we’ve been helping.” 
        
       
       
      The significance sought to be placed on this on behalf of the plaintiff will be explored later. 
       
      
    50 On 29 August 2003 the plaintiff was psychiatrically examined by Dr Jonathan Phillips. Like Dr Samuell, Dr Phillips diagnosed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder directly consequential upon the plaintiff’s experiences at Eden Park. He considered the plaintiff to be disabled by his symptoms, with exacerbation as a result of learning of the connection between his childhood experiences and his adult behavioural symptoms.  
     
      
    51 There was then considerable communication between solicitors including disputes over production of documents. 
     
      
    52 On 30 March 2005 Ms Slape wrote to Mr Brewin. She raised three matters. First, she sought an explanation for the first defendant’s opposition (which had, apparently, been communicated to her) to the hearing of the application for extension of time. Secondly, she contended that the first defendant was, on the basis of the High Court decision in The Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39; 170 CLR 394, estopped from relying upon the limitation period. Thirdly, she included the following paragraph: 
     
      
       
        
        “We refer you to the requirements on a respondent to an application for extension of time set out in  
        Nowlan v Marson Transport 
         [2001] NSWCA 364 at paras 22 – 32 and 43 – 46. You are required to specify the grounds of your opposition to our application for extension of time. 
         
         
        I note in this context that you have told us that you have statements from Major Allen Laurens and Major David Osborne. If you allege prejudice through delay it will be necessary for you to disclose the contents of those statements or we will ask the court to draw the obvious inference that no such prejudice exists.” 
        
       
      
    53 On 4 April Mr Doran (a solicitor employed by Nevett Ford) replied, explaining that the basis on which he opposed the hearing of the application was that criminal charges were pending against the second defendant. He therefore considered the references to Verwayen and Nowlan as “irrelevant and unnecessary”. 
     
      
    54 On 24 May Ms Slape telephoned Mr Doran. Inter alia, she asked Mr Doran when he would be in a position to provide details of his objection (if any) to the application for extension of time. Mr Doran initially replied by saying that he had not read the decision in Nowlan; he did not concede that it applied, given that the issue is under South Australian jurisdiction. He said he would need to read the decision and consult counsel. On 2 June Mr Doran replied in writing. Relevantly to this question, he wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “With respect, your reliance on  
        Nowlan 
         appears to assume that the first defendant has not made plain its opposition to the extension of time application. We most strenuously reject that assumption as being correct. 
        
       
       
        
        The first defendant has filed and served seven affidavits in opposition to the application. Each of those affidavits sets out in detail the matters to which they are addressed. The plaintiff can be under no misapprehension as to the factual basis upon which the first defendant opposes an extension of time being granted. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, the decision in  
        Nowlan 
         turned on its facts and the comments of Heydon JA and Young CJ in Equity that you rely on are  
        obiter dicta 
        . You have not pointed to any rule of the Supreme Court or practice direction that requires the first defendant to state its objections to the extension of time application (see paragraph 32). 
        
       
       
        
        Finally, if it is a principle of the conduct of the extension of time applications for a statement of opposition to be given, it is only appropriate where it is not clear on the material filed what the grounds of the opposition are (see paragraph 44). 
        
       
       
        
        It follows therefore that the affidavits in opposition upon which the first defendant relies set out the scope of its opposition to the extension of time application so that the plaintiff cannot be said to be taken by surprise in how opposition to the application will be conducted at the hearing.” 
        
       
      
    55 Under the heading “Conclusion” Mr Doran wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Given the substance of its affidavits, there is no requirement for, or obligation on, the first defendant to state objections to the extension of time application. In short, any principle to be drawn from  
        Nowlan 
         does not apply to this proceeding.” 
        
       
      
    56 This drew a response from Ms Slape dated 6 June 2005. It is unnecessary to reproduce what Ms Slape said. It is sufficient to note that the issue was plainly joined between the legal representatives. 
     
      
    57 In 2004 a Commission of Inquiry was appointed in South Australia. The Commission was charged to inquire into allegations, inter alia, of sexual abuse of children in State care. The Inquiry opened on 9 December 2004. On 12 May 2004 the Commissioner furnished to the Governor of South Australia an interim report. (I mention this because the Report has been put in evidence on behalf of the plaintiff in these proceedings. Although the Inquiry was directed to children in State care Mr Brewin said that it also concerned children who were wards of the state but accommodated in religious institutions and that some former residents of Eden Park gave evidence. In any event, as no relevant finding or extract of the Report was identified, it is difficult to perceive its materiality to the present application.) It seems also that, in about 2003, the Senate appointed a Committee to enquire into the treatment of children in institutional care. In July 2003 the Salvation Army Australia Eastern and Southern Territories made a joint submission to the inquiry. This also was put in evidence on behalf of the plaintiff. Again, the basis upon which it is said to assist in resolution of the present dispute escapes me. The submissions contained little of real substance, at least that is relevant to the present proceedings. 
     
      
       
      The first defendant’s case 
       
      
    58 Mr Brewin, Ms Wilson and Mr Doran, and others, provided affidavits on behalf of the first defendant. Mr Brewin and Mr Doran gave oral evidence. 
     
      
    59 With respect to the second limb of s48(3)(b)(i), whether it is just to grant the extension, the first defendant sought to make a case of actual hardship. In short, its position was that, by reason of the passage of time since the events in question, it is unable adequately to investigate the plaintiff’s claims. A good deal of preliminary work has been undertaken in the investigation of claims generally, including that of the plaintiff.  
     
      
    60 Evidence was given of largely unsuccessful attempts to locate various of the individuals identified by the plaintiff. Some of these were other residents; others were staff members or Salvation Army officers. There was formal evidence (not surprisingly) that some have died. 
     
      
    61 The first defendant’s solicitors also focussed upon assertions made by the plaintiff of his chequered employment history, which, on his case, was (although previously unknown to him) a consequence of the psychiatric condition with which he has now been diagnosed; and of the suicide attempts in 1971 and 1974. In this respect, the plaintiff had advised the first defendant’s solicitors that he had consulted a psychiatrist in Mann Street Gosford. He was unable to give a name of the psychiatrist. The evidence of the first defendant was that they had made what attempts they reasonably could to identify and locate such a person, but without result. Accordingly, on the first defendant’s case, it would be unable to investigate the plaintiff’s allegations in this respect. 
     
      
    62 I am prepared to accept, even without the detailed evidence provided on behalf of the first defendant, that, after a lapse of 40 years, it would be difficult to locate relevant witnesses, and that any who would be able to be located would be likely to have, at most, sketchy and probably unreliable recollections. 
     
      
    63 The plaintiff’s solicitors themselves were able to locate some of the individuals named. However, there was no evidence that any of those located was able to elucidate the issues. 
     
      
    64 There was one worrying aspect of the evidence elicited on behalf of the first defendant upon which I must comment. Mr Doran swore an affidavit on 14 December 2005. The thrust of this affidavit was, in a careful and painstaking way, to detail some of the attempts that had been made to locate potential witnesses, or individuals who could provide information.  
     
      
    65 Mr Doran’s affidavit evidence concerning a Major Ian Huxley, an officer of the first defendant, was of some concern. Mr Doran deposed that Major Huxley had died on 11 September 2004. That, no doubt, was correct, and was established by a death certificate. However, to Mr Doran’s knowledge, a statement had been taken from Major Huxley before his death. He did not disclose this, leaving the impression that the first defendant was deprived of any opportunity to obtain information from this source. 
     
      
    66 More worryingly, in an affidavit sworn on 7 February 2006, Mr Doran made reference to a Dr Le Page. Dr Le Page was shown, by other evidence, to have been a psychiatrist who, during the relevant period, attended at Eden Park from time to time to care for some of the residents. Contact was made on behalf of the first defendant with Dr Le Page who, on 6 June 2003, wrote to Ms Wilson (in response to a subpoena) saying that he did not have in his possession any relevant documentation in relation to the plaintiff. Later, in October 2005, Mr Doran wrote to Dr Le Page, and subsequently spoke to him by telephone. Again, it was made clear that he was unable to provide any relevant documentation, although he had arranged for some searches to be made. All this was included in Mr Doran’s affidavit. What is worrying about this is that, in cross examination, Mr Doran agreed that he knew that Dr Le Page had only treated residents who had been referred through a particular clinic. He was not a general consultant to Eden Park. He had never treated the plaintiff. 
     
      
    67 Mr Doran’s affidavit evidence, in this respect, was plainly intended to create the impression that the first defendant had been prejudiced by the inability to obtain documentary material from Dr Le Page. That was, in my opinion, a misleading impression, in the light of the knowledge that Dr Le Page had never been involved in the plaintiff’s treatment. That is, the effluxion of time was, in this respect, entirely incidental. Contrary to the impression given, it did not work any prejudice to the first defendant. Both Mr Brewin and Mr Doran were cross-examined about this. I found the answers of each on this issue to be less than satisfactory. 
     
      
    68 In cross-examination of these two witnesses it became clear that the contents of their affidavits presented something of a one-sided account of the results of their endeavours. While they emphasised those inquiries that had yielded no or little useful information they did not disclose that they had in fact been able to obtain some significant information. Following cross-examination a somewhat different picture emerged. The solicitors had, for example, obtained statements from a number of officers or former officers of the Salvation Army who had been engaged at Eden Park. One, at least, had given a good deal of detailed information about the conduct of the second defendant, including acceptance of the possibility that the plaintiff may have been physically ill-treated by him. 
     
      
       
      Material facts: s48(3)(b)(i) 
       
      
    69 When pressed senior counsel for the plaintiff identified a number of what he contended were material facts unascertained by the plaintiff until after 25 March 2002. These were: 
     
      
       
      (i) that Dr Samuell assessed the plaintiff’s capacity for work to have been reduced, by reason of his psychiatric disability, by 60-70 percent; 
       
       
      (ii) that the correct identification of the entity responsible for the plaintiff’s case at Eden Park, for the purpose of bringing proceedings, was the Salvation Army (South Australian Property Trust); 
       
       
      (iii) features of the plaintiff’s psychological makeup described by Mr Jackson as–  
       
      
    · social isolation· high levels of shame· difficulty of developing normal relationships· very low self-esteem· extreme difficulty in relating to people· innate suspicion and defensiveness especially towards men· lack of follow up services· need for cognitive behavioural therapy· need for continuing counselling; 
     
      
       
      (iv) the failure of the informal settlement conference on 29 August 2002. 
       
      
    70 Whether any one or more of these qualifies as a “material fact” within the meaning of s48(3)(b)(i) may depend, in part at least, upon whether or not the later-introduced sub-ss(3a) and (3b) apply. It is therefore necessary now to consider that question. These subsections were introduced into the Act with effect from 1 May 2004, that is, after the statement of claim was filed. Initially, counsel for the first defendant conceded that they do not have retrospective effect and therefore do not apply in this case. However, on further reflection, counsel retracted that concession, and argued that sub-ss(3a) and (3b) are applicable to the determination of the plaintiff’s claim for extension of time. 
     
      
    71 S48 in its unamended form was considered by the High Court in Sola Optical Australia Pty Ltd v Mills [1987] HCA 57; 163 CLR 628. The High Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        “A fact is material to the plaintiff's case if it is both relevant to the issues to be proved if the plaintiff is to succeed in obtaining an award of damages sufficient to justify bringing the action and is of sufficient importance to be likely to have a bearing on the case. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines the word ‘material’, inter alia, to mean ‘Of such significance as to be likely to influence the determination of a cause’. Although a definition attributed to the sixteenth century, in our opinion it provides an apt guide to the intention of the legislature in choosing to refer, without any elaboration, to ‘facts material to the plaintiff's case’.” 
        
       
      
    72 The Court rejected the proposition that, in order for an unascertained fact to be “material” for the purposes of the sub-section, it was necessary that it have some bearing upon the plaintiff’s decision to bring proceedings. There are thus two components to the determination of materiality of a fact: (i) it is relevant to the issues to be proved if the plaintiff is to succeed in obtaining an award of damages sufficient to justify bringing the action; and (ii) it is of sufficient importance to have a bearing on the case. 
     
      
    73 Sub-ss(3a) and (3b) were introduced into the Act by the Law Reform (Ipp Recommendations) Act 2004. Schedule 1 of that Act includes the following clear statement: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The amendments made by the Law Reform (Ipp Recommendations) Act 2004 … are intended to apply only prospectively. 
         
         
        (2) If a cause of action that is based wholly or partly on an event that occurred before the commencement of the Ipp Recommendations Act arises after the commencement of the Ipp Recommendations Act, it will be determined as if the amendments had not been enacted. 
         
         
          
          Example— 
           
          Suppose that A was exposed to asbestos in 1990 but a resultant illness is not diagnosed until after the commencement of the Ipp Recommendations Act. An action is then brought in negligence in which damages are claimed for personal injury. The amendments made by the Ipp Recommendations Act would not affect the determination of liability or the assessment of damages.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    74 Clause (2) is not material to the plaintiff’s claim. It is concerned with the circumstance where the events that give rise to a cause of action predate 1 May 2004, but damage resulting therefrom is not suffered, or is not known to have been suffered, until after that date. That is plainly not the present case. However cl (1) is applicable, and is, in my opinion, in clear terms. On behalf of the first defendant, reliance was placed upon the corollary to a presumption of statutory interpretation to the effect that, in general, a statute will not be construed as taking away or altering the incidence of accrued rights the title to which consists in facts or events which have occurred before its enactment; see, for example, Reid v Reid (1886) 31 Ch D 402; Laurie v Renad [1892] 3 Ch 402; Maxwell v Murphy [1957] HCA 7; 96 CLR 261; Re Rutledge [1973] VR 733; Boral Windows v Industry Research & Development Board [1998] FCA 455; 83 FCR 215. The asserted corollary is that the principle has no application in the absence of “accrued rights”. 
     
      
    75 The argument advanced on behalf of the first defendant was that the general principle did not here apply since the plaintiff had no accrued right that was affected by the changes wrought to the interpretation of “material fact” or to the justice of granting the extension of time sought by sub-ss(3a) and (3b). The argument was put in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “Rather, the plaintiff’s problem is that, until the court grants him an extension of time in which to sue the first defendant, he has no right to take such action at all.” 
        
       
      
    76 There is a fallacy in this argument. It misconceives the relevant “accrued right”. It is true that, as at 1 May 2004, the plaintiff did not have any accrued right to take action against the first defendant; what he did have, however, was an accrued right to make an application for extension of time in accordance with the statutory law as it then stood – that is, the construction of “material fact” and the justice of granting an extension as explained in Sola Optical, unmodified by the introduction of sub-ss(3a) and (3b).  
     
      
    77 Accordingly, the principle of statutory construction recognised on behalf of the first defendant continues to apply for the plaintiff’s benefit.  
     
      
    78 I propose to determine the application on the basis that “material fact” is to be construed in accordance with Sola Optical, without reference to sub-s(3a) and that whether it is just to grant the extension is to be determined without reference to the gloss imposed by sub-s(3b). 
     
      
    79 The test of materiality so imposed has been described as “extremely modest, even some would say to the point of absurdity”: Wright v Donatelli (1995) 65 SASR 307. 
     
      
    80 The last of the so-called “material facts” propounded on behalf of the plaintiff can be despatched promptly. It concerns the failure of the informal settlement conference which took place on 29 August 2002. When asked to explain the basis on which it is claimed that the failure of a settlement conference could be a material fact for the purposes of s48, senior counsel replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because anything which is material to either the appropriateness of commencing litigation or a fact which assists in establishing any of the matters necessary to establish can be, under the  
        Sola Optical 
         test, a material fact. It is a very undemanding test … The fact that the plaintiff is unable to resolve his unlitigated claim is a matter which is material to the commencement of litigation.” 
        
       
      
    81 This is a distortion of the approach to the construction of “material fact” set out in Sola Optical, expressly relied upon on behalf of the plaintiff. I repeat, in Sola Optical, a fact was said to material if it is both: 
     
      
       
        
        “… relevant to the issues to be proved if the plaintiff is to succeed in obtaining an award of damages sufficient to justify bringing the cause the action and is of sufficient importance to be likely to have a bearing on the case.” 
        
       
      
    82 The failure of the mediation is not relevant to any issue to be proved if the plaintiff is to succeed in obtaining an award of damages; and it is not capable of having any bearing on the case which the plaintiff seeks to bring.  
     
      
    83 I reject the failure of the mediation/settlement conference as a “material fact”.  
     
      
    84 It is otherwise, however, in relation to the other “material facts” propounded on behalf of the plaintiff. Most importantly, Dr Samuell’s assessment of the plaintiff’s reduced capacity for work is, within the principles stated in Sola Optical, a relevant “material fact”. It is, indeed, a fact of precisely the same kind as the High Court held to be a “material fact” in that case. 
     
      
    85 So also is the correct identification of the first defendant. It is fundamental to the plaintiff’s case to prove that the entity he names as defendant is in fact the entity responsible for the wrongs he asserts. It is an essential matter to be proved by or on behalf of the plaintiff. It is not to the point that the plaintiff (or his solicitors) could earlier have ascertained that information: s48(3)(b)(i) is concerned only with what was in fact unascertained by the plaintiff. It contains no reference to constructive knowledge.  
     
      
    86 Counsel for the first defendant submitted (and I accept) that the failure of the mediation conference fails to meet the criteria of “material facts”. They made the same submission in respect of the contents of Mr Jackson’s reports, contending that the plaintiff gave no evidence about the reports except to record the fact that he had received them. This is, in my opinion, rather too literal, or compartmentalised, an approach to the evidence. 
     
      
    87 In para 29 of his first affidavit the plaintiff said, in reference to Dr Samuell’s first report: 
     
      
       
        
        “This was the first time I had any knowledge or basic understanding of the link between Eden Park and my behaviour and that I was actually suffering a disability.” 
        
       
      
    88 Dr Samuell’s first report (28 September 2001) postdates Mr Jackson’s first report (1 August 2001) by almost two months. If, prior to receiving Dr Samuell’s report, the plaintiff lacked an understanding of the link between his mental state and his treatment at Eden Park, or the existence of a disability (which was emotional or psychological, not physical), then it is a fair inference that he also lacked an understanding of the substance of Mr Jackson’s report. It is not necessary for the plaintiff explicitly to say, in reference to Mr Jackson’s report, that he did not know (in the sense that he had not articulated in his own mind) that he suffered from social isolation, high levels of shame, and the other matters catalogued by senior counsel for the plaintiff. What matters is that he was not aware that his personality and character features amounted to a disability; nor that there was a link between that disability and his experiences at Eden Park. Those are material facts and facts of which I am prepared to infer the plaintiff was not aware.  
     
      
    89 I am satisfied that these are “material facts” for the purpose of s48(3)(b)(i). 
     
      
    90 The written submissions advanced on behalf of the first defendant purported to challenge the materiality of the various facts propounded on behalf of the plaintiff. However, on analysis, the real challenge generally appears to be to the time at which the facts were ascertained by the plaintiff. Counsel for the first defendant made the following submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “21 It is submitted that whether the remaining facts are ‘material’ must be considered in the context of the plaintiff’s clear understanding of the effect of his experiences at Eden Park on him and an abiding intention, from early 2001, to seek compensation from the Army in respect of those experiences.” 
        
       
      
    91 They then set out a sequence of events which included the fact that the plaintiff had had nightmares, approximately once weekly, about the assaults, from 1964; that he had contacted the Salvation Army several times in about 1971 to complain about his experiences at Eden Park; that, in 1992, he had told his wife about some of the incidents; that in March 1999, he began to consult Dr Kemp in relation to sleeping difficulties resulting from “dreams re boys home”; that during 1999, he began to talk to Mr Jackson about the sexual assaults. 
     
      
    92 These can have no bearing upon whether the facts asserted are or are not “material”. They are, rather, a challenge to the date upon which he ascertained the material facts. But no clear argument was directed to this. 
     
      
       
      When did the plaintiff ascertain the material facts? 
       
      
    93 The assessment of this question is complicated by the completely unclear way in which the evidence concerning the operation of the Deed was left. As best I can determine, the Deed suspending the running of time came into operation either on 19 October 2001, or on 15 January 2002. When negotiations ceased, bringing to an end that suspension, is quite undefined, but was probably in about the middle of October 2002. 
     
      
    94 The correct identification of the first defendant is clearly a material fact which is not ascertained by the plaintiff until a time within 12 months prior to the filing of the statement of claim. That, alone, is sufficient to bring him within s48(3)(b)(i). 
     
      
    95 Counsel for the first defendant made no point concerning the operation of the Deed although, in written submissions, they assumed that it operated from 15 January 2002 to 29 August 2002. It was, no doubt, because of the operation of the Deed that they focussed upon materiality rather than the dates on which the plaintiff ascertained the material facts. 
     
      
    96 The other material facts upon which reliance is placed – identification of his psychiatric condition, and the extent of its impact upon his normal functioning – came within his knowledge on receipt of the report of Mr Jackson (on or shortly after 1 August 2001) and that of Dr Samuell (on or shortly after 28 September 2001). Apart from the operation of the Deed, these would not qualify as relevantly unascertained facts, because they came within the plaintiff’s knowledge more than 12 months prior to the issue of the statement of claim. However, by reason of the operation of the Deed, the clock on the limitation period was not ticking; accordingly, these, too, are material facts not ascertained by the plaintiff until the relevant time. 
     
      
    97 It was in this context that counsel for the first defendant placed great weight upon Mr Brewin’s opinion (and that of Ms Wilson) that, as early as the May 2001 conference, the plaintiff intended to seek compensation, or held the view that he ought to be monetarily compensated. This is, in my opinion, immaterial to the question of material facts, and to the time in which the plaintiff ascertained them. 
     
      
    98 The mere fact (if it be the fact) that the plaintiff had a view that he ought to be compensated for his treatment while at Eden Park does not bear upon his knowledge of any material fact, nor the timing of that knowledge. It does no more than show that the plaintiff had a sense of grievance which he thought should be resolved by monetary compensation. S48(3)(b)(ii) does not avail the plaintiff. 
     
      
       
      Conduct of the first defendant: s48(3)(b)(ii) 
       
      
    99 As mentioned above, counsel for the plaintiff also purported to rely upon s48(3)(b)(ii) – that the plaintiff’s failure to institute proceedings within the limitation period was brought about by representations or conduct of the first defendant, or some person he reasonably believed to be acting on its behalf. 
     
      
    100 No argument, written or oral, was directed to supporting that claim. 
     
      
    101 In opening, and during the course of the evidence, senior counsel identified the basis upon which reliance was placed on sub-para (ii) as the Deed that suspended the running of the limitation period, and the settlement negotiations. 
     
      
    102 Recourse to the terms of s48(3)(b)(ii) establishes that the provision is not and cannot be activated by those circumstances. Sub-para (ii) excuses, in appropriate circumstances, the failure of a plaintiff to institute the action within the limitation period, by reason of reliance upon conduct of or on behalf of the defendant. Axiomatically, that conduct must have occurred during the limitation period. The limitation period in this case expired on 15 April 1974. There is no evidence of conduct by or reasonably attributable to the first defendant prior to that date that could conceivably have had any bearing on the plaintiff’s failure to institute action on or before that date.  
     
      
       
      Is it just to grant an extension of time? 
       
      
    103 The starting point in any contemporary consideration of the discretion to extend a limitation period is the decision of the High Court in Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor [1996] HCA 25; 186 CLR 541. The effect of the various judgments is encapsulated in that of Dawson J, in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “The section confers a discretion upon a court to extend time and that discretion should only be exercised in favour of an applicant where, in all the circumstances, justice is best served by so doing. The onus of satisfying the court that the discretion should be exercised in favour of an applicant lies on the applicant. To discharge that onus the applicant must establish that the commencement of an action beyond the limitation period would not result in significant prejudice to the prospective defendant. I agree with McHugh J that, once the legislature has selected a limitation period, to allow the commencement of an action outside that period is prima facie prejudicial to the defendant who would otherwise have the benefit of the limitation.” 
        
       
      
    104 Toohey and Gummow JJ emphasised that the discretion is a discretion to grant, not a discretion to refuse, the extension, and that the onus lies upon the applicant. Their Honours also held, however, that an evidentiary onus lies upon their prospective defendant to raise any consideration telling against the exercise of the discretion. 
     
      
    105 Their Honours then identified “the real question” as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… whether the delay has made the chances of a fair trial unlikely.” 
        
       
       
      If the delay has not made the chances of a fair trial unlikely, then, their Honours held, there is no reason why the discretion should not be exercised in favour of the respondent. 
       
      
    106 It was in the judgment of McHugh J that the most powerful analysis of the legislation appears. Having held, in concurrence with the other members of the Court, that the applicant retains the onus of persuading the Court that justice requires the exercise of the discretion in his or her favour, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The discretion to extend time must be exercised in the context of the rationales for the existence of limitation periods. For nearly 400 years, the policy of the law has been to fix definite time limits (usually six but often three years) for prosecuting civil claims. The enactment of time limitations has been driven by the general perception that ‘[w]here there is delay the whole quality of justice deteriorates’. Sometimes the deterioration in quality is palpable, as in the case where a crucial witness is dead or an important document has been destroyed. But sometimes, perhaps more often than we realise, the deterioration in quality is not recognisable even by the parties. Prejudice may exist without the parties or anybody else realising that it exists. As the United States Supreme Court pointed out in  
        Barker v Wingo 
         [(1972) 407 US 514 at 532] ‘what has been forgotten can rarely be shown’. So, it must often happen that important, perhaps decisive, evidence has disappeared without anybody now ‘knowing’ that it ever existed. Similarly, it must often happen that time will diminish the significance of a known fact or circumstance because its relationship to the cause of action is no longer as apparent as it was when the cause of action arose. A verdict may appear well based on the evidence given in the proceedings, but, if the tribunal of fact had all the evidence concerning the matter, an opposite result may have ensued. The longer the delay in commencing proceedings, the more likely it is that the case will be decided on less evidence than was available to the parties at the time that the cause of action arose.” 
        
       
      
    107 Brisbane South was decided in respect of the Queensland counterpart of s48, which is not in identical terms, but which similarly confers, in the event that foundational matters (ignorance of material facts of a decisive character) are made out, a general discretion to extend the limitation period. 
     
      
    108 It is a case that has been applied many times. I was referred, by both parties, to a number of occasions on which the question has come before courts of this and other states. But these represent no more than the application of now established principles to a particular fact situation. They do not further elucidate the principles stated in Brisbane South. 
     
      
    109 For example, particular reliance was placed on behalf of the plaintiff on the decision of Patten AJ in Ellis v Pell [2006] NSWSC 109. On examination, however, there is no statement of principle in Ellis that casts any additional light on Brisbane South. Patten AJ analysed the evidence of prejudice in that case and concluded, on the facts of the case, that a fair trial could be held, even if it were less than perfect. 
     
      
    110 Ellis is certainly not authority for the proposition (as was put by counsel for the plaintiff) that a failure by the potential defendant to investigate a potential plaintiff’s complaints overcomes prejudice that arises subsequently. That submission was put in this context. In Ellis the applicant complained of having been sexually assaulted by a priest of the Roman Catholic Church between 1974 and 1979, when he was 13 to 18 years of age. He made his first complaint to the Church in June 2002. it was not investigated until at least a year later. In 1994 the priest had suffered a cerebral stroke. Following the stroke his cognitive function was impaired. By June 2003 he was not able to give instructions to the solicitors representing the Church, handling the investigation of Mr Ellis’ complaint. He died in October 2004. Prima facie, such a circumstance would be of significant weight in the evaluation of prejudice. However, by reason of other evidence, Patten AJ concluded that the Church had long before had the opportunity of investigating allegations of a similar kind against the priest. That, as I read Patten AJ’s judgment, was a factor in the overall assessment of whether it was just to grant the extension sought. In the result, his Honour did extend the time, and it is, no doubt, for that reason that heavy reliance was placed upon the decision on behalf of the present plaintiff. 
     
      
    111 In any event, the submission to which I referred (that a failure to investigate overcomes evidence of prejudice) depends upon the drawing of an analogy between the present case and that of Ellis. That analogy is not available. Despite my concerns, earlier expressed, about the candour (or lack of it) of some of the evidence, the first defendant has adduced a considerable body of evidence to show that it has undertaken quite extensive investigations. It has sought (with limited success only) to follow up individuals named by the plaintiff; it has sought to locate the psychiatrist, not named by the plaintiff, by whom he asserts he was treated; it has unsuccessfully sought the records of the high school attended by the plaintiff; it has unsuccessfully sought information (other than from the plaintiff) confirming his employment history. These are not insignificant matters. 
     
      
    112 I accept that if an extension of time is granted, the first defendant will be hampered in the extent to which it will be able to meet the plaintiff’s claims – both as to events at Eden Park, and as to his post Eden Park history going to the extent of disability (if any) and to the quantification of damages. 
     
      
    113 However, I also bear in mind the rather different picture that emerged following the cross-examination of Messrs Brewin and Doran. 
     
      
    114 In cases of sexual assault, the problems faced by the first defendant are not unfamiliar. Persons are regularly accused, in the criminal jurisdiction, of sexual assault or other misconduct many years after the events alleged. The delay in bringing proceedings and the consequent impairment of the person accused to marshal evidence in defence is not seen as a reason to prevent the prosecution proceeding. Instead, the criminal law has devised a means of redressing the unfairness. Juries routinely are directed, explicitly, of the difficulties cast in the way of the accused by reason of the delay in pursuing the prosecution: see Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; 168 CLR 79. 
     
      
    115 If a jury can be entrusted, in weighing evidence in a criminal trial in the light of these considerations, then surely a judge sitting alone in a civil trial can be expected to undertake the same tasks. Indeed, one would expect that it would be almost instinctive. The inability of the first defendant to obtain material for cross-examination, or to adduce evidence in response to the evidence called on behalf of the plaintiff, would be factors relevant to the assessment of credibility, and to the weight to be given to any item of evidence, and, ultimately, to whether the plaintiff has established that justice favours the granting of the extension. 
     
      
    116 I do not suggest that analogy with criminal trials constitute a complete answer to the prejudice alleged to have been suffered by the first defendant. But potential amelioration of prejudice is one consideration to be taken into account in determining the overall justice of granting or refusing the extension sought. 
     
      
    117 It is also necessary to analyse with some particularity what the first defendant claims to have lost.  
     
      
    118 Counsel for the first defendant submitted that it was prejudiced in three specific ways:  
     
      
       
      (i) in relation to determining whether the alleged abuse occurred. It will be remembered that the plaintiff alleged abuse of two kinds – at the hands of other residents (some of which he claimed to have disclosed to the second defendant); and at the hands of the second defendant himself; 
       
       
      (ii) in relation to the absence of records relating to his medical or psychological condition in the intervening years – for example, his consultation with a “Mann Street Gosford” psychiatrist; 
       
       
      (ii) in relation to the absence of records of his psychiatric history. 
       
      
    119 The first of these is, in my view, somewhat disingenuous. I was told, without dissent, that the second defendant faced criminal charges in South Australia, and that they were due to be tried in November 2006. The allegations made by plaintiff constitute the basis of some of those charges. And in a letter to the plaintiff of 20 August 2001 (see [38]) above) Mr Brewin said that his allegations had been put to the second defendant and others. 
     
      
    120 There was no evidence of what the second defendant, or others, had said to Mr Brewin. 
     
      
    121 It is likely that there will be significant material available to the first defendant arising out of the investigation and prosecution of the criminal charges. 
     
      
    122 The asserted prejudice arising in the categories numbered (ii) and (iii) above, are, in my opinion, really of the same ilk. I accept that, in some circumstances, a complete psychiatric history may cast considerable light, and even considerable doubt, upon assertions made by a plaintiff. However the psychiatric profession is practised in evaluating histories recounted by patients or potential plaintiffs. The absence of such records is not, in my opinion, sufficient of itself, or in combination with any other matters, to enable a conclusion that a trial of the plaintiff’s allegations could or would not be fair. 
     
      
    123 Having regard to the investigations undertaken by “the Salvation Army” for the purposes of the South Australian Commission of Inquiry and the Senate Committee Inquiry, and to the more complete picture of the results of inquiries made on behalf of the first defendant that emerged after cross-examination, I am satisfied that the prejudice to the first defendant is not nearly as great as the solicitors would have had me believe. Having said that, I accept, as I have already mentioned, that a degree of prejudice is inevitable. The real question is, as posed by Toohey and Gummow JJ in Brisbane South, whether the delay has made the chances of a fair trial unlikely. 
     
      
    124 I conclude that it has not. In my opinion, the first defendant will not be precluded from mounting an adequate defence to the plaintiff’s claim. I accordingly propose to grant the extension sought. 
     
      
    125 There remain two further matters. 
     
      
       
      Estoppel 
       
      
    126 On behalf of the plaintiff, a further matter was raised. It was that, by reason of the statements made by Mr Dalziel in the Four Corners programme, extracted above, the first defendant is estopped from relying upon the limitation defence. This submission can be disposed of quickly. It was based upon the decision of the High Court in The Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39; 170 CLR 394, which was said to be relevantly indistinguishable from the present case. That I do not accept. There are very significant distinguishing features between the factual bases of the two cases. 
     
      
    127 There were, indeed, significant divergences in the approach taken by the members of the Court to the determination of the issues. Those divergences need not detain me at present. 
     
      
    128 Verwayen concerned the notorious collision in 1964 between two Australian Navy ships, the Melbourne and the Voyager. Mr Verwayen was one of many who sought to claim damages for personal injury he alleged he suffered as a result of the collision. He did not commence proceedings until many years after the expiration of the relevant limitation period (under Victorian legislation). The solicitors who acted for him also represented many other claimants. They corresponded with solicitors for the Commonwealth and with the then Minister for Defence. In relation to a different claimant, both the solicitors and the Minister had given written assurances that, in this case, the limitation defence would not be invoked. Before issuing Mr Verwayen’s writ, the solicitors sought an assurance that, in his case also, the defence would not be invoked. Before receiving a reply, they issued the writ. Subsequently, the assurance was given. The Commonwealth filed a defence to Mr Verwayen’s claim. It did not then raise the limitation defence. It was not until 18 months after the writ was issued, and 14 months after the defence was filed, that an amended defence, pleading expiration of the limitation period, was filed. 
     
      
    129 In those circumstances, three members of the High Court held that the doctrine of estoppel operated to preclude the Commonwealth’s reliance upon the defence. Two members of the Court (Toohey and Gaudron JJ) held that the Commonwealth had waived its right to rely upon the defence and was bound by that waiver.  
     
      
    130 In the decision of Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and McHugh JJ, the concept of reliance upon a representation as fundamental was central to the establishment of an estoppel: this is so even where, as in the case of Mason CJ and Brennan and McHugh JJ, the application of the stated principles would have resulted in a different outcome, the rejection of an estoppel. 
     
      
    131 Deane and Dawson JJ each inferred that Mr Verwayen had in fact relied upon the representations made to him by the Commonwealth, notwithstanding that his writ had been filed before the written assurances were given. Deane J concluded that Mr Verwayen had prepared and prosecuted his action, had expended both time and money thereon; had subjected himself to the stress, anxiety and inconvenience inevitably associated in the pursuit of the proceedings. 
     
      
    132 Dawson J concluded to similar effect: he held that the Commonwealth had continued to encourage Mr Verwayen in his belief that there would be no insistence upon the statute by its joining with him in applications for an expedited hearing upon the question of damages only. Indeed, his Honour held that:  
     
      
       
        
        “There can be no question that [Mr Verwayen] acted upon the assumption that [the Commonwealth] would not exercise its right to claim that the action was statute barred” 
        
       
      
    133 The facts in the present case do not support a parallel conclusion. There is, indeed, no evidence that the plaintiff ever became aware of Mr Dalziel’s statements; there is no evidence that he in any way relied upon them, either in commencing or in pursuing his claim or his application; there is no evidence that, apart from these statements by Mr Dalziel, either the plaintiff or his solicitors were ever led to into a belief that the first defendant would not invoke the limitation defence. I reject the submission that the first defendant is estopped from asserting a defence under the Act. 
     
      
       
      The decision in Nowlan v Marson Transport Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 346; 53 NSWLR 116 
       
      
    134 Counsel for the plaintiff placed heavy reliance upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in Nowlan v Marson Transport Pty Ltd. It was in anticipation of that submission that the correspondence of Ms Slape seeking explication of the basis of the first defendant’s opposition to the extension of time was written. In my opinion the reliance upon the decision is misconceived. It has had no bearing upon my conclusion that the extension of time should be granted. 
     
      
    135 Nowlan was a case in which an applicant (Mr Nowlan) had sought an extension of time for commencing proceedings under the Motor Accidents Act 1988. He failed at first instance.  
     
      
    136 In allowing an appeal, Heydon JA, with whom Mason P and Young CJ in Eq agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where the respondent to an application fails to signal a prima facie case of prejudice, either by evidence to be tendered by the respondent, or by an indication that some part of the applicant's evidence will be relied on to raise a prima facie case of prejudice, it will not be possible for the applicant to deal with the point satisfactorily. Here the respondent was able to point to material in the applicant's evidence raising the possibility of prejudice … But that possibility was capable of being rebutted by evidence. The fact that that possibility was not availed of by the applicant in view of the respondent's failure to give prior notice of the point successfully taken creates an injustice justifying reception of the evidence in this Court.” 
        
       
      
    137 Heydon JA was critical of the approach taken to the application, as was Young CJ in Eq who said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a culture where the plaintiff may be ambushed, it is incumbent on the plaintiff's solicitors to minimise that possibility by seeking to confine the defendant by forcing the defendant to state what his or her grounds of opposition to the plaintiff's motion are. Ordinarily, if this is not clear on the material filed, a letter should be written to the defendant's solicitors in good time before the motion is heard and complaints made to the judge if no reasonable response is received.” 
        
       
      
    138 The circumstances of the two cases are not comparable. In Nowlan the plaintiff had no notice, and no way of knowing, what point was to be taken against him arising out of his own evidence. It was that of which the Court was critical. 
     
      
    139 Here the affidavit evidence filed on behalf of the first defendant made it perfectly plain, as the solicitors for the first defendant said, what the basis of the opposition was. It is not necessary for solicitors then to spell out, in some other format, what has already been spelled out in affidavit evidence. There is, here, no question of ambush. 
     
      
    140 In any event, failure to spell out a basis for opposition does not go to any relevant question for decision. The remedy for a failure to comply with what is required by Nowlan is to seek, prior to hearing, orders for compliance. 
     
      
    141 As I have indicated, the decision in Nowlan has no played no part in the conclusion I have reached. 
     
      
    142 The orders I make are: 
     
      
       
      (1) Pursuant to s48 of the  
      Limitation of Actions Act 1936 (SA)  
      the time for commencement of proceedings against the first defendant is extended to 25 March 2003; 
       
       
      (2) The first defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the application.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: 
       
       
      Introduction  
       
      
    1 The central questions in these proceedings are, firstly, whether three search warrants, issued respectively by the first and second defendants, were invalid, and, secondly, assuming the warrants were validly issued, whether they were executed unlawfully. 
     
      
    2 The plaintiff, by an amended summons dated 14 November 2006, filed in Court on 20 February 2007, claims relief in respect of the following three search warrants:- 
     
      
       
      • Search warrant issued on 24 September 2002 by the first defendant in respect of specified premises at Randwick ( 
      the first warrant 
      ). 
       
       
      • Search warrant issued on 11 November 2002 by the first defendant in respect of specified premises at Bondi Junction ( 
      the second warrant 
      ). 
       
       
      • Search warrant issued on 19 December 2002 by the second defendant in respect of specified premises at Bondi Junction ( 
      the third warrant 
      ). 
       
      
    3 The three warrants (referred to in this judgment as “the warrants”) were issued on the application of members of the New South Wales Police. The premises at Waverley Street, Bondi Junction at the relevant times, was the residential premises of the plaintiff. The warrants were issued under the Search Warrants Act 1985 (NSW) (since repealed and referred to in this judgment as “the Act”) which enacted a statutory scheme for the issue and execution of search warrants. The equivalent provisions in respect of search and seizure powers are now to be found in Part 5 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW). 
     
      
    4 The plaintiff claims an order in the nature of certiorari that the first, second and/or third warrants be set aside or quashed and declarations that the execution of each of the warrants was contrary to law. 
     
      
    5 A further order is sought in the nature of prohibition preventing the defendants or any of them, their servants or agents, from relying on the validity of the said warrants. 
     
      
    6 A further order in the nature of mandamus or an injunction is sought against the defendants, their servants or agents, requiring them to deliver up to the plaintiff any property seized and any audio, video, digital or computer recordings and/or transcripts or copies or notes made from the recordings. 
     
      
    7 Mr. M. A. Robinson, of counsel, appeared on behalf of the plaintiff. Mr. P. Saidi and Ms. K. Richardson of counsel, appeared on behalf of the third, fourth and fifth defendants. Submitting appearances were entered on behalf of the authorised justices, the first and second defendants. 
     
      
       
      Grounds relied upon 
       
      
    8 The plaintiff relied upon eight grounds in support of the relief claimed in the amended summons, but at the hearing, not all grounds were pressed. In particular, Grounds 5 and 7 (respectively the validity of Regulation 10 under the Search Warrants Regulation 1999 (NSW) and a contention of “bad faith” were abandoned). 
     
      
    9 The plaintiff’s challenge in the present proceedings, accordingly, had a two-fold aspect. The first challenged the validity of the warrants. The second asserted that the execution of the warrants was contrary to law. 
     
      
    10 In relation to the first of these two aspects, the central contention on behalf of the plaintiff is that the three “covert” warrants were not contemplated or authorised by the Search Warrants Act 1985 (NSW) or, alternatively, they were not warrants contemplated by the Act and are, accordingly, invalid. 
     
      
    11 The primary submission made on behalf of the plaintiff was that in each case authorisation was sought that the warrants be executed covertly and, as such, involved “… an application … to do something which we say is unlawful and the magistrate acceded to it and … that makes what might be a plainly valid warrant on the face of it invalid in reality in light of the evidence” (transcript, p.124).  
     
      
    12 It was contended that there was a purported exercise of a power authorising the covert execution of the warrants and that such was ultra vires the Act “… there is no power for a magistrate to issue a warrant that he or she knows is going to be executed covertly” (transcript, p.130). 
     
      
    13 The plaintiff also submitted that s.19 of the Act by which an authorised justice may authorise the execution of a warrant by night, was of no assistance in providing authority for the covert execution of a warrant. Section 19(1A) of the Act provided that an authorised justice is not to authorise the execution of a search warrant by night “… unless satisfied there are reasonable grounds for doing so …”. The submission on behalf of the plaintiff was that the authorised justice in relation to each warrant purported to improperly exercise the power under s.19(1A) by relying upon the fact that such manner of execution would facilitate the surreptitious execution of the warrants. 
     
      
    14 At the forefront of the plaintiff’s submissions was the proposition that in each case the execution was intended to be undertaken in his absence as occupier of the premises and without notice or information to him as contemplated by the Act. As such, the submission proceeded, each warrant was invalid. 
     
      
    15 In ground 3 of the amended summons it was stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… The Act contemplates the postponement of the service of the Occupier’s Notice only after the occupier is not found at the premises (s.15(3)(b) and s.15(4)). The warrants here were issued on the basis that the Occupier’s Notice would not be served. At the time of the issue of the warrants, the authorised justice was aware that the occupant was to have the execution of the warrant kept secret from him. Such a process is not contemplated or authorised by the Act. Accordingly, the warrants were invalidly issued and/or executed.” 
        
       
      
    16 The plaintiff, in support of the amended summons, relied upon the affidavits of Christopher Heath Watson sworn 21 March 2006 and 4 April 2006 and documents comprising the tender bundle (Exhibit H) which related to the issue and execution of the warrants. 
     
      
    17 It was submitted on behalf of the third, fourth and fifth defendants (the police officers who made the applications for the issue of the three warrants) that in each case there was disclosure of the intention to execute each of the warrants covertly and that, as a matter of statutory construction, power existed under the Act for the issue and execution of the warrants upon that basis. 
     
      
       
      Background to the charges 
       
      
    18 The applications for the warrants reveal that a number of persons were suspected by the Australian Federal Police of involvement in the importation of a large quantity of MDMA (ecstasy). The plaintiff’s activities in the latter part of 2002 had been the subject of physical and electronic surveillance. On 25 December 2002, he was arrested and charged in respect of his alleged involvement in the importation. 
     
      
    19 The defendants relied upon an affidavit of Mark William Standen sworn 29 November 2006. Mr. Standen is the Assistant Director, Investigations, with the New South Wales Crime Commission (the “Commission”). According to Mr. Standen’s affidavit, the plaintiff was charged following an investigation conducted by a joint taskforce comprised of the Special Crime Unit of the New South Wales Police, the Australian Federal Police and the Commission. 
     
      
    20 On 21 February 2006, the plaintiff was committed for trial on the charge of supply prohibited drugs. Other charges relating to firearms and prohibited weapon offences alleged to have occurred in 2002 are to be heard at the same time as the supply prohibited drugs charge. 
     
      
       
      The search warrants 
       
      
    21 Information concerning each of the search warrants may be summarised as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The first search warrant 
       
       
        
        (i) The first application was made on 24 September 2006. The application expressly recorded that the third defendant sought to  
        “have this search warrant executed covertly and would be applying for an extension of time regarding the service of the Occupier’s Notice” 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) The application made it clear that night time execution of the warrant was required so that it would coincide with the absence of the plaintiff as occupier. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The application also sought to prevent access under Clause 10 of the  
        Search Warrants Regulation 1999 (NSW) 
        . The 
          
        reason provided was stated to be the  
        “information contained is sensitive in nature and is part of a long term, ongoing investigation into organised crime on the East Coast of Australia’ 
        . 
        
       
      
    22 The first defendant, as the issuing justice, granted the warrant on 24 September 2002 at 10.45 am and purported to permit it to be executed at night on the grounds of, inter alia:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(d) Ongoing investigation – to be executed covertly.” 
        
       
      
    23 The warrant authorised a search for things of the kind referred to in s.5(1) of the Act with appropriate particulars of those “things”. 
     
      
    24 It was the plaintiff’s case that the police officers who executed the warrant at night were confident that he would not return during the search and they intended that the fact that the search has been carried out would not be detected upon his return. The plaintiff’s case was that from the outset, there was an intention in those applying for the warrant not to give him any notice of the search until the law enforcement agencies determined it to be appropriate. 
     
      
    25 The warrant was executed at 9.00 pm on 24 September 2002. It is not necessary, for the purposes of the present proceedings, to detail the outcome of the search of premises. It is sufficient to record the contentions made on behalf of the plaintiff to the effect that the execution of the warrants was essentially an intelligence-gathering exercise marked by a selectivity in the approach taken during the search with care being taken to avoid creating any visible signs of disturbance of the premises and its contents so as to maintain the covert nature of the execution of the warrants. I will return to the question as to whether there is substance to the proposition that the manner of execution supports the contention in effect that the warrants were sought for extraneous or improper purposes. 
     
      
    26 On 24 October 2002, a report pursuant to the Act was made reporting upon the execution of the first warrant on 24 September 2002. The document contained a request, purportedly by way of application pursuant to s.15(4) of the Act, to extend the time for service of the Occupier’s Notice for a period of six months as “service of the Occupier’s Notice would alert the occupant and their associates of police interest and therefore compromise the current operation”. 
     
      
    27 The Report to Authorised Justice on the Execution of a Search Warrant made pursuant to the Act dated 24 October 2002 included a handwritten note at the foot of the report: “granted. Six mths extension granted to 24/3/02”. This was clearly an error and was intended to refer to 24 March 2003. This note related to the decision of the authorised justice purportedly postponing service of the Occupier’s Notice. 
     
      
       
      (b) The second search warrant 
       
      
    28 On 11 November 2002, an application was made by the fourth defendant. 
     
      
    29 This application referred to an earlier application for a warrant issued on 8 November 2002 but which could not be executed due to operational circumstances. 
     
      
    30 On 11 November 2002 at 3.45 pm, the first defendant issued a search warrant for specified premises at Bondi Junction. In the application for the warrant appeared the following statement:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Application for caveat on warrant grounds 
        
       
       
        
        Furthermore, police are seeking that a Clause 10 provision be granted for this search warrant application. Information contained in this application is sensitive in nature and is part of a long term, ongoing investigation into organised crime on the East Coast of Australia. Release of any of this information would jeopardise this ongoing investigation. Furthermore, police hold grave fears for the identity and subsequent safety of the informants mentioned herein, should the details of the information they are supply (sic) to police become public.” 
        
       
      
    31 The authorised justice referred in his record of the application to the alleged facts arising from police investigations and to the fact that on 24 September 2002, police had executed a warrant covertly at the plaintiff’s premises and located certain items:- 
     
      
       
        
        “4. … the grounds on which I relied to justify the execution of the warrant by night are as follows:- 
        
       
       
        
         (a) … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) there is likely to be less risk to the safety of any person; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) ongoing investigation – covert execution.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    32 An Occupier’s Notice for the warrant was made and was dated 11 November 2002. 
     
      
    33 The Report to Authorised Justice on the Execution of a Search Warrant noted that the Occupier’s Notice was not served and a request made that the service of the Notice be withheld in accordance with the provisions of s.15(4) of the Act. An “extension” was sought for service of the notice for a period of six months. 
     
      
    34 At the foot of the report, there is a handwritten note “extension granted to 11.5.03”. The independent observer field report in relation to the execution of the second warrant (dated 11 November 2002) contained an entry concerning the Occupier’s Notice “not served/delayed service”. 
     
      
    35 In the summary of the results of the execution of the warrant it is noted “Covert search at … Bondi Junction” and records items of interest as being “located” rather than “seized”. 
     
      
    36 As in the case of the first warrant, it is unnecessary for the purposes of the present proceedings to record in any detail the results of the execution of the warrant. The issues referred to in paragraph [25] above were also raised in relation to the second warrant. It was, in particular, contended that the recording of data, such as phone card numbers, was part of what was said to be a covert intelligence and evidence gathering procedure and not a search and seizure operation authorised under the Act. 
     
      
    37 On 9 April 2003, a letter was sent to the issuing justice (the first defendant) by the fourth defendant outlining the result of the service of the Occupier’s Notice on the solicitor for the applicant in his trial. It was asserted, accordingly, that the Occupier’s Notice was served more than three months after the applicant was arrested (namely, on 9 April 2003). 
     
      
       
      (c) The third search warrant 
       
      
    38 On 19 December 2004, Detective Sergeant Cullen applied to the second defendant for a search warrant in respect of the plaintiff’s premises at a specified address in Bondi Junction. The application set out factual matters relied upon. It referred to the covert execution of the warrant on 24 September 2002 and the results of the search of premises. The application also recorded that police were seeking “… the provision to execute the search warrant at any time during the day, including after 9.00 pm. Due to the ongoing operational investigation of BALLIS and his associates, that is necessary to preserve the integrity of this investigation”. 
     
      
    39 A search warrant was issued dated 19 December 2002 authorising entry and search of the plaintiff’s premises. The things to be searched for were of a kind similar to those sought in the November warrant, except for a handwritten addendum which referred to specified items. 
     
      
    40 The Occupier’s Notice was dated 19 December 2002. As in the case of the first and second searches, it was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that it was clear that the warrant was to be a “covert” warrant and that the service of the Occupier’s Notice was to be postponed until the end of the operation or at the expiry of an indeterminate period. Unlike the first two warrants, there was no express reference in the application for the third warrant to an intention to execute the warrant covertly. The authorised justice’s record (tender bundle, p.190) stated that the grounds relied upon to justify the execution of the warrant at night included:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(d) the execution of the warrant is dependent upon the continuing investigation and activities of the suspects and may occur at night.” 
        
       
      
    41 The independent observer field report in respect of the third warrant (dated 19 December 2002) recorded in respect of “Occupier’s Notice” “N/A. Covert warrant”. 
     
      
    42 Mr Robinson of counsel contended that Regulation 10 (which permitted a certificate to issue to prevent the inspection of documents in relation to a search referred to in Regulation 9) was relied upon to keep information concerning the application for the warrant from the plaintiff as occupier. Mr. Watson stated that there was no information which established that the Occupier’s Notice was ever served. 
     
      
    43 The fifth defendant made application on 16 January 2003 to delay service of the Occupier’s Notice pursuant to s.15(4) of the Act. The second defendant purportedly delayed service of the Notice without stating the date by which it had to be served. On 9 April 2003, the Notice was served, not on the plaintiff himself, but on the plaintiff’s solicitor. This was disputed as proper service under the Act. 
     
      
    44 The authorised justice’s record of the application states that reasonable grounds existed for issuing the warrant. As indicated above, the statutory report in relation to the issue of the execution of the third warrant by night does not state in express terms that execution of the warrant by night was authorised as part of a covert operation. In respect of its execution by night, the grounds relied upon were stated as including:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(c) An occupier is likely to be on the premises only at night to allow entry without the use of force. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The execution of the warrant is dependent upon the continuing investigation and activities of the suspects and may occur at night.” 
        
       
      
    45 Whilst there was no express reference in relation to the third warrant, as in the case of the first and second warrants, to its execution by night by reason of the continuing investigation, Mr. Robinson contended that the authorisation given in respect of the third warrant was “implicitly” one which authorised its covert execution. 
     
      
    46 The report on the execution of the warrant on 19 December 2002, is entitled “covert search at … Bondi Junction”. The warrant, of course, was, in fact, executed covertly on 19 December 2002. 
     
      
    47 The Report to authorised justice on the execution of the search warrant dated 16 January 2003 recorded that the warrant was executed on Thursday 19 December 2002 at 6.08 pm. It records that the result of the execution of the warrant as “no items seized”. It also records that the Occupier’s Notice was not served and a request was made for service of it to be withheld:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… in accordance with the provisions of s.15(4) of the Search Warrants Act. The execution of this search warrant is part of an ongoing police operation. Service of the Occupier’s Notice at this point in time would alert the occupant and their associates of police interest and therefore compromise the current operation.” 
        
       
      
    48 The statement of Detective Sergeant Cullen dated 9 May 2003 (pp.114-116 of Exhibit H) records the result of the search. 
     
      
       
      Specific disclosures 
       
      
    49 The evidence establishes, and I find accordingly, that, in the case of each search warrant, each application to the relevant authorised justice (the first and second defendants) disclosed that it was the intention that police officers who were to execute each warrant would do so covertly and that, accordingly, the Occupier’s Notice would not be served on entry into the premises. 
     
      
    50 The evidence further establishes, and I so find, that each application disclosed that it was likely that, following execution of each warrant, an application for postponement of service of the Occupier’s Notice given in each case would be made. 
     
      
    51 Subsequent to the execution of each warrant, each authorised justice purported to authorise the postponement of service of the Occupier’s Notices in respect of each warrant. 
     
      
       
      Agreed facts  
       
      
    52 The parties reached agreement (recorded in Exhibit B) in terms as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The three search warrants were executed in such a manner as to conceal the occurrence of their execution from Mr. Ballis, the occupier, until such time as service of the occupier’s notices were affected.” 
        
       
       
      The plaintiff’s contentions 
       
      
    53 The plaintiff contended that the three warrants were invalid as they did not constitute search warrants authorised by the Search Warrants Act 1985 (NSW). No objection was taken as to the form of the warrants. In a letter of particulars dated 31 October 2006, Mr. Watson furnished the solicitors for the defendants with particulars in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… the warrant purported to authorise a ‘covert’ investigative process or operation not contemplated by the Search Warrants Act 1985.” 
        
       
      
    54 In the letter of particulars, to which I have referred, it was asserted, in relation to each warrant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… the … warrant was contrary to law as it was not a warrant contemplated by the Search Warrants Act 1985 and its execution was purposely to be undertaken in the absence of the occupier, without notice or information to the occupier of the entry as contemplated by the Search Warrants Act 1985.” 
        
       
      
    55 Mr. Watson also asserted in the abovementioned letter of particulars that the applicant relied upon an interpretation of the Search Warrants Act 1985 (NSW) to the effect that it did not authorise postponement of the service of an Occupier’s Notice by reason of or on the basis of the concurrent undertaking of a covert operation. 
     
      
       
      Plaintiff’s written submissions 
       
      
    56 In the plaintiff’s submissions it was contended:- 
     
      
       
      (a) That the three warrants issued were invalid (the term  
      “unlawful”  
      was from time to time used in oral submissions, eg, transcript 27 February 2007, p.18). 
       
       
      (b) That the execution of the warrants was invalid (or  
      “unlawful” 
      ). 
       
       
      (c) That postponement of the service of the Occupier’s Notice in respect of each warrant was  
      “unlawful” 
      . 
       
      
    57 On behalf of the plaintiff, Mr. Robinson observed that the Search Warrants Act 1985 (NSW) established a scheme for the issue and execution of search warrants, and that that scheme contemplated (in particular by reference to s.15) that upon execution of a warrant or as soon as practicable thereafter, the person executing it “shall” serve an Occupier’s Notice on the occupier of the premises. That notice was to be in accordance with the prescribed form. 
     
      
    58 Reliance was also placed upon the provisions of s.9(2) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) which provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In any Act or instrument, the word ‘shall’, if used to impose a duty, indicates that the duty must be performed.” 
        
       
      
    59 It was contended that on application for each of the warrants it was made clear to the particular authorised justice that the warrants were sought upon the basis that they were part of a “covert” operation by law enforcement agencies. 
     
      
    60 In the Summary of Applicant’s Argument (undated), it was contended:- 
     
      
       
        
        “5. In the present circumstances, the warrants were sought as part of a ‘covert’ operation. Relevantly to the present circumstances, this meant that the police determined to execute the warrants at a time when they planned that the occupant would not be at the premises. Further, that they never intended to notify the occupant of the premises of the issue and execution of the warrant at the time of the search or at any point proximately thereafter. This, notwithstanding, that they were aware of the location and movements of the occupant at all relevant times. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The applications for the warrants and their issue were based on the premise that the occupant would not be notified of the search at or about the time of the search and that the service of the Occupier’s Notice would be withheld from the occupant and delayed depending on the police operational requirements. 
        
       
       
        
        7. It is submitted that a warrant of this nature is not contemplated or authorised by the Search Warrants Act 1985 and that accordingly the warrants issued were invalid and should be quashed.” 
        
       
      
    61 Mr. M. Robinson, in his written submissions dated 21 February 2007 (paragraph 14) submitted:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Relevantly to the present circumstances, this meant that the police were always determined to execute the warrants at a time when they planned and had ascertained that the plaintiff occupant would not be at the premises. Further, they never intended to notify the occupant of the premises of the issue and execution of the warrant at the time of the search or at any point approximately thereafter. This is notwithstanding that they were aware of the location and movement of the occupant at all times (having him under blanket surveillance at relevant times).” 
        
       
      
    62 It was submitted that a warrant issued in these circumstances was neither contemplated nor authorised by the Act. Accordingly, it was contended the warrants were invalid and should be quashed. It was also contended that “the execution of the purported warrants was bad and that each was contrary to law”. 
     
      
    63 It was further submitted that the Act contemplated that a decision for postponement of service of an Occupier’s Notice could only validly be made by an authorised justice after the warrant had been executed and when no occupier “is then present or in or on the premises” (s.15(3)(b) and s.15(4)). In other words, it was contended that s.15(4) only permitted the postponement of an Occupier’s Notice in the limited circumstances specified in s.15(3)(b). 
     
      
    64 There is, in my opinion, some substance to the proposition that if s.15(4) were intended to be construed as making available a covert search warrant procedure in order to enhance the effectiveness of an investigation, one would expect that such a procedure would be expressed in clear terms and not appear in a subsection to a section of the Act concerned with the service of occupier’s notices. 
     
      
    65 It is clear that a covert search warrant procedure plainly would represent a significant departure from the balance struck in the Act as discussed by Kirby P in Carroll v Mijovich (1991) 25 NSWLR 441. The covert execution of search warrants would clearly tilt the balance in favour of law enforcement authorities. 
     
      
    66 It was submitted in this case, that the warrants were issued on the basis that the Occupier’s Notice in each instance would not be served, in that the entire operation was to be covert as an integral part of an overall investigation. In other words, it was submitted, at the time the warrants were issued, the authorised justice was aware that the execution of the warrant was to be kept secret from the plaintiff and that following execution of each warrant an application for postponement of service of the respective Occupier’s Notice would follow. This was based upon the assumption that s.15 permitted postponement of service in such circumstances. 
     
      
    67 The plaintiff concedes that, whilst the warrants do not, on their face, reveal or manifest error, the “other primary material” does reveal the plain intention of both the applicants and the authorised justices who issued the warrants. 
     
      
    68 Mr. Robinson supported the plaintiff’s argument by specific reference to the requirements of the statutory scheme described as one “… for the open and reviewable conduct of warrants …” (paragraph 10 of the Summary of Applicant’s Argument). The elements in the statutory scheme were identified as including:- 
     
      
       
      • the requirement upon entry of premises to announce that a search warrant is to be executed (s.15A); 
       
       
      • the duty to show the warrant (s.16); 
       
       
      • execution by day (s.19) (absent a specific order permitting execution by night); 
       
       
      • the necessity for record keeping (s.13); 
       
       
      • the obligation to inform the occupant of rights of review (the prescribed Occupier’s Notice); and 
       
       
      • the right of an occupier to inspect the grounds for issue etc. 
       
      
    69 These were said to point to the absence of a power to authorise the covert execution of warrants issued under the Act and to the absence of a power to withhold service of an Occupier’s Notice by reason of police operational requirements. 
     
      
       
      Jurisdictional considerations 
       
      
    70 The Court’s jurisdiction to grant declaratory and other relief in proceedings challenging the validity of search warrants has not infrequently been exercised prior to the laying of criminal charges and where orders are sought for the return of items seized and consequential orders and in some cases damages have been sought, see, for example, Trimboli v Onley (No. 3) (1981) 56 FLR 321 and Cassanti v. Croucher & Ors [2000] 48 NSWLR 623. 
     
      
    71 In the present case, where the plaintiff has been charged and criminal proceedings are pending, I have considered whether, as a discretionary matter, this Court should assume jurisdiction or whether the issues as to the validity of the warrants and/or the lawfulness of their execution should be left for determination by the trial judge in the District Court, the hearing of the criminal proceedings having been scheduled for June 2007. 
     
      
    72 It has been observed as a matter of general principle that civil courts appreciate that it is of vital importance that law enforcement agencies should not be hindered unduly in their task of investigating fully allegations of criminality. Similarly, it has been stated that civil courts appreciate the need to ensure that the work of the criminal courts is not frustrated by applications challenging the validity of warrants, particularly those which are quite unmeritorious and designed to achieve little more than delay: Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Jiang (2001) 183 ALR 604. That case addressed the previous ready availability of administrative law remedies in the federal sphere in relation to what have commonly been referred to as “collateral attacks”. Reference was there made to the body of case law developed over time in which courts have stressed the dangers of fragmentation of the criminal justice process and the need for restraint on the part of civil courts in reviewing decisions taken in the course of that process: Jiang (supra) at [7]. See also ACS v Anderson [1975] 1 NSWLR 212 at 215-217; Conwell v Tapfield [1981] 1 NSWLR 595 at 601, 603-605; Cain v Glass (No 2) [1985] 3 NSWLR 230 at 244-245, 253; Anderson v Attorney General (NSW) [1987] 10 NSWLR 198 at 200-202; and Carroll v Attorney General (NSW) (1993) 70 A Crim R 162. 
     
      
    73 This Court, nonetheless, has exercised its jurisdiction where considered appropriate in circumstances where criminal proceedings are pending. See for example Commissioner of Police v Atkinson [1991] 23 NSWLR 495. However, in each case there remains a need to examine and determine the particular circumstances in which the jurisdiction ought to be exercised. Reference to relevant case law establishes a number of general propositions including the following:- 
     
      
       
      (a) There ought to be sound justification in point of practical utility in a Court intervening by way of granting declaratory relief in criminal proceedings. Otherwise, discretionary considerations will point against the grant of such relief (see  
      Conwell 
       (supra) at 601 per Street CJ). 
       
       
      (b) Where an application for declaratory and ancillary relief raises important questions both of statute law and of evidentiary principle, the resolution of which may have a substantial bearing upon criminal litigation, then this Court may exercise its jurisdiction where such relief is sought (see  
      Conwell 
       (supra) at 601). 
       
       
      (c) There is a distinction between proceedings in which a declaration is sought as to the construction of a statute which provides for the issue of search and seizure warrants from those in which in criminal proceedings a declaration is sought on a question of evidence or procedure. In the case of the latter, the circumstances must be exceptional to warrant the grant of relief:  
      Sankey v Whitlam 
       (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 25 per Gibbs ACJ. See also  
      ACS v Anderson  
      (supra) at 216 per Hutley JA;  
      Cain  
      (supra) at 253 per McHugh JA;  
      Anderson  
      (supra) at 200-201 per Kirby P and  
      Carroll  
       (supra) at 168. 
       
       
      (d) An application for declaratory and other relief which involves evident unmeritorious delaying tactics ought not be permitted to fragment the criminal justice process. 
       
      
    74 The determination of the issues raised in the present application will not in itself decide the admissibility of any evidence established as having been seized under the warrants (although such a determination may be relevant thereto) nor do they relate to a mere matter of procedure. The proceedings do not, in any relevant sense, involve any interference in the conduct by the District Court of the trial scheduled to commence in June 2007: see, for example, Carroll (supra) at 168 per Kirby ACJ. 
     
      
    75 The present application seeks review in advance of trial and not strictly by way of collateral review. The situation in that respect is not unlike that which arose in Carroll (supra). See Ousley v Regina (1997) 192 CLR 69 at 79 per Toohey J. In circumstances in which, as discussed below, there has been a determination by a District Court judge of a similar issue concerning what has been referred to as “covert warrants” under the Act, which determination rejected the challenge to validity, I consider that there is a proper basis upon which this Court should determine the questions raised involving as they do the construction and application of the Act as it affects occupiers’ rights. 
     
      
    76 The determination of the issues raised in these proceedings will not, as indicated above, interfere with the trial judge’s determination as to whether or not any evidence seized under the warrants is ultimately to be admitted, for, in the event of any attempt to adduce such evidence, he or she, in the event of an objection, will be required to consider the matters that are relevant to the exercise of his or her discretion under s.138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) for the purpose of making any ruling on admissibility pursuant to those provisions. 
     
      
    77 In Regina v. Ballis & Hinke (unreported, 9 September 2004), Shadbolt DCJ considered the question as to whether or not evidence that had been unlawfully obtained should be excluded in circumstances in which the search warrant under which the evidence was obtained had been executed in a covert manner. The accused, Hinke, argued that in the application for the warrant there in question, without there having been disclosure of information to the issuing magistrate of an intention to execute the warrant covertly, such constituted an abuse of process. 
     
      
    78 The Crown there submitted that there was no requirement for police to, in fact, inform the authorised justice that the warrant was intended to be executed covertly, the Act being silent on the matter. The Crown also contended that the Act provided for covert searches and for searches in the absence of an occupier, it being said that there was no distinction between the two. 
     
      
    79 In upholding the Crown’s contention in that case, the learned judge placed considerable reliance upon the provisions of s.15(3) and s.15(4) of the Act. His Honour held that, in light of those provisions, there was no requirement to inform the authorised justice that the search warrant was to be executed in the absence of the occupier. By reason of the fact that the Act envisaged and provided, in specified circumstances, for the execution of warrants in the absence of an occupier, his Honour arrived at the conclusion that it did not preclude the covert execution of warrants. Specific support for that conclusion was said to be found in the provisions under which authorising justices may order postponement of the service of an Occupier’s Notice. In consequence, his Honour was of the view that the search warrant in question was not unlawful, nor was its execution.  
     
      
    80 Whilst, with respect, I agree with his Honour’s ultimate conclusion as to the validity of the warrant, although for different reasons than were expressed in that case, I am unable to agree with the conclusion that the implementation of a planned execution of a warrant covertly constitutes a valid execution of it under the Act.  
     
      
       
      Analysis 
       
      
    81 The specific issues that arise for consideration concerning the validity of the warrants themselves and the lawfulness of the execution of the warrants are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The validity of the warrants require an examination of the following four matters:- 
       
       
        
        (a) The general principles relating to the issue of search warrants.  
        
       
       
      (b) The provisions of the Act. 
       
       
        
        (c) The terms of the applications for the warrants. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The authority or purported authority granted by the authorised justices as expressed in the warrants. 
        
       
       
      (2) The lawfulness of the execution of the warrants requires consideration of the following three matters:- 
       
       
        
        (a) The statutory safeguards which the Act afforded occupiers whose premises are to be searched under the authority of a search warrant. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The provisions concerning Occupier’s Notices. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) The question as to whether there was valid postponement of service of the Occupier’s Notices in accordance with the Act. 
        
       
       
      Validity of the search warrants 
       
       
      (a) The general principles relating to the issue of search warrants 
       
      
    82 The validity of a warrant turns on the fulfilment of the conditions for its issue: see George v Rockett (supra) at 111, that is, upon whether the authorised justice issuing it has complied strictly with the statutory requirements governing its issue: see Ryan & Raven v Tran Nominees (1986) 22 A Crim R 274 at 281 per Cox J. In that case it was stated that these include the limitations, express or implied, upon the power to issue the warrant. If the statutory pre-conditions are not met, it is very likely that the warrant will be at least seriously defective (Cox J at 281). See also Corbett v State of New South Wales [2006] NSWCA 138 per Giles JA at [109]. 
     
      
    83 The duty of an authorised justice issuing a statutory search warrant requires the issuing justice to “… stand between the police and the citizen, to give real attention to the question whether the information proffered by the police does justify the intrusion they desire to make into the privacy of the citizen and inviolate security of his personal and business affairs” (per Burchett J in Parker v Churchill (1985) 9 FCR 316 at 322). In Carroll v Mijovich (supra), Kirby P emphasised that a central question is the protection of privacy of individuals against the arbitrary use “… of the great power of entry and search …”. Accordingly, in determining an application for a search warrant and an application for postponement of service of an Occupier’s Notice upon entry into or onto premises, an authorised justice must adopt an impartial role between police and the citizen. In other words, he or she is not permitted to exercise the statutory powers under the Act in a partial manner such that the interests of law enforcement agencies impermissibly trump the statutory safeguards that Parliament has put in place for the protection of occupiers. 
     
      
       
      (b) The relevant provisions of the Act 
       
      
    84 In applying the principle that the validity of a search warrant, essentially, turns upon whether or not it has been issued in accordance with the prescribed statutory pre-conditions, it is necessary to identify those conditions. These include a requirement under the Act for a verified written application (except for cases of urgency - see s.12, telephone search warrant), that the application contains specified information (s.12A), and the requirement that the authorised justice be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to issue a search warrant. Additionally, a warrant should be in the prescribed statutory form (s.14). 
     
      
    85 Accordingly, for a search warrant to be valid under the Act, it was essential that there be compliance with the statutory provisions in ss.5, 6, 11 and 12A. If such requirements were met and the warrant was in the prescribed form in accordance with s.14 of the Act, then it met the conditions essential for its validity. In these proceedings, it has not been suggested that the three warrants did not each satisfy all such statutory pre-conditions or otherwise meet the prescribed statutory requirements. 
     
      
       
      (c) The terms of the applications for the warrants 
       
      
    86 The fact that the applicants for the warrants disclosed that it was their intention that they be executed covertly, did not, of itself, in my opinion, invalidate the process leading to the issue of the warrants themselves. Their initial validity is dependent, not upon the provisions concerned with the ancillary or separate power in an authorised justice to authorise the execution of a warrant by night (ie, s.19). Validity depends, as stated above, upon fulfilment of the statutory preconditions. The applications for the warrants complied with the Act. 
     
      
    87 Notwithstanding the disclosed intention as to the manner by which the warrants were to be executed and whether or not the specific power to authorise execution of a search warrant by night under s.19 was properly exercised on the ground, inter alia, that to do so would facilitate a covert execution of it, are not matters that detract from the fact that the pre-conditions for the warrant’s issue were satisfied. I will return to this aspect below. 
     
      
       
      (d) The terms of the authority/purported authority granted by the warrants 
       
      
    88 Mr Saidi of counsel, in emphasising that the necessary pre-conditions for the issue and the execution of the warrants were satisfied, observed that this included the fact that the Occupier’s Notices were served within the six month period. 
     
      
    89 On behalf of the third, fourth and fifth defendants, he sought to argue in support of a power for a warrant to be executed covertly:- 
     
      
       
        
        “15. One should not confuse the concepts of a covert search warrant with that of a search warrant which may be executed covertly. The latter is permissible, though the former arguably is not. It is submitted that the plaintiff is confusing these concepts in these proceedings. The provisions of Clause 10 of the Regulations recognises the need to protect informants, address safety issues and protect the integrity of investigations. This is consistent with the policy of the legislation. There is recognition that the interests of the occupier can be clearly over-ridden by the terms of the legislation.” 
        
       
      
    90 An alternative submission was that there had been substantial compliance with the relevant statutory requirements within the meaning of s.23 of the Act. 
     
      
    91 The grant of the warrant did not, in its terms, authorise it to be executed covertly. The warrant did not authorise its execution otherwise contrary to law. At most, at least in the case of the first and second warrants, the intended covert execution of them was, as indicated above, only relied upon as one of two grounds to justify their execution by night and for that to be permitted. 
     
      
    92 In these proceedings, the fact that “ongoing investigation – covert investigation” was stated as one of two grounds for authorising the execution of the first warrant by night and “ongoing investigation – covert execution” recorded as a ground for the execution of the second warrant by night could not, even if not valid or proper ground for the exercise of the discrete discretion under s.19 of the Act, in my opinion, lead to the conclusion that that of itself rendered the warrants themselves, otherwise lawfully issued, invalid. An authorised justice impermissibly taking into account a matter for the limited purpose of authorising execution by night would not, in other words, infect the antecedent or primary exercise of power to issue the warrant with vitiating error. 
     
      
    93 In Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427, a case involving the purported authorisation to use a listening device under s.45(3) of the Invasion of Privacy Act 1971 (Qld), the High Court held that that provision did not confer power to authorise trespass and the installation of devices and no power of entry was implied. 
     
      
    94 The majority (Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) examined the question whether the order made purporting to authorise entry could be disregarded so as to leave on foot a valid approval for use of the device so far as that use did not involve otherwise unlawful entry. 
     
      
    95 The Court determined that the purported authority given to enter premises was integral to the authorisation given holding that (at p.443):- 
     
      
       
        
        “The extraneous factor … the perceived necessity to approve entry onto private property … not only contributed to the making of the decision to approve the use of the listening devices but it also took the form of an invalid authorisation to enter private property.” 
        
       
      
    96 In some cases, the Court acknowledges it may be possible to disregard that part of the decision that goes beyond power and treat as valid that part of the decision which is within power (see Coco (supra) at p.443). 
     
      
    97 In the present case, there is no basis in my opinion for a conclusion that the statement of each of the applicants of an intention to execute the warrant covertly, in the words of the majority in Coco, “influences the valid part of the decision” or was “an element integral and essential” in the decision to grant the warrants (Coco (supra) at p.443). The information that was otherwise provided to the authorising justices in the case of each application under the Act for a warrant relevantly addressed the matters to be satisfied under the Act. The intended surreptitious execution of the warrants as disclosed by the applicants, in other words, was a matter separate and indeed extraneous to the statutory pre-conditions required to be fulfilled. 
     
      
    98 Accordingly, the intended execution of the covert execution of the warrants was not a matter, in my opinion, which in any way influenced or related to the antecedent or primary decisions to actually grant the warrants. The authorised justices did not, in the terms of the warrants, authorise or purport to authorise the covert execution of the warrants. I am of the opinion that the warrants were properly issued in accordance with the Act. 
     
      
    99 On the same basis, I do not consider that it can be said that the power to grant a search warrant under the Act was exercised for an improper purpose, namely, for the purpose of granting a covert search warrant. Whilst the disclosures were made to the authorised justices as to the intended covert method of executing the warrants, the warrants were, as I have stated, correctly issued upon the basis that the statutory preconditions were satisfied. Those conditions formed the basis upon which the authorised justices’ power to grant the warrants depended. 
     
      
       
      Whether there was valid execution of the warrants 
       
       
      (a) Statutory safeguards for occupiers 
       
      
    100 The procedures prescribed by the Act on the execution of a search warrant are fundamental to the second question referred to in paragraph [1]. In Ousley v The Queen (supra), Toohey J, at 82, emphasised the importance of the statutory procedural safeguards attending the execution of such a warrant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Tran Nominees is, I think, distinguishable and the grounds just mentioned offer the basis for distinction. In particular, while both search warrants and listening devices involve an invasion of privacy, an analogy between the two cannot be pressed too far. A search warrant will ordinarily be produced to the person whose premises are to be searched whereas the authority for a listening device will necessarily not be known to the person whose communications are to be recorded. It follows that in the case of a listening device, no opportunity is provided for an assessment of its lawfulness at the time of its installation. 
        
       
      
    101 These observations reflect the accepted rationale that underpins statutory schemes that provide for the giving of authority for the execution of search warrants and associated procedural safeguards. 
     
      
    102 Similarly, in Ousley (supra), McHugh J (at 111-112) stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A listening device warrant differs from a search warrant because the execution of the former is by way of covert installation of the listening device. Its installation is intended to go undetected by the person against whom or against whose interests the warrant is executed … In contrast, a search warrant is ordinarily presented to the person whose rights and liability stand to be affected. At common law, the requirement for the officer executing a search warrant to produce the warrant to the occupier of the premises to be searched was restricted to circumstances where the occupier requested to see the warrant and this position is maintained in legislation such as the Search Warrants Act 1985 (NSW), s.16. However, provisions such as s.3H of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) make it mandatory for the executing officer to make a copy of any search warrant issued under that Act available to the occupier of the premises. Such provisions reflect the desire to achieve an appropriate balance between a person’s rights of privacy and the need to facilitate the gathering of evidence against, and the apprehension and conviction of, those who have broken the criminal law. Recognition is given to the importance of enabling persons whose rights of privacy stand to be affected to satisfy themselves of the authority for such action, as emphasised by Lord Wilberforce in  
        Rossminster 
        :- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The person affected, of course, has the right to be satisfied that the power to issue [the warrant] exists: therefore the warrant should … contain a reference to that power.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Thus, although a requirement for disclosure of jurisdiction is easily understood in relation to search warrants, the need for such a requirement is less clear in the case of listening device warrants, which are not presented to affected persons prior to execution …” 
        
       
      
    103 As McHugh J in Ousley (supra) observed, underlying the statutory procedures prescribed for the execution of a search warrant is the fact that, absent statutory authority, the search of a person’s premises and the seizure of items contained therein without the permission of the occupier clearly involves tortious conduct. Accordingly, any statutory authority for such conduct must be strictly construed (at 112). 
     
      
    104 Service of an Occupier’s Notice referred to in s.15 of the Act is a central provision in the statutory scheme prescribed by the Act. It is plainly an important procedural safeguard in relation to a warrant’s execution. As discussed below, this is of central importance in determining the lawfulness of the execution of the particular warrants in this case. 
     
      
    105 Section 15 provides that an authorised justice, in addition to issuing a warrant, is also to prepare and furnish an Occupier’s Notice to the person to whom the authorised justice issues a warrant (s.15(1)). The word “shall” in that provision imports an obligation upon the authorised justice to act in accordance with that section as does s.15(3) insofar as it also imposes an obligation upon the person or persons authorised to execute the search warrant. 
     
      
    106 The provisions of s.15 have been addressed in the submissions of the parties, in particular, those in s.15(3) and (4). 
     
      
    107 Section 15 is in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. An authorised justice shall prepare and furnish an occupier’s notice to the person to whom the authorised justice issues a search warrant. 
        
       
      
    2. An occupier’s notice furnished in relation to a search warrant:- 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) shall be in or to the effect of the prescribed form, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) shall specify:- 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) the name of the person who applied for the warrant, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) the name of the authorised justice who issued the warrant, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iii) the date and the time when the warrant was issued, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    (iv) the address or other description of the premises the subject of the warrant, and 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) shall contain a summary of the nature of the warrant and the powers conferred by the warrant. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        3. A person executing a search warrant shall:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) upon entry into or onto the premises or as soon as practicable thereafter, serve the occupier’s notice on a person who appears to be an occupier of the premises and to be of or above the age of 18 years, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) If no such person is then present in or on the premises, serve the occupier’s notice on the occupier of the premises, either personally or in such other manner as the authorised justice who issued the warrant may direct, as soon as practicable after executing the warrant. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        4. Service of an occupier’s notice pursuant to subsection (3)(b) may be postponed by the authorised justice who issued the search warrant if that authorised justice is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the postponement. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Service of an occupier’s notice pursuant to subsection (3)(b) may be postponed on more than one occasion, but shall not be postponed on any one occasion for a period exceeding six months.” 
         
        
       
       
      (b) The provisions concerning Occupier’s Notices 
       
      
    108 In Black v Breen [2000] NSWSC 987, Ireland AJ, as his Honour then was, considered a contention that the execution of the warrant in that case was contrary to law. An incomplete copy of the Occupier’s Notice had been served. His Honour stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… of more significance is the fact that at the time of the execution of the warrant (police) handed to the plaintiff the first page of the Occupier’s Notice, but inadvertently left with (another police officer) the second page of the notice. I accept that this was done purely by way of oversight on the part of the police officers. P.2 of the Occupier’s Notice sets out under appropriate headings the basis for the issue of the warrant; the entitlement of the occupier to challenge the issue of the warrant or the conduct of the search; the limitations on the power conferred under the Search Warrant and the occupier’s entitlement to inspection of the Application for the Search Warrant, the written reasons for the issue of the warrant and other associated documents held at the Local Court of issue.” 
        
       
      
    109 Ireland AJ referred to the judgment of Kirby P (as his Honour then was) in Carroll v Mijovich (1991) 25 NSWLR 441 and to the Second Reading Speech and reference therein to the major reforms introduced by the 1985 Act. He then added at [36]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not to the point that the plaintiff may have said that he did not wish to read the warrant or even the Occupier’s Notice. The integrity of the execution of the warrant depends upon the performance of the various duties including that of furnishing the occupier with the Occupier’s Notice which on the face of it recognises that it contains ‘important information for occupiers concerning a search warrant’.” 
        
       
      
    110 It was held that the failure to hand the plaintiff a complete Occupier’s Notice meant that the execution of the warrant was contrary to law and a declaration to that effect was made. 
     
      
    111 The requirement for service of an Occupier’s Notice under s.15(3)(a) arises “upon entry”. It is in light of that provision that the proper construction of s.15(3)(b) may be derived. 
     
      
    112 The latter provision essentially provides for service of an Occupier’s Notice other than on entry of the premises searched. Section 15(3)(b), insofar as it provides that “if no such person is then present in or on the premises …” (emphasis added), is a reference to the time of entry, as referred to in s.15(3)(a). If the occupier is not present at the time of entry into or onto the premises, then s.15(3)(b) provides two alternatives for the service of an Occupier’s Notice:- 
     
      
       
      (a) Personal service of the notice on the occupier. 
       
       
      (b) Service in such other manner as the authorised justice who issued the warrant may direct. 
       
      
    113 These alternatives, it is to be noted, are both subject to the requirement to effect service “as soon as practicable after executing the warrant”. 
     
      
    114 The evident purpose of s.15(3) was to ensure that an Occupier’s Notice was brought to the attention of the occupier either at the point of entry or “as soon as practicable after” the warrant’s execution. The importance and purpose which the legislature attached to the Occupier’s Notice and its service contemporaneously with the execution of the warrant or promptly thereafter is clear. 
     
      
    115 Similarly, s.15(4) is also an important provision. It provides for the postponement of the service of an Occupier’s Notice. However, it is not unlimited in its operation, for it specifically is concerned with and limited in its operation to “Service of an Occupier’s Notice pursuant to subsection (3)(b) …”. 
     
      
    116 It has been contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the power to postpone service only arises following, and not before, the issue of a search warrant and, in particular, after execution of it. That conclusion, it is said, is inescapable from the terms of s.15(3) read with s.15(4).  
     
      
    117 In Carroll v Mijovich (supra), Kirby P examined the historical background and statutory context within which the Act is to be construed. His Honour referred to the obligation to provide an occupier with a notice of rights as one of “… the major reforms introduced …” (by the Act). He quoted the Minister in the Second Reading Speech to the following effect (at 3860):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… this Notice will be given to every occupier of premises subject to search under a valid warrant. The Notice will contain details concerning the reason for the search and the nature of the powers conferred by the warrant. The language of the Notice will be plain so as to enable the occupier to check that the warrant has been properly issued. The Notice will contain advice in relation to seeking legal assistance should the occupier be dissatisfied with any aspect of the search. The occupier will keep this Notice. While introducing the idea of an Occupier’s Notice, the Bills preserve the requirement to show the original warrant.” 
          
        
       
      
    118 Parliament did not expressly provide in the Act for the consequence of a failure to comply with s.15. In those circumstances, as in Carroll (supra), it is necessary to identify, if possible, any presumed legislative “intent” from the words of the provision in question. As Kirby P there stated (at 449), the relevant words are to be construed in the context of the Act as a whole and for the purpose of achieving the objects which may be imputed to Parliament in providing as it did in that provision. 
     
      
    119 The execution of a search warrant is a serious matter (Carroll v Mijovich (supra) at 449). In the present case, the effect of the approach taken by each applicant and those executing the warrants was to give priority to operational considerations over and at the expense of the procedural safeguards in s.15 of the Act. 
     
      
    120 The operational requirements of law enforcement agencies may be such, in a particular case, that a covert search warrant procedure is considered by those involved in an investigation as being desirable or even necessary. Inconvenience without such a procedure may result. However, it is the terms of the statutory scheme that determine where the balance lies between the interests of such agencies and the interests of the occupiers of premises. Accordingly, it has been observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “[I]nconvenience in carrying out an object authorised by legislation is not a ground for eroding fundamental common law rights” 
        :  
        Plenty v Dillon 
         (1991) 171 CLR at 654 referred to by the Full Court of the High Court in  
        Coco v The Queen 
         [1993-94] 179 CLR 427 at 436. 
        
       
      
    121 Kirby J in Ousley (supra) stated (at 144) that occasionally there is a need for the enlargement of police powers beyond those traditionally enjoyed. His Honour noted the accepted approach that courts properly tend to adopt a practical rather than an unduly technical view of challenges to warrants permitting intrusion into the property and privacy of those subject to them. However, his Honour also observed that when a real defect is demonstrated “courts err, rightly in my view, on the side defensive of the fundamental rights of the individual affected” (at 144). 
     
      
    122 The Search Warrants Act provides occupiers of premises with procedural safeguards. Provisions by way of exception or qualification would be required to limit their application in particular cases. In Morris v. Beardmore [1981] AC 446, Lord Scarman (at 463) stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “When, for the detection, prevention or prosecution of crime, Parliament confers upon a constable a power or right which curtails the rights of others, it is to be expected that Parliament intended the curtailment to extend no further than its express authorisation.” 
        
       
      
    123 In Regina v Inland Revenue Commissioners (1980) AC 952, Lord Wilberforce, at 997-998, stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Courts have the duty to supervise, I would say critically, even jealously, the legality of any purported exercise of these powers. They are the guardians of the citizens’ right to privacy. But they must do this in the context of the times, ie., of increasing Parliamentary intervention, and of the modern power of judicial review. In my respectful opinion, appeals to 18th Century precedents of arbitrary action by Secretaries of State and references to general warrants do nothing to throw light on the issue. Furthermore, while the Courts may look critically at legislation which impairs the rights of citizens and should resolve any doubt in interpretation in their favour, it is no part of their duty, or power, to restrict or impede the working of legislation, even of unpopular legislation; to do so would be to weaken rather than to advance the democratic process.” 
        
       
      
    124 However, in this case, whilst particular provisions of the Act curtail occupier’s rights, they only do so to the extent that the Act authorises. Whilst the presumption against statutory interference with fundamental rights may be displaced by necessary implication, that test is a very stringent one: Coco (supra) at 438. The presumption, as the High Court stated in that case, may be displaced if it is necessary to prevent the statutory provisions from becoming inoperative or meaningless. That principle, however, has not been contended as having application in the present proceedings. 
     
      
    125 In the written submissions on behalf of the third, fourth and fifth defendants (paragraph 13), examples are provided of what are said to be “reasonable grounds for searching the premises in the absence of an occupier and/or postponement of the warrant …”. The examples provided were as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (a) Safety concerns if the warrant were to be executed in the presence of the occupier or other persons on the premises. 
       
       
      (b) To prevent the risk of the search being frustrated upon police attendance (eg., disposal of drugs before police entry). 
       
       
      (c) The occupier being a known violent offender or having known mental instability rendering it unsafe for police to conduct a search in his/her presence. 
       
       
      (d) Public interest immunity concerns insofar as the search may be part of a wider operation and any search may tip other suspected officers off when searches may be proposed with respect to other premises. 
       
       
      (e) To prevent any compromise or frustration of any ongoing investigation. 
       
      
    126 However, be that as it may, there is not to be found in the Act’s detailed regime governing the issue and execution of search warrants authorisation for their execution covertly. The provisions of the Act, in fact, point in the opposite direction. The regulatory regime is clearly intended to protect persons as occupiers of premises that are the subject of a warrant, by requiring, inter alia, that they be given a notice of rights. 
     
      
    127 The covert execution of each of the warrants was, in my opinion, clearly contrary to the provisions of the Act. It is plain that the planned covert nature of the execution in each case had the effect of negating the procedural safeguards provided for by the Act. The result is that the execution of each warrant was, in my opinion, unlawful. 
     
      
       
      (c) The question of the validity of the decision to postpone service of the Occupier’s Notices 
       
      
    128 It is clear from what has been earlier stated that there is support for the contention that a decision by an authorised justice to postpone service of an Occupier’s Notice solely for the purpose of enhancing the effectiveness of police investigations was not an available ground for a decision to postpone serve under s.15(4) of the Act. 
     
      
    129 However, given the conclusion expressed above, namely, that the execution of each warrant was unlawful, it is unnecessary to express any concluded view on this aspect. 
     
      
       
      Issues relating to the Occupier’s Notices 
       
      
    130 A number of procedural issues were raised concerning the Occupier’s Notices. These were:- 
     
      
       
      (a) whether an Occupier’s Notice in each case had been served; 
       
       
      (b) if such a notice had been served, the date upon which they were served; 
       
       
      (c) in the case of the third warrant, whether service of the notice upon the plaintiff’s solicitor was service for the purposes of the Act. 
       
      
    131 In light of the conclusion reached and expressed above, namely, that the execution of each warrant was unlawful, it is not necessary to deal with and resolve each of these procedural issues. They each relate to matters that post-dated the execution of the warrants and would only have required determination had the execution of the warrants otherwise been lawful. 
     
      
    132 It is also unnecessary, given the conclusion which I have expressed as to the lawfulness of the execution of each warrant, to resolve on a final basis the contention that the search was conducted on a selected basis as an intelligence-gathering exercise (see paragraph [25]). I simply observe that under s.7(1))(a) of the Act, police executing a warrant had a discretion to (“may”) seize things mentioned in a warrant. There may in particular circumstances be a strategic reason for not seizing all such things. Further, a search of premises under a warrant will result in police executing a warrant making observations. The fact that a note may be made of such observations during the course of a lawful execution of a warrant does not, to my mind, render the execution of a warrant unlawful. 
     
      
       
      Covert search warrant legislation 
       
      
    133 Mr Robinson referred to legislation that expressly addresses the subject of covert search warrants. Ms Richardson, on behalf of the defendants, correctly submitted that references to other legislation, in particular, the provisions of the Terrorism (Police Powers) Act 2002 (NSW), Part 3 – “Covert search warrants”, does not assist in the construction of the Act’s provisions. In deference to the submissions made, I will deal briefly with some of the matters raised.  
     
      
    134 Reference to such legislation does, at least, demonstrate, as one might expect, that the legislature has marked such covert investigative procedures as calling for specific provision, given the obvious implications such procedures have for the civil rights of occupiers of premises. This may be seen as reflected in the provisions governing the authorisation of applications for a covert search warrant under the Terrorism (Police Powers) Act. Section 27C requires, inter alia, that the person giving authorisation for a covert search warrant to issue must suspect or believe on reasonable grounds, inter alia:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(c) that it is necessary for the entry and search of those premises to be conducted without the knowledge of any occupier of the premises.” 
        
       
      
    135 In this provision, the test of necessity rather than that of desirability or mere convenience has been selected by the legislature and sets the bar at a high level before authorisation may be given for such a warrant to issue. 
     
      
    136 Mr. Robinson provided a copy of an article entitled “Sneak and Peek Search Warrants and the USA Patriot Act” (September 2002). The article addresses the issue of statutory authorisation for what are referred to as “covert entry search warrants” or “surreptitious entry search warrants” (also referred to in the article as “sneak and peek search warrants”). In the year 2001, s.213 of the Patriot Act introduced for the first time statutory authorisation for such warrants. The section is not restricted to terrorism offences but potentially applies to any federal crime. Provision is made in that statute whereby any notice required to be given may be delayed, inter alia, if “… the court finds reasonable cause to believe that providing immediate notification of the execution of the warrant may have an adverse result …”. 
     
      
    137 The expression “adverse result” is defined as including specific circumstances such as “… otherwise seriously jeopardising an investigation or unduly delaying a trial”. 
     
      
    138 These provisions enacted in the United States reflect the acceptance, evident in some legislation enacted in recent times in Australia, for there to be specific statutory authority for covert search and seizure warrants. See, for example, the Terrorism (Police Powers) Act 2002 (NSW), the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 (Qld) (s.215, in relation to what is termed “Designated offence, organised crime or terrorism” in Chapter 9, Covert Searches), the Terrorism (Community Protection) Act 2003 (Vic) and the Terrorism (Emergency Powers) Act 2003 (NT). 
     
      
       
      Conclusions 
       
      
    139 In relation to the three warrants, I am of the opinion that each warrant was validly granted under the Act. 
     
      
    140 I have also concluded that the execution of each warrant was contrary to the Act and was, accordingly, in each case unlawful. 
     
      
    141 I, accordingly, consider that the plaintiffs are entitled to relief by way of declaratory relief in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
      (a) That the execution of the search warrant issued on 24 September 2002 by the first defendant at the Local Court of New South Wales at Redfern in respect of specified premises at Randwick ( 
      “the first warrant” 
      ) upon application by the third defendant was unlawful. 
       
       
      (b) That the execution of the search warrant issued on 11 November 2002 by the first defendant at the Local Court at Redfern in respect of specified premises at Bondi Junction ( 
      “the second warrant” 
      ) upon application by the fourth defendant was unlawful. 
       
       
      (c) That the execution of the search warrant issued on 19 December 2002 by the second defendant at the Local Court at Redfern in respect of specified premises at Bondi Junction ( 
      “the second warrant” 
      ) upon application by the fourth defendant was unlawful. 
       
      
    142 I request that the parties produce short minutes of orders to give effect to this judgment. I will provide the parties with the opportunity of making submissions in relation to any ancillary orders including any order as to costs.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application brought by the Attorney General for New South Wales by way of summons filed on 24 April 2007 pursuant to the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act). 
     
      
    2 The relief sought at the hearing on 8 May 2007 was an order pursuant to s.16(1) of the Act that the defendant be detained in a correctional centre on an interim basis for a period of 28 days from 13 May 2007. 
     
      
    3 The alternative relief sought is an order pursuant to s.8(1) of the Act that the defendant be subject to interim supervision for the same period. 
     
      
    4 I observe at this point that the hearing of the application for a continuing detention order by way of a “preliminary hearing” is required to be conducted by the Supreme Court within 28 days after an application is filed: s.15(3) of the Act. 
     
      
    5 In the case of a preliminary hearing, the Court is required to determine if it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order, as the case may be: s.7(4) and s.15(4) of the Act. 
     
      
    6 The application is supported by the following affidavits:- 
     
      
       
      (a) affidavit of Sharon Klamer affirmed 2 May 2007; 
       
       
      (b) affidavit of David Anthony Bright affirmed 2 May 2007; 
       
       
      (c) affidavit of Christina Valentine affirmed 24 April 2007;  
       
       
      (d) affidavit of Christina Valentine affirmed 2 May 2007; 
       
       
      (e) affidavit of Denes Blazer affirmed 7 May 2007. 
       
      
    7 In the observations which I make and in the conclusions and findings which I express in this judgment, I emphasise that in no way should I be understood as indicating that those observations or conclusions would necessarily apply in relation to any matter that would arise for consideration and determination on a final hearing of the matter. The Act does not, in a preliminary hearing or in relation to an application for an interim order under the Act, provide for evidence or material tendered by the Attorney General to be challenged. Nor does the Act make provision for material or evidence to be produced or tendered by the defendant at those stages. That, however, can occur or take place at a hearing before any final order is made. 
     
      
       
      The statutory provisions 
       
      
    8 The scheme established by the Act has been the subject of examination by McClellan CJ at CL in Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340. It is sufficient for the purposes of the present application to confine attention to certain key provisions of the Act. 
     
      
    9 Section 3 sets out the objects as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The objects of this Act are to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) to ensure the safety and protection of the community, and  
        
       
       
        
        (b) to facilitate the rehabilitation of serious sex offenders.” 
        
       
      
    10 As McClellan CJ at CL observed in Gallagher, at [21], the fundamental objective of the legislature is the protection of the public which, where necessary, is intended to be achieved by supervision of an individual or if necessary by his or her continuing detention. If an order is made, as his Honour there observed, the consequences may be the continuing incarceration of an individual or the imposition of serious restrictions on his or her liberty. 
     
      
    11 On an application for an interim detention order under s.16 of the Act, the Court is required to be satisfied of three fundamental matters, namely:- 
     
      
       
      (a) That the defendant is currently in custody in a correction centre serving a sentence of imprisonment by way of full-time detention for a  
      “serious sex offence” 
       or an  
      “offence of a sexual nature” 
      : s.14(1). There was no issue taken in the present proceedings on this matter. The requirement is satisfied on the evidence in the present application. 
       
       
      (b) The defendant’s current custody is to expire before the proceedings for final orders: s.15(1)(a). In this application, that requirement is satisfied as the defendant’s current sentence is due to expire on Sunday 13 May 2007. 
       
       
      (c) That the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or extended supervision order: s.15(1)(b). 
       
      
    12 A substantial amount of the evidence on this application was directed to this third requirement. 
     
      
       
      The statutory process: continuing detention orders 
       
      
    13 A number of the provisions of the Act impose conditions as to time as follows:- 
     
      
       
      • An application by the Attorney General under the Act may not be made until the last six months of the offender’s current custody: s.14(2). 
       
       
      • A preliminary hearing into the application is to be conducted by the Supreme Court within 28 days after the application is filed in the Supreme Court or within such further time as the Court may allow: s.15(3). 
       
       
      • An interim detention order must not exceed 28 days from the day on which it commences: s.16(2). 
       
       
      • Interim detention orders may be renewed from time to time, but not so as to provide for the detention of the offender under such an order for periods totalling more than 3 months: s.16(3). 
       
      
    14 I note at this point that s.16(1)(a) clearly envisages a situation whereby the offender’s current custody may expire before an application under the Act is heard and determined. It is for that eventuality that power is vested in the Court to make interim detention orders under s.16. 
     
      
    15 Proceedings under the Act are civil proceedings and to the extent that the Act does not provide for their conduct, such proceedings are to be conducted in accordance with the law (including the rules of evidence) relating to civil proceedings (s.21). 
     
      
    16 Proceedings under the Act are instituted by the Attorney General by application to this Court under Part 2 of the Act (in respect of “extended supervision orders” – meaning orders under s.9 and s.17 of the Act or under Part 3 in respect of “continuing detention orders” made under s.17 of the Act). 
     
      
    17 Applications made under Part 2 or Part 3 may proceed:- 
     
      
       
      (a) By way of a preliminary hearing (s.7(3) and s.15(3)). 
       
       
      (b) Unless dismissed under s.7(5) or s.15(5), applications for either type of order referred to in the preceding paragraph are to be heard and finally determined in accordance with either s.9 or s.17 of the Act. 
       
      
    18 Parts 2 and 3 both make provision for interim orders (interim supervision orders or interim detention orders). Such orders, as earlier noted, may only operate for a finite term (28 days from the date of commencement of the order) unless renewed but for not more than 3 months: s.8(3) and s.16(3). 
     
      
    19 In proceedings for interim orders under s.8 or s.16, the Court may receive and act upon supporting documentation. It is clear from the terms of those sections that the rules of evidence do not apply in proceedings for interim orders. Those provisions state, inter alia, that the Court may make an interim order if “it appears to … the Court”, inter alia, “that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing order or extended supervision order”. The provisions for interim orders are, accordingly, less exact and demanding, at least as to their admissibility requirements concerning the material relied upon in the application for such inter orders than the actual evidence adduced in the proceedings by way of final determination. So much is clear from the expressions in s.8(1)(b) and s.16(1)(b) “the matters alleged” and “would, if proved”. 
     
      
    20 However, that said, the matters alleged or established in the supporting documentation on an application for an interim order under the Act must be such that “if proved” they would justify the making of a continuing supervision order or an extended supervision order: s.8(1)(b) and s.16(1)(b). Accordingly, the supporting documentation must address matters that the Court will be required, in due course, to consider when determining proceedings under s.9 or s.17 of the Act. These include “the safety of the community”. 
     
      
    21 A question has been raised in these proceedings as to whether the Court has a residual discretion not to make interim orders even if it appears to the Court that the specified prerequisites in s.8 or s.16 are satisfied. That, however, is not an issue that needs to be resolved in the present proceedings for reasons recorded below. 
     
      
    22 In the present application, there is a substantial body of supporting documentation, much of which would be admissible on a hearing for final relief under the Act. Whilst it is not specifically required by s.8(1)(b) or s.16(1)(b), given the significance to a defendant against whom an interim order is sought under the Act, it is obviously desirable, where possible, for the matters relied upon in support of an application for an interim order under the Act to be supported by material provided by those with direct knowledge of the facts concerning the individual offender. That is certainly the case here. 
     
      
    23 In an application for an interim order, it is necessary for the Court to determine whether, if proved, the relevant matters would justify the making of a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order: see in that respect, s.9(3) and s.17(4). For that purpose, consideration must also be given to the provisions of s.17(2) and (3) which are in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “17(1) … 
        
       
       
        
        (2) An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he  
        or she is not kept under supervision. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A continuing detention order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she  
        is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.” 
         
        
       
      
    24 In the written submissions on behalf of the Attorney General (paragraph 93), reference was made to the preliminary view expressed by McClellan CJ at CL in Gallagher (supra) at [34] to the effect that the Act imposes a standard of proof higher than the ordinary civil standard but less than the criminal standard, beyond reasonable doubt. This preliminary analysis was challenged and it was suggested that the Act “may fairly be viewed as imposing the ordinary civil standard of balance of probabilities – with the nature of the issue, and the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding, affecting the process of being satisfied to the requisite civil standard (cf. Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1983) 60 CLR 336)”. 
     
      
    25 I consider, by reason of the nature of the supporting documentation relied upon in the present application, that it is unnecessary to express any final opinion in relation to the provisions of s.17(3). It is sufficient to say that the standard of persuasion in a civil proceeding in terms of the reasonable satisfaction of a tribunal as to whether a past event or fact has been established having regard, in particular, to the seriousness of an allegation made, the likelihood or otherwise of its occurrence and the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding (the Briginshaw test) may not be entirely applicable to the making of a determination under s.17(2) and (3). Such a determination involves, not the establishment of a past fact or event, but the undertaking of a predictive risk assessment as to the degree of probability that a particular offender some time in the future is “likely” to commit a further serious sex offence in the circumstances to which those provisions refer. No doubt, the nature and quality of the material used for such the making of an assessment will be vital. 
     
      
       
      Submissions on behalf of the defendant 
       
      
    26 Mr M Austin of counsel, on behalf of the defendant, submitted that on the material provided, the Court would not make a determination that a continuing detention order is appropriate in the circumstances of this case. He submitted in this respect that the material on the application merely discloses that the defendant, after almost nine years in custody, is “an untreated sex offender”. It was further submitted that the defendant is not a person for whom the Custody Based Intensive Treatment (CUBIT) programme is appropriate. Mr Austin submitted that the only proposition established by the material before the Court was that there is a programme for serious sex offenders and that the defendant has not completed that programme. He submitted that whilst the programme may be the best programme “for the average or majority of inmates who could fall into the category of serious sex offenders”, it could not be suggested that the material in support of the application established that the programme was suitable for everyone and it was contended that it certainly was not suitable for the defendant. 
     
      
    27 Accordingly, it was contended that the material relied upon in support of the application would not enable the Court to reach the conclusion required by s.16(1)(b), given, in particular, the high standard of proof that applies under s.17 of the Act. 
     
      
    28 Mr Austin additionally relied upon the issue of delay in the making of the application. 
     
      
    29 As I understood the contention made in relation to the issue of delay, it was that the legislation should be interpreted and understood as requiring any application for a continuing detention order to be made at a time which would enable the Court to conduct a preliminary hearing and, if necessary, make any interim orders within a period of six months. 
     
      
    30 In the present proceedings, the complaint was that, by reason of delay, any interim order now made by the Court will result in the continued detention of the defendant beyond the current period of custody. Had the application been made at an earlier point in time, a preliminary hearing could have been conducted and completed well within the six month period to which he referred and thereby have avoided the prospect of the defendant being further detained after having served nine years in custody. 
     
      
    31 The submission on delay was linked with the submission that the Court ultimately will not be satisfied on the material so far presented that it is likely that a final determination will result in a continuing detention order being made. I will return to these contentions below. 
     
      
       
      The relevant history of offences 
       
      
    32 The defendant’s criminal record in relation to sexual offences, including the offence the subject of the current term of imprisonment, was set out in the detailed written submissions produced by Mr L Babb, Crown Advocate, and Dr D Kell, who appeared for the Attorney General. Reproduced below is a schedule taken from paragraph 31 of those submissions:-

    33 A matter relied upon in the present application was the evidence establishing that the sexual offence in respect of which the defendant is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment, as well as the sexual offences in respect of which he was convicted on 8 December 1989, were both committed whilst the defendant was on release on parole following conviction on a prior sexual offence. 
     
      
       
      Matters under s.17(4) of the Act 
       
      
    34 The documentation in support of the application includes a number of pre-release reports made by Ms Joanne Kennedy, Manager, Long Bay Parole Unit dated 23 March 2005, 14 April 2006 and 7 June 2006. 
     
      
    35 The assessment and recommendation made in the report of 23 March 2005, is based upon interviews with the defendant and other sources of information identified in the report. It is unnecessary here to detail the history and assessments referred to in it. It is sufficient to say that the source materials relied upon, taken at face value, would support the recommendation stated therein, namely, that release of the defendant to parole was not recommended and that the most appropriate course for him was that he make a further application to join the next CUBIT Programme scheduled for later in that year (2005). 
     
      
    36 The pre-sentence report dated 14 April 2006 referred to assessments of a medium risk of general re-offending and to a high risk of sexual/violent re-offending, each assessment being based upon the administration of “Instruments” or assessment tests. The report records that the defendant’s circumstances remained unchanged and that otherwise he remained as “an untreated sex offender …” who continued to refuse to re-enter the CUBIT programme since his unsuccessful attempt in 2003. 
     
      
    37 The supplementary pre-release report dated 7 June 2006 maintained the previous risk assessments and re-affirmed that release to parole posed “an unacceptable level of risk to the community”. 
     
      
    38 The psychological risk assessment report dated 18 April 2007 by Sharon Klamer, psychologist, proceeds upon the basis of a detailed account of the historical sex offences committed by the defendant, his response to previous supervision, noting his breaches of parole, and his attitude to treatment and his attitude to risk. 
     
      
    39 In light of the submissions made on behalf of the defendant, it is appropriate to observe that, according to Ms Klamer’s report (p.7), the defendant enrolled to participate in the Education of Sex Offenders Programme at Lithgow Correctional Centre in October 2003, but that he withdraw from the programme before completing it. 
     
      
    40 The report also records that the defendant commenced treatment in the High Intensity Custody Based Intensive Treatment (CUBIT) on 17 March 2003. The programme length varies between 8 and 12 months, depending upon progress. The report records that the defendant was discharged from the programme at his own request on 5 May 2003 after six weeks in treatment. His progress in treatment was described as poor, it being noted that there was a failure by him to accept responsibility for his general behaviour in the programme and two suspensions for threatening behaviour. 
     
      
    41 On 2 June 2003, a Ms Shaw is recorded as having recommended that the defendant be re-referred to CUBIT and that he complete the programme “prior to his release”. Ms Klamer’s report notes that information contained in reports compiled since that time in relation to the defendant’s interest, or lack thereof, in participating in treatment, was conflicting. 
     
      
    42 Since 16 September 2006, the report records that there had been a number of written communications from the defendant in relation to him returning to the programme and the conditions under which he would agree to return. These included requests by him that he recommence the programme from where he stopped in 2003, a refusal to discuss the index offence and his most recent prior convictions “due to the involvement of underworld figures” and a request to discuss these offences with the therapeutic manager or psychologist individually. 
     
      
    43 In November 2006, the defendant was advised that he was not eligible to participate in a programme as he was due for release at the end of his sentence on 13 May 2007 and there was no longer sufficient time to complete the programme. 
     
      
    44 On the evidence on this application, I am unable to accept the submission made on behalf of the defendant that the CUBIT programme was not an appropriate or was not a suitable one to meet his requirements. 
     
      
    45 The affidavit of Ms Klamer sworn 2 May 2007, paragraph [45], stated that in her opinion, the only appropriate treatment programme for the defendant is the CUBIT programme. Ms Klamer there also stated that there is no comparable programme available in the community for high risk offenders. 
     
      
    46 Mr David Bright also addressed the issue in his affidavit sworn 2 May 2007. Mr Bright is the Therapeutic Manager of CUBIT, Sex Offender Programmes at the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services. 
     
      
    47 Correspondence with the defendant annexed to Mr Bright’s affidavit reveals that the reason for refusing to re-admit him to the CUBIT programme was not that he was considered as unsuitable or that the course was not an appropriate one for him. Rather, the reason was that the conditions requested by him could not be met. Subsequent correspondence referred to by Mr Bright indicates that the conditions which the defendant was seeking to have imposed upon his proposed re-entry to the programme were not acceptable. Mr Bright’s conclusion expressed in his affidavit (paragraph 77) does suggest that the CUBIT treatment programme would be both appropriate and suitable for the defendant. 
     
      
    48 The supporting material concerning the defendant’s convictions suggests a pattern of offending of an opportunistic nature and the difficulty that any such tendency may pose in terms of supervision taken with his prior history of breaches of parole, the assessments made of the defendant and his unwillingness to participate in the programme on the conditions specified in it, all constitute supporting material on this application for interim relief which would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order. 
     
      
    49 Ms Klamer stated in her affidavit that in February 2007, she was requested by the New South Wales Commissioner of Corrective Services to prepare a risk assessment report in respect of the defendant in anticipation of an application under the Act. Ms Klamer undertook the assessment and produced a Risk Assessment Report dated 18 April 2007 which is Exhibit SK-1 to her abovementioned affidavit. She interviewed the defendant on 27 February 2007 and 2 March 2007 for the purposes of making her assessment. Ms Klamer stated that she also took a risk assessment relating to the defendant based upon both Static Risk Factors using the Static – 99 Actuarial Risk Assessment Tool and upon Dynamic Risk Factors. Her overall assessment and conclusion was that the defendant is a high risk sex offender and that that assessment is based upon both of the abovementioned risk assessments. Ms Klamer scored the defendant as a “9” on the Static – 99 by application of the Static – 99 Coding Rules. Ms Klamer stated that, in her experience it is rare for an offender to receive a Static – 99 score as high as nine, which score places the defendant in the group of offenders in respect of whom there is a high risk of re-offending. 
     
      
    50 Ms Klamer also addressed the Dynamic Risk Factors which involves a structured interview process undertaken with the offender and has regard to the individual offender’s psychological state and life circumstances. Based on the Static and Dynamic Risk Factors, Ms Klamer assessed the defendant as being in the high risk category of sexually re-offending relative to other adult males (report, p.14). 
     
      
    51 Having regard to the material on this application for an interim order which points to a limited amount of community support available to the defendant (in particular that that would be available from his female friend), the defendant’s previous pattern of offending and the assessments made as to his risk of re-offending, I am not presently persuaded that supervision as envisaged by the Act would provide sufficient protection from the assessed prospect of him re-offending. 
     
      
    52 I am of the opinion that the material tendered on this application establishes a basis for the risk assessment referred to in the reports. I also have regard to the defendant’s past conduct in not responding to the trust reposed in him when on parole. Accordingly, I am not satisfied on this application that an extended supervision order would afford adequate community protection. 
     
      
    53 On the issue of delay, I do not consider that I should accept that there has been relevant delay. As indicated earlier, the Act expressly provides that an application may not be made until the last six months of the offender’s current custody or supervision: s.6(2) and s.14(2). The Act does not specify a date by which an application must be made. As earlier indicated, the direction for a risk assessment to be undertaken by Ms Klamer was given in February 2007 and there has not been any relevant delay since that time. 
     
      
    54 I have had regard in considering the submissions made on behalf of the defendant to the fact that, prior to Ms Klamer advising the defendant that an assessment was to be made for the purposes of a possible application under the Act, he had an expectation that he would be released on 13 May 2007. That, I accept, is an important matter in determining whether or not there is any relevant unfairness or detriment arising from the making of the application. 
     
      
    55 I have concluded that, given the time periods prescribed in the legislative scheme, that it has not been established that relevant delay has occurred. Even if there can be said to have been delay prior to February 2007, I do not consider that any such delay in itself has created a basis for refusing the application. 
     
      
    56 The question of the exercise of any residual discretion referred to in paragraph [21] need not be determined as I am of the opinion that an interim detention order ought be made. 
     
      
    57 I, accordingly, make orders in terms of paragraph (1) and (2) of the summons as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) An order pursuant to s.16(1) of the  
      Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW)  
      that the defendant be detained in a correctional centre on an interim basis for a period of 28 days from 13 May 2007. 
       
       
      (2) An order pursuant to s.20(1) of the Act that the Court issue a warrant for the committal of the defendant to a correctional centre for the duration of the interim detention order referred to in order (1) above. 
       
      
    58 I, accordingly, direct that the above orders be entered forthwith and that an appropriate warrant issue. 
     
      
    59 I emphasise, as I have indicated earlier, that the findings I have made have been made for the purpose of the application for an interim detention order pursuant to s.16 of the Act. Those findings are based upon the material and evidence that has been placed before the Court for that purpose. 
     
      
    60 The Act envisages that, following a preliminary hearing, if the Court is satisfied of matters referred to in s.16(4) of the Act, then the Court is to make orders appointing two qualified psychiatrists to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the offender and to furnish reports to the Court on the results of those examinations and to direct the offender to attend such examinations. 
     
      
    61 The hearing of the application for an interim detention order has addressed the matter that the Court is required to determine in a preliminary hearing under s.15(4) of the Act and I accept the submission that has been made on behalf of the Attorney General that the hearing of the application for an interim detention order constitutes the “preliminary hearing” under that provision. In the case of such a hearing, the Court is required to determine if it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continued detention order or an extended supervision order. 
     
      
    62 Paragraph [4] of the summons seeks orders which the Court is empowered to make under s.15(4) of the Act. On the basis of the findings to which I have referred, the plaintiff has established an entitlement to such orders. 
     
      
    63 Accordingly, pursuant to s.15(4) of the Act, I make the following additional orders:- 
     
      
       
      (3) Two qualified psychiatrists are to be appointed to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations by 1 June 2007. 
       
       
      (4) The defendant is directed to attend those examinations. 
       
      
    64 Finally I record that, in order that the Court may determine at a final hearing the application that has been made for a continuing detention order, it must consider any admissible evidence that may be adduced on behalf of the defendant. Accordingly, the legislation makes it clear that a finding required and made at this stage is preliminary in nature. In proceedings for a final determination and a final order due regard must be given to the evidence in such proceedings, including, psychiatric reports to which I have referred.

      JUDGMENT -  
      (On applications arising from discovery that a member of the jury was disqualified from serving as a juror - see T1403) 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On Monday 7 May 2007 (day 25 of the trial), a juror did not attend Court by 10am to continue his participation in the criminal trial of the Accused. In accordance with usual practice, attempts were made to contact the absent juror to ascertain his whereabouts. These attempts were unsuccessful.  
     
      
    2 Further inquiries by the Sheriff’s Office revealed that the juror had been arrested over the weekend of 5 - 6 May 2007 and charged with offences of resist police, driving recklessly, driving an unregistered motor vehicle, driving whilst disqualified and exceeding the speed limit by more than forty-five kilometres per hour. The juror had appeared before a Local Court on the morning of 7 May 2007, with the proceedings being adjourned to 21 May 2007 and bail being refused by a Magistrate (MFI 40). 
     
      
    3 Further inquiries were undertaken by the Sheriff’s Office at my request. It was ascertained that the juror had been disqualified from driving by court order for a period of four years on 12 April 2002, with further periods of disqualification being ordered thereafter by courts for other offences, so that the juror is disqualified from driving until 24 April 2015 (MFI 42). 
     
      
    4 This state of affairs has given rise to a number of legal questions which have been argued by counsel and require urgent determination by me. Those issues are: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Whether the trial is rendered a nullity as a result of the presence on the jury of a person who is disqualified from serving as a juror;  
        
       
       
        
        (b) If the trial is not a nullity, whether that person ought be discharged under s.22  
        Jury Act 1977 
        ; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) If that person is discharged, whether the trial ought proceed before a jury comprising the eleven remaining jurors under s.22  
        Jury Act 1977 
        .  
        
       
      
    5 Having heard submissions from counsel yesterday morning and having considered those submissions, I indicated to the parties at 2pm yesterday my conclusions on these issues (T1400). In this judgment, I give my reasons for those conclusions. 
     
      
       
      The Present Trial 
       
      
    6 The history of the litigation giving rise to this trial may be found in R v Petroulias (No 1) [2006] NSWSC 788. This is a retrial following a trial before Sully J and a jury in 2005, at which the jury was unable to agree and was discharged.  
     
      
    7 As at the first trial, the indictment against the Accused, alleges:  
     
      
       
      (a) one count of defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s.29D  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      ;  
       
       
      (b) one count of agreeing to receive a benefit on an understanding that the exercise by him of his duty as a Commonwealth officer would be affected contray to s.73  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      ; and  
       
       
      (c) one count of publishing to a person to whom he was not authorised to publish, documents which came into his possession by virtue of him being a Commonwealth officer and which it was his duty not to disclose, an offence under s.70  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      . 
       
      
    8 On 26 March 2007, a jury was selected and the trial for the Accused commenced. On the sixth day (2 April 2007) a (different) juror fell ill. In circumstances which do not require elaboration, Senior Counsel for the Crown and the Accused submitted that it was appropriate to await the recovery of the juror and to resume the trial with a jury of twelve. No application was made to discharge the ill juror under s.22 Jury Act 1977. I agreed with the submissions of the parties. 
     
      
    9 The trial resumed on 16 April 2007 and has continued since then. A number of Crown witnesses have been called - Michael Robert Ingersoll, Richard Llewellyn Morgan, Lowman Chow and Francis Jeyapal. The examination in chief of Emmanuel Demetrios Aivaliotes was drawing to an end at the time when the present issue arose. Although some twenty-five witnesses remain to be called in the Crown case after Mr Aivaliotes (assuming all the Crown witnesses called at the first trial are called again at the present trial), it is fair to observe that the Crown case is well advanced at this time. Mr Morgan, Mr Chow and Mr Aivaliotes are important witnesses in the Crown case and their evidence occupied substantial time at the first trial and has done so again at this trial.  
     
      
    10 Before the trial commenced, the jury panel was given an estimate of four months for the trial. It is my present belief that the balance of the trial is likely to occupy some two months.  
     
      
    11 This was the point that had been reached in the trial when the surprising discovery was made this week, that present on the jury all along was a person who was disqualified from service as a juror. 
     
      
       
      The Broad Positions of the Crown and Accused 
       
      
    12 Mr Sutherland SC, for the Accused, submits that the state of affairs which now presents itself means that the trial is a nullity and cannot proceed. He submits that such a finding ought be made and that the remaining eleven members of the jury ought be discharged.  
     
      
    13 The Crown submits that the trial is not a nullity and that the Court ought proceed to discharge the absent juror under s.22 Jury Act 1977 with the trial to continue with a jury constituted by the remaining eleven jurors in accordance with s.22. 
     
      
    14 I note that Mr Sutherland SC submits that, if the trial is not a nullity and the Court has power to proceed further under s.22, it would be appropriate to discharge the absent juror and to proceed with the trial with a jury comprised of the remaining eleven jurors.  
     
      
    15 The critical issue for determination, therefore, is whether the events which have occurred render the trial a nullity so that it is not open to the Court to resort to the provisions of s.22 Jury Act 1977. 
     
      
       
      Relevant Provisions of Jury Act 1977 
       
      
    16 It is appropriate to set out several provisions in the Jury Act 1977 which are pertinent to the present application.  
     
      
    17 Section 6 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
         Persons not qualified or liable to serve as jurors 
        
       
       
        
        A person is not qualified or liable to serve as a juror if that person is, for the time being: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) disqualified from serving as a juror, being a person referred to in Schedule 1, or  
        
       
       
        
        (b) ineligible to serve as a juror, being a person referred to in Schedule 2” 
        
       
      
    18 Schedule 1 to the Act, referred to in s.6(a), provides as follows (emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
        “Schedule 1 Persons disqualified from serving as jurors 
        
       
       
        
        1  
        A person who at any time within the last 10 years in New South Wales or elsewhere has served any part of a sentence of imprisonment (not being imprisonment merely for failure to pay a fine). 
        
       
       
        
        2  
        A person who at any time within the last 3 years in New South Wales or elsewhere has been found guilty of an offence and detained in a detention centre or other institution for juvenile offenders (not being detention merely for failure to pay a fine). 
        
       
       
        
        3 
          
        A person who is currently bound by an order made in New South Wales or elsewhere pursuant to a criminal charge or conviction 
        , not including an order for compensation, but  
        including 
          
        the following 
        : 
        
       
       
        
         (a) a parole order, a community service order, an apprehended violence order and  
        an order disqualifying the person from driving a motor vehicle 
        , 
        
       
       
        
        (b) an order committing the person to prison for failure to pay a fine, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) a recognizance to be of good behaviour or to keep the peace, a remand in custody pending trial or sentence and a release on bail pending trial or sentence.” 
        
       
      
    19 Section 19 provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Number of jurors in criminal proceedings 
        
       
       
        
        The jury in any criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or the District Court is to consist of 12 persons returned and selected in accordance with this Act.” 
        
       
      
    20 Section 22 provides for continuation of a trial where a juror is discharged (emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Continuation of trial or inquest on death or discharge of juror 
        
       
       
        
        Where in the course of any trial 
         or coronial inquest  
        any member of the jury 
         dies or  
        is discharged by the court 
         or coroner  
        whether as being through illness incapable of continuing to act or for any other reason, the jury shall be considered as remaining for all the purposes of that trial 
         or inquest  
        properly constituted if 
        : 
        
       
       
        
        (a)  
        in the case of criminal proceedings, the number of its members 
        : 
        
       
       
        
          
        (i)  
        is not reduced below 10 
        , 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) is reduced below 10 but approval in writing is given to the reduced number of jurors by or on behalf of both the person prosecuting for the Crown and the accused or each of the accused, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) is reduced below 10 but not below 8 and the trial has been in progress for at least 2 months, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) in the case of civil proceedings, the number of its members is not reduced, in the case of a jury of 4, below 3 or, in the case of a jury of 12, below 8, or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) in the case of a coronial inquest, the number of its members is not reduced below 4,  
         
        and if the court 
         or the coroner, as the case may be,  
        so orders 
        .” 
        
       
      
    21 Section 73 is in the following terms (emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Verdict not invalidated in certain cases 
        
       
       
        
        The verdict of a jury shall not be affected or invalidated by reason only 
        : 
        
       
       
        
        (a)  
        that any member of the jury was disqualified from serving as a juror  
        or ineligible to serve as a juror, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) of any omission, error or irregularity with respect to any supplementary jury roll, jury roll, card or summons prepared or issued for the purposes of this Act, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) that any juror was misnamed or misdescribed (where there is no question as to the juror’s identity).” 
        
       
       
      Submissions for the Accused 
       
      
    22 Mr Sutherland SC submits that s.19 requires a jury in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court to “consist of twelve persons returned and selected in accordance” with the Act. He submits that the absent juror was and is “currently bound by an order made in New South Wales… pursuant to a… conviction… disqualifying the person from driving a motor vehicle”, and thus fell within cl 3(a) of Sch 1 to the Act. Accordingly, because he was, as at 26 March 2007 and is, for the time being, disqualified from serving as a juror (s.6(a)), the absent juror was and remains not qualified or liable to serve as a juror.  
     
      
    23 Mr Sutherland SC submits, that a trial of the Accused before a jury of twelve persons did not commence in this case, and that s.22 cannot apply. He submits that s.22 has application where a relevant event occurs in the course of a trial and “any member of the jury” is discharged by the Court. Mr Sutherland SC submits that the absent juror was disqualified from serving as a juror and thus never became a “member of the jury”.  
     
      
    24 Mr Sutherland SC refers to a number of decisions of the High Court of Australia with respect to jury trials for offences against the law of the Commonwealth. The Accused is on trial for offences against the law of the Commonwealth in this case.  
     
      
    25 Mr Sutherland SC submits that there are consistent statements in the cases of the importance of a trial at least commencing with twelve jurors: Wu v The Queen [1999] 199 CLR 99 at 106 [21]; Brownlee v The Queen [2001] 207 CLR 278 at 302 - 303 [68]. He submits that the requirement for a jury of twelve at the commencement of a trial is mandatory under s.19, and that a failure to comply with that provision renders the trial a nullity: Maher v The Queen [1987] 163 CLR 221 at 233. 
     
      
    26 Particular reliance is placed upon the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Brown & Tran (2004) 148 A Crim R 268. Although the jury defect which occurred in that case is different to the present case, Mr Sutherland SC submits that the consequences are the same. He points to the conclusion of Sperling J (Mason P and Sully J agreeing) at 278 [54] - [55], that there had been, in that case, a failure of compliance with mandatory provisions of the Jury Act 1977 and that “the trial is accordingly a nullity unless s.73 and, in particular, s.73(b), applies”. The Court held that s.73 did not apply in R v Brown & Tran so that the trial was a nullity (at 279 [62]). 
     
      
    27 Mr Sutherland SC acknowledges that R v Brown & Tran concerned s.73(b) of the Act and that the Court held that the facts of the case were not accommodated by that provision. He acknowledges that s.73(a) relates directly to a verdict of a jury where a member of the jury was disqualified from serving as a juror. Accordingly, the precise defect in this case is addressed specifically in the Act with respect to the saving of a verdict at trial.  
     
      
    28 He submits, however, that s.73 relates only to the saving of verdicts, and cannot apply directly or indirectly to assist the process of construction of other provisions in the Act. In particular, he submits that s.73(a) cannot be called in aid in any way to assist the construction of the Act and the possible application of s.22 to circumstances where it is discovered, before verdict, that a disqualified person is a member of the jury. 
     
      
    29 Section 73(a) was part of the Jury Act 1977 as originally enacted. Mr Sutherland SC referred to parts of the second reading debates in the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council concerning the Jury Bill 1977 which, he contends, shed light upon the matters presently falling for determination. In the second reading speech in the Legislative Assembly, the Attorney General, Mr FJ Walker, referred to matters included in Sch 1 to the Bill (Hansard, 24 February 1977, p 4474 at 4477):  
     
      
       
        
        “Though Victoria has gone part of the way, legislation in that State falls short in that it does not preclude the chronic serious traffic offender from taking his place on a jury, and this Bill will improve on that State’s legislation in this regard. After examining comparative legislation in other States and overseas and discussing the matter extensively with the New South Wales Privacy Committee, the Government has arrived at the criteria for disqualification because of criminal conviction as set out in Sch 1.” 
        
       
      
    30 Soon after, the Attorney General said at page 4478: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have already mentioned a number of matters about disqualified persons, particularly the difficult task of drawing up a Schedule of this kind to fit all situations. Schedule 1 aims at ensuring that persons who sit in judgment upon their fellows, or decide issues between parties, ought to be able to point to their own good character and general fitness for the task. It recognises that people who have come into conflict with the law, particularly those who have served gaol sentences, could bear some ill will towards the Crown and so increase the probability of disagreement in criminal proceedings. As I stated earlier, this Bill improves upon the Victorian legislation in that it will ensure that one of society’s most anti-social types, the chronic, serious traffic offender, would be precluded from jury service.” 
        
       
      
    31 The Attorney General made no reference to cl 73 of the Bill in the second reading speech in the Legislative Assembly. Nor did the Hon DP Landa, Minister for Planning and Environment, make reference to cl 73 in the second reading speech in the Legislative Council (Hansard, 2 March 1977, p 4645). However, Mr Sutherland SC points to later references in the second reading debate in the Legislative Council where the Hon LA Solomons, for the Opposition, said at p 4748: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am glad that the people who designed the Bill have recognised the importance of cl 73 which provides that a jury’s verdict cannot be invalidated by a mere technicality. On this point I again refer honourable members to my remarks about majority verdicts. It is most frustrating for the technical point to be taken that a jury has been incorrectly struck, thus aborting a trial and resulting in heavy costs and inconvenience.” 
        
       
      
    32 In his speech in reply, the Hon DP Landa (at p 4753) acknowledged that the exercise of a challenge for cause depended upon knowledge of the facts giving rise to the challenge, and then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Without such knowledge one would not be able to establish cause. Otherwise the matter would be left for discovery until after the trial. In my view, that would involve the risk of destroying a trial that was impeccably conducted and give rise among those who were convicted properly to a clutching at straws, with a possible tarnishing of the regard in which the jury system is held. It would be regrettable if that cautious approach were changed today, only to have a person claiming later that he had not received a fair trial because a woman who served on the jury was the wife of a policeman whose attitude to drugs, alcoholism or whatever field of human behaviour was involved, was well known. It is worthwhile to pay a penalty for covering as wide an area as possible in that cautious approach.” 
        
       
       
      Although reference was not made to cl 73 in this passage, Mr Sutherland SC submits that it is clear that the Minister had in mind that provision in making these observations. 
       
      
    33 Accordingly, Mr Sutherland SC submits that s.73(a) cannot be called in aid in any way on an application such as this. He submits that the trial is a nullity and that situation may only be changed, by operation of the statute, if a verdict is returned. As that point has not been reached in the trial, he submits that the Court should decide that the trial is a nullity and discharge the jury.  
     
      
       
      Submissions of the Crown 
       
      
    34 The Crown submits that the circumstances of the present case disclose a procedural irregularity in the conduct of the trial but not such as to constitute a nullity. It is submitted that care ought be taken in the use of the term “nullity” and, in this respect, reference is made to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Swansson v R [2007] NSWCCA 67.  
     
      
    35 With respect to R v Brown & Tran, the Crown emphasises that the Court held that the factual circumstances were not caught by s.73(b) of the Act. Sperling J observed, at 279 [57], that the statutory exemption in s.73(b) was confined to omissions, errors and irregularities concerning the contents of documents of a specified kind but did “not cover mistakes in relation to mandatory processes required by the legislation”. His Honour referred, at 279 [58], to s.18 Juries Act 1974 (UK) and continued at [59]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        If the legislature of New South Wales had intended so wide an exemption, covering mandatory processes as well as documentation, that could readily have been enacted with clarity. The United Kingdom model existed in 1977. Instead, the legislature of this state chose to use imprecise language, leaving it to context to define the ambit of the provision. Without clear words to the contrary, such as have been used in the United Kingdom legislation, I would assume that it was not intended by the legislature here to exempt non-compliance with fundamental, mandatory provisions of the legislation of the kind involved in the present case, where the composition of the jury has been affected by error.” 
        
       
      
    36 The Crown submits that s.73(a) does relate expressly to the process in s.19 whereby the trial should commence with twelve jurors empanelled in accordance with the Act. It is submitted that insertion of these clear words in s.73(a) discloses a statutory intention to, in the words of Sperling J at 279 [59], “exempt non-compliance with fundamental, mandatory provisions of the legislation of the kind involved in the present case, where the composition of the jury has been affected by error.” 
     
      
    37 According to the Crown submission, not only does s.73(a) operate to maintain a verdict given by a jury which has included a disqualified person or persons, but the existence of s.73(a) in the Act discloses a statutory purpose which is relevant to the present case where discovery is made of the presence of a disqualified juror before verdict. Applying the well known principles in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 388 [91] and 390 [93], the Crown submits that the use of the mandatory-directory dichotomy ought be placed to one side, with a better test for determining the issue of validity being to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid.  
     
      
    38 Given the presence of s.73(a) in the Act, the Crown submits that a statutory intention is disclosed whereby the commencement of a criminal trial with a jury comprising twelve persons, one or more of whom are disqualified persons under s.6(a) of the Act, does not render the trial a nullity. A verdict returned by such a jury is valid.  
     
      
    39 In the event that this state of affairs is discovered before verdict, the Crown submits that s.22 of the Act is available, as part of the statutory scheme, to remove the disqualified person and permit the trial to continue with a jury constituted in accordance with the Act. The Crown submits that, to approach the matter in accordance with the Accused’s submissions would create an artificial distinction between events in the trial before and after verdict. The Crown submits that, if the Accused’s construction is correct, all steps taken during the course of the trial, including the swearing of witnesses, the issue of certificates under s.128 Evidence Act 1995 and other steps which form part of the trial process would be nullities. On this approach, for example, a prosecution for perjury could not be brought against a witness who had given false evidence at the trial. The Crown submits that such a result injects an element of uncertainty, if not absurdity, into the process which is not consistent with a sensible construction of ss.6, 19, 22 and 73 of the Act.  
     
      
    40 With respect to the concept of “nullity”, the Crown referred to Swansson v R where Spigelman CJ said at [60] - [61]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As noted above, the judgments in  
        Crane 
         and  
        Munday v Gill 
        , reflecting a number of authorities, assert that a criminal trial that has been conducted in contravention of the rule of criminal procedure here under consideration is a “nullity”. Notwithstanding the force of these remarks, in my opinion, this Court should not proceed on the basis that the cases are authority for the proposition that a trial conducted in breach of this rule is to be treated as if there had not been a trial at all. Rather, the position is that there has not been a trial in accordance with law.  
        
       
       
        
        The use of terminology such as “nullity” and, in the administrative law context, the cognate distinction between “void” and “voidable” decisions, where appearing in judgments, must be approached with some caution. (See generally FC Hutley “The Cult of Nullification in English Law” (1978) 52 ALJ 8.)” 
        
       
      
    41 Later, Spigelman CJ said at [78]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In view of their express reliance on  
        Crane 
        , in my opinion, their Honours were not using the terminology of “nullity” in the sense that there has not been a trial at all but, as I have noted at [60] above, that there has not been a trial in accordance with law.” 
        
       
      
    42 The Crown refers to other passages in Swansson v R where the term “nullity” is to be understood as the consequence where a court in which the proceeding takes place is, for some reason, devoid of jurisdiction. See the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL at [86] - [94] and Simpson J at [163] - [164], [172] - [173]. The Crown submits that the issue in Swansson v R involved an absence of jurisdiction resulting from a departure from the “one indictment, one jury” rule. In the present case, the Crown submits that the Court has jurisdiction, and that the defect concerning the absent juror does not go to jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Crown submits that the term “nullity” is not apt to this case, nor was it apt (in the Swansson v R sense) to the facts of R v Brown & Tran.  
     
      
    43 The Crown submits that the power under s.22 is available to the Court to remedy the present defect by discharging the absent juror and to permit the trial to continue according to law.  
     
      
       
      Resolution of Competing Submissions 
       
      
    44 The issues arising on this application are important to the trial and to the parties. There is no direct authority dealing with the issue to be determined in this case. Important questions are raised concerning the proper construction and operation of the Jury Act 1977. It is necessary that I determine this application as a matter of urgency, and without the opportunity for detailed reflection which might otherwise be open. 
     
      
    45 The constitutional importance of trial by jury for a Commonwealth offence is reflected in decisions that judge alone trial is not available (Brown v The Queen [1985-1986] 160 CLR 171) nor is a majority verdict open (Cheatle v The Queen [1993] 177 CLR 541). The High Court has accepted that s.22 Jury Act 1977 may apply to reduce a jury below twelve persons in a trial for a Commonwealth offence: Brownlee v The Queen; Ng v The Queen [2003] 217 CLR 521. 
     
      
    46 I take, as a starting point, the repeated statements by the High Court of Australia of the importance of trial by jury generally, and for Commonwealth indictable offences in particular given the terms of s.80 of the Commonwealth Constitution. Deane J observed in Brown v The Queen, at 201, that the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury existed for the benefit of the community as a whole as well as for the benefit of the particular accused.  
     
      
    47 It is clear, however, that a verdict may be returned in a Commonwealth trial by a jury comprising less than twelve members, where a juror or jurors have been discharged under s.22 Jury Act 1977. In Brownlee v The Queen, Gleeson CJ and McHugh J, after referring to Williams v Florida (1970) 399 US 78 at 100, said at 289 [22] - [23]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Those observations apply with even greater force to a system which requires twelve jurors to begin with, but permits the trial to continue with ten of the original twelve where two have been discharged, and requires a unanimous verdict of the remaining ten. Such a system is not inconsistent with the purposes of trial by jury. In particular, it is not inconsistent with the objectives of independence, representativeness and randomness of selection, or with the need to maintain the prosecution's obligation to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.  
         
         
        Neither history, nor principle, nor authority warrants a conclusion that the meaning of ""trial ... by jury"" in s 80 of the Constitution is inconsistent with the provisions of s 22(a)(i) of the Jury Act.”  
        
       
      
    48 In Brownlee v The Queen, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at 302 - 303 [68] - [69]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        There remains the applicant's complaint respecting s 22 of the Jury Act. The origin of the requirement, currently expressed in s 19 of the Jury Act, that the jury in proceedings for the prosecution of offenders on indictment consist of twelve persons rather than some greater or lesser number is lost in the mists of Anglo-Saxon and then Anglo-Norman life and experience. In modern times, the requirement that a jury of twelve be empanelled for a trial on indictment (which may be assumed, for present purposes, to be a central characteristic of trial by jury and mandated by s 80 of the Constitution) is to be supported on utilitarian grounds. It ensures that the trial gets underway with fact-finding entrusted to a group of laymen which is large enough to promote measured deliberation and indicates to the community sufficient participation by its members to vindicate the outcome.  
        
       
       
        
        Further questions arise where, in the course of the trial, for what appears to the presiding judge to be good reason and in accordance with legislative provision, one or more jurors should be discharged. It may be accepted, as was urged by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, that trials in the nineteenth century tended to be much shorter than is so today. This reflects not only the increased complexity of the substantive issues to be tried but the expansion of procedural rights favouring the accused. If, in the circumstances under consideration, a fresh jury must be empanelled, this has consequences not only for the public purse, but also for the individuals involved.”  
         
        
       
      
    49 Their Honours said at 303 - 304 [71] - [72]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Current legislation which authorises the discharge of jurors for good cause so that the trial continues with no fewer than ten jurors is not incompatible with s.80 of the Constitution. 
        
       
       
        
        It may well be said that questions of degree are involved. However, if twelve be taken as the requisite minimum with which the trial must commence, there is much force in the contention that no reduction below ten is permissible. Paragraph (a)(i) of s.22 of the Jury Act, which is in issue here, meets that criterion.” 
        
       
      
    50 In Ng v The Queen, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ said at 526 [9], [11]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Brownlee  
        establishes that, whilst the requirement in s 80 of a trial ""by jury"" is referable to that institution as understood at common law at the time of federation, it is the essential features of that institution which have what might be called a constitutionally entrenched status. Further,  
        Brownlee 
         also indicates that those essential features are to be discerned with regard to the purpose which s 80 was intended to serve and to the constant evolution, before and since federation, of the characteristics and incidents of jury trial. Accordingly, the circumstance that provisions such as those in ss.14A and 48A of the Juries Act respecting additional jurors were not found in pre-federation legislation is not determinative. 
        
       
       
        
        Brownlee 
         determined that a trial on indictment for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth which was conducted in accordance with a provision of New South Wales law which permitted the reduction in number of jurors to not below ten was not at odds with the meaning of trial ""by jury"" in s 80 of the Constitution. The applicant does not argue for the proscription of a trial by a jury where more than twelve jurors are empanelled. The complaint concerns the operation of the provisions respecting reduction in numbers to twelve before the jury retired to consider its verdict. However, by parity of reasoning, the conclusions which led to the outcome in  
        Brownlee 
         militate in favour of the dismissal of the present application.” 
        
       
      
    51 The requirement of unanimity is a requirement that all the persons constituting the jury at the time the verdict is pronounced return a unanimous verdict: Cheatle v The Queen at 548; Ng v The Queen at 526 [12]. The continued participation in the process of any juror after empanelment is at all times conditional upon the juror remaining qualified and of capacity and on operation of any relevant laws: Ng v The Queen at 527 [13]. 
     
      
    52 The cases demonstrate that a trial by jury for a Commonwealth offence attracts the incidents of State legislation concerning juries. In the present case, that legislation includes s.73(a).  
     
      
    53 Other decisions of the High Court of Australia have emphasised the importance of provisions concerning the jury in a criminal trial. In this context, the term “nullity” has been used. It is important, for present purposes, to examine the precise way in which that term has been used. In Maher v The Queen,  Mason CJ, Wilson, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said at 233: 
     
      
       
        
        “The provisions of the Jury Act and of the Code which govern the constitution and authority of the jury as the tribunal of fact in a criminal trial are mandatory, for the entitlement to trial by jury which s.604 of the Code confirms is trial by a jury constituted in accordance with the Jury Act and authorised by law to try the issue raised by the plea of not guilty. A failure to comply with those provisions may render a trial a nullity, at least in the sense that the conviction produced cannot withstand an appeal: see  
        Crane v Public Prosecutor 
         [1921] 2 AC 299. In any event it involves such a miscarriage of justice as to require the conviction to be set aside.” 
        
       
      
    54 In Maher v The Queen, a jury found the applicant guilty of an offence charged in a particular count though it had not been sworn to try the issues on that count. The Court concluded, at 234, that a conviction founded on that verdict could not stand and that there was “a failure to observe the requirements of the criminal process in a fundamental respect”.  
     
      
    55 In Katsuno v The Queen [1999] 199 CLR 40, the Court held that the provision of information about potential jurors by the Chief Commissioner of Police to the Crown was unlawful, but that the trial was not rendered a nullity as a result (Gleeson CJ at 51 [7], Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ at 58 [30] ff, in particular, at 60 - 62 [34] - [45]).  
     
      
    56 The various statutory provisions considered in the High Court cases do not appear to contain a provision such as s.73 Jury Act 1977. The circumstances under consideration in the cases involve provisions which were characterised as mandatory in nature where, to use the language of Maher v The Queen, a failure to comply with the provisions may render a trial a nullity, at least in the sense that the conviction produced cannot withstand an appeal.  
     
      
    57 It is apparent immediately that any conviction which arose in the present case from a verdict of a jury including a disqualified person would withstand an appeal by operation of s.73(a) of the Act. Accordingly, the Jury Act 1977 itself contains a statutory indicator that such a verdict, and the trial at which the verdict arose, are not nullities. This is an important point of distinction between this case and other cases so far considered. 
     
      
    58 This brings me to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Brown & Tran. The Crown submits that that decision may be distinguished on the facts and that a different conclusion may be reached in the present case, as a matter of construction, because of the presence of s.73(a). The Crown submits further that the term “nullity” as used by Sperling J should be understood in light of statements in Swansson v R. 
     
      
    59 In R v Brown & Tran, Mason P agreed with Sperling J but made the following additional comments at 269 [2] - [3]: 
     
      
       
        
         “ 
        I would add this. Everything points in the present case to an entirely innocent intervention by ""Ms Smith"". Nothing suggests that she deliberately impersonated the juror who meant to attend the Downing Centre on 26 February 2003 and unexpectedly did not; or that Ms Smith went out of her way to get onto the panel from which the appellants' jury was drawn. But other cases might be closer to the line or over it. 
         
         
        One function of the system of random jury selection in accordance with the procedures of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) is to prevent any miscarriage of the type I have hypothesised and rejected. Yet investigation of the facts involved in such matters would be difficult. Interrogation of jurors is problematic, as Berman DCJ recognised in the present case. These factors reinforce my conclusion, in agreement with Sperling J, that the purpose of the relevant sections of the Jury Act, gleaned from the language of the sections and the scope and object of the statute as a whole, is that the empanelling of the jury in a case such as the present would be invalid and ineffective (cf  
        Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority 
         (1998) 194 CLR 355).” 
        
       
      
    60 In my opinion, the application of the Project Blue Sky test to the present case leads to a different conclusion to that reached in R v Brown & Tran. There, s.73 could not be called in aid at all for the purpose of construing provisions of the Jury Act 1977 which had not been complied with. The facts in R v Brown & Tran fell completely outside s.73, and the failure of the legislature to make express reference in that provision for the relevant factual circumstances fortified the conclusion in that case.  
     
      
    61 In this case, the proper construction of ss.6, 19, 22 and 73 of the Act is assisted directly by the express provisions of s.73(a) which protect a verdict returned by a jury which comprises a disqualified juror. The existence of that express provision, in my view, sheds light upon the so called mandatory nature of that provision or, using the Project Blue Sky test, whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid. In my view, the existence of s.73(a) leads to a negative answer to this question.  
     
      
    62 The defect in this case does not go to the jurisdiction of the Court and is not a nullity in the sense recognised in R v Halmi (2005) 62 NSWLR 263, R v Janceski (2005) 64 NSWLR 10 and Swansson v R. Nor does the failure to comply with ss.6 and 19 render the trial a nullity in the sense that any conviction produced could not withstand an appeal: Maher v The Queen at 233. To the contrary, any conviction by a jury which includes a disqualified person will always withstand appeal by operation of s.73(a) of the Act.  
     
      
    63 In my view, it is appropriate to approach this question upon the basis of a statutory expectation of twelve jurors being empanelled in accordance with the Act, but that any verdict of a jury which includes a disqualified juror being nevertheless good. The position after verdict is protected directly by operation of s.73(a) of The Act.  
     
      
    64 Where it comes to attention before verdict that a disqualified person is on the jury, the legislative scheme permits the defect to be overcome by use of s.22 of the Act to discharge that person and, if the Court sees fit, continue with the trial with the jury constituted by the eleven remaining jurors. This is part of the statutory scheme which enables the Court to overcome the defect arising from the presence of the disqualified person and to allow the trial to proceed to verdict according to law. 
     
      
    65 The submissions for the Accused contend, in effect, that a disqualified person may never be a “member of the jury” so that s.22 can have no application. In this respect, I note that s.73(a) uses the term “any member of the jury was disqualified from serving as a juror”. The words of the statute extend the phrase “member of the jury” to a disqualified person. As a matter of construction, a particular word or phrase in a statute ought be construed consistently in the same or different sections unless the context dictates otherwise: Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 6th ed, 2006, para [4.6] - [4.7]. Where a disqualified person is characterised, in one part of the Jury Act 1977, as a “member of the jury”, then it seems to me that he falls within the terms of the same phrase appearing in s.22 of the Act. 
     
      
    66 In the circumstances of this case and having regard to s.73(a), the submissions for the Accused point to a type of conditional or provisional nullity during the course of the trial which, in the event that a verdict is returned, will disappear by operation of statute. I do not consider that this concept sits comfortably with an understanding of the legal term “nullity”, nor with a sensible and consistent construction and operation of the Jury Act 1977. 
     
      
    67 The scheme of the Jury Act 1977 itself provides a solution in s.22 to the defect which has arisen in this case.  
     
      
    68 Mr Sutherland SC is correct in his submission that s.73(a) relates expressly to post-verdict events. I do not consider, however, that the statements during the second reading debates assist the Accused on the present application. In particular, I do not consider that the reference by the Hon DP Landa in reply in the Legislative Council (p 4753) (see par 32 above) assists on the present question. The real issue here is what light s.73(a) sheds upon the process of statutory construction required, for the purpose of the Project Blue Sky test, in determining the consequence of presence on a jury of a disqualified person. In my view, the consequences of such a state of affairs are as I have set out above. 
     
      
    69 Construing the provisions of the Jury Act 1977 as a whole, I am satisfied that the trial is not a nullity and that s.22 may be applied to discharge the “member of the jury” who is a disqualified person. I accept the Crown’s submissions concerning R v Brown & Tran which, in my view, is distinguishable from the present case, because of the express provision contained in s.73(a) of the Act. Put shortly, the presence of s.73(a) suggests that the greater includes the lesser in this case. If the verdict of a jury including a disqualified person is valid, then it is open to the Court to use available procedures within the Act, before verdict, to remove the disqualified person to enable the remaining jurors to return a verdict in accordance with the law. 
     
      
    70 I reject the submission of the Accused that the circumstances of the present case render the trial a nullity. The powers of the Court in s.22 of the Act are available in this case.  
     
      
       
      Should the Absent Juror be Discharged? 
       
      
    71 I have concluded that the absent juror is a “member of the jury” for the purposes of s.22 and, accordingly, may be discharged by the Court “for any other reason”. The material before the Court demonstrates that the absent juror is disqualified from serving as a juror under s.6(a) of the Act. That alone is good reason for discharging him at this time. Added to that is the fact that he has been remanded in custody, bail refused, until 21 May 2007 and is, for obvious reasons, unable to attend the Court.  
     
      
    72 The decision to discharge a juror and the decision to proceed with fewer than twelve jurors are distinct steps and often will be affected by different considerations: Wu v The Queen at 103 [6].  
     
      
    73 In the event that I concluded that the power to discharge the absent juror under s.22 is available in this case, both the Crown and the Accused submit that discharge of that person is appropriate.  
     
      
    74 I am satisfied that the absent juror should be discharged.  
     
      
       
      Should the Trial Proceed With Fewer Than Twelve Jurors? 
       
      
    75 The second and distinct step now arises, namely, whether the trial of the Accused should proceed with the remaining eleven jurors constituting the jury for the purpose of the trial under s.22 of the Act. The Crown submits that such a course is appropriate. In the event that I reached this point, Mr Sutherland SC does not advance a submission to the contrary.  
     
      
    76 I have regard to the fact that the Crown case is well advanced. I accept the Crown submission that a number of Crown witnesses, including Messrs Morgan, Chow and Aivaliotes, have given evidence three times - at committal proceedings, the first trial and the present trial. I have regard to the fact that, as is obvious, a trial before a jury of eleven is not a trial before a jury of twelve. Trial before a jury of twelve persons is the statutory ideal, but the ideal may be departed from by operation of s.22 of the Act. The whole purpose of s.22 is to provide that a trial can proceed before a jury despite the discharge of one or more of its members. There can be a fair and lawful trial of an accused despite the discharge of a juror in the course of the proceedings: Wu v The Queen at 106 - 107 [21]. 
     
      
    77 I am satisfied that the appropriate course in this case is to direct that the trial of the Accused proceed with the jury constituted by the remaining eleven jury members.  
     
      
       
      Non-Publication Order 
       
      
    78 On 8 May 2007, I made an order prohibiting publication of the fact that the absent juror had failed to attend Court, the reasons for that failure and the fact that application was being made arising from the circumstances of that failure (T1371).  
     
      
    79 In making that order, I had in mind the provisions of s.68(1) Jury Act 1977 which prohibit a person, except in accordance with the Act, wilfully publishing any material or broadcasting any matter, or otherwise disclosing any information, which is likely to lead to the identification of a juror or former juror in a particular trial. Section 68 reflects the purpose or object of protecting juror anonymity: R v Ronen [2004] NSWCCA 176 at [97].  
     
      
    80 The absent juror has not been present at Court since 4 May 2007, and is not in a position to express a view concerning possible disclosure of his identity as a juror, or former juror, in this trial. I was informed that some publicity had appeared in a metropolitan newspaper which might relate to the arrest of the absent juror. Reference was made to the alleged offences of the person but no reference was made in the article to him being a juror (if, indeed, he is the same person). In these circumstances, it appeared to me to be important to make orders to guard against the possible identification of the absent juror in any report of his criminal proceedings where his association with this trial might be revealed. Further, it appeared to me that the possibility of some publication in a newspaper concerning the absent juror’s arrest and charge which linked him as a juror in this trial, may serve to distract the eleven remaining jurors from the exercise of their duties and functions in the trial. Accordingly, in the exercise of implied or inherent power to protect the administration of justice, I made an interim non-publication order as set out above. The Crown supported the making of such an order and Mr Sutherland SC did not submit to the contrary. 
     
      
    81 Having regard to the view that I have formed on the present application, I propose to extend that non-publication order until further order of the Court. I will give further consideration to this question at the end of the present trial. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    82 The issues falling for determination on this application are not straight forward. Having considered the submissions of the parties, I have determined that the presence of the absent juror on the jury, although a disqualified person, does not render the trial a nullity. It is open to the Court to discharge the absent juror under s.22 and to direct that the trial proceed with the jury constituted by the eleven remaining jurors. I announced these conclusions in the Court at 2pm yesterday. This judgment contains my reasons for reaching those conclusions.  
     
      
    83 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The juror whom I have described as the absent juror is discharged, under s.22(a)  
        Jury Act 1977 
        ; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) I order, under s.22(a)  
        Jury Act 1977 
        , 
          
        that the remaining eleven jurors be considered as remaining, for all purposes of the trial, to be properly constituted as the jury;  
        
       
       
        
        (c) Until further order of the Court, I make an order prohibiting publication of the matters revealed in the course of these proceedings on 8, 9 and 10 May 2007 concerning the absent juror, the reasons for his absence from this trial and the reasons for my order discharging him under s.22(a)  
        Jury Act 1977 
        .

      1215 OF 2006 REGINA V GARETH JOHN BUNCE  
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Gareth John Bunce pleads guilty to the murder of Margaret Elizabeth Wagner on 18 March 1997. 
     
      
    2 At the time of her death the deceased lived with her husband, Shane Andrew Metcalfe, and their two children, Jason then aged 7 and Samantha aged 2, at 88 Richard Street, Warrimoo. It was in Jason’s bedroom in the home that the deceased died as a result of the prisoner placing both his hands on her neck and strangling her. She was 27 years old when she was murdered. 
     
      
    3 During the prisoner’s evidence on sentence it became apparent that the extent of the prisoner’s pre meditation to kill the deceased was in dispute. The Crown contends that the prisoner travelled to Warrimoo on the day of the murder with the intention of killing the deceased whereas the prisoner gave evidence that the intention was formed when guns were placed in his hands whilst he was in the deceased’s home. 
     
      
    4 The onus is on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the intent to kill had been formed by the prisoner prior to his attendance at the home on 18 March 1997. 
     
      
    5 The authorship of an undated letter addressed to the deceased in 1993 and whether the prisoner had sexual intercourse with the deceased on the day of her death are further matters of fact which are in dispute and are for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt as findings adverse to the prisoner may increase the objective seriousness of the offence: see The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. 
     
      
    6 Before considering these issues, I propose to detail those facts which are not controversial. They are taken largely from the Statement of Facts tendered by the Crown.  
     
      
       
      The facts not in dispute 
       
      
    7 The deceased was the daughter of William Wagner and step sister of Kelly Van Der Schoot. She left home in 1985 when she was 15 years of age and commenced to work for a man known as Arthur Mafoi. She became a user of cocaine, heroin and practised prostitution. After marrying Mr Metcalfe in 1990, she appeared to get her life back together. Jason was born in 1990 and Samantha in 1995. 
     
      
    8 The prisoner married Kelly Van Der Schoot in 1985 and lived with her in Leopold Street Merrylands. The deceased lived with them for a short time. Whilst living with them the deceased participated in a pornographic film with the prisoner which portrayed them having sexual intercourse at the Merrylands address. The deceased was then aged 15. The film was discovered by Helen Wagner, mother of the deceased, who viewed it. Some years later Kelly, the prisoner’s wife, discovered the video and spoke to the prisoner about it threatening to leave him. She decided to continue living with him at that time. Mrs Wagner destroyed the film in 1990. 
     
      
    9 In 1988 the prisoner was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 9 months for an offence of larceny as a servant. He had been employed by the railways. In April 1991 the prisoner gave evidence during a sentencing hearing in the District Court for a charge of assault and robbery with an offensive weapon committed on 1 May 1989 that he had been blackmailed into carrying out the armed robbery of the railway station by his wife Kelly who was assisted by her two sisters one of whom was the deceased. He told the Court that the deceased “……said that she would use a videotape that she and I made together and say that I had forced her to make it”. He was sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment of two years with an additional term of eight months.  
     
      
    10 In 1997 the deceased received an anonymous letter indicating that she was eligible to claim a portion of $876,954.89. On 23 April 1993, she approached Simon Patterson, an accountant, and discussed the letter with him. Mr Patterson was of the opinion the letter was a hoax.  
     
      
    11 A few days prior to the murder the deceased met the prisoner at the Mt Druitt Pizza Hut where a birthday party was being held for one of the prisoner’s children. They discussed the 1993 letter, agreed to make another video and to meet at Warrimoo railway station on 18 March 1997. 
     
      
    12 The deceased collected the prisoner from Warrimoo railway station at around midday on 18 March 1997 and drove him to her home. The prisoner had brought with him a video camera and some nylon rope but did not bring a video tape for the camera. 
     
      
    13 Having arrived at the home, they decided to make a pornographic video. The deceased went into the bathroom, disrobed and then laid on the bed in Jason’s room. Her ankles and wrists were then tightly secured by the prisoner to the legs of the bed by the nylon rope he had brought with him. Heavy duty electrical tape was placed over her mouth. 
     
      
    14 The prisoner then sat on her abdomen and applied pressure with both hands to her neck high up under the chin until she was dead. It took about two to three minutes for the deceased to die.  
     
      
    15 When he strangled the deceased, the deceased used a technique that would not leave any bruising or indication that she had been strangled. The prisoner had learned of this technique from other prisoners when he was in gaol on an earlier occasion and from his own reading. 
     
      
    16 After ascertaining the deceased was dead, he untied the body leaving it uncovered on the bed. He left the home taking the rope and tape with which he had secured and gagged the deceased. A Daily Telegraph newspaper dated 18 March 1997 was left by him in the lounge room which had two of his finger prints on the front page.  
     
      
    17 The deceased’s son, Jason, arrived home from school at about 3.20pm and was unable to wake his mother who he found lying uncovered on the bed in his room. An ambulance was not called until later that afternoon. The time of death was fixed between 2pm and 3pm. 
     
      
    18 The prisoner was charged with the deceased’s murder on 29 December 1999 and was remanded in custody. He was released on 28 September 2000 when the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions directed that the charge proceed no further at that stage. 
     
      
    19 After emailing the television program, A Current Affair, the prisoner met with Andrew Byrne, the supervising journalist for that program, on 12 September 2005. He confessed to killing the deceased which he elaborated upon at a meeting on 20 September 2005. The prisoner travelled with Mr Byrne to Brisbane where Mr Byrne and another A Current Affair journalist, Amanda Paterson, spoke to him. A conversation with the journalists in Brisbane on 21 September 2005 was covertly recorded. Interviews in Brisbane on the same day and on the next day in Sydney were recorded on sound and by video with the prisoner’s knowledge and consent. Excerpts of what was said during these conversations and interviews are detailed at pages 9 to 14 of the Statement of Facts.  
     
      
    20 The prisoner does not dispute what is recorded as being said to the television reporters but denied in evidence that he told the truth to them about when he formed the intention to kill the deceased (T18). 
     
      
       
      When did the prisoner form the intention to kill? 
       
      
    21 The Crown relies on statements made to the journalists to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner had formed the intention to kill the deceased prior to going to her home on 18 March 1997. Other circumstances relied upon include confessional statements made to friends and the fact that a video tape was not one of the items taken by the prisoner to the deceased’s home.  
     
      
    22 As proof is required beyond reasonable doubt, a finding is not to be made that the intention to kill had been formed prior to the attendance at the home unless it is the only rational finding to be made in the circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    23 Mr Byrne recalled the prisoner informing him on 12 September 2005 that “he did it because Margaret had ruined his life for 15 years and had waited for revenge”. During the flight to Brisbane on 20 September 2005, the prisoner told Mr Byrne that the took the rope so he could tie the deceased up and kill her. He took grey tape to gag her with and also took a video camera but did not take a video tape with him. He said that it was the deceased’s idea to “……make a sex video and his idea to make a bondage video. This was to give him a reason to tie Margaret to the bed……” The prisoner further told him, Mr Byrne recalls, that “he was going to kill Margaret that day as ‘all the pieces had fallen into place’” and “Margaret wanted him to do an armed hold-up with her at a petrol station and that he did not want to do it and that was the reason he killed her”. 
     
      
    24 During the covert recording, the prisoner said on the day of the killing, he was aware that the deceased’s husband would be away, and the children would be at school. He intended to kill her at this point. He stated that he did not want to meet her in public and that he wanted to meet at her place. He took the rope with him and was setting the stage. He also brought the video camera with him and told her that a bloke wanted a “porno” movie with bondage and they would get “two hundred grand” for it. 
     
      
    25 The prisoner remembered killing Margaret and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “She wanted me to hold up a service station. I wasn’t gonna hold up no service station……If I, I did it again, she would want me to do it to another. I wanted it to stop, end of story. And I had been to the police…..She’s got a video tape with her under 17, under 18, saying well he molested me.” 
        
       
      
    26 When the prisoner was asked did he have sex with the deceased, he replied “No. My intention wasn’t to have sex with her my intention was to knock her. Simple.” In response to a question of how long had he been waiting for his moment to murder her said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t know. As long as it took, I suppose.”  
        
       
      
    27 In the overt recording in Brisbane on the same day, the prisoner said he set the scene using a video camera, to make a “kinky video” so he could get the rope around her. “I went there to kill her, end of story”. “I went there to kill her.” During the overt recording the next day in Sydney, the prisoner said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I didn’t want to do the armed robbery, and to solve the problem I killed her. End of story.”  
        
       
      
    He also stated:  
     
      
       
        
        “Well it was either go [do] the armed robbery or kill her, or go to gaol for a child molester.” 
        
       
       
      He said he wasn’t sure whether he would be able to kill her on that day because he had never been to her home before. He stated:  
       
       
        
        “It was only when, till I got to her place, found out that she was gunna be alone for at least two hours, that I have the opportunity.” 
        
       
      
    28 The prisoner told this Court that after he and the deceased arrived at her home, they went into the lounge room and the deceased told him to sit. She went into another room and came back carrying a towel. The deceased unfolded the towel, put two guns in his hand and told him [they] were the guns [with which] she wanted him to hold up a service station with her. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “She had mentioned an armed robbery. She started talking about an armed robbery when she placed the guns in my hand and kept on saying that she wanted me to do the armed robbery and she wanted me to shoot the owner of the service station and shoot the bloke behind the cash register and me leave the money and give her the money. I was not going to do any of that at all.” (T17 26/3/07) 
        
       
      
    29 He understood that the sum of money at the service station was [to be] “anywhere up to a hundred grand” as “the bloke in the service station knew [the deceased] and he was going to ring [her] when the boss had come in from collecting money from the other stations that he owned”. The prisoner said that he at first told the deceased he did not agree but she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I can do to your kids what I’ve just done to you.” (T17 26/3/07). 
        
       
      
    To which he responded: 
     
      
     “What do you mean by that? 
     
      
    The deceased replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “You know your flat mate and her daughter that she got charged?” and……“That girl is my friend and we arranged to have that charge brought against you.” (T17-18) 
        
       
      
    30 He agreed she was referring to a charge of sexual assault on a young girl for which he had been convicted and sentenced some years previously. The prisoner said that he understood the deceased had something to do with the conviction and he had not been guilty of the offence. It appears that the prisoner was referring to his conviction for an offence of committing an act of indecency with a person under the age of 16 years. 
     
      
      He understood that the deceased, if he did not carry out the armed robbery, would do the same to his children and have them “gaoled for this sexual harassment, or whatever”. (T18) 
       
      
    31 The prisoner testified that he formed the intention to kill “when she put the guns in my hands and told me I was going to shoot a bloke in the service station and the bloke who was giving her information and she was going to sit in the service station and shoot anyone who came on the driveway”. The allegations against his children just made him angrier. (T18-19) 
     
      
    32 After she told him she was prepared to put his two children through the same thing, he said “Okay, let’s go and do it.” The deceased, he said, decided to do the video and the prisoner described how he then strangled her.  
     
      
    33 The last time he had seen the deceased before the birthday party, the prisoner deposed, was the armed robbery in 1989. The deceased had tried to ring him many times since he got out of gaol in 1994 – in late 1996 and early 1997 but he responded to her requests to contact her by pressing “delete”.  
     
      
       
      
    34 The prisoner’s evidence as to the formation of the intent to kill stands in contraposition to some of the statements he made to the journalists.  
     
      
    35 It is the prisoner’s testimony that he did not take a video tape to the deceased’s home as she did not say anything about taking a video tape. Her request was confined to a video camera and rope. It was her idea to do the bondage movie. This evidence contradicts the statement to Mr Byrne that it was the deceased’s idea to make a sex video and his idea to make a bondage video.  
     
      
    36 The prisoner told this Court that his evidence was the truth and not what he said to the reporters, who were told what they wanted to know.  
     
      
    37 In assessing the veracity of the varying accounts given by the prisoner, I have taken into account the assessment by Barbara Liddle, senior clinical psychologist, of the prisoner’s idiosyncratic personality and grandiose history giving and the oral evidence of Dr Westmore which I will expand upon later in these remarks. 
     
      
    38 Although he told the journalists that the deceased wanted him to do an armed robbery he did not divulge to them that the deceased had placed two guns in his hands. In closely scrutinising the prisoner’s account, Mr Crown asked him (T26): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And when you spoke to the reporters, the accounts you gave of what happened on that day were quite exhaustive …you were there telling them everything you knew of what happened on that day? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I was there telling them what they wanted to know. I was not going to tell people on the television, especially people that I associate with now, that I had two guns in my hand.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. That is the point I want to make, sir. You never at any stage mentioned to…….Paterson or Byrne, anything about guns? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s right, because I knew I was going to gaol and if I went to gaol, what am I going to tell the blokes in gaol about these two guns. Everybody would be on my back. 
        
       
      
     Q. What are you going to tell them now? 
     
      
       
        
        A. It’s all over and done with now. I’ve gone through the first 12 months. I’m just one of them at the moment.” 
        
       
       
      I find the prisoner’s explanation for the lack of mention to the journalists of the guns to be less than credible.  
       
      
    39 No mention was made to the journalists by the prisoner of the deceased’s threat to his children who were at that time aged between 7 and 12. Before this Court, the prisoner had difficulties articulating what he understood by the threat. It seems that he comprehended the threat to mean that the deceased would make false allegations against his children. The assertion that such a threat was made, is in my view, implausible. 
     
      
    40 The alteration in the prisoner’s account as to whose idea it was to do the bondage video underpins the veracity of his evidence. On the version given to Mr Byrne, it would have otherwise been difficult to explain why he attended the home without the video tape unless he had a prior intention to kill. The prisoner’s explanation that he did not take the video tape as the deceased’s request was confined to a video camera and rope was transparently dishonest.  
     
      
    41 Various statements confessing to the murder were made by the prisoner to friends. Whilst in hospital in 1998, he told Fiona Wallwork: 
     
      
       
        
        “My ex sister-in-law got what she deserved. I can say what I like now because I am mental and I can’t get done for it”. 
        
       
      
    42 The prisoner when asked by Ms Wallwork: 
     
      
       
        
        “Why, what did she get? 
        
       
      
     Replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I got what I wanted, strangled her and tied her up. But I didn’t leave any evidence for them to know it was me.” 
        
       
      
    43 On 4 January 1999, he told Kylie Hearn that he killed the deceased. When asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Why did you?” 
        
       
      
     He replied: 
     
      
     “Because she was in the way”. 
     
      
       
      He explained to Ms Hearn that “she [the deceased] was sticking her nose in where it wasn’t wanted”. 
       
      
    44 During the intercepted telephone conversation with Karen Bugeja on 23 December 1999, the prisoner told Ms Bugeja that he put his hands around the deceased’s neck and said……… “it was fun” and he “enjoyed it”. No mention was made during these conversations by the prisoner that the deceased had placed guns in his hands and had threatened his children. 
     
      
    45 The prisoner’s assertion that the deceased had blackmailed him by the threat of disclosing the pornographic film of sexual intercourse between them when she was aged 15 to police is not of recent invention. As mentioned previously, evidence was given of the blackmail at the sentencing hearing in 1991. The journalists, Mr Byrne and Ms Paterson, were also given accounts of the blackmail. 
     
      
    46 It appears, however, that the prisoner’s focus upon the deceased’s asserted misconduct has enlarged over the years. 
     
      
    47 During the sentencing proceedings in the District Court, the deceased’s blackmail was not his sole complaint. He testified that his former wife and stepsister Marea had also blackmailed him. His wife was saying that she would take the children from him and he would never see them again. Marea suggested that she would have him up on a rape charge claiming that he had raped her. He told the Court that he had no quarrel with his stepsisters but was disappointed they had helped his wife. 
     
      
    48 It is appropriate to observe that in a statement dated 24 March 1997, Kelly Van Der Schoot recalled the prisoner being involved in an armed robbery at Granville Railway Station. She said she had nothing at all to do with [the robbery] and the prisoner never told her anything about it. She recounts (at para 15): 
     
      
       
        
        “However, when he got out of gaol after doing the 9 months, he tried to blackmail me by coming around to our house in St Marys and showing me a letter in which he said he was going to tell the police that me, Margaret and Marea were all involved in the armed robbery. I never took Gareth back and he ended up going back into gaol on that charge.” 
        
       
      
    49 Ms Van Der Schoot said that whilst the prisoner was in gaol, she was interviewed by Blacktown Detectives at the police station about the armed robbery in, it appears, 1992. The detectives rang her back later and told her she had been cleared. She was not aware if the deceased or Marea were interviewed.  
     
      
    50 During the recorded conversations in Brisbane with the journalists the prisoner related that the deceased had “blown the whistle” on him and his brother for the offence of larceny by a servant for which he served nine months in prison. He told this Court that the deceased, he understood, had something to do with concocting the evidence that led to his conviction for a charge of sexual assault upon a young girl. 
     
      
    51 As was said by Dr Westmore, the prisoner’s personality included an obsessiveness and an inability to move on. He had, it seems, a pre-occupation about what he understood to be the deceased’s misconduct towards him and an inability to resolve the conflict by lawful means. 
     
      
    52 The prisoner had a motive to kill the deceased before the day of the murder. He had, I am satisfied, the belief that the deceased had ruined his life. He related to Mr Byrne he “had waited for revenge”, and to Ms Paterson that he “….got a ……needle out of my bum that was annoying the shit out of me for many years, and I pulled it out.” 
     
      
    53 The statements made to the journalists of his prior intent to kill were not exaggerations but were the truth. I do not accept the prisoner’s evidence that he formed the intent to kill after he arrived at the home. Without dilating further on the evidence, I reject the prisoner’s assertions that the deceased placed guns in his hands and threatened his children. I do not accept that the deceased wanted him to do an armed robbery and to commit murder. These assertions, I conclude, were made by the prisoner in order to justify his criminality.  
     
      
    54 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference to be drawn from the prisoner’s motive, his attendance at the deceased’s home with the video camera and the rope without the video tape, the statements made to the journalists, to Ms Hearn, Ms Wallwork and Ms Bugeja is that the prisoner had formed the intent to kill the deceased before he travelled to Warrimoo on the day of the murder. 
     
      
    55 The murder had been carefully planned. The bondage video was to be used as a ruse to place the deceased in a vulnerable position when she could be strangled by the technique which decreased the possibility of detection.  
     
      
    56 I have taken into account the prisoner’s careful planning of the killing as an objective factor increasing the seriousness of the offence and not as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Crimes (SP) Act).  
     
      
     
     
      
      Did the prisoner write the letter? 
       
      
    57 As previously mentioned the deceased received an anonymous letter which advised that her “joint investment is due to be realised on Friday 23 April 1993”. The value of the investment was stated to be $876,954.89. The money could not be retrieved unless the author had “all five passwords”. The letter was typed.  
     
      
    58 The Crown contends that the prisoner wrote the letter. As the authorship of the letter is relevant to the issue of the murder being planned rather than as a reaction to threats made by the deceased on the day of the murder, the onus of proof is on the Crown beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    59 During his testimony, the prisoner denied he was the author of the letter. He said it was typewritten and he had not used a typewriter since he was 16. He said he had a recollection of the letter but had not read it. The deceased at a birthday party had shown it to him and said “we can make some money from this, you come to my place and make another video” to which he said “yeah”. 
     
      
    60 The Crown relies upon the following circumstances to prove that the prisoner wrote the letter: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) the conversation between the prisoner and Mr Byrne on 4 October 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the contextual similarity between the letter received by the deceased and a letter he wrote to Kelly Van Der Schoot whilst he was in prison in 1989, 1990; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) the conversation between the prisoner and Mr Andrew Byrne on 11 October 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) the conversation between the deceased and Corrina Ann Aitken which was overheard by Cheryl Wade. 
        
       
      
    61 During the conversation on 4 October 2005, Mr Byrne said to the prisoner: 
     
      
       
        
        “Come on Gareth no secrets now. Who else but you would have sent this letter, there was no one else to gain from it. It was you wasn’t it”. To which the prisoner replied, “Yes”. 
        
       
       
      Mr Byrne asked “This was four years before you murdered Margaret, what were you doing, playing mind games?” 
       
       
      The prisoner, Mr Byrne recalled, smiled and shrugged and said something like “you can never do too much planning, you never know when you need that piece of the jigsaw”. 
       
      
    62 On 11 October 2005, the prisoner told Mr Byrne that he and the deceased had spoken on the day of his son’s birthday party at Mt Druitt Pizza Hut. They had made arrangements to meet and talk about the money from the letter. The prisoner indicated to Mr Byrne that this was the time when he arranged to meet the deceased so if the opportunity presented itself he could go through with what he had planned and kill her. 
     
      
    63 In her statement dated 24 March 1997 Ms Van Der Schoot recalls that whilst the prisoner was in gaol (although she was not sure about the timing) for the 9 months for larceny and trying to get her back, receiving a letter handwritten and signed by him. The letter said that he had opened a bank account which had two passwords on it. One was “George” and the other was “X-ray”. He said that the account contained eighty thousand dollars from selling the video he had made of him and the deceased having sex. She could not recall the exact wording of the letter but the idea was to give her one password if something happened to him in gaol. He also mentioned that the deceased had the other password. She said she never spoke to the prisoner about the contents of the letter which she did not believe. Whilst there are similarities in the references to passwords and the prospect of obtaining money, the letter which the deceased received was typed whereas the letter to his former wife was handwritten.  
     
      
    64 Ms Van Der Schoot recalled having a conversation with the deceased about the contents of a letter saying there was money invested in an account for her. She told her that she had no idea who the letter was from. They were at Ms Van Der Schoot’s home in Oakhurst sometime around Christmas or New Year in 1996. Sometime later the same evening she saw the deceased speaking to the prisoner on the front lawn. When the deceased came back inside, the deceased told her that the money was real and that she believed him. She stated that the prisoner said he would look into it and let her know. Ms Van Der Schoot told the deceased she was stupid for listening to the prisoner but the deceased still believed him. The deceased rang her about the end of January to see if she had heard anything from the prisoner about the money. Ms Van Der Schoot replied that she hadn’t. The deceased asked her to ring the prisoner and give him her number which Ms Van Der Schoot never did. 
     
      
    65 On the morning of the day she was murdered, the deceased told Corrina Aitken “I’ve got to meet someone later on this morning. I might be coming into some money…………eight hundred and seventy five thousand…I want to find out what the story is. I’ve been making some phone calls and got onto a guy. That’s who I’m meeting today. Hopefully he will be able to give me some more information so I invited him over for coffee so I could find out. He’s due at the house about ten o’clock”. 
     
      
    66 Cheryl Wade heard this conversation and her account of it is substantially the same as that related by Ms Aitken except that Ms Wade recalls that the time of the meeting was one or two o’clock. 
     
      
    67 I have no doubt that the deceased in her conversation with Ms Aitken was referring to meeting the prisoner. 
     
      
    68 I do not consider that the evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that it was the prisoner who typed the letter. I find, however, that the prisoner’s statement to Mr Byrne that he sent the letter was truthful and not an exaggeration. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the prisoner who sent the letter in 1993 to the deceased. I do not conclude that he did so at that time as part of a plan to kill her. The prisoner encouraged the deceased in 1997 to believe that the contents of the letter were true and he would help her to obtain the money. He used this interest in the letter to assist the deceased in feeling comfortable with him. It was at that time part of his careful plan to kill her. As he told Mr Byrne “the letter was part of the jigsaw and that you can never do too much planning”. 
     
      
       
      Did the prisoner have sexual intercourse with the deceased? 
       
      
    69 In answer to questions by Mr Young SC the prisoner said that the had no idea how sperm consistent with his DNA type was located on the swabs taken from the deceased’s body. He did not have sexual intercourse with her (T20). 
     
      
    70 In cross-examination by Mr Crown, the following appears (T24): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr Bunce, I want to suggest to your sir, that on 18 March, when you were at the home of the deceased, that you in fact had sexual intercourse with her on that day. What do you say about that? 
        
       
      
     A. Could have 
     
      
     Q. Not could have, sir; you did have? 
     
      
       
        
        A. I could have. I do not remember, and just because the police officers in 1991 can’t do their jobs when an allegation is made, and the courts can’t do their job when the allegations are made, and put people in the position which I was in. I don’t remember. I have had two heart attacks, so I can’t remember a small, insufficient (sic) thing like that.” 
        
       
      
    71 While I am mindful of the impact of the hypoxic episode in 1998 upon his memory, the prisoner told the journalists during the covert recording that he did not have sex with the deceased. 
     
      
    72 There are four reports from the analyst Michele Franco. It is for present purposes sufficient to state that Ms Franco opines in the third additional report dated 23 March 2007 that the male fraction of DNA recovered from the vaginal and vulva swabs appeared to originate from two main individuals. Assuming that the deceased’s husband was one of the main contributors to this mixture then the prisoner had the same DNA profile (in the Profiler Plus system) as the second main contributor. The profile of the second main contributor was expected to occur in approximately one in ten billion individuals of the general population. 
     
      
    73 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference to be drawn from all the circumstances is that the prisoner had sexual intercourse with the deceased upon the day that she was murdered. Whether or not the sexual intercourse occurred before or after the deceased was tied up cannot be determined. 
     
      
    74 For the purpose of this sentence, the sexual intercourse must be considered to have been voluntary. Voluntary sexual intercourse would have provided assurance to the deceased that nothing was amiss at a time the prisoner intended to murder her. It was either part of the ruse employed by the prisoner to carry out the murder or a callous act of self gratification (or a combination of both). In any event the sexual intercourse increases the objective seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    75 Objectively, the killing displays a high degree of criminality. There is little in the way of mitigation. The prisoner’s conversations with the journalists and with Ms Wallwork, Ms Hearn and Ms Bugeja demonstrate callousness for the crime. In a report dated 23 February 2007, Dr Westmore states that the prisoner “did not however freely or spontaneously openly acknowledge the wrongness of his actions and he showed no emotional responses of that type when talking about the deceased or his actions towards her which led to her death”. The psychologist, Ms Liddle, in a report dated 15 August 2006 reports that the prisoner “does not seem to understand the consequences of his actions, or the seriousness of his situation”. 
     
      
    76 Mr Young SC contends that the prisoner’s attitude towards the deceased’s young son appeared to play heavily on his mind and may have been one of the reasons he came forward and entered a plea of guilty. During the interview with Dr Westmore on 21 February 2007, the prisoner told him that he was upset because the deceased’s young son had walked in and found her body. When asked what he hoped to achieve by telling people he had committed the offence the prisoner said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Get the book closed. Doesn’t the seven years (sic) old deserve some answers, his mother’s dead. She was going to take him away from his father. I don’t know his father at all so I don’t know what sort of life he would have with or without his father. I wouldn’t let her carry on the way she was, just on her say so.” 
        
       
       
      The regret that the prisoner expressed to Dr Westmore was not apparent during the interviews with the journalists. When asked by Ms Paterson didn’t [it] bother him that a child found his mother dead, the prisoner replied: 
       
       
        
        “I couldn’t help what happened afterwards” (exhibit A volume 2 tab 36 at 20). 
        
       
       
      In Ms Liddle’s report there is no mention of regret for Jason. When Ms Liddle visited him on 14 August 2006, the prisoner told her there were two reasons why he contacted  
      A Current Affair 
       which were to get a nurse from Nepean Hospital to contact him to confirm his story and to prove his innocence. He wanted compensation money. Ms Liddle made reference to Dr Westmore’s assessment of the prisoner on 10 May 2006. 
       
      
    77 I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the prisoner’s expression of remorse for Jason is anything more than of recent origin. It was not a reason for his voluntary disclosure of his offence to the journalists. As I have previously mentioned the prisoner’s lack of repentance for taking the life of the deceased is egregiously evident during those interviews. For whatever reason the prisoner made his voluntary disclosure it was not motivated by remorse or contrition. I conclude that any remorse that the prisoner presently has for the offence is confined to the discovery of the deceased’s body by Jason. The prisoner does not appreciate the enormity of his crime.  
     
      
    78 The Crown case against the prisoner, the admissions having been made, was very strong. The prisoner’s plea of guilty was a recognition of the inevitable and, save to the limited extent to which I have referred, not an expression of remorse. The strength of the Crown case is irrelevant to the determination of the utilitarian value of the plea.  
     
      
    79 During his evidence the prisoner expressed his anger towards the police and the court system because of their failure to do anything when he asked for help. He said that if they had done something about it, he may not have been put in a position [which he faced] in 1997. He described going to Hornsby police in 1985 and to Merrylands police in 1986 complaining about the deceased’s and her family’s blackmail and being told he would need more evidence. Dr Westmore reports that the prisoner told him that he approached the police in 1996 and told them that his wife and her family were trying to blackmail him.  
     
      
    80 Detective Senior Constable Gill, however, told this Court that his inquiries at Hornsby and Merrylands police stations did not reveal any records of complaints being made by the prisoner. It is apparent that police treated the allegations made by the prisoner in 1991 seriously. Kelly Van Der Schoot as previously mentioned was interviewed at Blacktown police station and subsequently cleared. In any event the prisoner’s belief in the inaction of police and the court system does not in any way justify or mitigate his criminality. 
     
      
       
      
    81 The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A person sentenced to imprisonment for life is to serve that sentence for the term of his natural life: s 19A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 19A(3) provides that nothing in s 19A affects the operation of s 21(1) of the Crimes (SP) Act (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life). 
     
      
    82 Section 61(1) of the Crimes (SP) Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence”. 
        
       
      
     The primary focus of the section is an assessment of extreme culpability. 
     
      
    83 In the present case, I have found that the prisoner carefully planned the killing and was motivated by revenge. The killing was an act of great cruelty in that the deceased, having voluntarily submitted to being bound and gagged, found that she was being strangled. The murder, however, was not accompanied by violence that was prolonged, gratuitous or wanton.  
     
      
    84 Mr Crown, contrary to the Crown’s written submissions on future dangerousness, in oral argument pointed to various parts of the conversations with the journalists which indicate some degree of dangerousness in the future so far as his ex-wife is concerned. Mr Young SC contends there is no cogent evidence that there are any personality traits which would lead to a conclusion of future dangerousness. A finding of future dangerousness does not need to be established beyond reasonable doubt: R v SLD (2003) 58 NSWLR 589. It is sufficient if the Crown establishes on the balance of probabilities that there is a risk of re-offending: see R v Harrison (1997) 93 A Crim R 314.  
     
      
    85 In the conversation with the journalists in Brisbane, Ms Paterson asked the prisoner (exhibit A vol 2 tab 35 at p85): 
     
      
       
        
        “Will you kill again?” 
        
       
      
     To which he replied: 
     
      
     “Maybe my ex if the time and place comes up.” 
     
      
     When further asked: 
     
      
     “You will kill your ex-wife?” 
     
      
     He responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “If everything fell into place like it fell into place with Margaret, I would, I think. I don’t know if I would actually, but thinking about it, yes, I would.” 
        
       
      
    86 During the “walk through” interview the prisoner told the journalists that he had never thought about murdering anybody else. In response to a question by Mr Byrne if he was capable of doing it again to his ex-wife, the prisoner replied that he had thought about that and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, I don’t know, it would be nice to do it…….” 
        
       
      
    87 He went on to say that he was just annoyed with her and her family but if he did that “where does it stop? So you’ve got to draw the line somewhere:” (see exhibit A volume 2 tab 36 page 22) 
     
      
    88 Whilst these statements conflict, they are, to my mind, of significant concern. 
     
      
    89 Dr Westmore opined that it was unlikely that the prisoner represents a risk to the general community. He said (T 02/04/07 at p 9): 
     
      
       
        
        “He’s unlikely to go out and commit an offence without some historical link. The fact that the incident occurred in the context of a complicated relationship suggests that if he does have a risk it’s going to be in that context.” 
        
       
       
      There was no obsessiveness that he could recall in relation to the prisoner’s ex-wife. 
       
      
    90 The prisoner has had a long and unhappy relationship with Ms Van Der Schoot. It was Ms Van Der Schoot that he principally blamed during the sentencing hearing in the District Court. It is evident from his conversations with the journalists that those issues had not resolved. I conclude that, whilst the prisoner is not a risk to the general community, there is a risk that the prisoner could offend again by killing his ex-wife. 
     
      
    91 I do not, however, conclude that the prisoner’s culpability is so extreme that the only sentence that can be passed is one of imprisonment for life. Although I do not characterise the offence as being in the worst case category, it is a very serious offence [of murder]. 
     
      
    92 The prisoner’s criminal record includes convictions for assault and robbery, larceny as a servant, and commit an act of indecency with a person under 16. The prisoner’s record does not entitle him to any leniency but it is not such that it is a matter of aggravation.  
     
      
    93 As the murder was committed in 1997, I am required to sentence the prisoner in accordance with the sentencing practice as at the date of the commission of the offence and not as presently prevails: see MJR 130 A Crim R 481. Although the statutory maximum penalty for the offence of murder has not been altered, it is evident from the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics that sentencing practice has moved adversely to the prisoner since 1997. Division 1A – standard non-parole periods of the Crimes (SP) Act which came into force on 1 February 2003, as a consequence, has no application to the present sentence. Sections 3A and 21A of the Crimes (SP) Act, however, apply. 
     
      
    94 Mr Young SC has provided me with a schedule of sentences imposed, copies of relevant cases and material from the Judicial Commission including a study entitled “Sentenced Homicides in New South Wales 1994 – 2001” by Keane and Poletti. I am satisfied that this material establishes a sentencing range current at the time of the murder which I have taken into account. Each case depends upon it’s own facts and circumstances and I believe the sentence I am about to impose is consistent with the sentencing range.  
     
      
       
      
    95 The prisoner pleaded guilty upon arraignment on 7 July 2006, however, the plea was not entered. A plea of guilty made on 16 March 2007 was accepted. The expense of a lengthy trial and the emotional stress likely to be experienced by the deceased’s family and friends in giving evidence has been avoided. The plea has significant utilitarian benefit. 
     
      
    96 Mr Young SC contends that the prisoner’s voluntary disclosure of his crime to the journalists should attract a measure of added leniency. It is common ground that, without the prisoner’s revelations, the cause of death could not be established. Difficulties in establishing cause of death resulted in the charge being no-billed in 2000. 
     
      
    97 Without the prisoner’s disclosure of the technique he used in strangling the deceased, it is unlikely that the offence could have been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Although he has retracted some of his disclosures to the journalists, he has most importantly adhered to his admission of how he killed the deceased. The disclosures adhered to by the prisoner are to be taken into account with respect to the utilitarian benefit of the plea: see R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at para 138; R v Palinko [2005] NSWCCA 46. I assess the utilitarian value of the plea at twenty five per cent.  
     
      
    98 The prisoner was born on 9 October 1959 and is 47 years of age. He was 37 years old at the time of the murder. From the history given to Ms Liddle, it appears that he grew up in Merrylands and attended school until Year 10. On leaving school he joined State Rail. He said when he was 25 he had his own house in Merrylands and was in a relationship which he terminated when she didn’t want children. He then met his ex-wife who became pregnant and they married. He said that he lost his house and job because of her family’s drug and alcohol habits. Ms Liddle notes that the prisoner “was diagnosed with a psychopathic personality after his charges of larceny and armed hold-up”.  
     
      
      He suffered hypoxic brain damage following an out of hospital cardiac arrest on 26 September 1998. He suffered a further cardiac arrest whilst in hospital but was resuscitated successfully. He was demonstrating, after the serious hypoxic episode, “amnestic syndrome and bizarre behaviour”. Ms Liddle concluded “that he has made a remarkable recovery in his performance on tests of memory and executive functioning, although there is suggestion that residual weaknesses remain when asked to recall more abstract information. His memory appears to be intact enough for day-to-day functioning”. Ms Liddle refers to the prisoner presenting “with an unusual personality style which is largely consistent with that commented on prior to the brain injury…His history giving is grandiose”. Ms Liddle opines “that his idiosyncratic personality style is more likely to be a premorbid state”. Dr Westmore expressed the view in evidence that hypoxic brain damage can cause an exaggeration of pre-existing traits.  
       
      
    99 Victim impact statements from Shane and Jason Metcalfe and from the deceased’s sisters and mother have been placed before me. The contents of the statements cannot be used by me to increase the prisoner’s sentence by reason of the pain and loss occasioned to the members of the family by the killing. The statements are important because they allow the members of the family to express their grief to this Court as representing the community. The prisoner’s act is a crime against the community and not just those who mourn the passing of the deceased. The punishment meted out by the Court on the prisoner is for what he has done to the community and to express on the community’s behalf it’s abhorrence of the taking of human life but also to express its sympathy and compassion for the deceased’s husband, her children, her mother and sisters.  
     
      
    100 The prisoner was arrested on 29 December 1999 and remained in custody until 28 September 2000. He was re-arrested on 23 February 2006 and has remained in custody ever since. Accordingly, the date of the commencement of the sentence will be 23 May 2005.  
     
      
    101 The appropriate undiscounted starting point of the overall sentence, I conclude, is 32 years. The overall sentence is reduced by 25 per cent to 24 years. As the offence was committed before 1 February 2003, the repealed section 44 of the Crimes (SP) Act applies. I do not consider that “special circumstances” exist which justify the non-parole period being less than three-quarters of the term of imprisonment.

      REGINA v. DALLEY STUART ROBINSON 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Dalley Stuart Robinson, and I will refer to him throughout these remarks as “the offender”, was charged by way of indictment that on 28 June 2005 at Bexley North in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Kelly Lorraine Hudson. 
     
      
    2 The offender, through his legal representative, indicated to the Local Court that a plea of guilty would be entered on the next occasion. On 8 August 2006, he pleaded guilty to the charge before the magistrate. He was committed to this Court for sentence. 
     
      
    3 The offender was born on 5 June 1973. He was therefore 32 years of age at the date of the offence and is now 34 years of age. He and the victim had lived in a domestic relationship for approximately 11 to 12 years. They had two children, aged six years and 10 years as at the date of the offence. Ms Hudson had a son from a previous relationship who was aged 15 years at that time. 
     
      
    4 The level of culpability in the commission of the offence by the offender is, in part, dependent upon the relevant findings of fact to be made in relation to the circumstances in which the offence occurred. That, in turn, requires close consideration to the offender’s own account or accounts given, firstly, to police during the electronically recorded interview held on 29 June 2005 and, secondly, to his evidence given in these proceedings. It also requires consideration to other evidence to which I shall shortly refer. 
     
      
    5 I have viewed the videotape of the electronically recorded interview, which reveals something as to the offender’s capacity to respond to questions in considerable detail. The manner of giving his responses in the interview did not, while it proceeded, reveal a lack of understanding. He, however, requested the interview be suspended when questions were directed as to the precise events as to what occurred in the lead up to his attack upon Ms Hudson. A similar observation was made in the pre-sentence report dated 2 March 2007 (Exhibit E) which records that there was some reservation in the offender accepting that he had come to a full acceptance of his actions, it being noted that he claimed to have minimal recall pertaining to the attack and its ferocity, although he appeared capable of recalling other detailed facets of information leading up to the offence. 
     
      
    6 It has been submitted on behalf of the Crown that the offender went to the victim’s flat with the intention of killing her. The Crown submitted that the offender has not given a truthful or reliable account of the events leading up to the victim’s death (written submissions, paragraph [16]). In this respect, the Crown submitted that the offender’s assertion that he went to the victim’s unit with her agreement to discuss the future arrangements for the children was unbelievable, given the context of the relationship that existed at the relevant time between her and himself. 
     
      
    7 In his written submissions, the Crown submitted as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “39. It is submitted that the objective seriousness of this case takes it beyond an offence that falls within the ‘middle range of objective seriousness’ for murder:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          •  
          the offence was premeditated; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          • it involved a high degree of violence; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          • it was committed when the offender was subject to court orders restraining him from approaching the deceased; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          •  
          was committed in the context of domestic violence.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    8 On behalf of the offender, it was submitted that the objective seriousness of the offence is to be considered in the light of the facts relating directly to its commission, including those that may explain why it was committed (written submissions, paragraph [4]). It was contended by Mr. Turnbull, on behalf of the offender, that the offence in question does not fall into the mid-range of seriousness in light of the facts set out in paragraphs (a) to (k) of paragraph [5] of the written submissions, namely:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) limited, if any, pre-planning, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the offence was not committed in cold blood but in the context of heightened emotion leading to impeded thinking, whilst not at a high level to afford a defence to the charge, nevertheless a significant level such that it impinged on the mens rea of the offender, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the killing was followed by an immediate expression of remorse and thereafter a desire for self-harm, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the accused had no sensible exit strategy sufficient to avoid detection, or to realise any misguided ambition in relation to his children, 
        
       
       
        
        (e) the question of intention to kill or grievous bodily harm cannot be resolved adverse to the offender on the evidence, 
        
       
       
        
        (f) the fact of killing was effected over a short space of time and, whilst frenzied, did not involve gratuitous cruelty or humiliation, 
        
       
       
        
        (g) there was an incapacity to sufficiently advert to the harm, 
        
       
       
        
        (h) access to the weapon used was opportunistic – it was not brought by the offender to the scene, 
        
       
       
        
        (i) there was some degree of intoxication, 
        
       
       
        
        (j) it was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity sufficient to attract the operation of s.21A, 
        
       
       
        
        (k) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial to the victim’s family.” 
        
       
       
      The facts 
       
      
    9 I observe here that before any matters of fact may be used adversely to the offender, I am required to be satisfied of such matters to the criminal standard of proof. In relation to matters that go to mitigation of the offence, however, then it is sufficient that I be satisfied of such matters on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
    10 The offender gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence. The material tendered by the Crown included a statement of Kelly Hudson to police dated 21 June 2005 and transcript of an electronically recorded interview by police with the offender on 29 June 2005. The relevant facts may be divided into three categories to which I will now relate:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The relationship in the months prior to the offence 
       
      
    11 The relationship, as the offender conceded, was marked by verbal and physical aggression perpetrated by him upon Ms Hudson. It is unnecessary to recount the full detail of that history over the period of the relationship. The part of the history that is most relevant is that which occurred closer in time to the offence. In relation to the earlier history, however, it is sufficient to say that in a statement dated 30 October 1998 (Exhibit B), the victim recorded that she had a “on again off again” relationship with the offender for about four years as at that time in which she said she suffered emotional and physical abuse from him. Reference is made by the victim in that statement to physical beatings in late December 1997, early January 1998 when the victim was pregnant. There was argument, according to her, about the offender’s desire that she have an abortion. 
     
      
    12 In relation to the more recent events, the victim provided police with a statement dated 21 June 2005, that is, approximately a week before she was murdered. That statement formed part of the materials within Exhibit A. 
     
      
    13 The material events related in that statement may be summarised as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (a) In the first week of the Easter school holidays in 2005, the offender head butted the victim whilst she was ironing causing pain to her head and injury to the bridge of her nose. The offender, according to the statement, then spat on her. These events occurred in front of the older child who was then 10 years of age. 
       
       
      (b) Later that same evening, the offender hit the victim on the nose causing her head to fling backwards. Blood ran down her throat from her nose. At this time, the victim recorded in her statement:- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “I was too scared to call the police. Dalley has said in the past that if ever I take the girls off him he would kill me …” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (c) Approximately two weeks before 21 June 2005, the offender pushed a table towards the victim in a rage. He dragged the victim along the ground on her back down the hallway and into the bedroom and proceeded to hit her. He kicked her on the ground and in the back. He placed his foot on her head and threatened  
      “if you ever try and take these kids away from me, I’ll kill you. They deserve a better life” 
      . The victim was left with a sore left ear and marks on her forehead (on the left side) and carpet burns on her back from being dragged by the offender. 
       
      
    14 In the statement of 21 June 2005, which I consider to be reliable, the victim also recited many instances of verbal and other physical abuse in the period leading up to 28 June 2005. 
     
      
    15 In cross-examination, the offender agreed that the criminal charges that were brought against him related to assaults that he had committed upon the victim over the previous two or three weeks prior to the charges. In cross-examination, he accepted that he had been guilty of assaulting the victim. 
     
      
    16 The statement of facts, Exhibit A, records a work supervisor noting on 21 June 2005 scratches to the right side of Ms Hudson’s neck and that the victim was crying uncontrollable. She said to him “I can’t live like this anymore”. 
     
      
       
      (2) The events concerning the AVO proceedings in the Newtown Local Court 
       
      
    17 At approximately 4.30 pm on 21 June 2005, police arrested the offender and interviewed him in relation to the assaults alleged by the victim to have been committed upon her. Following the interview, he was charged with four counts of assault of the victim and one count of maliciously damaging her property. 
     
      
    18 A telephone interim Apprehended Violence Order was obtained by police from a magistrate. The order prohibited the offender from approaching the victim either at her home or place of work. The order was served upon the offender at about that time. 
     
      
    19 In evidence, the offender stated that, following his arrest, he had resided, firstly, with a friend and then for most of that week at the hotel to which I have referred. On the Sunday, the day before the proceedings again at Newtown Local Court, Ms Hudson had gone to work and the children were in the custody of the offender. The victim rang to say that she had finished work earlier than expected and that the children wanted to see a movie. She picked up the children and she, with the offender, attended the movie. That evening, after dinner, the victim left and stayed at her mother’s house where her son was also then living with a view to returning in the very early hours of the morning on 27 June in the expectation that the offender would, by then, have gone to work. 
     
      
    20 He appeared at Newtown Local Court on 27 June 2005 when the four counts of assault and the maliciously damaging property came before the Court. The proceedings were adjourned, on the offender’s application, to Monday 11 July 2005. Bail was ordered to continue. It was a condition of bail and a term of the Apprehended Violence Order that the offender was not to engage in contact with the victim and, in particular, was not to enter the premises in which she resided in or in which she worked. 
     
      
    21 A reading of the transcript of the proceedings of 27 June 2005 discloses that the offender clearly understood the restrictions that operated upon him and he agreed in cross-examination in these proceedings that he did understand the effect of the apprehended violence order. He also conceded that within hours of the Local Court ordering the continuation of the apprehended violence order, he knowingly and deliberately breached it by entering the victim’s unit on the evening of 28 June 2005. 
     
      
    22 Later on the day of the hearing, that is, at about 4.30 pm, 27 June 2005, the offender attended Marrickville Police Station and told Senior Constable Narrelle Hall that the victim had texted him and he wanted her charged. 
     
      
    23 Senior Constable Hall then spoke to him and told him that it had been stated in Court that day that the AVO did not prevent arrangements for access being made by telephone. Senior Constable Hall emphasised that the offender’s mother should pick up and drop the children back to the victim, emphasising that he could not go there by himself and that it was important that he understand that because otherwise he would be arrested. The offender said, “Fine, I won’t. Whatever”. 
     
      
    24 The offender took a room at the Bexley North Hotel, which was situated directly opposite the victim’s unit. 
     
      
    25 The offender was asked in his evidence in chief as to whether or not he had discussed the court proceedings with the victim before going to court on Monday 27 June 2005. He admitted that they had had such a discussion. The offender said that it was his expectation before he arrived at Court that day that he was going to plead guilty to the charges and that the victim was “going to endeavour to get the AVO dropped”. This evidence does support an inference that the offender had sought to persuade the victim to that end, even though he was reluctant to concede as much in evidence. 
     
      
    26 The offender denied putting pressure on the victim to drop the AVO proceedings. He said he was simply trying to “work out something was going to (be) beneficial to everyone”. 
     
      
    27 I am unable to accept this statement as truthful evidence. What emerges plainly from the evidence is that in the weeks and months preceding 28 June 2005, the offender, at no stage, acted in a way which was “beneficial” to Ms Hudson, he having, on his own evidence, assaulted and intimidated her often in the presence of the children. Immediately before denying that he endeavoured to persuade or put pressure on the victim to drop the AVO proceedings, it was put to him in cross-examination in these proceedings (transcript, p.46):- 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Look, you treated her like dirt, didn’t you, in the weeks leading up to you being charged, correct? A. Some of my actions, yeah, yeah without a doubt.” 
        
       
      
    28 The evidence, in my opinion, well supports the inference that the offender had endeavoured to have the victim drop the AVO proceedings. When the victim did not, he was enraged at the fact that events at Court on 27 June went against his expectations and wishes. 
     
      
    29 The offender said that he had received messages and phone calls from the victim on the morning of 27 June 2005 that indicated that she was irate. In his evidence, he admitted that when he went to court he was “angry”. He added “… I couldn’t understand how things had turned out the way they did after what I’d thought was progress made the week prior”. He said he was angry, upset and confused when he left the court. 
     
      
    30 He said that he went to his mother’s place and then to the pub and “got on the drink”. He said that he did not sleep that night and his mind “was still racing”. He went to work the next morning at 4.00 am and then after work went back to the hotel and “got back on the drink again”. He said he spent the afternoon drinking at the hotel, and his evidence indicates he did so as an angry brooding man. 
     
      
       
      (3) The events leading to the offence 
       
      
    31 These events may be dealt with under a number of subject matters as follows:- 
     
      
       
       (a) The question of the offender’s intoxication 
       
      
    32 The offender was challenged over the inconsistency in his accounts as to how much alcohol he had drunk before the offence. In the record of interview held on 29 June 2005, he told police that before making contact with the victim by telephone, on the evening of 28 June 2005 he had consumed six schooners of beer. He told interviewing police that he considered he was “slightly” intoxicated at the time he entered the victim’s flat that evening.  
     
      
    33 In his evidence in chief, he stated that he consumed at least three schooners of beer an hour from the time he got there until the time he left, that is, between approximately 11.30 am and at least 6.00 pm. He gave a similar history to psychologists who made the psychological report (Exhibit 2). 
     
      
    34 He was challenged in cross-examination on his account in evidence that he had drunk that afternoon something in the order of three schooners of beer every hour or approximately 20 schooners of beer. Dr Westmore, it is noted, records in his report that he told the doctor that on the day of the offence “he may have had eight schooners …”. Dr Westmore saw him on two occasions, 20 July 2005 and 8 June 2006. 
     
      
    35 He was also challenged on his claim in evidence that he was unsteady on his feet and would have been slurring his words due to the effects of alcohol in contrast to his statement to police that he estimated that he was only “slightly” affected. The version of having consumed approximately 20 schooners appears, it seems recorded the first time, in the pre-sentence report dated 2 March 2007 (Exhibit E). 
     
      
    36 I will return later in these remarks to the question of the offender’s intoxication. 
     
      
       
      (b) Telephone contact made by the offender with the victim – discrepancy in the offender’s evidence 
       
      
    37 In the early evening of 28 June 2005, at about 6.30 pm, the offender telephoned the victim’s mobile phone. An inconsistency emerged in the offender’s account to the police in the interview and his evidence to this Court. He told police that, on the evening of 28 June 2005, he rang the victim once, not twice, as he recounted in evidence. In his interview, he stated that the purpose of contacting her was “to speak to her and to speak to the children”. 
     
      
    38 He claimed that the victim responded, “not a problem”. The arrangements were that she was going to bring the children and meet him at his mother’s house. It was then that he said to police that he saw the children and “then I went up to see her”. 
     
      
    39 In his evidence, he gave an account of not one but two telephone communications with the victim. In evidence, he said that on the Tuesday afternoon “… I rung Kelly on her mobile. I asked if I could have some contact with the kids, I wanted to see the kids”. 
     
      
    40 He agreed that he knew it was wrong to be making contact with her. He said when he made the call he asked if the victim could drop the children off at his mother’s place and that she said that that was not a problem. 
     
      
    41 He then stated that after the phone call he stayed at the hotel, had a couple more drinks “… stewed on a little bit more, made another phone call to Kelly’s mobile again”. He also gave a history of two calls to the psychiatrists (Exhibit 2) in which history he said he requested to speak to her at the unit. 
     
      
    42 The offender said that on this occasion he spoke to Ms Hudson when she was in the car on her way to drop the children off at his mother’s house. Unlike his version to police, he said that in the second call:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I asked if I could have words with her. I didn’t understand what was going on. She said ‘look, I’m in the car driving. We can talk, but I’ve got to get off the phone, I don’t want to get pinched’ sort of thing. I said, ‘fine, I’ll speak to you later on’ and that was that.” 
        
       
      
    43 The more recent account of two phone calls and the victim’s alleged ready compliance with his request to speak to her stands in significant contrast to the version he gave to police. This inconsistency to which I have referred is a matter that, in my opinion, undermines the offender’s reliability and credibility. 
     
      
    44 Other evidence, of course, indicated how unlikely it was, given the events that preceded it, that Ms Hudson would, late on 28 June, have been so willing to enter into discussions with the offender, as he suggested. Whilst it is clear that she agreed to take the children that evening to his mother’s place to meet him, the statement of facts (Exhibit A) records that, after Ms Hudson received the phone call from the offender, she appeared to be very upset and was unable to eat her dinner and told her mother “I don’t know what he is going to do”. Mrs Lesley Hudson told the victim not to go but the victim told her to keep out it. She then left her parents’ home at about 7.15 pm with the two children. 
     
      
    45 I am unable to accept the offender’s evidence that, if indeed there was a second alleged phone call, that Ms Hudson willingly agreed to his claimed suggestion of meeting to have a conversation. I, accordingly, reject his version that she expressly consented to meeting with him. 
     
      
       
      (c) The direction to the children to say goodbye 
       
      
    46 In his record of interview, the offender said that it was approximately 15 or 20 minutes after he took the children to his mother’s home that he then walked to her unit. 
     
      
    47 The eldest daughter gave an account when interviewed by police that when their mother delivered them to the offender’s home that evening:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q209 What happened when she dropped you off? A. He just said, like, just tell your mum love you, love you, two, two or three times or four.” 
        
       
      
    48 In an answer to a later question in that interview, she said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A220 To tell us to tell mum, say goodbye and love you, love you about three or four times.” 
          
        
       
       
        
        Q222 Was that normal? A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q223 Did he normally say that? A. He’d just, like, say it once.” 
        
       
      
    49 The offender, in his evidence in chief, stated that when the victim dropped the children off and they got out of the car “I asked the kids to say goodbye to their mother, told her that they loved them (as said) like I always do, got the kids. I said, ‘I’ll see you soon, Kel’ and that was that”. Whilst the direction to the children to say goodbye to their mother could bear a sinister meaning, I do not consider the evidence would enable me to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the statements attributed to the offender may be taken as evidence of an intention to kill. 
     
      
       
      (d) The offender’s anger 
       
      
    50 His evidence was that his initial arrest by police on 21 June 2005 took place in front of other parents who were picking up their children from the school and “I was pretty upset and pretty angry”. It is clear that being charged, arrested and made subject to an apprehended violence order set off in the offender a high level of anger. That anger escalated or re-surfaced at and following the events of 27 June at Newtown Local Court. The offender conceded that he was particularly angry when he had gone to the court on 27 June. When he realised that the victim wished to have the continued protection of the apprehended violence order, his level of anger once again escalated. He said when he left the court, “I was angry, I was upset, I was very confused” (transcript, p.25). 
     
      
    51 During the afternoon of that day, he said he “stewed on a little bit more” (transcript, p.28) and had been working out some questions that had “been mulling over in my head” which he wanted to put to Ms Hudson. 
     
      
    52 The evidence indicates that as the day wore on 28 June 2005, the offender was fixated upon the events of that day and was maintaining his anger. When he went about 4.30 to the police station and spoke to Senior Constable Hall he agreed that he was then angry and that he left the police station “upset”.  
     
      
    53 In the early evening when he telephoned the victim, he conceded that he was “upset”. It is clear that he had been ruminating or, as he put it, “stewing”, over the events all day and this was associated with his decision to make contact with the victim. 
     
      
    54 When asked in cross-examination why he could not have any discussions with her at his mother’s place, whether inside or outside, he was unable to provide what he termed “a logical explanation”. Of course, as the Crown also observed, had he wished to speak to Ms Hudson, he could easily have done so by telephone. 
     
      
    55 He said that he just wanted to ask “the questions that were confusing me, that made me upset”. To start, he said it was “just a normal conversation” and then things “began to get agitated” and deteriorated from that point. In the lead up to him punching the victim in the face and then stabbing her, the offender stated “I can tell you that I was asking questions in relation to how come things went so sour the week prior” (transcript, p.79). This statement supports the inference that the offender had indeed been endeavouring to have the victim drop the AVO proceedings and for her to possibly have the charges dropped. 
     
      
    56 The offender’s evidence was that he gained entry into the unit by the use of a key that he still had in his possession. He said he went upstairs and started speaking to the victim adding, “everything was civil to begin”. He said that the victim then began to get agitated with the questions he was asking and then he became agitated. He said things got heated and that he began to get dramatic, telling her that she had ruined his life. He said that he went into the kitchen and grabbed the knife and returned to the lounge room with it and said, “here, if you’re going to do this to me, you might as well stick this through my heart now” (transcript, p.31). 
     
      
    57 The offender, at a mid-point in the police interview on 29 June 2005, requested the interview be suspended. He declined to go into any detail with police as to what had happened when he entered the victim’s unit on the night he killed her. There is no earlier recorded account of him having grabbed the knife and suggesting that the victim might stab him. Although Dr. Westmore in his report of 29 June 2006 stated that he did not include the detailed history of events leading up to the incident, the account as to the lead-up to the stabbing given to him by the offender as set out in his report does not include any reference to any dramatic incident in which the offender suggested to the victim that she might stab him.  
     
      
    58 In his evidence in chief, the offender stated that the victim actually grabbed the knife off him and put it on the lounge. He said that soon after he punched her in the face. In cross-examination he had said that he had not previously punched her with a closed fist as he did on 28 June 2005. On this occasion, he punched her with sufficient force to cause her to fall to the ground backwards. The severity of this incident and the injury it inflicted, is itself, suggestive of extreme anger. The offender said that the victim got off the ground and came towards him screaming. It is then that he said he grabbed the knife off the lounge and stabbed her. 
     
      
       
      (e) Threatening statements 
       
      
    59 It was put to the offender in cross-examination that on a number of previous occasions he had said to the victim that if she or any other person stood in the way of him having access to the children he would kill them. He obfuscated and would not make any concession that he had actually made a statement to the victim to that effect. He did, however, agree that when he was in a rage and confronting the victim he had said “a lot of nasty things” (transcript, p.51). I consider that Ms Hudson’s statement that he had previously threatened to kill should be accepted, her statement in relation to other matters referred to therein being shown to have been correct. 
     
      
       
      (f) The offender’s plan 
       
      
    60 The Crown submitted that the offender’s request to have the children delivered to his mother’s house was a ruse or a contrivance to be able to separate the children from their mother so that he would then be in a position of being alone with her. 
     
      
    61 The offender’s account for the reasons as to why he requested the children to be brought to his mother’s home (namely, so he could see them) is itself highly improbable. He had only seen them the day before. He had been consuming alcohol during the day, on his account, At that hour of the night (7.30 pm) the children would normally be home settling down for the evening, the next day being a school day. The offender failed to offer any plausible explanation in evidence as to why it was that he had made the request so late in the day and so soon after the events of the previous day. His mother’s statement (Exhibit C) records that he asked her to look after the children so he could talk to Ms Hudson. There is, in my opinion, adequate support in the evidence for the Crown’s submission, and I find beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender’s request for the children to be brought to him was a ruse in order to be able to separate the victim from the children and then approach her when she was alone in the unit. 
     
      
       
      (g) The attack upon the victim 
       
      
    62 Exhibit A contains the autopsy report which states that the condition leading to death was multiple stab wounds of the trunk. At autopsy, 11 stab wounds were observed with associated injuries to the lungs, heart, major vessels and airway. There were also stab/incised wounds to the forearms, bruising with laceration to the nose and multiple bruises to the upper and lower limbs. The pathology summary also refers to several linear abrasions on the left side of the neck and bruising of the left side of the neck. 
     
      
    63 The wound depths of the various stab wounds ranged, in the case of some, between 15 and 20 millimetres, with others being 40 to 50 millimetres and a wound of 80 millimetres in depth. The nature, extent and number of wounds and other injuries to the victim have all the hallmarks of a determined and brutal attack. 
     
      
       
      Findings 
       
      
    64 On the evidence, this is not a case in which the offence simply occurred during an angry outburst in the course of a domestic dispute. The offender, initially angry at being arrested and charged, became increasingly angry and incensed when he realised on 27 June 2005 that the victim was proceeding with the AVO proceedings. Brooding in anger throughout the day, he developed and carried out a plan to separate Ms Hudson from the children and then to confront her in her unit when he knew she would be alone. 
     
      
    65 Although he denied, when it was put to him by the Crown Prosecutor, that he went to the victim’s unit to exercise power and control over her, as he had done in the past and, if necessary to kill her if she did not drop the AVO proceedings, I conclude that the evidence does support beyond reasonable doubt that he went there intending to commit violence upon her. 
     
      
    66 The evidence, in my opinion, establishes beyond reasonable doubt the following in relation to the events leading up to the victim’s murder:- 
     
      
       
      (1) On 27 June 2005, on hearing that Ms Hudson was proceeding with the proceedings to continue the apprehended violence order, the offender reacted with a high level of anger. This followed his initial anger at having been charged by police a week earlier. 
       
       
      (2) The offender retreated to the hotel, drinking and preoccupied with the events of that day in his much angered state and ruminating over the events which he considered would disrupt his access to the children. 
       
       
      (3) He determined, within hours of the order continuing the interim apprehended violence order, that he would approach the victim knowing that to do so was in breach of the AVO and bail conditions. 
      
     
     
      
      (4) The offender engaged in a calculated course of conduct involving a stratagem to have the children delivered to his mother’s home in order to separate them from the victim and then gain uninvited entry into the unit knowing that the victim would then be alone. 
       
       
      (5) That whilst in the unit with the victim, the offender embarked upon a ferocious attack whereby he intended to kill her. 
       
      
    67 The offender’s explanation for wanting to speak to the victim on 28 June 2005, namely, to try and work something out that was “going to be beneficial to everyone” is inconsistent, as earlier mentioned, with the history of the offender’s conduct towards Ms Hudson which was repeatedly marked by violence towards her and no consideration for her wishes or welfare. He conceded that he knew that the victim would be terrified of him. His deliberate actions in breaching the bail conditions and the AVO and entering the unit was the prelude to the violent course of conduct that occurred once he had gained entry. 
     
      
    68 The evidence does not establish that the offender brought the knife to the premises. For reasons he was unable to explain, after he had killed the victim, he removed his clothes, which were covered in blood, and placed them and the knife in a plastic bag. He said that he left the premises and took the bag and its contents with him in the car, which he then proceeded to drive to Coogee. His evidence was that he subsequently placed the bag and its contents in a bin, but he was unable to say where that occurred. 
     
      
       
      Pre-sentence custody 
       
      
    69 Following the offender’s arrest on 28 June 2005, bail was refused. He has, accordingly, been in custody exclusively in relation to this matter since 28 June 2005. 
     
      
    70 Section 47(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) provides that the Court must take into account any time which an offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence to which the sentence relates. 
     
      
    71 The Crown has submitted that the sentence should commence on and from 28 June 2005. I have no hesitation in accepting the Crown’s submission in this respect. 
     
      
    72 Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires the Court to take into account in determining the appropriate sentence, both aggravating and mitigating factors. 
     
      
       
      Aggravating factors 
       
       
      (a) The injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial (s.21A(2)(g)) 
       
      
    73 The Victim Impact Statement of Vicki Hudson dated 2 March 2007 was read by her. I have examined the statement and, in doing so, have regard to the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76; Regina v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [43] and Regina v King [2004] NSWCCA 444 at [171]. In accordance with established principle, I must approach my sentencing task objectively and dispassionately. However, in saying that, I do not in any way leave out of account that the dominating feature of any conviction for murder is that the person convicted has caused the death of another human being with the sad and often traumatic consequences that commonly flow from such an event. 
     
      
       
      (b) The offence was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty in relation to an offence or alleged offence: s.21A(2)(j) 
       
      
    74 The Crown submitted that the offence was especially aggravated by reason of the breach by the offender of the interim apprehended violence order. It was submitted that there was more than a failure to comply with the bail undertakings to stay away from the victim and to be of good behaviour. The breach, it was said, amounted to a deliberate and contemptuous disregard for an order of a court that resulted in the victim being attacked inside her own home at a time when she believed that she had the protection of the interim order. Both general deterrence and denunciation were said to be material factors in this respect. 
     
      
    75 The evidence establishes that the offender was fully aware of his obligations not to approach the victim at her home and that he deliberately acted in contravention of the interim apprehended violence order and in breach of the bail conditions in doing so. 
     
      
    76 On the findings which I have made and recorded earlier, the purpose for his wilful breach was to approach the victim in order to intimidate and perpetrate violence upon her. I accept the Crown’s submission that the objective seriousness of the offence is to be evaluated having regard to the fact that the offence was committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty and that this does constitute an aggravating factor and is relevant to general deterrence and denunciation of his conduct. 
     
      
       
      (c) The victim was vulnerable (s.21A(2)(l)) 
       
      
    77 Vulnerability, within the meaning of s.21A(2), arises by reason of any particular state or condition (eg, the victim was very young or very old or had a disability or because of the victim’s occupation (eg, taxi driver)). Whilst in a general sense, the victim was always vulnerable to the offender’s intimidation and violence, that is not the vulnerability to which the provision relates. This is evident from the Court of Criminal Appeal’s judgment in Regina v Williams [2005] NSWCCA 99. There, Buddin J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated that, in a case in which the sentencing judge concluded that the deceased was vulnerable upon the basis that the applicant was a powerful man who had violent tendencies, whereas the deceased did not have such characteristics, those were matters that were relevant to an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. However, it was held that it should not have been treated as a factor which further aggravated it. His Honour observed that, in any event, all victims of a homicide can be said to be vulnerable and that s.21A(2)(l) is not directed to vulnerability in the generalised sense. 
     
      
    78 The approach taken by Buddin J in Williams (supra) was confirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145 and Regina v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272. 
     
      
    79 The Crown submitted that because of the ongoing domestic violence and abuse at the hands of the offender in circumstances where she was incapable of defending herself or asserting her rights and being a woman and smaller and did not fight back, that some allowance should be made by reason of this factor. 
     
      
    80 For reasons earlier mentioned discussed, I am unable to accept that submission in this respect. 
     
      
       
      (d) The offence was part of a planned criminal activity: s.21A(2)(n) 
       
      
    81 As mentioned earlier in these remarks, the Crown submitted that the offender went to the flat with the intention of killing the deceased. His account, the Crown contended, was neither truthful nor reliable as to the events leading up to her death. 
     
      
    82 I have earlier made findings in relation to these events. I am satisfied on the evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the offender went to the victim’s unit with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm to her. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that once inside the unit, the offender formed the intention to kill Ms Hudson. Accordingly, the offender’s planning of the offence is to be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. As Davidson AJ in Regina v O’Connell [2004] NSWSC 1120 observed at [70], much depends upon what is meant by the term “premeditated” and that it does not necessarily involve long and careful planning. In that case it was determined that at some stage during the course of events leading to the death of the deceased, the offender formed the intention of killing her. In that case, as in this case, the potentiality for violence existed well prior to the commission of the offence and the offender acted on the occasion in question to give vent to that potentiality. 
     
      
       
      Plea of guilty 
       
      
    83 In passing sentence for an offence for an offender who has pleaded guilty to that offence, the Court is required to take into account the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty and when the offender pleaded guilty or indicated an intention to plead guilty and may accordingly impose a lesser sentence than it would otherwise have imposed: s.22(1), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 
     
      
    84 I have had regard to and I apply the principles stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to discounts for pleas of guilty in Regina v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. In that case, the Court of Criminal Appeal explained the reasons why a plea of guilty should attract a lower sentence. The reasons are identified, firstly, as being that the plea is a manifestation of remorse or contrition. Secondly, the plea has a utilitarian value to the efficiency of the criminal justice system. Thirdly, in particular cases, there can be a particular value in avoiding the need to call witnesses, especially victims, to give evidence. 
     
      
    85 However, although the range for a discount for a plea on sentence is 10 to 25%, an early plea does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that a discount of 25% must be given. It is true that a plea of guilty to a charge of murder is a very significant matter to be taken into account. On the other hand, Regina v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286, Howie J (Tobias JA and Shaw J agreeing) stated at [28]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is nothing in  
        Thomson & Houlton 
         that required his Honour to give a discount of twenty-five percent simply for the utilitarian aspect of the plea standing alone, particularly, where there would have been nothing complex about the issues in the trial had it proceeded. The only matter that appears to have been in dispute on the first count in the indictment was the intention to murder. It has to be emphasised, once again, that the range of discounts referred to in the guideline judgment is a guideline. It creates no presumption of, or entitlement to, a particular discount in a given situation.” 
        
       
      
    86 The facts of this matter are such that there was highly incriminating evidence and it can be said that there would have been nothing complex about the issues had the matter proceeded as a defended trial. 
     
      
    87 In all the circumstances, I consider that an appropriate discount for the offender’s early plea of guilty is 20%. 
     
      
       
      Remorse 
       
      
    88 Pleas of guilty are often taken as evidence of remorse. Certainly they are consistent with remorse, but as has been observed, given the discount available for pleas, they are often inspired, in whole or in part, by an accused making the best of a bad situation. In Regina v Reid [2005] NSWSC 230, Hulme J at [86] made such a point. As there stated, remorse is not necessarily the most probable inference or justified from the fact of a plea standing on its own. 
     
      
    89 The offender has expressed his remorse and contrition in his evidence. I, however, have regard to the extent to which he has not been completely forthcoming either with police or in his evidence as to precisely what occurred prior to stabbing the victim. I also have in mind the statement made in the pre-sentence report:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst Mr Robinson appeared to provide various self-reflective insights into his offending behaviour, and offered what may constitute a degree of plausible victim insight/empathy, this Service is ambivalent at this juncture regarding the offender’s thorough level of awareness and acceptance of his action. Such speculation is noted, given Mr Robinson’s claims that he possessed minimal recall pertaining to his attack upon the victim (and its incumbent ferocity), albeit appear incapable of recalling other detailed facets of information leading up to the offence, irrespective of alcohol impairment …” 
        
       
      
    90 I consider in all the circumstances that the offender has established that he is remorseful for his crime, to some extent, but that his expressions of remorse are qualified by the fact that he has, in my assessment, refrained from a full disclosure and acknowledgment of the events immediately preceding his attack upon the victim. 
     
      
    91 I, accordingly, do give some, but limited, weight to his evidence given of remorse in determining the sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
       
      Rehabilitation 
       
      
    92 In relation to the question of rehabilitation, there is no clear affirmative statement whereby one could comfortably make any forecast or assessment. I have previously referred to the offender’s good conduct and constructive activities whilst in custody. Those are favourable matters that provide some prospect of the offender being rehabilitated, although it is difficult to say to what extent. No doubt, following release, his conduct will be very much dependent upon the extent to which he can control alcohol and substance abuse and his ability to control his anger and impulsive tendencies. I have, however, had regard to the favourable matters which do support some prospect of rehabilitation. Beyond this, it would be sheer speculation to suggest that the probabilities of successful rehabilitation are heavily in his favour. 
     
      
       
      Subjective factors 
       
      
    93 Dr Bruce Westmore saw the offender on two occasions. In his report of 29 November 2006, he records that the offender first saw a psychologist in 1997 for depression and again in 2001 and 2002. His general practitioner in 2005 treated him with an antidepressant. The history was that the offender had suffered from depression since his teenage years and that he had tried to deal with it by using alcohol and drugs. The history also records that he was admitted to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in 1999 suffering anxiety. 
     
      
    94 The offender began to consume alcohol aged 16 years and a history of alcohol abuse followed. Dr Westmore recorded that he did not receive any medical treatment for his alcohol abuse problem. He commenced using cannabis around the age of 17 before abusing a wide range of illicit drugs. 
     
      
    95 The history records that his parents separated and he left home at the age of 17. He stated that he had only started speaking to his father again within the last three years. 
     
      
    96 The offender was educated to Year 10 standard, obtaining the School Certificate. He repeated that year. He worked as a storeman for 12 months then at a hotel in Kings Cross and than on and off at an RSL Club and thereafter undertook unskilled labouring/factory work. 
     
      
    97 At the time of examination, Dr Westmore did not think that he was suffering from a major depressive illness and there were no psychotic symptoms identified. He recorded that he had a history of depression and appears to have suffered a mood disturbance and that his mood state was more of an adjustment type disorder. 
     
      
    98 Dr Westmore records the psychological and psychiatric problems experienced over the years by the offender and their contribution towards interpersonal conflicts. Depression, anger and drug and alcohol abuse would have complicated his psychiatric problems and caused a further deterioration in interpersonal relationships. 
     
      
    99 A lengthy psychological report (Exhibit 2) was prepared by Ms Madelaine, psychologist and Fenia Kaufman, regional senior psychologist dated 23 February 2007. This report provides a detailed history, although certain aspects of the account given by the offender are not consistent with his evidence. He was assessed as a person of high average intelligence. 
     
      
    100 The report (Exhibit 2) records that the offender has had no record of institutional misconduct or charges since he has been in custody. His work in the prison has been regarded as extremely satisfactory. Reference is also made to the various courses which the offender has completed whilst in custody, including alcohol and drug awareness programmes and specified workshop courses. He has also undertaken individual counselling sessions in relation to strategies to avoid drug use. He has also accessed education services whilst in custody and completed a number of courses and has attended sessions for stress management and other matters. Nine certificates in relation to these course were tendered and constitute Exhibit 5. 
     
      
    101 I have had regard to the letters written by the Reverend Paul Drury dated 30 November 2006 (Exhibit 3) and that written by Mr Ian Mitchell from Parklea Correctional Centre dated 27 November 2006 (Exhibit 4). It should be acknowledged that the offender’s attitude and conduct in custody has, according to Exhibit 3 and 4, been exemplary. 
     
      
       
      The standard non-parole period 
       
      
    102 The offender’s state of mind is of central relevance in the determination as to whether or not the offence is appropriately characterised as one falling within the mid-range for the purposes of the standard non-parole period provisions in Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. A plea of guilty might, in itself, however, provide a reason for departing from the standard non-parole period. Accordingly, I have used the standard non-parole period as one reference point in the exercise of my sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    103 The standard non-parole period for an offence of murder under the table in Part 4, Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is 20 years. That represents the non-parole period of an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of murder and assessment of all relevant facts requires a determination as to whether or not the standard non-parole period is to be applied as a guidepost or benchmark or if it is to be so taken, to determine whether it falls above or below that middle range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    104 Whatever quantity of alcohol the offender had consumed on 18 June 2005, though it may have played a part in his action, I do not consider that its degree was such that the offender’s culpability is moderated by reason of his intoxication. He was clearly intent upon the course of action of confronting the victim and whatever effect the alcohol had on him did not prevent him from planning and carrying out the brutal attack. 
     
      
    105 In determining the objective seriousness of the offence, I have regard to the brutal, callous and cowardly act of the offender made against a much smaller and defenceless woman preceded by a degree of planning, as I have described it earlier. 
     
      
    106 The nature of the wounds inflicted upon the victim as I have described them, of itself, is indicative of the ferocity of the attack, although it does not contain the element as has arisen in some cases of added gratuitous cruelty added to the basic ingredients of the offence as committed. 
     
      
    107 Finally, I have also taken into account the fact that an aggravating factor was that the offender was on conditional liberty in relation to the charges that he had assaulted the victim. The offence is also aggravated by his wilful disregard of the interim apprehended violence order. 
     
      
       
      Deterrence 
       
      
    108 In evaluating the appropriate sentence, the Court must consider the issue of deterrence, including general deterrence. The Crown has submitted that the objective facts and subjective matters call for a strong element of deterrence. There can be no question but that public deterrence in relation to the offence of murder is a most significant matter to be borne in mind and taken into account in determining sentence. The offence in question occurred against a background of domestic violence, a tragic fact that occurs far too often these days. 
     
      
       
      Other matters 
       
      
    109 The offender does not have any record of convictions and, accordingly, that also is a matter to be taken into account in the offender’s favour. 
     
      
    110 In relation to the assault and malicious damage offences for which the offender stood charged at the time of the offence and which are detailed in MFI 2 and which have been transferred to this Court pursuant to s.166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, are, as requested by the Crown Prosecutor, to be dismissed on the basis that there is no longer any available evidence to prosecute them. I accordingly dismiss them. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    111 Murder has always been the most serious crime in the criminal calendar. Absent extraordinary circumstances, it calls for a substantial sentence by way of imprisonment to serve the interests of punishment, including denunciation and general deterrence. However, the objective seriousness of offences of murder is to be assessed within the relevant range. 
     
      
    112 I have been referred to a schedule of sentencing decisions in what sometimes have been referred to as relationship murder cases. Some of them involved sentencing after trial, some after pleas of guilty and some preceding and post-dating the standard non-parole period provisions to which I have referred. I have examined the sentencing remarks in many of those cases, including those to which Mr Turnbull drew my attention, making due allowance for their individual facts and circumstances of those cases and the present. 
     
      
    113 Section 19A of the Crimes Act provides that a person convicted of murder is liable to imprisonment for life. However, as earlier noted, that is not suggested as being appropriate in this case. It is reserved for cases which can be properly described as within a worst category. For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the gradations which the law recognises, I observe that premeditated murders committed simply for financial gain or carried out with great cruelty or which involve not one but multiple murders are the type of case or cases that fall into the worst category. The offence in this case did not fall into that category and is to be judged against a somewhat imprecise standard of criminality. 
     
      
    114 The purposes of punishment include, in addition to general and specific deterrence, the rehabilitation of the offender, protection of the community and retribution. I have already referred to the importance of emphasising deterrence in the context of domestic violence in which usually females are subjected to a history of violence before a catastrophic event such as murder occurs. 
     
      
    115 In the present offence, there are few factors which would indicate leniency is required in terms of the objective seriousness or criminality involved in the offence. 
     
      
    116 I am required by the terms of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to fix a non-parole period being the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence. The sentence which I have determined has been arrived at with allowance being made for the 20% discount for his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    117 The statute requires that the balance of term of the sentence must not exceed one third of the non-parole period unless there are special circumstances for it being greater. Mr Turnbull submitted that being the first time in custody for the offender and by reason of the prospects of rehabilitation, there is a need for enhanced supervision. However I do not consider that this is a case in which there is a basis upon which there can be said that the offender should be subjected to a longer period of supervision than he will need under the statutory ratio. I, accordingly, decline to find special circumstances and impose a balance of term to which I shall refer. 
     
      
    118 Dalley Stuart Robinson, for the murder of Kelly Lorraine Hudson, I sentence you to a non-parole period of 16 years to commence on 28 June 2005 and to expire on 27 June 2021. The balance of your term of imprisonment will be five years, expiring on 27 June 2026, a total sentence of 21 years. 
     
      
    119 The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 27 June 2021.

      2007/11984 Attorney General for the State of NSW v Keith Jamieson  
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: By summons filed in this Court the Attorney General, as plaintiff, seeks orders against the defendant, Keith Jamieson, under the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006. These include an order under s17 of the Act for his continued detention for five years or, alternatively, an order under s9 for his extended supervision for the same period. In the immediate term, however, the Attorney sought an interim detention order under s16 or an interim supervision order under s8.  
     
      
    2 That interim application was before me two days ago, on 9 May 2007. It was made because the expiry of the sentences which the defendant is currently serving was imminent, that is, today. Yesterday, I made an interim order for the detention of the defendant for 7 days from today. These are my reasons for that decision. 
     
      
    3 The defendant, who was represented before me, does not dispute that he is a sex offender to whom the Act applies: see the definition of “sex offender” in s4 and of “serious sex offence” in s5. He did not oppose an interim supervision order for the period sought, that is, 28 days. However, the Attorney pressed his application for an interim detention order, also for 28 days.  
     
      
    4 The legislation, of course, is recent. I was referred in argument to two previous applications for interim orders which have been decided by this Court. In Attorney General v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340, McClellan CJ at CL made an interim detention order. In Attorney General v Tillman [2007] NSWSC 356, Hoeben J declined to make an interim detention order but did make an interim supervision order. The Attorney appealed against Hoeben J’s decision, and the Court of Appeal set that decision aside and made an interim detention order. The Court’s reasons have yet to be published. 
     
      
    5 The machinery of the Act and the policy behind it were examined by McClellan CJ at CL in Gallagher at [20]-[41], and by Hoeben J in Tillman at [7]-[17]. To their Honours’ observations I should add those of Hall J in a decision handed down on 9 May 2007, after I heard argument in the present application: Attorney General v Quinn [2007] NSWSC 456 at [8]–[25]. I need not repeat what their Honours said, but for the purposes of the present application it is necessary to refer to some relevant provisions.  
     
      
    6 By s9 this Court is empowered to make an extended supervision order, but it may do so only if it is satisfied “to a high degree of probability” that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision: subs(2). Provision for the making of continuing detention orders is to be found in s17. By s17(1), on an application for a continuing detention order the Court may make that order or, instead, an extended supervision order. A continuing detention order may be made only if the Court is satisfied, again to a high degree of probability, that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order: subs(3). 
     
      
    7 Sections 9 and 17, of course, deal with final orders. The present application for an interim detention order is brought under s16(1), which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) If, in proceedings on an application for a continuing detention order, it appears to the Supreme Court; 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that the offender’s current custody will expire before the proceedings are determined, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or extended supervision order, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        the Supreme Court may make an order for the interim detention of the offender. 
        
       
      
    8 The expression “supporting documentation” is defined in s4. For present purposes, it means the material supplied to me by the Attorney in this application. Clearly, for the purpose of subs(1)(a), the defendant’s current custody would have expired before the proceedings on the application for a continuing detention order could be determined. Of importance, however, are the terms of subs(1)(b). As I have said, s17(3) provides that a final continuing detention order cannot be made unless the Court is satisfied that adequate supervision of the offender would not be provided by an extended supervision order. However, the effect of s16(1)(b) is that an interim detention order may be made if it appears that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, on their face, justify the making either of a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order.  
     
      
    9 As McClellan CJ at CL observed in Gallagher at [45], an application such as this must be approached upon the assumption that the matters in the supporting documentation are proved, with the result that “there is little or no opportunity for the defendant to bring evidence or test the evidence of the Attorney General”. No evidence was led by the defendant in the present application.  
     
      
    10 If the test in s16(1)(b) is satisfied, the question remains whether the expression “may make an order” in the subsection leaves the Court with a residual discretion to refuse the application. That, I am told, was argued before the Court of Appeal in Tillman. Hall J did not find it necessary to resolve the question in Quinn: see the judgment at [21]. As will be seen, nor did I. 
     
      
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    11 The central question which I had to determine was whether the material before me is capable of satisfying the test for a continuing detention order under s17 or an extended supervision order under s9. Both sections set out, effectively in the same terms, a series of matters which the Court must consider in applying that test: see ss17(4) and 9(3). Those matters fell to be examined in the light of the evidence, to which I now turn.  
     
      
    12 The defendant has completed an aggregate sentence of ten-and-a-half years, dating from 13 November 1996, for a series of sexual offences committed against boys or youths of ages ranging from nine to seventeen. There is no need to list the offences. It is sufficient to say that they embraced a variety of sexual activity, including anal penetration. Some were committed over a period between 1981 and 1983, but most were committed between 1988 and 1996. In relation to two of the victims, the offences charged were representative of a wider pattern of abuse.  
     
      
    13 The defendant enticed his victims into sexual activity by what is referred to in the psychological reports before me as “grooming” behaviour. He met and befriended them through his association with a Christian church, he afforded them hospitality, he showed them pornographic magazines and videos, and frequently he plied them with alcohol or drugs.  
     
      
    14 In 1973 he was convicted of offences of indecent assault male and buggery, with two further offences of a similar kind taken into account on a schedule, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. The offences had been committed earlier in that year, and the victim was a fourteen- year-old youth. In 1986 he was sentenced to imprisonment for a charge of committing an act of indecency with a person under sixteen years of age. This offence was committed shortly before he was dealt with, the victim was thirteen years old, and he had supplied the youth with alcohol and drugs. 
     
      
    15 In 1988 he was convicted of a charge of soliciting a male for an indecent act, and yet again sentenced to a term of imprisonment. That offence had been committed in the previous year. He had asked a fifteen-year-old youth, whom he had known for several years and to whom he had offered alcohol and marijuana on a number of occasions, to engage in sexual activity with him. The offence was committed while he was on parole for the sentence imposed in 1986. Similarly, some of the offences leading to his current sentence were committed while he was on parole for the sentences imposed in 1986 and 1988.  
     
      
    16 He has also been convicted of other offences, which are not particularly serious and which I do not consider material for present purposes. He was eligible for release on parole in respect of his present aggregate sentence in November 2005, but has remained in custody.  
     
      
    17 He is fifty-six years old. He was born in England and came to this country when he was twenty. He is not an Australian citizen and may well be deported when he is able to be released. That is a matter to which I shall return. He was married in his early twenties, but his homosexual activity put an end to that relationship.  
     
      
    18 I had before me material from three psychologists: a risk assessment report by Ms Kristy Murphy, employed by the Department of Corrective Services, a report of Ms Jenny Howell, a private practitioner, and an affidavit of Dr Roger Blake, now in private practice but formerly employed by Australasian Correctional Management at Junee Correctional Centre. Dr Blake had contact with the defendant in 1999 and 2000 in the course of two sex offender programs, to which I shall refer in a moment. Ms Murphy, whose comprehensive report was prepared for these proceedings, had a lengthy interview with him in December 2006. She also had access to a volume of background material, including psychiatric and psychological reports presented to the court in the proceedings which led to his present sentence. Ms Howell has not interviewed the defendant, but she supplied a report in response to certain questions put to her by the State Crown solicitor on behalf of the Attorney.  
     
      
    19 Dr Blake was involved at Junee in two programs known as SORT (Sex Offender Redirection Training) and NETT SORT (“NETT” standing for Normalisation, Education, Treatment and Training). The defendant participated in a preparatory psycho-educational treatment program known as Pre-SORT, as an introduction to the NETT SORT program. The latter was an extensive seventeen weeks program, which the defendant completed. It seems that his response was satisfactory. In April 2000 he was supplied with a certificate of graduation in the program, in which Dr Blake expressed pleasure in seeing “the new and positive Keith emerge, whereby defensiveness and negativity could be challenged”. The doctor also observed that he was prepared to see his victim “as a victim” and to relinquish the “relationships status” to which he had previously clung. 
     
      
    20 Using the statistical test known as STATIC-99, Dr Blake assessed the risk of the defendant’s re-offending as medium to high. For that reason, he considered that he needed the additional treatment provided by the familiar program known as CUBIT (Custody Based Intensive Treatment). The defendant was willing to participate in that program, and in July 2001 he was placed on the waiting list for it. Dr Blake’s letter of referral to the program noted that the defendant “does display reasonable insight into his cycle of offending and has shown a real commitment within treatment”. 
     
      
    21 There, it seems, the matter rested for the best part of three years. Whether that is because of the length of the waiting list or for some other reason does not appear from the material. In March 2004 the defendant told another psychologist that he was willing to undertake the CUBIT program provided it did not extend into his parole period. However, when he was finally offered a place in July of that year he declined it. He wrote in a prescribed form that he was waiting to see if further charges against him arising from events many years ago might be laid and, for that reason, did not wish to take a place that someone else might have. He added that he would undertake the program after Christmas “if still here”. No further charges were laid at that time but, as will be seen, fresh charges have been laid recently. 
     
      
    22 In the following year he did not seek reconsideration for the program, although he was told that he would need to “re-refer” if he wished to participate in it. On two occasions in late 2005 the Parole Authority considered his release on parole but refused it. His declining to participate in CUBIT was given as one of the reasons for refusal on the first occasion, and appears to have been relevant to the second refusal. He was later noted by his case management team to be unwilling to do sex offender programs and resigned to serving the whole of his sentence. In his interview with Ms Murphy, he told her that he believed he had participated in enough sex offending treatment and that the CUBIT program would not teach him “anything different”.  
     
      
    23 In applying the STATIC-99 test, which is an actuarial risk assessment, Ms Murphy had regard to his long history of sexual offending, the nature of the offences, and the fact that some were committed while subject to conditional liberty. She placed him in the “high risk category relative to other adult male sexual offenders”. She also considered a number of dynamic risk factors, that is, matters peculiar to the defendant.  
     
      
    24 She observed that he suffers from “intimacy deficits”, that is, an emotional identification with children and a limited capacity to relate to adults. She noted that he had had no contact with his family for many years, and that he has few adult friends. He was able to identify only two friends who might support him upon his release, one of those an untreated child sex offender.  
     
      
    25 She referred to what she described as his “distorted attitudes”. While acknowledging that he appeared to have developed some sense of responsibility for his sexual offending, she found that he displayed “limited understanding of the harm caused to the victims”, that he still appeared to view children as “sexually inquisitive”, and that he believed that his “grooming” attempts were generally successful only with victims who were “curious”. Under the heading “General Self Regulation”, she found that his plans for his lifestyle upon his release were “vague” and displayed “limited understanding of anticipated difficulties”. Noting that he had chosen not to participate in CUBIT, she concluded that he had “not provided himself with the opportunity to rectify his problematic behaviours or to formulate meaningful and effective self-management plans to manage his risk in the future”.  
     
      
    26 Finally, in considering “sexual self-regulation”, she noted his “strong history” of sexual preoccupation and sexually inappropriate behaviour, together with his “use of sex as a coping strategy”. He told her that he no longer viewed sex as a “core component of his life” and that, in particular, his thoughts and fantasies about his victims and about children generally had reduced. However, he also said that “he was not very interested in establishing an appropriate and intimate sexual relationship upon release.” 
     
      
    27 She wrote:  
     
      
       
        
        Whilst Mr Jamieson reported that he longer engages in deviant sexual fantasies, he is not sexually pre-occupied and no longer uses sex as a coping strategy, the likelihood of such a significant change occurring, given the limited treatment Mr Jamieson has received, is questionable. 
        
       
      
    28 Her conclusion was as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        Previous methods of supervising Mr Jamieson in the community have proven unsuccessful in preventing him from sexually reoffending. Mr Jamieson has consistently refused to enter treatment which is specific to his sexual offending behaviour and which is appropriate for his high level of risks/needs. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Jamieson’s risk may be managed or reduced if he were to agree to participate in a suitable treatment program so as to allow him to identify the risk factors associated with his sexual offending behaviour, formulate meaningful and effective management strategies and to allow for the practice of these strategies. In custody, CUBIT offers a treatment program appropriate to Mr Jamieson’s high risk/needs. Currently, there are no community based treatment programs of sufficient intensity which could expect to meet Mr Jamieson’s high risk/needs. Participation in such treatment programs is voluntary and Mr Jamieson would need to consent to participate. 
        
       
      
    29 It is not necessary to refer in any detail to the report of Ms Howell. After examining relevant Corrective Services material, she arrived at much the same conclusion as Ms Murphy. The dynamic risk factors led her to find that the defendant “continues to require treatment for his sexual offending behaviour, and has not yet developed adequate strategies to manage his risk in the community”. She saw it as desirable that he complete the CUBIT program, noting that there are no funded programs of that intensity available in the community. The alternative, she wrote, would be individual treatment with an accredited sex offender counsellor during an extended period of post release supervision, but she added that it was difficult “to provide the intensity of treatment that Mr Jamieson appears to require”.  
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    30 I have had the benefit of written submissions, developed orally, by the Crown Advocate, Mr Babb and Ms Mitchelmore of counsel, for the Attorney, and oral submissions by Mr Cook, counsel for the defendant. As I have said, it is necessary for the material produced by the Attorney to address the matters set out in sections 17(4) and 9(3) of the Act. Those relevant to this interim application are: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the safety of the community,  
         
        …  
        
       
       
        
         
        (c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         (e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,  
         
         
        (f) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,  
        
       
       
        
        … 
         
         
        (h) the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
    31 Clearly, all those matters have been addressed. The basal consideration is the first of them, the safety of the community. As is spelt out in ss9 and 17, a final order for continued detention or extended supervision requires proof “to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence …”. The standard of proof encompassed by those words was examined briefly by McClellan CJ at CL in Gallagher at [33]-[36], and by Hall J in Quinn at [24]-[25]. I need say no more than that it appears to be a high standard, although falling short of the criminal standard, appropriate for the gravity of the matter at issue, that is, the detention or supervision in the community of a man whose sentence has expired: cf Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336 per Dixon J (as he then was) at 361 – 2. 
     
      
    32 As I have said, by s16(1)(b) the question to be decided in the present application was whether the material before me, untested and unrebutted, could meet that standard of proof. Clearly, it could. As Hoeben J observed in Tillman at [16], the test on an interim application is “similar to the requirement for a prima facie case to be made out in committal proceedings”.  
     
      
    33 In so saying, I am mindful of the fact that the preponderance of the material I have is the expert evidence of psychologists. In proceedings for a final order evidence of that kind would be valuable but, most likely, would not be determinative of the question to be decided. No doubt, there would be additional evidence, perhaps from the defendant himself, perhaps from other experts. The reports I have leave unanswered questions such as the effect upon the likelihood of the defendant’s re-offending of his more advanced age and his lengthy period of incarceration. However, as Mr Babb pointed out in argument, there is nothing before me touching on matters of that kind. Nor, it seems, could there be. I have had no choice but to decide this interim application on the limited material I have.  
     
      
    34 There is nothing to suggest that the long delay between the defendant’s referral to CUBIT and his being offered a place in the program is attributable to any conduct on his part. If that is so, it is most disturbing. More importantly, it is regrettable that an intensive course such as CUBIT is not available to the defendant in the community. (One wonders whether he would maintain his opposition to such a program if it were.) That, however, is not a matter germane to my decision, for the reasons articulated by McClellan CJ at CL in Gallagher at [77].  
     
      
    35 Mr Cook submitted that I should not make an interim detention order unless I was persuaded that it was the only option, and that the community would not be adequately protected by an interim supervision order. He referred to s17(3) of the Act, and the decision of Hasluck J in Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia v Mangolamara [2007] WASC 71 at [178] ff. That was an application for a continued detention order or a supervision order under the Dangerous Sexual Offenders Act 2006 (WA). What Hasluck J there said is valuable but, putting aside the fact that his Honour was considering different legislation from that with which I am concerned, he was dealing with an application for a final order. An interim detention order had previously been made by Blaxell J: [2006] WASC 172.  
     
      
    36 As I have said, an interim detention order may be made under s16(1)(b) where the Attorney’s material, if proved, would justify the making of a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order. In any event, the fact that the form of treatment said to be most appropriate for the defendant is not available outside the prison system is a matter of concern, although that does not necessarily mean that he could not effectively be supervised in the community. Mr Cook put no other discretionary matter, such as delay, in opposition to an order. 
     
      
    37 All that said, it is in the light of very recent developments that I decided that a short interim detention order was appropriate. As I have said, when I heard argument two days ago I was informed that the defendant is likely to be deported upon his release. That position was confirmed yesterday but, in addition, counsel became aware only then that he has recently been charged with further sexual offences. These may well be the charges which he foreshadowed in 2004. 
     
      
    38 I took the view that, interim detention being available on the evidence, a period of 7 days was desirable and would allow further information about the defendant’s position to be gleaned. If fresh charges are to proceed, the question of bail will arise. He would not oppose deportation and, if the charges do not proceed, it seems that he would be promptly returned to his country of origin.  
     
      
    39 Mr Babb submitted that I should, nevertheless, make an interim detention order for the period of 28 days sought by the Attorney. He noted that, by s19(1) of the Act, such an order could be varied or revoked in the light of developments. However, I was unwilling to make an order of such significance in circumstances where it might prove unnecessary. I directed that the matter be listed before me on Thursday next, 17 May, to review the situation and entertain any further application which might be made.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Sylla Robillard appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to an offence of importing a border controlled drug, namely cocaine at a quantity which was a marketable quantity. He was detected at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport by customs officers. Strapped to his leg was a bag of cocaine. It weighed in total close to a kilogram, with the pure weight of cocaine later found to be about three-quarters of a kilogram. It is a substantial package with a substantial value.2 The offender co-operated with officers in that he allowed them to search him. He must have known at that stage that the package would be discovered and that he would be spending a considerable time in prison. The offender is a Canadian citizen who lives in Montreal. He flew from Montreal to Vancouver with the drugs in his possession and thence to Australia.3 It is a matter of interest, but not a determinative in any way of the sentence I will impose, that this is the second occasion this week that this court has been asked to deal with a Canadian citizen living in Montreal, importing cocaine into Australia via Vancouver. As I said it is a matter of interest only and has not affected the sentence that I will impose in the present case.4 The offender said that he got involved in this offence, despite being a man with no prior convictions, in order to satisfy a debt that was owed by a friend of his, that debt having been incurred because of his friend’s gambling and drug use. The offender claims that he decided to fly to Australia, bringing the drugs with him, in order to pay off his friend’s debt to drug dealers. I simply do not accept what the offender has said to me. It is on him to establish, on the balance of probabilities, any circumstances of mitigation. So if he wants me to sentence him on the basis that he did this for an altruistic purpose, only to protect his friend, then he has to prove that to my satisfaction on the balance of probabilities. I do not accept what he has said.5 There is no mention to Ms Collins the psychologist, about this being the reason he got involved in the offence. Mr Robillard said that he wasn’t asked about it by Ms Collins, but in her report this appears under the heading “offence”: “Mr Robillard agrees with the police facts, he states that his involvement in the offence was not well thought out. He expresses regret for his conduct and he advised that he realises he did not consider the likely ramification of his actions at that time.” In such circumstances I find it very difficult to accept that there was not the opportunity for the offender to provide information to Ms Collins regarding what it was which motivated him to commit this offence.6 I further note that not one of the many references tendered to me makes any mention of this circumstance. And finally the offender had no satisfactory explanation as to why his friend could not obtain a passport to fly to Australia, to do what the offender said he took it upon himself to later do.7 However there is no material before me to establish that the offender was in any way a principal. It is notorious that those who are principals in drug importation endeavours never, or at least very rarely, get themselves in a position where they are in physical contact with drugs. The result is that I must sentence the offender for what he has done. I cannot put a label on him, I cannot say that he is a mere courier, although I am satisfied that he is not a principal.8 The offence is a very serious one. The authorities referred to by the crown, and many others, make it clear that the community is rightfully concerned about those who involve themselves in drug importations, because it is the community which has to bear the brunt of the consequences of drug use and drug addiction. For that reason, those who contemplate bringing drugs into Australia must be made aware that they will spend a long time in custody if they are detected doing so.9 As I mentioned the offender is a Canadian citizen. He will thus be serving his sentence in a foreign country. He has received since his incarceration only one visit when a friend of his was passing through Australia. Any other visits from family or friends are likely to be rare, if not nonexistent. In particular, it is unlikely that he will receive a visit from his fourteen year old daughter. This will mean that the offender is doing his time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. Another factor suggesting that matter is that he knows that through his criminal activities, he has put his fourteen year old daughter in a position where she is denied his care and attention for a lengthy period of time. Of course not too much can be made of this because, after all, Mr Robillard went in to this with his eyes open. He cannot be surprised to learn that having been detected as a drug importer, thus will be serving his sentence in a foreign country and he will not be able to have the sort of contact that he had with his daughter as he did previously.10 The offender works in a number of occupations in Montreal. He is a musician primarily and as I think I have mentioned already, has no previous criminal convictions. The references tendered to me attest to his otherwise good character. Family, friends and employers all suggest that this offence is out of character. The offender acknowledges that he was involved in drug use and no doubt this was one of the significant factors which led to him committing this offence.11 The offender expresses regret for his actions. I am not entirely sure that this is genuine remorse. My doubts are due to the story, which I am satisfied is a false story, presented by the offender to both the Probation and Parole officer and in court today. No doubt the offender is remorseful for having being caught, but I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he is remorseful in the sense that he recognises that what he did was wrong. He may recognise that it was against the law, but I am not satisfied that he recognises that he should not have done it for any other reason. I note that the offender pleaded guilty at an early opportunity. His willingness to facilitate the course of justice will be recognised by an appropriate discount for pleading guilty at an early stage. Of course the circumstances in which he was detected as a drug importer mean that the plea of guilty says nothing about any remorse. The offender is not entitled to call upon his plea of guilty in such circumstances as suggesting remorse.12 I should have mentioned of course when talking about the offender’s daughter, that the fact that she is denied the offender’s close contact whilst he is in custody is a matter that I will take in to account as part of the general mix of subjective factors. It is certainly not exceptional, but the current way that the Court of Criminal Appeal approaches such matters, is to say that I am able to take it in to account, to a limited extent. I will do so.13 Despite what I have said about the offender’s version of events and his lack of genuine remorse, I am satisfied that there are good prospects of rehabilitation. Indeed I am satisfied that the fact that the offender is going to spend a lengthy period in custody will play its part in personally deterring Mr Robillard from any further criminal activity, at least as serious as that for which he is now to be sentenced.14 The sentence to be imposed upon the offender has to reflect the objective gravity of his conduct. That is a fundamental rule in sentencing. Notwithstanding the offender’s lack of previous criminal convictions and notwithstanding the other matters that I have referred to earlier, a significant period of custody is required.15 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of four and a half years and a head sentence of seven and a half years. It commenced on 7 December 2006. The offender is therefore eligible to be released to parole on 6 June 2011.16 HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Robillard what I have just done is imposed a period of imprisonment upon you. You will have to serve at least four and a half years in custody, commencing on the date of your arrest which was 7 December 2006. That means you are eligible to be released to parole on 6 June 2011. Of course if you continue the good conduct that you have displayed whilst in gaol, that will be a significant factor suggesting that you are likely to be released on that date.17 Once you are released on that date you in all likelihood will be deported, but you will continue to serve your sentence until seven and a half years have expired, and if you were to commit further offences or otherwise not be of good behaviour, it is entirely possible that you will be returned back to custody to serve more of your sentence. Do you understand that?18 OFFENDER: I do.

    SENTENCE1 There is no dispute to the facts Karla Burrows robbed a sixty-five year old woman, Ms Isabella Roberts, of eighty dollars in cash, her credit cards and a number of personal items contained in her black purse. At the time of that robbery Karla Burrows was armed with an offensive weapon, namely a kitchen knife. Ms Roberts was using a walking stick as she made her way along Chester Hill Road heading towards Bass Hill. In committing this criminal conduct, Karla Burrows has exposed herself to a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment.2 Today she is before the Court to be held accountable for her actions. As matters are panning out, that may be a process, rather than an event. The process will be one of what is called “enforced rehabilitation”, see The Queen v Griffith (1977) 137 CLR 293 per Barwick CJ. No sentencing exercise is easy, in this case there are clear tensions, the offence had a significant level of violence, appears to have had rudimentary planning, and the victim selected was alone and apparently frail.3 Objectively the guideline judgment of Henry (R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 340) postulates a starting point of four years imprisonment for armed robbers as a general proposition. Realistically a robbery having the factual matrix of this robbery would normally call for a starting point of at least four years imprisonment. I shall come to the facts shortly. However the offender appears to have made remarkable progress in rehabilitating herself and in particular in addressing causal factors in her conduct. I will return to that topic later in these remarks.4 I note she has been assessed as suitable for periodic detention. Were I assured of her rehabilitation [if the rehabilitation was as truly extraordinary as the initial evidence suggests] it would become a serious option open. Put shortly, however, that is the difficulty. The Court presently has impressive evidence of rehabilitation only for a period of ten or so weeks against a long, entrenched history of drug abuse. The duration of the drug-free period, her absence of a suitable income stream and employment, however are real worries. It is these tensions that need addressing in these remarks.FACTS5 At about 10am on 12 April 2006 Miss Isabella Roberts aged sixty-five was walking along Chester Hill Road towards Bass Hill. As she walked, she felt the accused beside her. At the same time she heard the accused say in a very firm voice, “Give me your bag”. Miss Roberts started to fumble through her bag to get her purse out. She was scared and started crying. She said to the accused, “Please, I will give you the money, please wait”. The accused’s unsympathetic response was, “Give me the money or else I’ll stab you.”6 Miss Roberts looked down towards the accused person’s stomach area and saw she was holding a kitchen knife with both hands. Miss Roberts became very scared, continued to search her bag for money. The accused grabbed the bag’s strap and tried to cut that with a knife. While doing this, the accused said, “I’ll cut the bag”, Miss Roberts’ response was, “Don’t do that”.7 The accused tried to pull the bag from Miss Roberts and Miss Roberts resisted by pulling back. She said, “I’ll give you the money” and removed her purse from her bag. At some time during the struggle, Miss Roberts fell to the ground, hitting her head on the concrete. The accused, on top of Miss Roberts, continued to tug at the bag. The accused managed to grab a black purse from Miss Roberts’ hand, she started running away. 8 Miss Roberts was able to get up and see the accused mount a bicycle and take off. Miss Roberts had eighty dollars in cash in her purse, a number of credit cards, and other items. A lady, Jade Abbott on a bus, who knew the accused, saw the elderly Asian lady attacked by the accused.9 Initially, the accused denied any involvement in the robbery; but eventually admitted to committing it. She told the police that the victim had fallen over, and she took off. The accused told police the lady fell over; she went to open her bag and she tripped. The accused’s account to police was that the lady stumbled on her own feet, causing her to fall. The accused said whilst the lady was on the ground, she grabbed her purse from her hand and ran. She denied carrying the knife.10 The relevance of that material is that it seeks to minimise the criminality of the accused, a not unnatural response, but one that would impede her rehabilitation. One has to acknowledge fully the problems that one is facing, including the quantity of criminality involved if one is to rehabilitate effectively. It is a matter that I must consider when choosing a rehabilitation path for the accused.11 On 17 January this year, the accused wrote a letter to the victim. It would appear this option was raised by her legal advisors. Even so, it is an option she pursued. What she wrote is this 
     
      
      “I am writing to you to express my deepest apologies for what I have done. Not only to you but also to your family. I understand that my apology could not possibly take away the pain and fear I’ve placed upon you by my actions. I would like to take the opportunity to explain my actions that day. This is not an excuse and will never excuse my actions. I have made some very wrong decisions in my life, the first being my choice to become involved in drugs which led me to my assault on you.  
      
     
     
      
      I have learnt the hard way that my choice to use the drug ICE has come very close to destroying my life. It also caused my children not to have their mother. There’s not one day goes by that I do not think of what I have done to you and what may have happened that day. I want you to know that I have made a right choice in my life and have chosen to attend a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre. I attend this four days a week, and I believe my life is now on the right path. 
      
     
     
      
      I once again wish to express my deepest apology, I understand that ‘sorry’ is such an insufficient word but it is all I have to offer, along with the promise not only to you but to my children, that I will never affect a person in this way again. Please do not think that I have written this letter to ease my conscience, as I will never forget my actions that day and what I did to you. I hope that I can be given the opportunity to return your money, and to apologise to you in person.” 
      
    12 I had expressed concern at the fact that no attempt had been made by her solicitors to deliver the letter to the crown. It may well be that the victim may not wish to hear from or receive this apology but the circumstances of it being made and should she so desire, the contents of the letter should be made available to the victim, if the victim thinks it will assist her in coming to a closure over this incident. SUBJECTIVE MATTERS, FAMILY BACKGROUND AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS13 Miss Burrows is a twenty-seven year old single mother of two children, aged 6 and 7. She has separated from their father. The relationship between Burrows and her former partner was marred by violence. Both were drug users. Presently, proceedings are before the Family Court, they appear to have an aroma of vindictiveness, as is not uncommon, over custody issues. Custody and access for her is being made difficult by her former partner and quite possibly by herself.14 Miss Burrows’ prime motivation in pursuing drug rehabilitation is her children and restoring maternal bonds with them. She believes her former partner is poisoning their minds against her. Of course, for her the real difficulty is that there is an element of truth in some of his claims. She has abused drugs in the past. She has a past history of violence.15 Her mother committed suicide six years ago. In 1989 her mother had been sexually assaulted by three men as some form of payback for her separating from her then partner, who Miss Burrows believes orchestrated the assault. Her mother also had a late onset of alcoholism and during the last few years of her life was continually drinking.16 Alcohol consumed in large quantities is a significant depressant. Miss Burrows became her mother’s carer and confidant. Their relationship was close. Miss Burrows’ own childhood was marred with violence. She had no contact with her father. She does, however, have other supports within the community. She stayed some three months with one friend and was staying with another for some seven weeks on the last occasion she was before me.17 She has now entered at the Wesley Rehabilitation services a place called Turnaround, Grace Manor, in Miller. I will come to that matter later.EDUCATION, SKILLS, EMPLOYMENT HISTORY18 Miss Burrows left school at the age of fourteen. She undertook a retail warehouse course. She has had experience as a factory hand, a position she held for three weeks. Her work experience is limited. She last worked for wages in 2004. Her longest period of employment is one of six months. In evidence before me, she indicated an interest in returning to work, perhaps in the warehouse. There was, of course, some other job of selling door-to-door, a course I thought a little concerning.19 She is doing a parenting course. She intends to start a Year 10 certificate. She will need to demonstrate a greater stability in her working or vocational study life before the Court can have confidence her rehabilitation will succeed. That instability is yet again instanced by another change, hopefully this time for the good, but from living in the community to living in full-time rehabilitation at Turnaround, Grace Manor.20 There was frequent moving during her early schooling.GENERAL HEALTH21 Miss Burrows suffers from asthma which she controls by an inhaler. She is also a smoker which may lead to other problems later in life. Otherwise as best one can tell she appears to be in good health, an important factor for rehabilitation particularly with drug addicts.DRUG AND ALCOHOL22 Miss Burrows started her drug abuse aged thirteen, binge drinking most weekends by the time she was seventeen. She claims to have slowed that drinking down last year, ceasing alcohol entirely by November 2006 after an episode of significant binge drinking. She was using cannabis from thirteen to eighteen, smoking up to a quarter of an ounce daily. She was able to reduce her cannabis intake during both pregnancies, completely in the case of the first child and on a couple of occasions for the second.23 She was smoking cannabis daily to November 2006 as a means of dealing with the loss of her children. She has also abused benzodiazepines, ecstasy, cocaine, amphetamines and heroin. The abuse of some of these drugs is long-standing and was entrenched until November 2006. Her amphetamine use was shared with her partner. At the time of offending, she was consuming ICE. Of course, having a partner using is counter-indicated, as they say, for rehabilitation, because the partner will want to normalise his, in this case, drug use by having his partner use as well.24 I am satisfied her offending was drug related, in the sense that she committed the offence to obtain money for her drugs. The offence was committed at a time she was “hanging out”. On 28 November last year, she was accepted into a drug program at Maryfields Day Recovery Centre. It is one of the rehabilitation programs conducted by St Vincent De Paul. It was a ten week outpatient program beginning, in her case, on 12 December 2006.25 She completed that program on 30 March this year. Her counsellor with the program noted some maturing, her seeking to come to terms with her mother’s death, learning to focus on positive lifestyle choices, and removing negative influences. She has been offered ongoing counselling in that after-care program, although that may be unnecessary now. That after-care program focussed upon relapse prevention, counselling, urine analysis and breathalysers.MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES26 I do not have the benefit of a psychometric testing. It is likely, however, that there is some depression. She has lost her mother in an apparent suicide just weeks before her own twenty-first birthday. She has lost custody of her children to her estranged partner, who she believes is hostile to her interests. She believes he is turning the children against her. Her personal relationship with her former partner was always dysfunctional. There was violence, reconciliation, further violence, and drugs being the principal component of it. The estranged relationship also appears to have an aura of dysfunction about it.27 She has issues of violence, no doubt related to her anger. She speaks of the odd punch-up with her mother. There was a dispute with her sister and brother-in-law that may have had a component of violence in it, not disclosed. However, there was something about the “fight” that caused police initially, and then either DOCS or the Family Court to take a view her children would be better off with the father. As I say, she may be contributing, in part, to her own disengagement with the children.28 Any treatment program will need to address issues seriously engrained, including, I suspect, violence and anger as appropriate responses to unwelcome situations. As a consequence of her participation in the ten week drug program - the pre-care and post aftercare - Miss Burrows’ psychological wellbeing has greatly improved. She is not reporting agitation, disturbed mood or ideation frequently accompanying drug withdrawal.29 She has improved self-image. She says she is quite proud of herself, she has three goals, some level of reconnection with her children; seeking re-entry into the workforce and remaining drug-free. Because of her desire to re-connect with her children, she is strongly motivated to rehabilitate. Life is dynamic, it would be a pity to waste the moment with full-time incarceration where the motivation would most likely be crushed.CHARACTER AND CRIMINAL HISTORY30 Miss Burrows, age twenty-seven has had a difficult life, made more difficult by her own drug addiction. She does, however, appear to have courage and determination, recently exhibited as she sought to become drug-free. She has insight into her offending behaviour and appears to be achieving goals that will address her criminal conduct. Fortuitously, they are congruent with matters she needs to address to restore some fruitful level of contact with her children.31 In 1997 there is a shoplifting conviction, another in June 2006. There is another offence of financial dishonesty in 2003, a stealing offence in August 2002, a common assault conviction in which the victim was a partner and there are two breaches of an AVO occurring in late September 2006. This is her first offence of violence outside the domestic setting. It is her first offence dealt with in the District Court. Her record is not one that disentitles her to some consideration of leniency.ATTITUDE TO THE OFFENCE32 The offender was committed for sentence. That is to say, she pleaded guilty at the outset. I am satisfied that early plea was entered by a contrite offender willing to accept full responsibility for her offending conduct. I have already made reference to the letter written which voices her apology directly to her victim. There is evidence she is having nightmares, focussed on her brutal treatment of her frail victim.33 During her drug treatment program she was required to keep a journal. One entry of significance was selected by Michelle Ackerman, her counsellor with Maryfield, it is an entry for 28 March 2007. 
     
      
      “I’m scared shitless of going to gaol next week. I know with going back to gaol, my attitude will come back and I don’t want it to, nor lose the person I have become as this is the old me before I started using drugs, and drinking. They turned me into a nasty person and I did heaps of things I’m not proud of, and will never be proud of them. It’s been fourteen years of silence, fourteen years of pain, those fourteen years are gone for and I will never have again but I have changed and become that person I never thought I would be again, and I know it’s a good thing, and I thank you guys heaps, I will not forget what you have done for me. 
      
     
     
      
      There is something about this place that I’ll always take with me, and that’s how much I’ve changed but as my real Mum always told me, you do the crime, you be prepared to pay the time and if I go, it’s my fault, I did the crime. I had the knife on me that day, yes, I’m guilty as charged but I’m sorry I did and I need to face the consequences, whatever that may be, my freedom still or gaol. All I can do is go in there and tell them how sorry I am and how I’ve turned my life around. 
      
     
     
      
      I’m in the wrong and I’m sorry, but that was me on drugs at the time and that’s what it did to me and who it made me be. That girl, that nasty girl wasn’t me, that was a drug stuffed person on ICE. I hate myself for what I did to that lady and I wish I could turn back time.” 
      
    REHABILITATION PROSPECTS34 Much depends upon the real level of rehabilitation in respect of drug abuse. Miss Burrows has been abusing drugs and alcohol for nearly fourteen years. She has been drug and alcohol free for less than six months. More time is needed to assess whether the last six months amounts to a first attempt at drug rehabilitation, or, hopefully, a successful campaign to become drug and alcohol free.35 On either view, they are important steps but total success would be the most desired outcome. For that reason I have determined that she should be given an opportunity to demonstrate her capacity to rehabilitate. I would not give her this chance if there were not a number of factors suggesting a positive outcome is likely, even if at this stage, not assured: 
     
     She appears strongly motivated to reform to a level where DOCS and, or the Family Court come to a view she can have an increased level of access to her children. 
     She appears genuinely contrite in respect of this serious criminal conduct and anxious to ensure there is no likelihood of re-offending. 
     She has at least two personal friends in the community who have demonstrated significant support for her. 
     She has generally good physical health and no significant mental health issues that should be a worry for the court. 
     She appears committed at least at this stage to the Maryfields program and staff and the program has a realistic testing regime. That bullet point can now be supplemented by her acceptance into a full-time rehabilitation program at the Wesley Rehabilitation Centre, Turnaround, Grace Manor. 
    This is a full-time residential program aimed at providing comprehensive educational, vocational, social and psychological rehabilitation services that allow clients to become productive members of society. The observation is made that the accused will greatly benefit by accessing the program and its framework for assisting her to rebuild her once broken life.36 I am granting the accused bail pursuant of s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a period of nine months from today. I take the nine months because we have been dealing with this case for some two or three months, I think, and although, strictly speaking I could take the year, it seems to me there has been some rehabilitation progress already made, which would bring us up to early February of 2008.37 The conditions are that she will reside at Turnaround, Grace Manor, and participate to the best of her ability in the Wesley Rehabilitation Program offered there. She is not to leave that program other than by application to this Court, or expulsion from the program. Assuming the expulsion is properly based, expulsion from the program would be regarded as a breach of the bail, see condition 1.38 She is to accept supervision of Probation and Parole. She is to accept all drug testing measures at the Wesley Rehabilitation Program. Any failure to fully participate in the testing, or any dirty test, will constitute a breach of the bail. I require the Probation and Parole and request Wesley Rehabilitation Services to notify the Court within forty-eight hours of any breach of the bail.39 The accused is to report to the Court on 13 July and 9 November for progress reports. I order presentence reports and request Wesley Rehabilitation Service Reports for those days.40 The matter will be finalised - a date to be fixed near 11 February, Friday closest to 11 February 08.

    JUDGMENT1 On 21 April 2006 Sihal Kurdi, a small businessman running the Al Nour convenience store at Greenacre was confronted by an unknown male wielding an axe. That man was yelling “Give me the money; give me the money.” The would-be robber was a big man, six foot tall and solid build, wearing a dark coloured balaclava. That axe was described as a medium-sized axe. I will come in more detail to that. 2 The unknown male armed with the axe was threatening Kurdi saying, “Give me the money or I’ll kill you.” Sahil Kurdi was brave and steadfast. “I’m not going to give you the money, you’d better get out.” he said. “No I want the money. I’m going to kill you.” said the unknown male. Sahil Kurdi was resolute. “No you’re not going to kill me. You’d better get out before you get into any more trouble.” he said. 3 The unknown male swung the axe in an overhead manner, apparently aiming for Sahil Kurdi’s head. Kurdi raised his right arm in self defence. The axe, nonetheless, struck the right side of his forehead, causing a wound. The unknown male fled the store. Sahil Kurdi chased after him. There was a white Ford Laser parked nearby. Its engine was off. As the unknown male ran, with his balaclava still on and the axe still in his hand, the car started up. In circumstances to which I shall shortly come, the robber was driven away from the scene by the very person who had driven him to the scene, Justin Konemann.4 Justin Konemann has pleaded guilty to a charge of being an accessory before the fact to an assault by the unknown would-be robber whilst he was armed with an offensive weapon with intent to rob Sahil Kurdi and at the time of that assault, wounding Sahil Kurdi. He offers himself today to be held accountable for his criminal actions. 5 In this case an agreed statement of facts was tendered. For my purposes there are two agreed facts which need to be explored. Agreed fact(5) is in these terms. “The offender claims, and the crown does not agree, that the offender was acting under duress pursuant to section 21A(3)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act”. Fact (17), “the offender claims and the crown does not agree, that he did not see the axe when Monz got back into the car and that he only discovered that an axe was used in the commission of the offence after his arrest”. Inherent in fact (17) as I understand it is that the offender's position is he did not see the axe at all and only discovered that an axe had been used in the commission of the offence after his arrest.6 To the agreed facts must be added this further evidence given by the accused before me in Court. Konemann’s evidence was that he met a man named Monz at a third person’s place. That man wanted him to drive up the road. He was asked only the once but felt intimidated and threatened. Monz appeared to him to be agitated. Monz was of Middle Eastern appearance. 7 The year before, Konemann had been struck with a stick and put in hospital for a week by a man of Middle Eastern appearance. Since that experience, Konemann had felt intimidated and threatened by men of Middle Eastern appearance. 8 After Monz and Konemann left the flat and were going downstairs, Konemann was told by Monz that there was going to be a robbery. He saw something in Monz’s pants, a bulge in them, but he did not know what it was. After the incident he found out that it was an axe with a handle thirty-five to forty-five centimetres in length. 9 They went to a convenience store, he dropped Monz off and was parked, on this account, for fifteen to twenty minutes. I say on this account because in his interview he put the time as seven to eight minutes. He waited that time because he felt threatened. 10 He did not expect to get anything from the robbery. 11 Monz jumped in the car and he dropped Monz off at a park after the robbery. That statement is to be understood as accepting the proposition that there was a scuffle in and around the car prior to Monz jumping into the car. He understood someone got hurt but did not find that out until he went to prison.12 The starting point for resolving the issue as to Konemann’s knowledge of the existence of the axe prior to the assault upon Mr Kurdi is to understand the significance of the plea. The offender has pleaded guilty to being an accessory before the fact. The words of the charge refer to him aiding and abetting the principal offender. His plea admits being present, aiding and abetting when the crime was committed, an arrangement entered into before the crime is committed, but taking no part in the actual crime. However, the aider and abetter, in order to be guilty must be aware of the essential matters that constitute the offence, that is, what the plea admits. When I say must be aware, must be aware before the offence is committed.13 In this case the essential matters constituting the offence are (1), he knew that someone in the store was to be assaulted for the purpose of him or her being robbed. (2), he knew the robber would be armed with an offensive weapon. (3), he contemplated at least the possibility that someone would be wounded by the actions of the robber and (4), he agreed to assist the robber so that that crime could be committed. 14 The offender’s claim as presented in the agreed facts is that he only discovered an axe was used in the commission of the offence after his arrest. In evidence he notes something in Monz’s pants, a bulge which he fails to identify. From his evidence is would appear his claim is, he never saw the axe, yet he is able to give its length as thirty-five to forty-five centimetres. That really describes a hatchet, sometimes called a tomahawk and sometimes referred to as a small axe.15 A person who did see the axe was Rabhid Kurdi, he describes the axe he saw as a normal, plain wood handled axe. He says it was old. Sahil Kurdi, who was menaced with and struck by the axe describes it as a medium sized axe. Naser Farojani describes the axe as having a forty-five centimetre wooden handle. I have no idea how accurate or otherwise Farojani is with measurement. I regard the forty-five centimetre handle favourable to the defence and am prepared to accept that it was forty-five centimetres at least, but probably more.16 Upon the accused returning to the apartment where he claims to have first met Monz, he told Susie Laxale, the owner of the apartment,  
     
      
      “We’ve gone to Greenacre, Monz told me to pull up there.” She said, “Where’s there?” The accused said, “Just in front of the shop there. I stopped right outside the shop while the car was running, Monz has run in and attacked two guys with an axe.” Ms Laxale said, “He attacked what?” The accused said, “He attacked two guys.” Ms Laxale said, “With what?” The accused said, “An axe. His axe.” Ms Laxale said, “Where did you see the axe come out of?” The accused said, “I didn’t see the axe.” Ms Laxale said, “What did you do then?” The accused said, “I had the car running. One of the guys came out and tried to attack me. Monz has jumped in the car and I drove off.” The accused continued, “He forced me to drive to Greenacre and  
      we 
       done an armed robbery.” Ms Laxale said, “Were the guys badly hurt?” The accused said, “One of them were.” (My emphasis). 
      
    17 It was important for the accused to tell Ms Laxale because it was her car that had been taken and the driver’s side window had been shattered as a consequence of its involvement in this incident. He clearly had to explain the shattering of that window to Ms Laxale. This conversation is inconsistent with the offender’s evidence in two important respects. It establishes his knowledge of the axe and its ownership within a couple of hours of the offence and long before his arrest. It also establishes his awareness of Mr Kurdi’s injury, again, long before his arrest and within hours of the incident. 18 There is another aspect of Ms Laxale’s statement that bears upon the truth of the offender’s account that he did not know before he left the flat that he would assist in a robbery. Her statement is in these terms, that at about 6.30pm that night, a male person came to her unit. He introduced himself as Amos’ (Ms Laxale’s partner’s mate, Monz).  
     
      
      “I was surprised to see him, because I’d never had him over before, and I’d never seen him before this date.” Monz said, “A couple of boys said you have some pills Suze.” She replied, “I’ve got nothing.” The statement continues, “I allowed Monz into my unit. I didn’t know what he wanted and I thought he would just leave after a couple of minutes [or less]. Harry appeared to not know Monz but I’m not sure about Justin. Monz stayed for fifteen minutes, he was mainly speaking to me and said a couple of things to Justin and Harry. I was speaking to Monz about the pills which he was determined to get but I had no pills. He was pacing around and looking nervous. He was definitely hanging out for something. I heard Monz say, ‘How are you boys?’ to Justin and Harry. About 6.45pm that night Justin said, ‘I’m going to the shop.’ At that time Monz said, ‘Can you give me a lift bro.’” The statement continues, “I said, ‘No he can’t. He’s only going to the shop and you’re going elsewhere.’ Monz said, ‘Mate I need a lift.’ Justin put his head down. Monz kept saying, ‘I need a lift mate.’ Justin said, ‘Yeah.’ Both Monz and Justin left my unit. I was aware that Justin was going to use my car.” 
      
    19 The significance of that evidence is that the initiative to leave the flat comes from the offender. His claimed purpose is to go to a shop. It would appear to be a given that he would use Ms Laxale’s car. As a matter of common sense, she would be unlikely to make the car available for a robbery. 20 It would make sense if there was a robbery planned, for Monz to meet the offender where the car was garaged. I have read carefully the offender’s interview and my notes of his evidence. He gives evidence of Monz entering into other stores before the robbery but no evidence that he did. Yet that was his purpose in leaving the unit. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the offender did not borrow Ms Laxale’s car because he wanted legitimately to visit a store; but left for the purpose of giving Monz a lift. 21 Ms Laxale makes no mention of seeing anything in the unit during the fifteen minutes that Monz was there that would qualify as an axe or any other offensive weapon. I am satisfied the axe was never in the unit. I am satisfied the axe was collected by Monz after he had left the unit, whether immediately outside the unit or elsewhere I am unable to determine. 22 Monz appears to have been six foot tall. That evidence comes from a number of sources. On the offender’s account, he sat in the front seat of a Ford Laser, a smallish to medium sized car with forty-five centimetres, or perhaps more, of axe handle stuffed down his trousers. It borders on the farcical to suggest a six foot solidly built man wearing, as the offender told police, tight clothing (see questions 259, 260) could, with forty-five centimetre of solid axe handle, accommodate the necessary bending of hips and knees without tearing his pants or having a protrudence that would be a source of ribald humour. 23 Finally, immediately after the principal offender had struck Sahil Kurdi, the principal offender ran from the shop. There is no suggestion he removed a balaclava that he was wearing or threw away the axe. As he approached, Konemann started the car, consistent with Konemann hearing or seeing the arrival of his co-offender. 24 The principal offender was at this stage concerned with two things, escaping capture and hiding his identity. To do the first, he would have remained armed with the medium sized axe. To do the latter, he would have remained shielded behind the balaclava he was wearing. The evidence is, he removed the balaclava as he entered the car (see Rabhid Kurdi). 25 Konemann’s response to his co-offender’s dilemma, as I say, was to start the Ford Laser as the principal offender was running towards him. There was, however, an altercation as the principal offender menaced Rabhid Kurdi and his father Sahil. The shop owner’s son makes clear the principal was still armed with the axe and swinging it five metres from the Laser. It is inconceivable in those circumstances the offender did not see the balaclava at that time or at some other time.  26 I reject the accused’s account of not seeing the axe as an attempt to minimise his involvement of full knowledge of the detail of his co-offender’s intentions and capacity to carry out the robbery. The offender also claims he was intimidated by Monz. This is not a matter that I need to determine for the purposes of what is about to happen but I will indicate my view on that.27 Of course, duress would be a defence but as I understand his evidence, he does not put the claim as high as that, but simply as a mitigating factor pursuant to section 21A of the Crimes Act. It is important to remember it was he who initiated the departure from the flat. It was he who insisted over the protestations of Ms Laxale, that Monz would accompany him. Konemann told the police he was not physically threatened in any way nor, as I understand his answers, verbally threatened (see questions 221, 225 ROI). He says Monz was demanding. He came to that view because Monz was directing him where to go. 28 During the confrontation between Konemann and Sahil Kurdi, the following exchanged occurred:  Sahil Kurdi said, ""Turn off the car, get out of the car."" The accused, who was the drive said, ""I have nothing to do with it [the attack and attempted robbery]"". Kurdi said, ""If you don't have anything to do with it, why not turn off the car and come outside."" Kurdi's statement continues,  
     
      
       
      “The driver didn’t say anything and he then began to wind up the window because I put my hand inside the car and was trying to remove the keys from the ignition. The driver tried to wind up the windows very fast. I removed my hand from the car.”  
      
    Kurdi’s statement continues,  
     
      
      “I said, ‘Just open the window, I’m not going to say or do anything.’ The driver said, ‘No, no, no.’ It was at that point that the window was broken.” 
      
    29 If the offender had nothing to do with it, and it would appear Kurdi was prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, that was the time for Konemann to establish his bona fides. He did not do so. He drove off. At that stage, but for him the car was otherwise empty. He then stopped to collect Monz. That final act is only consistent with his concern for Monz and his desire that Monz escape capture. 30 It follows from that view of the facts that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt Konemann was a willing and loyal driver of a getaway vehicle, a role that had been ascribed to him before the robbery (see the plea) and carried out by him throughout the robbery and the following escape. 31 In light of the offender’s denial as to his knowledge of the presence of the weapon other than his acknowledgement of seeing the bulge in the trousers of the principal offender, I have considered whether it is proper for me to accept his plea of guilty. He was at the time of plea represented by experienced counsel, who has been one of the public defenders for several years. 32 The issue was one flagged as a matter that was not agreed and in that sense, it might appear on the surface as one that could be determined by me.  33 I am having difficulty though, in assessing whether Konemann was fully informed that his plea amounted to an admission of the element of the principal offence, particularly his prior knowledge of the existence of the offensive weapon.  34 In those circumstances I intend to adjourn this plea, probably for three weeks. I will give to the accused an opportunity to confirm his plea, in which case I will then proceed with it. If he does not do so, I will reject his plea and set the matter down for trial. I should note, I do not intend to qualify in any way my findings of fact thus far made. I am however, concerned about the inconsistency inherent in the plea, the evidence and item 17 of the agreed facts. ADJOURNED TO THURSDAY 31 MAY 2007

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Geoffrey Smith, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence passed on him in the District Court for a charge of common assault. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months, comprising a non parole period of 13 and a half months commencing on 3 November 2006, and a balance of term of four and a half months. The offence, under S61 of the Crimes Act, carries a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment. 2 The facts of the matter are distressing and the offence was undoubtedly serious. The applicant was employed as a carer with an organisation known as Life Without Barriers, his primary responsibility being the victim of the assault. She was a young woman with a number of developmental and physical problems. On the occasion in question, which was 28 July 2005, the applicant had driven his sister from Wyong to Royal North Shore Hospital so that his sister could attend a medical appointment there. The victim, the young, disabled girl, accompanied them in the vehicle. Having arrived at the Royal North Shore Hospital the sister went in to attend her appointment and the applicant and the victim remained in the car park area.  
     
      
    3 The victim remained in the tailgate area of the vehicle, which was a station wagon, and she was restrained by one hand to a cargo barrier by a pair of handcuffs. It was the applicant's case that he did not do that, she had done it herself because she had some interest in handcuffs. That is a matter about which the learned sentencing judge gave the applicant the benefit of the doubt. The assault involved his gripping her hair, hitting her head against a side window of the vehicle, and also slapping her in the face.  
     
      
    4 This was witnessed by two people and to some extent was picked up in some security video, although her Honour found that to be unclear. There was no aggressive behaviour on the part of the victim which would appear to have preceded that assault, although it was the applicant's case that she was violent on this occasion and, indeed, she had been on occasions previously. 5 The applicant was 37 years of age at the time of the offence and had no prior convictions. He seemed to have an uneventful upbringing. Sadly, in 1993 both his parents died within a relatively short period. This seems to have given rise to depression, which has stayed with him ever since. He has had a somewhat sporadic employment history in unskilled positions, having been educated to the School Certificate standard only, and in recent years his employment had been primarily as a security guard.  
     
      
    6 He pleaded guilty on his arraignment in the District Court, having been committed to that Court for trial, a matter which the learned sentencing judge took into account, although she did not quantify the discount which that had earned him.  
     
      
    7 There was before her Honour a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report of Dr Westmore. What emerges from that is that there is a history of depression. It seems that his general level of intellectual function is low. He is a somewhat isolated figure. It was not put on his behalf that that psychological background and that depression specifically gave rise to the offence in question, but it was a relevant part of the background which her Honour had to consider.  
     
      
    8 What Dr Westmore did say was that he felt that the applicant did not have the skills or personality to work as a carer, and that he should not undertake this type of work in the future. It does seem to me to be a reasonable inference on the whole of the evidence. It seems he had some training in handling the unfortunate victim. One wonders whether he was the type of person who ought to have had such responsibility conferred upon him. Her Honour rightly found that this was a case where the victim was vulnerable and that was a further aggravating feature.  
     
      
    9 The only ground of the application is that the sentence is manifestly excessive. In my view, that ground is made out. Indeed, the Crown Prosecutor today very properly acknowledged that her Honour does not appear to have given the subjective case the weight it deserves. Of course, the offence was serious. As I have said, the circumstances are distressing, to say the least. However, her Honour's starting point must have been very close to the maximum, given that an unspecified discount for a plea of guilty had been allowed. 10 What we have is a first offence by a man who has no history of violence, who is in his late 30s, and who is a man who has had his own difficulties in the past and may well have been shouldering a professional responsibility which was beyond his capabilities. In my view, the ground has been made out and this Court should intervene. I would make the finding of special circumstances, given his background and the fact he is likely to need some assistance to readjust to society. Even so, any extension of the normal apportionment between non parole period and head sentence will not be a long period. That is inevitable because the non parole period must itself reflect the gravity of the crime. 11 The orders I make are these: 
     
      
      (1) I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and quash the sentence. 
       
      (2) In lieu, I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for fourteen months to date from 3 November 2006, comprising a non parole period of eight months and a balance of term of six months. The applicant, accordingly, is to be released to parole on 2 July 2007. 
      
    12 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J. It might be that the debate in relation to the impact of the applicant’s personal circumstances before the trial judge diverted attention from the impact which those circumstances should have on any term of fulltime custody. Her Honour’s remarks on sentence revealed the fact that the debate seems to have centred upon whether or not those personal circumstances justified a Section 9 bond or some other amelioration by way of a suspended sentence. It would appear that as a consequence the impact of his personal circumstances on the term of any fulltime custody may have not been given sufficient attention by counsel and by her Honour. In my opinion the remarks of Hidden J in relation to the problems which have now been revealed and the sentence which his Honour now proposes are appropriate. 
     
      
    13 PRICE J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    14 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Accordingly, the orders of the Court are what Hidden J has indicated.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: In proceedings originally commenced in the District Court on 30 January 2003 the plaintiff, Benjamin Cox (now eighteen years of age), claims damages for personal injury he alleges he suffered (as a child, and continuing) as a consequence of the breach of a duty of care owed to him by agents of the defendant. 
     
      
    2 The circumstances of the claim are unusual, and may succinctly be stated as follows (although it will be necessary to set out, in more detail, what the plaintiff alleges, and the defendant’s response). The defendant is responsible for the conduct and administration of government schools in NSW. The plaintiff’s claim arises out of his enrolment in a government primary school in 1994 and 1995, as a small child (aged six and seven). He alleges that he was subjected, at the hands of an older student, to harassment and bullying; that the school authorities took no or inadequate steps to prevent the harassment and bullying, or to protect him from its effects; and that, as a consequence, he suffered and continues to suffer severe emotional, psychological and psychiatric injury. 
     
      
    3 There are significant complications. While it is accepted on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff does suffer real and serious psychiatric and psychological dysfunction, it does not accept that it can be wholly, or even partly, attributed to the treatment he received at the hands of the older student; even less can it be attributed to any failure on the defendant’s part to intervene and prevent the conduct of the older student. 
     
      
    4 A short (and uncontroversial) history of the relevant events and circumstances is as follows. It will need to be expanded below. The plaintiff was born on 6 December 1988. In January 1994, at the age of five, he was enrolled in the Raymond Terrace Public School. His time there was unremarkable. In April of that year, his family having moved to a village called Woodberry, he was enrolled in the kindergarten class of the Woodberry Public School. There he was exposed to an older schoolboy, to whom I will refer as TH. Over a number of months in 1994, and into 1995, TH subjected the plaintiff to repeated harassment, with various incidents of bullying. On at least two occasions these incidents included physical assaults of a relatively serious nature. The plaintiff’s mother reported the events to the school authorities but the harassment and bullying continued. The plaintiff began to suffer from anxiety, with various symptoms to which I will refer in due course. Eventually, in September 1995, the plaintiff’s mother removed the plaintiff from the school. He was given psychiatric and psychological assessment and treatment. 
     
      
    5 At the beginning of the 1996 school year the plaintiff was enrolled in Year 1 in the Black Hill Public School, a small country school. There he experienced some anxiety but attended regularly. 
     
      
    6 In 2000, when the plaintiff was in Year 5, his family moved again, to Stroud. He was enrolled in the Stroud Public School. In 2001 the plaintiff was in Year 6 at that school. It became necessary for him to consider the selection of a high school for the following year. His anxiety condition re-emerged. He enrolled in the Dungog High School but attended for one day only. In March 2002 he was enrolled in Year 7 at the Gloucester High School, but experienced significant anxiety symptoms. His attendance was sporadic. In 2003 he was enrolled in a distance education programme conducted from Camden Haven High School, but, because of non-compliance with the work requirements, that enrolment was terminated at the end of the school year. 
     
      
    7 The plaintiff suffers from psychiatric conditions identified as Depression and Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. These are unlikely to abate. He is unemployable and is in receipt of a disability pension. 
     
      
    8 It is the plaintiff’s case that his condition was precipitated by the conduct of TH, and that the Woodberry School authorities, for whose misfeasance the defendant is liable, in breach of this duty of care to him, failed to take any reasonable steps to protect him from that repeated harassment and bullying. 
     
      
       
      LIABILITY 
       
      
    9 Although the plaintiff gave evidence, the principal evidence in relation to events the foundation of the claim was given by his mother, Mrs Angela Cox. That was because the plaintiff has no recollection of the events in question. Mrs Cox was not a witness to the events; the evidence she gave in that respect was given from what she said had been told to her by the plaintiff from time to time. It was therefore hearsay evidence, prohibited by the hearsay rule contained in s59 of the Evidence Act 1995, unless subject to one of the exceptions that follow. This gave rise to an evidentiary issue – was the evidence admissible under any exception to the hearsay rule? 
     
      
       
      An evidentiary issue 
       
      
    10 It is useful to set out s59 in full. It is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        59 The hearsay rule—exclusion of hearsay evidence 
         
         
        (1) Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation. 
         
        (2) Such a fact is in this Part referred to as an  
        asserted fact 
        . 
         
        (3) Subsection (1) does not apply to evidence of a representation contained in a certificate or other document given or made under regulations made under an Act other than this Act to the extent to which the regulations provide that the certificate or other document has evidentiary effect. 
        
       
      
    11 The two relevant exceptions are contained in s63 and s64 of the Evidence Act. S63 applies in civil proceedings where the maker of the previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact. In those circumstances, by subs(2), the hearsay rule does not apply to: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) oral evidence of the representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made …” 
        
       
      
    12 S64 applies in civil proceedings where the maker of the previous representation is available to give evidence about an asserted fact. In those circumstances, by subs(3): 
     
      
       
        
        “If the person who made the representation has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by: 
         
        (a) that person, or 
         
        (b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, 
         
        if, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation.” 
        
       
       
      Obviously, only one of these sections can be applicable. 
       
      
    13 At first blush, it would appear that the relevant section is s64: the previous representations about asserted facts were made (to his mother) by the plaintiff: that is, the plaintiff was, for the purposes of both sections, “the person who made the previous representation”. The plaintiff (apparently) was available to give evidence, and did in fact give evidence. However, the position is not as simple as that makes it appear. Part 2, clause 4 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act clarifies the meaning of “unavailability of persons”. It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “4(1) For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if: 
         
          
           
          (a) …;  
           
          (b) the person is, for any reason other than the application of section 16 [which has here no application], not competent to give the evidence about the fact;  
           
          (c) … 
           
          (d) … 
           
          (e) … 
           
          (f) ... 
          
         
         
         (2) In all other cases the person is taken to be available to give evidence about the fact.” 
        
       
      
    14 “Competence” is further explained in s13, subs(3) of which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) A person who is incapable of giving a rational reply to a question about a fact is not competent to give evidence about the fact, but may be competent to give evidence about other facts.” 
        
       
      
    15 The debate between the parties concerned whether the plaintiff was, within the meaning of s13, competent to give evidence: that is, not evidence in general, but the evidence in question. That evidence concerns the treatment of the plaintiff by TH. When asked about the events the subject of the claim, the plaintiff responded that he had no recollection. Counsel who appeared for the defendant therefore argued that this was a rational reply and that it could not therefore be concluded that the plaintiff was not available to give evidence. 
     
      
    16 I concluded that this approach was erroneous. The “rational replies” that the plaintiff was able to give were not replies to questions about facts relevant to his claim, but were about facts relevant to his recollection. Once he replied that he had no recollection of the events, it had to be concluded that he was not capable of giving a rational reply to questions about those facts. That he was capable to giving rational replies to questions about his recollection is beside the point; the argument focussed upon the wrong fact. It is to be remembered that s63 applies where a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact. The “asserted facts” are the assertions about what was done to him by TH. He was not able to give rational replies to questions about those asserted facts. 
     
      
    17 I therefore held that the plaintiff was relevantly unavailable to give evidence – that is, he was not available to give evidence about those asserted facts. Accordingly, the hearsay rule, by s63(2), does not apply to oral evidence of the representation given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made. On her evidence, the plaintiff’s mother, Mrs Cox, came into that category. Her evidence was therefore admissible. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    18 Mrs Cox gave evidence that, when he attended the Raymond Terrace school the plaintiff: “… was doing really, really well, especially in sport”. After he transferred to the Woodberry School, she observed a change in his behaviour at home. He began to suffer headaches, experience nightmares, and his behaviour deteriorated. His schoolwork also deteriorated. He began refusing to attend school. She asked him to explain what was happening. Then she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He told me that there had been a boy pinching things off him, schoolbooks, pencils, and he was shoving him into the walls at school, and he was scaring him.” 
        
       
      
    19 This was happening before school, at recess, and at lunchtime. 
     
      
    20 At the age of about 5 or 6 the plaintiff began playing football and this continued throughout the 1990s. Initially he played rugby league, but subsequently transferred to rugby union. He was, however, nervous before games, and refused to change in the change rooms or to use the toilets. He was taken to football, usually by his father, who was enthusiastic about his participation. 
     
      
    21 Mrs Cox said that on several occasions (in 1994) the plaintiff came home from school upset and crying. She spoke to a teacher at the school. She told the teacher what was happening. The teacher said that they would “keep an eye on Ben”. 
     
      
    22 Notwithstanding this, the plaintiff continued to be upset and to cry. He refused to sleep alone in his bedroom; he did not want to go out anywhere; he “just panicked” when his mother went out. He became clingy, like a toddler. His refusal to go to school escalated. 
     
      
    23 In February 1995 Mrs Cox had a further conversation, this time with the principal of the school, Ms Walmsley. Ms Walmsley knew that the perpetrator of the harassment was TH, and told Mrs Cox that TH suffered from Attention Deficit Disorder and that that could be the explanation for his conduct towards the plaintiff. She told Mrs Cox that they would try to keep the plaintiff and TH separate at school times. 
     
      
    24 At the beginning of the school year in 1995 the plaintiff still was reluctant to attend school. Mrs Cox persuaded him to do so. However, he experienced sleeplessness. Mrs Cox found it necessary to sleep with him in his room, and later had his sisters do so. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He just wasn’t the same boy that he used to be. He didn’t want to do anything, just cried all the time.” 
        
       
      
    25 Mrs Cox then recounted an occurrence of 23 February 1995. On that day she was telephoned by school authorities to advise of an incident. She went to the school. She found the plaintiff “shaking and crying” with red marks on the front of his neck and what looked like burn marks on the back of his neck. A teacher told her that a student had attempted to strangle the plaintiff with his hands and that Ben had actually “fallen onto the ground unconscious”. 
     
      
    26 Later in the day she spoke to the vice-principal (then Mr Valor) who told her that he would reprimand TH. Later still, she had a conversation with the plaintiff, who told her that TH had hurt him (the plaintiff) again, that TH had choked him. That night he was severely traumatised. He did not return to school for about two weeks. Mrs Cox took the plaintiff to see the local doctor, Dr Sprogis, at a practice the Cox family attended. She did this because of the sleeplessness and the marks on his neck, and also because she was concerned about the unconsciousness. She said nobody knew how long he had been unconscious. 
     
      
    27 Dr Sprogis examined the plaintiff and referred him to Dr Mark Selikowitz, a “Consultant Developmental Paediatrician”. The plaintiff did not attend school for “a couple of weeks” but then returned. 
     
      
    28 Following these events, Mrs Cox spoke to yet another member of the school staff, who again told her that TH suffered from Attention Deficit Disorder and postulated that condition as an explanation for his behaviour. He asked if the plaintiff had done anything to provoke the attack to which Mrs Cox replied in the negative. 
     
      
    29 Mrs Cox then spoke to two officers of the Department of Education, apparently administrative officers, one in Maitland and one in Newcastle. She recounted the strangulation incident and complained that the school authorities had not acted. Her evidence was that one of the officers, Mr Ian Wilson: 
     
      
       
        
        “… told me that bullying builds character and that he thought it was a good thing that Ben got bullied.” 
        
       
      
    30 A few weeks later Mrs Cox took the plaintiff to another doctor in the family practice, Dr Margot Woods. She did this because the plaintiff was not sleeping, he was crying all the time, and suffered from headaches and nightmares and he would not leave her alone, but clung to her. Dr Woods referred the plaintiff and his mother to Dr Tony Turnbull, a Wallsend psychiatrist. 
     
      
    31 Mrs Cox said that when it was time for the plaintiff to return to school after the February 23 incident, he was “absolutely petrified”. She persevered and persuaded him to return. However, his nightmares and headaches continued; he would not leave the house; his schoolwork continued to deteriorate. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before he even went to school, he could write his name, by that stage, he couldn’t write his name. He had gone backwards. He couldn’t dress himself. He was just a total mess really.” 
        
       
      
    32 Some time in the first half of 1995, but after the 23 February incident, the plaintiff told her again: 
     
      
       
        
        “… that [TH] was scaring him, pushing him into the walls of the school as he walked past him, jumping out from behind buildings, including the school toilets, and scaring him so much that he couldn’t even use the toilets at the time.” 
        
       
      
    33 At this time Mrs Cox noticed that the plaintiff would not use any public toilets; he was frightened that somebody would hurt him, and jump out and scare him. 
     
      
    34 Mrs Cox spoke again to Mr Elliott, then the vice-principal. On this occasion she was told that TH’s parents would be required to come to the school and supervise TH during recess and before and after school. The evidence does not disclose that this in fact occurred. 
     
      
    35 The plaintiff developed a severe stutter. This manifested itself when anything to do with the school was raised. He also began to become panicky when out of the house. Mrs Cox took him to a speech therapist for assistance with the stuttering. Because of the deterioration in his schoolwork he was enrolled in a reading recovery programme. 
     
      
    36 In July 1995 Dr Woods referred the plaintiff to Dr Peter Donald, a paediatrician. This was because he was “really insecure”; “more or less housebound”; and continuing to experience nightmares and headaches. 
     
      
    37 Dr Donald at first considered that the plaintiff might be suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder and suggested medication. Mrs Cox was not happy with this suggestion and made an appointment with Dr Selikowitz, to whom she had earlier been referred by Dr Sprogis. 
     
      
    38 On an occasion at the end of July 1995 Mrs Cox picked up the plaintiff from school at about 3.00 pm. He was crying. He was very red. When Mrs Cox asked him what had happened he replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “The big boy has hurt me again.” 
        
       
       
      He lifted his shirt and lowered his pants and she saw red welts across the back of his body. He told her that this had been done by TH. He also said that TH threatened that if he reported the matter to a teacher, he would be hurt again. 
       
      
    39 Mrs Cox walked with the plaintiff back into the school, and again saw the vice-principal, Mr Elliott. On this occasion Mr Elliott said that TH would be placed on detention, that a letter would be sent home by the school, and that one of his parents would be required to come to the school and supervise TH. Again, there was no evidence that this proposal had been implemented. 
     
      
    40 The plaintiff did not return to school then for approximately two weeks. When he did return Mrs Cox was telephoned by the school to tell her that the plaintiff had been in a fight. On 8 August she went to the school to find the plaintiff in the office, crying, his mouth bleeding. A lower tooth was missing and his lip was swollen and cut and bleeding. Mrs Cox said that, when asked what had happened, the plaintiff told her: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [TH] had tried to shove his jumper down his throat – like into his mouth.” 
        
       
      
    41 Mrs Cox spoke to Mr Elliott, and the principal, now Mrs Corben. They told her (again) that a letter would be sent home to TH's parents, and that TH would be placed on detention. 
     
      
    42 At this point the plaintiff refused to return to school. Mrs Cox reported the circumstances of the incident to the local police. She understood that a local constable visited TH’s parents at home. She said that, two days later, when the plaintiff had returned to school, TH accosted him, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was funny how the police came to my house. And if they come again, I’ll threaten to kill you.” 
        
       
      
    43 In September of that year the plaintiff stopped attending school altogether. Mrs Cox had a conversation with Mrs Corben, to tell her that she was taking the plaintiff out of school, and why. She said that this was because the school could not provide a safe place for the plaintiff and that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I had just basically had enough of it.” 
        
       
       
      She told Mrs Corben: 
       
       
        
        “I am not going to submit my son to any more bullying and hurting.” 
        
       
       
      Mrs Corben replied: 
       
       
        
        “You lose some kids and keep some.” 
        
       
      
    44 The plaintiff’s last day at Woodberry School was 20 September 1995. 
     
      
    45 Thereafter Mrs Cox attempted to find another suitable school for the plaintiff. She first tried a Catholic school at Tarro, but the plaintiff refused to leave the car. Although Mrs Cox was being assisted by a truancy officer at the Department of Education, she was unable to locate a suitable alternative school during the remainder of 1995. She contacted Mr Wilson again, who repeated that “bullying builds character”. At the beginning of 1996 she was offered a choice of schools, at some distance from her home. She selected the Black Hill Public School because it was a very small country school, 13 kilometres from her home. Because there was no public transport she was provided with a travelling allowance for transporting the plaintiff.  
     
      
    46 Initially, on his enrolment at Black Hill, the plaintiff refused to leave the car. It was not until two weeks had elapsed that, with the help of the principal, she was able to persuade the plaintiff to attend. 
     
      
    47 Thereafter the plaintiff settled well into the school and this continued over 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999, when the plaintiff was in years 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.  
     
      
    48 Notwithstanding his adaptation to the school, the plaintiff continued to have nightmares. Nevertheless, Mrs Cox felt: 
     
      
       
        
        “… like I had my little boy back.” 
        
       
      
    49 In 2000 the plaintiff recommenced school at Black Hill but during that year the family moved to Stroud where the plaintiff was enrolled in the Stroud Public School. Although he suffered some anxiety he attended school and completed that year. In 2000 and 2001 he travelled, with a number of other pupils (including his sister) on excursions to the Blue Mountains, and to the south coast. Both involved overnight stays. Mrs Cox had some concerns about his capacity to cope and made special arrangements for him to have access to a phonecard. She thought he would not have been able to participate had his sister not also been involved. 
     
      
    50 2001 was the plaintiff’s last year of primary school. He attended the Stroud Public School. However, it became necessary for him to consider enrolment in a high school, and his anxiety symptoms returned. Mrs Cox said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He got frightened again, his headaches came back, the nightmares started. He just saw the high school as, like, the big people were going to hurt him again.” 
        
       
      
    51 She sought the assistance of Mr Holloway, the principal of the Stroud Public School, with the intention of obtaining extra help for the plaintiff’s transition to high school. This was not forthcoming. The plaintiff began refusing to attend school. Mrs Cox said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… he wanted nothing to do with high school, nothing whatsoever.” 
        
       
      
    52 In June 2001 the plaintiff was referred to Dr Tony Slowiaczek, a child psychiatrist. Dr Slowiaczek invited the plaintiff to write a letter expressing his feelings. This he did on the computer at home. It became Exhibit A in the trial.  
     
      
    53 Dr Slowiaczek recommended family assessment at an adolescent psychiatric unit called Rivendell.  
     
      
    54 Attempts to identify a suitable high school for the plaintiff continued. Eventually Mrs Cox selected the Dungog High School. He attended on the first day, but during the day he telephoned his mother in tears. She described him: 
     
      
       
        
        “He was just a mess again, crying and wanted me to come pick him up. He could hardly talk, he was totally gone.” 
        
       
      
    55 She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He was exhausted, he was just totally exhausted and it was like having, like it almost reverted back to being like a little child … He was sooky and kept near me again, wouldn’t leave me alone.” 
        
       
      
    56 He never returned to that school. He was then enrolled in the Gloucester High School, which involved about an hour’s travel. His attendance was sporadic.  
     
      
    57 It was in March of that year that a family assessment at Rivendell took place. The plaintiff was offered a residential place, but flatly refused to participate. 
     
      
    58 His progress at Gloucester “was really really poor”. The plaintiff put no effort into his school work and showed no interest in anything to do with school.  
     
      
    59 In June 2002 Mrs Cox consulted a clinical psychologist, Malcolm Robertson, who suggested more psychiatric counselling.  
     
      
    60 In July Mrs Cox was invited to attend a meeting with a school counsellor and the year 7 adviser at Gloucester High School concerning the plaintiff’s absences from school, which were, by then, quite significant.  
     
      
    61 On the referral of Dr Woods, Mrs Cox took the plaintiff to yet another psychiatrist, Dr Miller, who prescribed medication and provided some counselling. At this time it was recommended (by whom is not clear) that the plaintiff undertake distance education and this was put into effect for a time. However, the plaintiff’s application to the tasks set was so poor that, at the end of 2003, his enrolment was discontinued. 
     
      
    62 A sustained attack was made upon both the reliability and credibility of Mrs Cox. Her evidence was subjected to minute scrutiny. In written submissions it was suggested that she demonstrated: 
     
      
       
        
        “… readiness to tailor her evidence to meet the emerging exigencies …” 
        
       
       
      At another point she was accused of: 
       
       
        
        “ … a tendency … to exaggerate.” 
        
       
       
      She was accused of being “evasive”. 
       
      
    63 Generally, I reject these criticisms. That is not to say that Mrs Cox’s evidence was not without its difficulties. In particular, her recollection of the times and duration of the plaintiff’s absences from school, especially in 1994 and 1995, did not always accord with objective evidence drawn from school records. (I interpolate here that I was provided with a large bundle of documentation from the Woodberry Public School, including what appear to be class rolls. However, I was given no proposed or suggested interpretation of these documents and no guidance as to what was sought to be made of them.) It will be necessary, in a different segment of these reasons, to pay considerable attention to Mrs Cox’s own psychiatric difficulties. However, on the whole, I found her to be a credible witness, doing her best to recount distressing events more than a decade old. It is, in those circumstances, hardly surprising if there is some confusion about dates, sequences of events, or the details of conversations. 
     
      
    64 By way of illustration, one criticism made of Mrs Cox’s evidence concerned her account of having taken the plaintiff to see Dr Sprogis. In this she was characterised as “unreliable”. This was because at one point she suggested that the consultation followed closely upon the event that precipitated the consultation, the 23 February occasion when TH was said have attempted to strangle the plaintiff. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would have been very close to the time that it happened. It even might have been that afternoon, I don’t know.” 
        
       
      
    65 In fact Dr Sprogis’ report states that he was consulted on 1 March 1995 – eight days after the incident. I do not regard this discrepancy on the part of Mrs Cox as of the slightest significance. The answer quoted above shows that she did not purport to have any certainty about the date of the consultation. Of far more importance was the confirmation afforded to her evidence by Dr Sprogis. His report states: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was consulted by Benjamin Cox on 1/3/95 for insomnia and anxiety on going to bed. The symptoms seem to follow an incident where he was choked by another child while at school one week previously.” 
        
       
      
    66 In this report, the essentials of what Mrs Cox recounted in her evidence were clearly supported. That is, Dr Sprogis’ notes demonstrate consistency between what he was then told and the evidence given in these proceedings by him. That is the case in respect of many other matters on which criticism was made of her evidence. 
     
      
    67 Despite the sustained attack upon Mrs Cox’s credibility and reliability, no submission was made that I should not accept that the plaintiff had been the subject of conduct and assaults of the type of which she gave evidence. It is of some significance that no witness was called on behalf of the defendant relevant either to the question of whether the conduct had occurred, or, perhaps more importantly, as to the reports Mrs Cox maintained she had made to the school. 
     
      
    68 Accordingly, although there were some discrepancies between her evidence and objectively determinable facts, I accept, in broad outline, that the plaintiff was subjected to harassment, bullying, and assault at the hands of TH, and that Mrs Cox made repeated attempts to have the school authorities intervene and control the conduct of TH, and prevent repetition of that conduct. Minor variations in detail do not affect that conclusion. 
     
      
    69 One issue of which much was sought to be made concerned whether or not, following the 23 February assault, the plaintiff had lost consciousness; and the related issue of what Mrs Cox said or believed about that. 
     
      
    70 I have already recorded Mrs Cox’s evidence on this matter: she was, plainly, recounting what she recalled having been told by a teacher at the school. She was not herself present at the time of the incident, and, by the time she arrived at the school, the plaintiff was certainly not unconscious. It is true that Dr Sprogis’ report made no mention of unconsciousness; a subsequent report of Dr Woods (from the same partnership, but who first saw the plaintiff on 14 March 1995) also mentioned the assault (described as “an attempted strangling by an older child at the school”) and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was no report of loss of consciousness at the time.” 
        
       
      
    71 On the question of the acceptability of Mrs Cox’s evidence, I find this to be of no significance. The plaintiff’s response to the events did not, in my opinion, depend upon whether there had been loss of consciousness. Nor does Mrs Cox’s credibility stand or fall on her perception or recollection of what had been said to her about that. 
     
      
       
      The relevant legal principles 
       
      
    72 That the defendant, through the Woodberry School authorities, owed a duty of care to the plaintiff cannot be seriously doubted. The nature of the duty has been considered on more than one occasion but, again, is not controversial. In Geyer v Downs [1977] HCA 64; 138 CLR 91, both Stephen J in his individual judgment, and Murphy and Aickin JJ, in their joint judgment, with which Mason and Jacobs JJ agreed, cited, with approval, passages from Richards v Victoria [1969] VR 136. Murphy and Aickin JJ excerpted that part of the judgment concerned with the content of the duty of care, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The duty of care owed by [the teacher] required only that he take such measures as in all the circumstances were reasonable to prevent physical injury to [the pupil]. This duty not being one to ensure against injury, but to take reasonable care to prevent it, required no more than the taking of reasonable steps to protect the plaintiff against risks of injury which ex-hypothesi [the teacher] should reasonably have foreseen.” 
        
       
      
    73 The passage excerpted by Stephen J sought to explain the rationale for the duty, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The reason underlying the imposition of the duty would appear to be the need of a child of immature age for protection against the conduct of others, or indeed of himself, which may cause him injury coupled with the fact that, during school hours, the child is beyond the control and protection of his parents and is placed under the control of the schoolmaster who is in a position to exercise authority over him and afford him, in the exercise of reasonable care, protection from injury.” 
        
       
      
    74 Stephen J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The duty which a schoolmaster ows to his pupil arises from the relationship between them and its temporal ambit will be determined by the circumstances of the relationship on the particular occasion in question. Children stand in need of care and supervision and this their parents cannot effectively provide when their children are attending school; instead it is those then in charge of them, their teachers, who must provide it.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour also said: 
       
       
        
        “It is for schoolmasters and for those who employ them, whether government or private institutions, to provide facilities whereby the schoolmasterly duty can adequately be discharged during the period for which it is assumed. The schoolmaster’s ability or inability to discharge it will determine neither the existence of the duty nor of its temporal ambit but only whether or not the duty has been adequately performed. The temporal ambit of the duty will, therefore, depend not at all upon the schoolmaster’s ability, however derived, effectively to perform the duty but, rather, upon whether the particular circumstances of the occasion in question reveal that the relationship of schoolmaster and pupil was or was not then in existence. If it was, the duty will apply. It will be for the schoolmaster and those standing behind him to cut their coats according to the cloth, not assuming the relationship when unable to perform the duty which goes with it.” 
        
       
      
    75 Murphy and Aickin JJ also cited as “the classic formulation of the duty owed by a schoolmaster to a pupil” that drawn from Williams v Eady (1893) 10 TLR 41, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … The schoolmaster was bound to take such care of his boys as a careful father would take of his boys, and there could not be a better definition of the duty of a schoolmaster.” 
        
       
      
    76 This was restated by Kitto J in Ramsay v Larsen [1964] HCA 40; 111 CLR 16 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The breach of duty which the plaintiff alleges is a failure to take such precautions for his safety on the occasion in question as a reasonable parent would have taken in the circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    77 The facts in Geyer v Downs scarcely bear upon the present case. That was a case in which a pupil was physically injured as a result of conduct on the part of another pupil, in the absence of any supervision on the part of the school authorities. But the statements of principle extracted are of general application.  
     
      
    78 Counsel for the defendant sought to draw comfort from a more recent decision of the High Court, Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn v Hadba [2005] HCA 31; 221 CLR 161. That was a case involving physical injury to an eight year old. The injury was caused to the plaintiff while she participated in a legitimate recess activity, in the course of which two other students blatantly breached school rules and caused her injury. The High Court observed that, although the plaintiff’s case had been presented as “a res ipsa loquitur case”, it was not that kind of case at all. They held that, despite significant factors pointing in the opposite direction, it was open to the plaintiff to establish (if she could) a breach of the duty of care owed to her by the school authorities. But, their Honours held, if she were to do this, it was incumbent upon her to demonstrate that there was some system of supervision which was an alternative to that which the school was using at the time of the accident, which was free of the risk of which the plaintiff complained, and which was available in a practical, as distinct from a general or theoretical, sense. 
     
      
    79 In the present case, counsel who appeared for the defendant relied upon that passage and also another in which the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[25] Nor is it reasonable to have a system in which children are observed during particular activities for every single moment of time - it is damaging to teacher-pupil relationships by removing even the slightest element of trust; it is likely to retard the development of responsibility in children, and it is likely to call for a great increase in the number of supervising teachers and in the costs of providing them.” 
        
       
       
      Counsel also relied upon another passage in which the Court observed that even constant supervision of that plaintiff’s activities would have been unlikely to have prevented the injury to her ([27]). 
       
      
    80 Reliance upon Hadba is misplaced. The circumstances of the two cases are vastly different. Here TH was not engaging in a legitimate activity in an illegitimate or unauthorised way. On each occasion, in varying degrees, he was engaging in activity which was (or should have been) forbidden. Nor was any incident isolated. The conduct was, in various ways, repeated. Had the school staff decided, after the reports made by Mrs Cox, to implement more rigorous supervision of TH, there could have been no complaint of damage to the trusting relationship between teacher and pupils. Moreover, the suggestions that TH suffered from Attention Deficit Disorder imply that the staff were well aware of his behavioural problems. Neither the statements, not the result, in Hadba offer any comfort to the defendant. 
     
      
    81 I interpolate that in Hadba at [6], in a passage in which the facts were recounted, the Court observed (and presumably regarded as having some significance) that there was no evidence that the two children who had broken school rules had created any disciplinary problems in the past or had any tendency to behave dangerously. By contrast, TH's propensities were known to the school authorities independently of anything brought to their attention by Mrs Cox; and even if that were not so, the school was thoroughly on notice after Mrs Cox’s repeated complaints about the behaviour of TH towards the plaintiff. 
     
      
    82 In [21] the Court also reminded itself that there was no evidence of any serious accident on the equipment in the past, no evidence of pupils having behaved as these pupils did, and there was evidence that the school had a well-known and enforced policy against that kind of behaviour. 
     
      
    83 That further diminishes the applicability of the observations in [25], in which the Court considered that trust between teachers and pupils was of some importance in the educational function. That, in Hadba, was a factor contraindicating increased supervision. It may be contrasted with the present case. 
     
      
    84 Hadba has little to say that bears upon the decision in the present case. 
     
      
    85 It was also submitted on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff adduced no evidence “of witnesses” who observed any of the incidents; “of locations” where the incidents are alleged to have occurred; “of layout”; or “of signs of impending trouble”. This was said to be significant because there was an absence of evidence from which it could be inferred that the conduct of TH was observable by any of those in authority at the school. Again, this submission must be rejected. It ignores the evidence that the conduct of TH was expressly and repeatedly brought to the attention of various teachers, including at the highest level in the school. Unlike Hadba, this was not an isolated incident, which occurred unexpectedly, and which the school could not reasonably be expected to have foreseen. This conduct was conduct which was not only foreseeable, but of which the school had actual and repeated notice. As a consequence, it was necessary that the school take greater than normal steps to eliminate the bullying in this case. This was not a case of attempting to prevent something which may or may not have occurred; what was called for were steps that would eradicate a known course of conduct. 
     
      
    86 On the evidence I have already recorded, alone, I would have been prepared to find that the school authorities failed to exercise reasonable care to circumvent the attacks upon the plaintiff. 
     
      
    87 However, that is not all the evidence. Dr Keith Tronc provided an expert report and gave oral evidence. 
     
      
    88 Dr Tronc has been a primary school teacher and principal, a secondary school teacher, a teacher educator and Associate Professor of Education training both primary teachers and secondary teachers. His expertise is in the area of educational administration generally with special emphasis on issues of safety. He has written widely on educational issues. 
     
      
    89 In his report Dr Tronc dealt with the need for schools to implement effective anti-bullying programmes. He set out 23 specific items of “professional expectations and criteria” directed to the implementation of such programmes. I do not propose to set out the whole of his catalogue; it largely involves education of both staff and students; enforcement of strict policies; a management plan for eradicating bullying; the involvement of students as active participants in anti-bullying committees; and many variants and gradations of these. 
     
      
    90 Dr Tronc was not cross examined in such a way as to suggest that his approach was anything other than orthodox and conventional. It appears, to me, to make perfect sense. Moreover, no evidence was called on behalf of the defendant to suggest that any of these measures had been taken or considered at the Woodberry Public School. It is of some significance that it was clear that the defendant had itself taken expert advice and had been furnished with a report, but that no such report found its way into evidence. 
     
      
    91 Dr Tronc identified a series of deficiencies in supervision and in the school’s bullying prevention philosophy and methodology. He went so far as to express the view that, by reason of the persistence and seriousness of the assaults upon the plaintiff, TH ought to have been suspended from the school. 
     
      
    92 While I accept that the school had a delicate line to tread, it seems to me that there is considerable force in this view. Lurking in the background is the repeated suggestion that TH suffered from Attention Deficit Disorder. The defendant made no attempt to establish either that there was such a diagnosis, or even that the suggestion was reasonably based upon the observations of TH’s conduct, whether towards the plaintiff or otherwise. But it must be recognised that, if there were even a reasonably based suspicion of that diagnosis, then the school had a difficult task in balancing its duty to TH against its duty to the plaintiff. If that diagnosis were correct, suspension may not necessarily have been the correct approach, or, at least, the only correct approach. 
     
      
    93 But this is without real present significance; the fact is that the defendant made no attempt to explain the conduct of the school authorities or to show that they acted reasonably in all of the circumstances. And the evidence establishes to my satisfaction that the school’s responses to Mrs Cox’s repeated reports was dismally inadequate. The staff made no attempt to deal with a serious problem. In ignoring the behaviour of TH they grossly failed in their duty to the plaintiff. 
     
      
    94 Dr Tronc also criticised the school for failure to implement guidelines issued by the Department of Education for the management of critical incidents in schools. A “critical incident” is defined to include violence between students, or an assault upon a student. Two at least of the incidents may well have come within this definition. Dr Tronc commented upon a contrary view apparently contained in an expert’s report served by the defendant. This report was not evidence, and, apart from Dr Tronc’s response to it, I am in the dark as to its content. I do not find it necessary to enter into the debate, or to resolve the debate, as whether any of the assaults amounted to “a critical incident”. 
     
      
    95 In oral evidence, Dr Tronc expanded upon his answers, setting out where he considered the responses of the school to have been inadequate, and identifying what he considered would have been adequate or appropriate responses. For example, in relation to the 23 February incident (referred to in the evidence as the “choking” or “strangling” incident), Dr Tronc said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion an appropriate response would have been a fairly multi-faceted approach rather than mere reassurances of an oral nature. There should have been, in my view, conferences called with the parents of the alleged perpetrator of the bullying. In my view official reports should have been made to the Education Department by the school on the basis that such a serious incident as the causing of unconsciousness, that kind of assault is serious enough to constitute what is described as a critical incident in the New South Wales Department of Education’s policy at that time, and required witness statements and reports to go to the Education Department, so I would have thought that the school had an obligation to do that at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        It would have been more appropriate, or it would have been appropriate in my view for a good deal of communication to have occurred within the school so that all teachers were alerted to what had been alleged, and required to take special concern in observing the boy who had been named on a number of occasions as the perpetrator of the bullying. It would have been more appropriate to arrange for some sort of counselling of both boys, again in accordance with the Department of Education’s Critical Incidents Policy, where that is one of the fairly standard victim approaches that is recommended. 
        
       
       
        
        Certainly I am of the view, again in terms of the regime of sanctions which were then available in terms of behaviour management and disciplinary projects, that these incidents, particularly the repetitiveness of them and the seriousness of one or two of them, were enough to warrant suspension of the boy.” 
        
       
      
    96 In relation to the subsequent reports, up to the middle of 1995, Dr Tronc was of the view that the school response was insufficient and inappropriate; he would have expected for “something positive and active” to have been done, rather than the giving of mere reassurances. In relation to the July incident (the plaintiff being hit with a stick), Dr Tronc considered that the foreshadowed detention of TH was insufficient; that writing a letter to TH’s parents was one appropriate course of action; but that involving his parents in his supervision at the school was “totally inappropriate”. 
     
      
    97 Similarly, he considered that a response of detention and a letter to TH’s parents in relation to the incident of 8 August 1995 (attempting to stuff a jumper into the plaintiff’s mouth) was inadequate. He considered that the letter should have vigorously required TH’s parents to attend the school for a conference about his behaviour, and for some planning to take place about how best to protect the plaintiff. He considered that there should have been a good deal of communication with other members of staff so that teachers would be alert to the safety of the plaintiff and to scrutinise TH’s behaviour. 
     
      
    98 The approach taken on behalf of the defendant to Dr Tronc’s evidence, in cross examination, was somewhat disconcerting. In substance, the approach was that there was, in truth, nothing that the Woodberry School authorities could realistically have done to prevent the continued attacks. For example, Dr Tronc was asked if bullies are sometimes able to conceal their tendencies or behaviour; it was put to him that, on the assumption that TH had been spoken by police, and had continued to perpetrate the attacks, this suggested that he was “not easily deterred”; and, that being the case, that it was unlikely that he would be deterred by parallel action on the part of a teacher (it being implicit in the question that a teacher is a person of lesser authority and having fewer sanctions available than a policeman). Dr Tronc rejected the last part of the questioning; he placed some reliance on the fact that teachers are trained to deal with children and their discipline. The line of cross examination also overlooked the possibility of suspension of TH, or his removal from the school if he truly could not be controlled. 
     
      
    99 Considerable attention was also paid to the question of whether, on 23 February, the plaintiff had indeed lost consciousness. This was directed largely to the related question of whether the incident qualified as “a critical incident”. To my mind the issue is, at most, peripheral. Certainly, whether the plaintiff did lose consciousness, or did not, or whether it cannot be known, it is not determinative of any issue in the proceedings. 
     
      
    100 The evidence of Dr Tronc reinforces the view to which I would, in any event, have come. The school authorities responded quite inadequately to an escalating problem and failed to take such steps as were reasonably required to protect the plaintiff from the conduct of a plainly behaviourally disturbed older pupil. 
     
      
    101 Some gauge of the attitude of the school (and departmental) authorities is to be found in two items of evidence. These are the assertions (not denied) by Mr Wilson, on two occasions, that bullying builds character, and the remark by the school principal to the effect that some pupils would be lost to a school. These are revealing because they denote an attitude that does not suggest that any attention was paid to the amelioration of a serious situation. 
     
      
    102 The conclusion that the school authorities failed to discharge their duty of care to the plaintiff is therefore inevitable. 
     
      
       
      The plaintiff’s present condition 
       
      
    103 That the plaintiff now suffers from a severe psychiatric condition, to which various labels have been attached, and is unemployable, was the subject of general agreement. 
     
      
    104 Defining that condition need not occupy a great deal of this judgment. 
     
      
    105 The plaintiff has been the subject of intense scrutiny in a number of medical specialities. In a 2004 report to Centrelink, in respect of the plaintiff’s application for a disability pension, Dr Woods diagnosed major Depression/Anxiety, secondary to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, itself attributable to “severe bullying with near strangulation in primary school”. She described his current symptoms as “severe social phobia”, a “withdrawal from all activities involving contact with people outside the family”. In a section of her response to Centrelink’s questionnaire that directed her attention to the impact of the condition on the plaintiff’s ability to function, Dr Woods wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Severe anxiety outside own household 
         
        - unable to establish relationships or adequately communicate with non-family member 
         
        - anxiety can lead to aggression if pushed past ‘comfort zone’” 
        
       
      
    106 In May 2003 Dr Leonard Lambeth, a psychiatrist, diagnosed moderate Depression, moderate Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder and Asperger’s Disorder. Further investigation by Dr Geoffrey Rickarby, a psychiatrist specifically expert in Asperger’s Syndrome, excluded that disorder as a diagnosis. In April 2006 Dr Lambeth accepted the view of the expert better qualified in that respect, but adhered to the other diagnoses, and added to his list Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. 
     
      
    107 Dr Rickarby examined the plaintiff at the request of another psychiatrist, Dr John Miller (from whom no report was in evidence). Dr Rickarby’s diagnoses were of Separation Anxiety Disorder and Developing Personality Disorder with criteria from both avoidant and schizoid criteria. He added that the Separation Anxiety Disorder was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… associated (with) School Refusal – eg to malign variety that destroys all normal development.” 
        
       
      
    108 Dr Lambeth found the plaintiff to be hyper-vigilant, unable to mix with children, unable to concentrate, and exhibiting great difficulty in separating from his mother. He noted avoidance, aggression and the need for ongoing treatment. He concluded the plaintiff would be: 
     
      
       
        
        “… extremely unlikely to be engaged in any remunerative employment.” 
        
       
      
    109 Dr Anthony Slowiaczek, a certified child psychiatrist, treated the plaintiff from June 2001. His most recent report is dated 28 February 2002, and was directed to the Rivendell Adolescent Unit, for the purposes of the family assessment to which I have already referred. Because Dr Slowiaczek’s reports are not recent, they are of limited assistance in evaluating the plaintiff’s present condition. However, Dr Slowiaczek gave oral evidence. It was then four to five years since he had seen the plaintiff. In June 2001 Dr Slowiaczek made a retrospective diagnosis of acute recurrence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, precipitated by the need to select a high school for the following year. 
     
      
    110 Medical practitioners qualified on behalf of the defendant did not take issue with these diagnoses. In a report dated 28 July 2003, Dr Doron Samuell, who describes himself as a “clinical and forensic psychiatrist”, specified the plaintiff’s condition as severe Separation Anxiety Disorder. Although Dr Samuell provided several subsequent reports, he did not alter that opinion. 
     
      
    111 The plaintiff was also assessed, on behalf of the defendant, by Dr Anthony Milch, whose stationery describes him as a “child, family and adult psychiatrist”. Dr Milch provided an initial report, dated 3 November 2003, following his only personal assessment, which took place on 31 October 2003; and follow up reports, dated 26 October 2004, 30 March 2005, and 23 August 2005. 
     
      
    112 In his November 2003 report, Dr Milch found the plaintiff’s reported symptoms to have been consistent with acute Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Separation Anxiety Disorder, but did not find ongoing evidence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. He rejected a hypothesis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. He considered the prognosis to be poor, that it was then unlikely (as has proved to be the case) that the plaintiff would complete formal education, and that he would be “significantly impaired” in employment. He did note some features of Asperger’s Disorder, but insufficient to qualify for a diagnosis, and he posited, as an alternative, evolving Personality Disorder with avoidant and schizoid features. 
     
      
    113 In his second report Dr Milch expressly adopted Dr Lambeth’s diagnosis of Separation Anxiety Disorder. 
     
      
    114 Although, as I have mentioned, different labels were attached to the plaintiff’s undoubted psychiatric disability, the differences in labelling do not appear to me to be of any major significance. Nor did the parties appear to attach any significance to the terminology of the diagnoses. No medical practitioner was cross-examined, either about the characterisation of the condition, nor about its existence, and nor about the severity. The true issue, as the parties recognised, concerned causation. 
     
      
       
      Causation 
       
      
    115 The plaintiff’s claim is governed by the provisions of the Civil Liability Act 2002. Part 1A of that Act is concerned with negligence; Division 3 with causation. Therein appears s5D, bearing the subtitle “General principles”. Subss(1) and (2) provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        5D General principles 
         
         
        (1) A determination that negligence caused particular harm comprises the following elements: 
         
          
          (a) that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm (factual causation), and 
           
          (b) that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person’s liability to extend to the harm so caused (scope of liability). 
          
         
        (2) In determining in an exceptional case, in accordance with established principles, whether negligence that cannot be established as a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm should be accepted as establishing factual causation, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.” 
        
       
      
    116 It has been said that the principles there embodied are in accord with the common law: Ruddock v Taylor [2003] NSWCA 262; 58 NSWLR 269 at [89] per Ipp JA. 
     
      
    117 The relevant “harm” for the purposes of s5D(1)(a) is the psychiatric condition and disability now suffered by the plaintiff. Subject to the application of subs(2), for the plaintiff to succeed, it is necessary that he establish that, but for one or more of the incidents of which he complains, he would not suffer the condition or conditions he now does. 
     
      
    118 Through their medical advisors, the parties attempted to explore, in great detail, the causes of the plaintiff’s condition. It is apparent (not surprisingly) that the medical advisors brought to this question a test of causation consistent with a medical approach. That is not identical to the legal approach. At times, the differential is apparent, and has the effect that some of the reports do not directly address the issue for determination. However, there is sufficient in the reports to reach a firm conclusion. It is convenient to begin with an analysis of the medical evidence called on behalf of the defendant. 
     
      
    119 A major focus of the analysis concerned the contribution, if any, made to the plaintiff’s present condition by what is accepted to be his mother’s psychiatric difficulties. She has a long history of depression, for which she has been treated, at times in hospital. There has also been depression diagnosed in other members of the family – the plaintiff’s father has suffered depression consequential upon workplace injury, and there are also reports (unconfirmed) of other relatives suffering from the same illness. 
     
      
    120 The defendant’s position on causation may be encapsulated as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) even if the plaintiff did indeed suffer some trauma and/or anxiety at the time of the assaults and harassment in 1994 and 1995, his subsequent history of satisfactory school attendance, participation in school excursions and playing football demonstrates that the effect of the bullying came to an end shortly after he transferred to Black Hill Public School; 
       
       
      (ii) that the true cause of his current condition is to be found in either or both of his genetic history, and the (unintentionally) malign influence of his mother. 
       
      
    121 Dr Samuell, in his first report (28 July 2003), having referred to the various diagnoses, turned his attention specifically to the question of causation. Dr Samuell wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Children who develop separation anxiety will often develop this problem due to a constellation of factors. These include genetic predisposition, developmental factors and external events. In this case there are contributions from many sources.” 
        
       
       
      These sources included the strong family history of depression. Dr Samuell also included reference to a tragic event that occurred when the plaintiff was aged 13. A friend of the family, to whom the plaintiff was very close, was accidentally drowned in a boating accident, in which the plaintiff’s father was involved. Dr Samuell considered that this event would have had a significant impact. Dr Samuell also considered that parenting style may have contributed to the plaintiff’s current difficulties. Dr Samuell then wrote: 
       
       
        
        “In view of the nature of this current litigation, the core question of the impact that the earlier assault would have had on him is of course germane. 
        
       
       
        
        If the contemporaneous historical information that was provided to me is indeed accurate, it does support the contention that Ben experienced difficulties as a consequence of assaults by a fellow student. 
        
       
       
        
        It is now some time since those assaults occurred and I am not in a position to make a retrospective diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I can say though that in my opinion the diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder does not adequately account for Ben’s difficulties. The diagnosis is, at present, that of Separation Anxiety Disorder. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view the nature of Ben’s difficulties are (sic) likely to be at least bi-modal. In the first instance his exposure to the schoolyard problem was probably the cause of the school refusal, but in latter years, as an unremembered event, it has become the focus of misattribution due to the other factors I have described above.”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    122 Dr Samuell concluded this report by writing: 
     
      
       
        
        “In summary, whilst I do accept that the events in 1994 and 1995 did contribute to the difficulties Ben experienced, other external, genetic and developmental factors are likely to have much greater explanatory value at present.” 
        
       
      
    123 Some time later Dr Samuell was asked a series of specific questions. Inter alia, he was asked to explain what he meant by “the focus of misattribution”. He replied that Mrs Cox attributes her son’s school refusal to the bullying and that, in his view, this was “a misattribution”. He wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “The correct attribution of her son’s difficulties is more probably his relationship with his mother and his mother’s significant psychopathology.” 
        
       
      
    124 In that same report (dated 1 April 2005) Dr Samuell undertook an extensive examination of Mrs Cox’s developmental and psychiatric history. The source of his information is set out at the commencement of his report, and includes a large number of medical reports and hospital notes. Not all of these found their way separately into evidence. However, it was not suggested that Dr Samuell approached his examination of Mrs Cox’s condition on any false premise. He concluded that she suffered from an Anxiety Disorder and that her anxiety must be seen to have contributed significantly to the psychopathology in the plaintiff. 
     
      
    125 A key question directed to Dr Samuell is recorded in the transcript as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … Specifically, is it likely that the plaintiff would be in the same position now if the alleged assault did not occur, that is, is it likely the plaintiff would have recovered from the bullying but for the over-enmeshed relationship with is (sic) mother?” 
        
       
       
      His answer was: 
       
       
        
        “… In my opinion, the development of separation anxiety by then could be explained by maternal factors alone.  
        It is entirely possible  
        that Ben would have developed a separation anxiety disorder irrespective of his own adverse school experiences. Angel (sic) Cox’s difficulties were likely to have contributed significant difficulty to the resolution of Ben’s separation anxiety. Often an adverse event becomes a  
        de facto 
         rationalisation for both a child and a parent to legitimise the dependent and enmeshed relationship. Because adverse events in a school are fairly common, a pre-disposed individual, such as Ben, is particularly vulnerable to the development of such a disorder due to the dynamic in his relationship with his manifestly unwell mother.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    126 Dr Samuell was also asked, in the event that the additional material with which he had been provided caused him to vary his previously expressed opinions, to set out his then current opinion and the basis for the variation. He replied that he had not substantially altered his opinions. But he added: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, the role that Angela Cox has played in the evolution of her son’s difficulties cannot be understated. It seems to me more likely than not that Angela Cox may have both inadvertently caused and perpetuated her son’s separation anxiety resulting in a significant problem with school refusal. It is unclear in my mind now if the school assaults played any significant role in the evolution of the separation anxiety.” 
        
       
      
    127 In his final report, dated 20 April 2005, in response to a request for further clarification, Dr Samuell explained the last sentence of that answer. He wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “My explicit meaning is that I do not know whether the assault has played any significant role in the evolution of the separation anxiety.” 
        
       
      
    128 Although Dr Samuell gave oral evidence, neither his examination in chief nor his cross examination threw any new light upon this issue. 
     
      
    129 Dr Milch also paid considerable attention in his reports to the issue of causation. In his first report (3 November 2003) he stated his opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “… these symptoms and complaints are not referable solely or even primarily related to the incidents alleged to have occurred in 1994 and 1995.” 
        
       
      
    130 However, he added that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The alleged incidents were noted to have triggered substantive emotional and behavioural problems.” 
        
       
       
      He considered the reported symptomatology to have been consistent with acute Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Separation Anxiety Disorder at that time, but that there had not been ongoing evidence of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. He recorded: 
       
       
        
        “… [a]n enmeshed relationship … between Ben and his mother which had served to reinforce avoidant strategies.” 
        
       
       
      He then reported: 
       
       
        
        “7. The family history of psychiatric illness is likely to have played an exacerbating role with regard to the plaintiff’s current condition. Maternal depression will commonly amplify separation anxiety symptomatology and is often the primary aetiological factor. The father’s history of depression and injury has also had a substantive impact on the family functioning. The plaintiff also has a possible genetic predisposition resulting in depressive and anxiety symptomatology.” 
        
       
      
    131 In his next report (26 October 2004) Dr Milch referred to the report of a Dr Miller, a report which was not in evidence. Dr Milch commented upon, and in part disagreed with, the contents of that report. In particular, he questioned a statement which he described as “categorical” and which he extracted in his report as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Obviously it seems that the bullying this boy received at the commencement of kindergarten led him to being predisposed to ongoing anxiety about attending school which has been aggravated by an over enmeshed relationship with his mother.” 
        
       
      
    132 Dr Milch wrote that he agreed: 
     
      
       
        
        “… that bullying experienced at the commencement of kindergarten was a likely precipitating event to anxiety about attending school.” 
        
       
       
      However, he expressed concern at the absence of more detailed histories of parental depressive illness in the expression of opinions such as that which he cited. He reiterated that the plaintiff’s mother’s depressive symptoms had directly impacted upon her parenting capacity and considered that the importance of the genetic predisposition to depression and anxiety should also be considered as of significance. 
       
      
    133 On 30 March 2005 Dr Milch reported again in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. In my assessment, it was my opinion that the psychiatric history of the plaintiff’s parents and in particular the plaintiff’s mother had had a significant impact upon the plaintiff’s own psychiatric condition. The document provided substantively supports this view and highlights the profound nature of such issues. Indeed, on the basis of the psychopathology described in this documentation it is my view that the psychiatric condition of the plaintiff’s mother alone would satisfactorily explain the plaintiff’s emotional and behavioural disturbance.” 
        
       
      
    134 Dr Milch then set out something of Mrs Cox’s psychiatric history and wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is well recognised that such a level of parental psychopathology, with associated impairment in parenting capacity, and the associated recurrent periods of separation from the children are common aetiological factors in the development of and maintenance of Separation Anxiety Disorder and phobic avoidance strategies in vulnerable children. Both genetic and environmental factors will contribute to this vulnerability … 
        
       
       
        
        2. It is my view that it is  
        quite possible  
        that the plaintiff would be in the same position now, suffering from the same psychiatric conditions, if the alleged assault had not occurred. It is, in my view,  
        highly likely  
        that the plaintiff would have recovered from the bullying but for the enmeshed relationship with his mother, in the context of her mental illness. … 
        
       
       
        
        4. The enclosed subpoenaed documentation lead me to consolidate my opinion that the maternal psychopathology has been a primary factor in the development of the plaintiff’s emotional and behavioural disturbance and resultant disability and handicap.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    135 On 23 August 2005 Dr Milch stated his opinion that the plaintiff’s condition is a complex one, with a range of contributing factors; in those circumstances he stated as his professional opinion that it would be inappropriate specifically to identify a single cause of the Separation Anxiety Disorder that he diagnosed and that to delineate a single cause of the disorder would be simplistic and incorrect. He restated this view on 27 September 2005. 
     
      
    136 In oral evidence Dr Milch was asked about the impact, if any, of the pre-existence of separation anxiety symptoms to his opinion. His answer was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The significance in this matter would be that the child was already vulnerable, had already experienced symptoms of separation anxiety and therefore would be more vulnerable to the impact of any additional stressors by nature of the underlying vulnerability. Separation anxiety is associated with both the experience of anxiety and avoidant behaviour. If that is present in the context of a trauma it is likely that the trauma will be more difficult to resolve.” 
        
       
       
      In cross examination he expressly accepted that the instances of bullying had an effect on the plaintiff’s psychological state. He was then asked if his view was that that effect was exacerbated by the family dynamics. It is worth extracting a fairly long answer: 
       
       
        
        “… It was my assessment that there were many factors which had contributed to the development of Ben's substantive emotional and physical and behavioural vulnerableness which had continued and I was very concerned by his persistent anxiety symptoms and avoidant behaviour, all of which continue to magnify the problems. The issue with, the issues that I was concerned with in my report was that there were many factors in my assessment which had been germane to the development of this situation. Certainly the types of issues that were identified with regard to the mother's significant history of psychopathology is the type of context which, first of all, from genetic factors, and secondly from environmental factors, exposure to likely disorganised attachment, exposure to the recurrent experiences of separation and loss, exposure to the type of parenting strategies to manage issues as they came along, which would make Ben in this situation significantly vulnerable with or without a history of trauma. If trauma occurs in that context certainly it can significantly exacerbate that vulnerability. The way in which the vulnerability is then managed by the family is likely to have a profound impact upon the development and persistence of emotional or behavioural problems, and to consider the trauma on its own without consideration of these factors, from an assessment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist, it was my view that that was incorrect, that there were many factors which rendered Ben vulnerable and certainly in my experience I have seen the development of significant psychopathology where simply those factors alone have been evident without the history of trauma.” 
        
       
      
    137 Dr Milch said that he had understood from the history he had been given that the plaintiff had been vulnerable to stuttering and that the instances of bullying had precipitated an exacerbation. 
     
      
    138 When asked about the plaintiff’s avoidance of public toilets in the context of some instances of the bullying being said to have occurred in the vicinity of school toilets, Dr Milch proposed two possibilities: the first was that it was a direct consequence of the experience of bullying and was specific avoidance related to that; the second was that it was a manifestation of the plaintiff’s general experience of social anxiety. When pressed, he finally said: 
     
      
       
        
        “With regards to that, to that specific issue, certainly if there is a specific trauma that has resulted in specific behaviour, certainly it is more likely. As I indicated, there are other possibilities in this case, given his experience of anxiety and phobic avoidance in a range of circumstances. But certainly it is more likely that if there was a specific trauma associated with this, then that’s a specific response.” 
        
       
      
    139 Finally, Dr Milch accepted that, the plaintiff having been vulnerable, and having been exposed to the trauma, a psychiatric response was “certainly in part” caused by that trauma. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I would, I would agree with that proposition, however, it was caused by the trauma in the context of there being a range of other causal factors.” 
        
       
      
    140 I turn now to consider the medical evidence on this issue adduced on behalf of the plaintiff. Dr Lambeth, who, it will be remembered, diagnosed Depression, Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder and (initially) Asperger’s Disorder, expressed the following opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “… The depression and anxiety disorders are more probably than not the result of the constant harassment and assaults at the school, which occurred in 1994 and 1995. I have no doubt that there was almost certainly a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder arising from these assaults, but this is not something that is clinically evident at present. … 
        
       
       
        
        There is a history of depression in Benjamin’s mother. I do not think that this played a significant role in the aetiology of Benjamin’s disorders. 
        
       
       
        
        This is a young man who is now socially and educationally isolated, he is constantly anxious and afraid. He is, quite understandably, depressed and, in my opinion, it is more probable than not (indeed very highly probable) that this has resulted from the treatment he received early in his school year.” 
        
       
      
    141 Dr Lambeth repeated this opinion in a report of 11 November 2003. On 3 April 2006 Dr Lambeth reported again, apparently in response to a request for comment upon other medical reports. Specifically, this report is directed to the question of any cause of or contribution to the plaintiff’s condition by his mother’s condition. He accepted that it was “highly possible” that Mrs Cox’s history of depressive illness with possible abuse and chronic illness as a child, and the possibility of a variant of borderline personality disorder, would indicate a degree of genetic predisposition in the plaintiff. Depression in the plaintiff’s father was also an indicator of genetic predisposition in the plaintiff. He accepted that the plaintiff was “certainly vulnerable”. 
     
      
    142 He then added: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, vulnerability is not frank disorder. It would appear to me that Benjamin was a person at the time of the assaults upon him, who was very vulnerable to contracting some type of psychiatric illness, but the fact of the matter is that he was assaulted, and thereafter certainly appears to have deteriorated. Trauma is something it is very widely accepted that may cause psychological problems. …  
        
       
       
        
        I believe that one can view Benjamin as a child who at the time of the assaults upon him was very vulnerable, given the very high probability of a strong genetic history. 
        
       
       
        
        Benjamin may well at that time even have had the beginnings of an Anxiety Disorder, a Separation Anxiety Disorder, and even developing Personality Disorder.  
        
       
       
        
        Then he was assaulted. The question is whether this exacerbated pre-existing problems, and it most certainly did in my opinion. … 
        
       
       
        
        Therefore, had at the time of the bullying Ben been a completely normal child with no genetic history, and no probability of other disorders that may have been subclinical, it is in my opinion  
        more probable than not  
        that he would have recovered from the trauma of the bullying. 
        
       
       
        
        That being said, he was not a normal child, there was a genetic vulnerability, there may well have been subclinical disorders. Therefore the bullying impacted upon a person who was already at risk and any pre-existing problem was at very least exacerbated and prolonged. 
        
       
       
        
        Looking at your second question as to whether on the balance of probabilities Ben would be in the same condition now even if the bullying had not occurred,  
        I believe on the balance of probabilities 
        , he would not be in the same condition now. I think the bullying was in fact the major precipitating factor, certainly in terms of the Workers Compensation Act; it was a substantial contributing factor. All psychiatric disorder is multifactorial in aetiology, and I believe that the fact of the bullying should be seen as ‘the straw that broke the camel’s back’ in Benjamin’s case.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    143 If anything, Dr Lambeth’s view was expressed more forcefully in evidence in chief. Dr Lambeth was specifically asked whether he had considered the question whether, had the bullying not occurred, and given the plaintiff’s undoubted genetic predisposition, he would have, eventually, come to the predicament in which he now finds himself. Dr Lambeth replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I considered that and I stated I believe that I don’t think he would have been. The bullying was the initiating factor. Now, we don’t know if there would have been some other episode later in his life that might have caused it. The fact is that this was the episode that caused the problem.” 
        
       
      
    144 In cross examination he was asked if there were any room for the view that the period of apparent relative calm between 1995 (sic – probably 1996) and 2001 evidenced “complete remission of any anxiety associated with the trauma”. Dr Lambeth replied in the negative. 
     
      
    145 Dr Lambeth was cross examined on the weight that ought to be given to evidence of the plaintiff’s condition and behaviour during that period – of satisfactory school attendance, participation in excursions, playing football. He declined to accept that the circumstances indicated that the plaintiff had recovered from the trauma of 1994 and 1995 and that his condition from 2002 represented, not a relapse or recurrence of the pre-existing condition, but, in reality, a new and different condition. 
     
      
    146 The evidence satisfies me that Dr Lambeth’s approach is to be preferred. It is wrong to characterise the period of “relative calm” between 1996 and 2001 as anything other than a partial subsidence of the plaintiff’s anxiety symptoms. He continued to manifest those symptoms, although to a lesser degree: he, throughout, refused to enter public toilets; he refused to change in the change rooms at football; he required extensive support during the school excursions. 
     
      
    147 That the symptoms flared up again on his contemplating high school is best explained by Dr Lambeth in his evidence in chief. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The incidents [which I take to mean various incidents of bullying] would lay down memories. This is typical of the way post-traumatic stress disorder is laid down and affects the brain. The memories are there and, of course, avoidance behaviour is what is necessary. Now, many people who have post-traumatic stress disorder, their avoidance behaviour is adaptive, so they adapt to their life by the use of avoidance. They are then able to live sometimes, for many years, a life in which there is no overt symptomology … We, therefore, know … that PTSD is essentially characterised by a delayed onset of symptoms in many, many cases.” 
        
       
      
    148 When properly examined the opinions of Dr Samuell and Dr Wilson do not exclude the 1994 and 1995 as a cause of the plaintiff’s present disability. They place far greater emphasis upon genetic and environmental factors, but (perhaps implicitly) recognise the impact of TH's behaviour. 
     
      
    149 On behalf of the defendant the following submission as to the application of s5D(1)(a) of the Civil Liability Act was made: 
     
      
       
        
        “93. s5D(1)(a) of the CLA introduces a test of causation which is different from the egg shell skull rule. The section requires, in the present case, that the Court be satisfied that the negligence was necessary to the development by the plaintiff of the conditions from which he suffers. 
         
         
        94. Such a conclusion is not open by virtue of the concession that he had a vulnerability which was apt to be uncovered by the ordinary stresses of life: in other words, the negligence here in question was not ‘necessary’ to the plaintiff being as he is.” 
        
       
      
    150 There are a number of flaws in this argument. Firstly, it misapprehends the relationship (if any) between s5D and the “egg shell skull rule”. The egg shell skull rule, as I understand it, makes a tortfeasor liable for injury caused by his or her tort, even where that injury is disproportionate (by reason of particular vulnerability in the plaintiff) to what might ordinarily be expected. It is not a rule of causation. 
     
      
    151 Secondly, the submission in para 94 overstates the evidence. Although the evidence was clear that the plaintiff was vulnerable, it did not go so far as to establish that that vulnerability “was apt to be uncovered by the ordinary stresses of life”. I would accept, as a matter of reality, that the plaintiff’s pre-existing vulnerability left him open to descent into periods of anxiety and depression. It did not establish that that vulnerability left him open to either the condition of Separation Anxiety Disorder or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  
     
      
    152 Thirdly, this submission appears to assume that vulnerability in a plaintiff saves a tortfeasor from the consequences of his or her tort. That is not the effect of s5D.  
     
      
    153 Fourthly, the question relevant to causation is not whether or not the plaintiff would, in other circumstances and at some other time, have succumbed to his vulnerability and suffered some other psychiatric disorder. (That is a question which may be relevant to the assessment of damages, either on the principles stated in Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 20; 169 CLR 638 or in the assessment of the appropriate of any damages awarded by reason of vicissitudes.) 
     
      
    154 What s5D is directed to is the “particular harm” suffered by the plaintiff; and whether the negligence established was a necessary condition for the occurrence of that harm. (This, to my mind, is no more than a statutory formulation of the “but for” test that is familiar in tort law: see, for example, March v E and M H Stramare Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 12; 171 CLR 506; Nader v Urban Transport Authority of NSW (1985) 2 NSWLR 501 at 531, and the authorities there cited.) 
     
      
    155 The “particular harm” suffered by the plaintiff was the condition or conditions variously described by the psychiatric witnesses, as “Separation Anxiety Disorder”, “Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder”, and Depression. Having regard to the chain of events, and the evidence, that I accept, that during his period of partial respite, the plaintiff nevertheless continued to manifest symptoms of anxiety, related to the conduct of TH, I am satisfied that the negligence established was indeed was a necessary condition of the occurrence of that harm. It is not essential, for the purposes of s5D, that the negligence established the sole cause of the “particular harm”. 
     
      
    156 Accordingly, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has satisfied the causation test. 
     
      
    157 On behalf of the defendant, the following submission also was made: 
     
      
       
        
        “89. The ‘nature and conditions’ aspect of the allegations of bullying do not involve physical injury. In order to recover for any damage caused by this the plaintiff must prove that by virtue of it he suffers from a recognisable psychiatric illness: there is no evidence to support such a conclusion.” 
        
       
      
    158 A need to prove a recognisable psychiatric illness arises from s31 of the Civil Liability Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “31  
        Pure mental harm – liability only for recognised psychiatric illness 
         
         
          
          There is no liability to pay damages for pure mental harm resulting from negligence unless the harm consists of a recognised psychiatric illness.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    159 There is ample evidence, extracted above, that the plaintiff does suffer from a recognisable psychiatric illness. I reject the submission. 
     
      
    160 It follows that the plaintiff is entitled to an award of damages.  
     
      
       
      DAMAGES 
       
      
    161 The plaintiff claims damages under five heads: 
     
      
       
      (i) non-economic loss; 
       
       
      (ii) past economic loss; 
       
       
      (iii) future economic loss; 
       
       
      (iv) superannuation; 
       
       
      (v) out of pocket expenses. 
       
       
      Non-economic loss 
       
      
    162 The award of damages for non-economic loss is governed by s16 of the Civil Liability Act. No damages may be awarded under this head unless the severity of the non-economic loss is at least 15 percent of the most extreme case. A maximum amount is prescribed, but may be awarded only in a most extreme case. A table prescribes the amounts that may be awarded in respect of the non-economic loss, proportionate to the most extreme case, that is found. 
     
      
    163 The first task, then, is to determine whether the severity of the plaintiff’s non-economic loss is or is not at least 15 percent of a most extreme case. 
     
      
    164 I have no difficulty in finding that it is. His adolescence has been all but destroyed; his adulthood will not be any better. He will never know the satisfaction of employment. He will suffer anxiety and depression, almost certainly, for the rest of his life. He is unlikely to form any relationships, romantic or platonic. He has no friends and is unlikely to make any. 
     
      
    165 Given that his injury is, in effect, a whole of life injury, I accept, as proposed on his behalf, that the severity of his non-economic loss should be assessed as at 50 percent of a most extreme case. 
     
      
       
      Economic loss 
       
      
    166 Although the plaintiff’s injury dates back to 1995, when he was six, its real manifestation dates from 2001 or 2002. Because, at that time, he had established no pattern of employment, there is, of course, almost no direct evidence on which to base any real findings about what his employment would have been had he not suffered the injury. His father was, so far as the evidence discloses, a manual or unskilled worker, who suffered some injury at work, and some periods of unemployment. His mother, as set out above, suffered from psychiatric disabilities which largely excluded her from the workforce. I have already accepted that the plaintiff was vulnerable to similar periods of anxiety and depression, even without the negligence of the Woodberry School authorities.  
     
      
    167 The best I can do is to accept the proposition that damages for economic loss, both past and future, ought to be calculated in accordance with average weekly earnings.  
     
      
       
      Superannuation 
       
      
    168 It was proposed that an allowance of superannuation based upon 11 percent of the “net” ought to be made. No separate argument was addressed, by either party, to this. Subject to hearing any further submissions I would propose to accept this figure. Since it will be necessary for the parties to perform the calculations of damages, I will allow an opportunity for further argument in this respect. 
     
      
       
      Out of pocket expenses 
       
      
    169 No figure was provided in respect out of pocket expenses accumulated to date. It will be necessary for the parties to attempt to reach agreement on this issue. 
     
      
       
      Discount for vicissitudes 
       
      
    170 I have referred above to a potential impact of the plaintiff’s pre-existing vulnerability on the assessment of the discount to be made in respect of vicissitudes. This is not an easy question. I am satisfied that the allowance ought to be greater than the usual 15 percent. Counsel for the defendant proposed 30 percent. I will allow 25 percent. 
     
      
    171 The orders I make at present are: 
     
      
       
      (1) Verdict for the plaintiff; 
       
       
      (2) Defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings; 
       
       
      (3) Parties to bring in short minutes of order reflecting the findings and conclusions herein.

    JUDGMENTThe name of the complainant and any particular whereby she may be identified, including the names of her siblings and her mother, must not be published. By consent, however, I authorise that the name of the offender may be published in respect of the judgment.SENTENCE1 On 23 February this year Rodney Thomas Phipps was found guilty by a jury of eleven counts of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child who was between the age of twelve and fifteen at the relevant times and on five counts of aggravated indecent assault. He was therefore convicted of those offences and remanded in custody.2 In each case the aggravating circumstance was that the victim of the offences was the offender’s stepdaughter, B. At the time of the first offence about the Queen’s Birthday holiday weekend in June 1998 she was twelve years old. At the time of the last offence charged she was fifteen years old. The prisoner was between twenty-nine and thirty-three years old at the time of the offences. 3 These offences form part of a continuing pattern of what amounted to virtual sexual servitude. Over the period of these offences the offender became obsessed with the victim, although there was evidence that he had previously been convicted in respect of indecent assaults on three of the complainant’s sisters. He served a term of imprisonment for those matters. This record of previous similar offences must be regarded as a factor aggravating these offences.4 After extensive argument I have admitted as “context” evidence, evidence of uncharged occasions upon which the accused and complainant had various forms of sexual intercourse and other sexual contact over the period of these offences. In her evidence the complainant said that she thought that over that period there was sexual contact by the offender with her on five days out of seven. I can only sentence the offender in respect of those offences of which he has been convicted. However, the evidence even in respect of the matters charged shows a continuing pattern of the most flagrant sexual exploitation by the offender of his stepdaughter. It is rare to see a case where a person in authority has abused that authority to the extent or for the length of time that happened in the case of this offender with his stepdaughter, B..5 The offences charged include: penile-vaginal intercourse, oral intercourse, anal intercourse and repeated sexual touching. The victim also gave evidence, as part of the uncharged evidence, of sexual contact in the form of cunnilingus by the offender on her, on a number of occasions before he put his penis in her vagina.6 The complainant was born on 20 November 1985, so that at all material times she was aged between twelve and fifteen. Also at all material times the offender was in a de facto relationship with the complainant’s mother, WB.. That relationship commenced late in 1993. WB had four other daughters from previous relationships, and a son, of whom the prisoner is the father. During the relationship some, at least, of the girls were known by the name, Phipps, although there was no formal change of name. B. was certainly known as B. Phipps and was enrolled at all material times at high school under that name. 7 Over the period during which these offences were committed the complainant’s mother, WB, was working at the Collingwood Service Station at Liverpool. She worked shifts on a three day rotation. Mostly she worked either morning or afternoon shifts. If she worked afternoon shifts she worked from 3pm to 11pm. The complainant said that all the offences that took place in the family home took place either when her mother was at work, or at night when her mother and the brother and sisters were asleep.8 There was evidence that for part of the period three of the complainant’s sisters, M, E and S, lived in the family home. Another sister, R, had moved out before the first of the offences. There was evidence that M, who had a young son, lived in the house only for short times. At other relevant times she lived at Coolah. After charges were laid against the offender in respect of E and S, they also left the family home. However, they were present at some relevant times and both gave evidence, which corroborated the complainant’s evidence in important respects.9 The complainant’s evidence was that on each occasion when penile-vaginal intercourse took place between the offender and her, except one which was not charged, the offender would withdraw his penis from her vagina before ejaculating on her stomach, on her back or on the floor. There is no evidence that he ever had protected sex, and that had some unfortunate sequences for the victim, which I will refer to later.10 For the purposes of sentencing the prisoner, I will define the offences into those which were committed while the family was living at various addresses in the Liverpool/Campbelltown area. The specific matters in respect of which the offender was convicted are as follows;11 The offences in counts 1 to 6 were committed while the family were living at Leumeah; in counts 7 to 10, while the family lived at Long Point; in counts 11 to 15 while they lived at B.... Drive, St Andrews and in count 16 while they lived at S..... Rd, St Andrews. The facts of each offence are as follows:Count 1In June 1998 the prisoner came into the complainant’s bedroom on the lower floor of the house where the family was living. He removed her underpants and placed his penis in her vagina. He threatened to kill her if she made a noise and at one stage placed a pillow over her face to stop her making a noise.Count 2When the complainant was having her thirteenth birthday party in the garage at Leumeah, the offender called her into the formal lounge room of the house, kissed her and put his tongue in her mouth.Count 3Between 30 July and 23 September 1998 while the movie, “Sliding Doors” was showing at the Greater Union Cinema, Macarthur Square, the victim asked the prisoner if she could go to see that movie with her boyfriend. He told her that she could go if she put her hand on his penis, and she did so.Count 4The complainant moved from the downstairs bedroom to a bedroom on the upper floor where she slept in the top bunk of a set of bunks. There was evidence that the bottom bunk was a double bed. The offender climbed into the top bunk, removed the complainant’s underpants and put his penis into her vagina.Count 5The offender took the victim into his bedroom and caused her to kneel on the bed facing out the window. He then took up a position behind her and placed his penis in her vagina from behind.Count 6On one occasion the victim was ‘jigging’ school and was at home when the prisoner came home. He undertook to “fix things at school” if the complainant agreed to let him have anal sex with her. He rubbed her anus with baby oil and put his penis inside it, but because of the pain this caused her to move forward, so that his penis came out of her anus. He then placed his penis in her vagina. Later she noticed that her anus was bleeding and felt sore.Count 7One evening the complainant and the offender were sitting together on a modular sofa in the lounge room. The offender put his hand on the outside of the complainant's vagina. The complainant’s sister, M came into the room at that stage and when the prisoner saw M he removed his hand and started tickling the victim’s knee.Count 8One afternoon the prisoner collected the children from their schools and took them home. He went into the victim’s bedroom and put his penis into her vagina from behind. The complainant’s sister, E tried to get into the room but could not do so, because the door was locked. She wanted to get some clothes. The offender then hid in the complainant’s wardrobe while E entered the room and then left it. The prisoner then left the room. On this occasion the victim said that the prisoner did not ejaculate.Count 9The house at Leumeah was badly damaged by fire and the family moved to Long Point. One day the offender took the victim in his car to the Leumeah property. There he took her into the lower bedroom, near the garage, removed her clothes and put his penis into her vagina from behind.Count 10The prisoner took the victim in his car to a place off a dirt road near the Glenfield Railway Station. There he placed the complainant’s head on his penis and made her suck it until he ejaculated in her mouth. She opened the door and spat the semen onto the ground.Count 11The victim and her sister, E asked the prisoner if he would buy them cigarettes. He agreed to do this if they agreed to let him feel their vaginas under their underpants. He bought them cigarettes. Some days later he came into the bedroom they shared at night and said, “It’s time, who wants to go first?” He then proceeded to touch both girls on the vagina. E saw him place his hand under the blanket in the area of the victim’s groin.Count 12About St Valentine’s Day the offender told the complainant that he had a surprise for her. He gave her a black bra and panties embroidered with red hearts. He then showed her a vibrator, which she described as being purple and which flashed when it was turned on. Later she came to his bedroom where he used the vibrator on her before putting his penis in her vagina.Count 13During the Sydney Olympics there were extended school holidays. The victim, her brother and her sisters, E and S, all went to stay with their older sister, M, at Coolah. The day after they returned to Sydney the prisoner took the victim to a dirt road near a preschool in the Ingleburn/Denholm Court area in his car. There he put his penis into her mouth and ejaculated into it.Count 14The complainant went to the sixteenth birthday party of her friend, Rebecca. Another friend, Helen, was also at the party. The offender collected Helen and the victim from the party and drove Helen home. He then said to the victim, “You’ve had sex,” and unbuttoned her jeans. He put his fingers on her vagina and continued to say that he knew that she had had sex.Count 15By afternoon the offender took the victim into the bathroom and locked the door. They both removed their clothes. The prisoner then bent the victim over the bath, which was next to the shower, and put his penis into her vagina from behind.Count 16The prisoner telephoned the victim while she was at work at the St Andrews Take Away. He asked her to come to his place of work, which was at Liverpool, and she did so. He then drove her home, took her to the bedroom and put his penis into her vagina.12 Because these offences were all committed against a child, consent is irrelevant. It is clear that although the first offence was accompanied by a threat of violence and although the complainant said she did not complain or mention the matters because she was in fear of the offender, the relationship developed so that she became quite, indeed almost totally, dependent upon him. She said that she continued to have sexual contact with him partly because of the fear that she felt for herself and particularly because of the fear that she felt for her mother, and because she had been brought by the prisoner to feel that he was the only person in the world who understood her. She gave evidence that on one occasion she consented to sexual contact when he promised not to hit her mother anymore.13 Dependency of this type is not uncommon in cases where an offender has a long period to manipulate the victim, as the prisoner did in this case. There was ample evidence of violence by the prisoner towards WB. There was also evidence that from time to time he hit or slapped the children. It is understandable that the victim was in fear of him. There was also evidence that her natural father had left the household when she was very young and that the offender was the only father that she knew. It is not surprising that she felt a mixture of hatred and dependence towards him. This emotional situation was something that the prisoner exploited to the full.14 While the prisoner was in gaol for the offences against the sisters, he wrote a number of letters to the victim, which described his sexual fantasies about her in lurid detail. The similarity between what he described in those letters and the matters about which the victim gave evidence is remarkable. He admitted to the police and he gave evidence at the trial that he had had sexual intercourse with the victim, but he said that this was after she turned sixteen and it had happened at her instigation. The jury clearly rejected this evidence.15 Her letters to him at the time indicate that she had developed sexual feelings towards him and it is not disputed that the two had arranged that on his release from prison they intended to go away together. The fact that this could happen indicates the extent to which the offender had consciously manipulated his stepdaughter to become his sexual plaything.16 The complainant read a victim impact statement to the Court. What she said does not, in general, come as a surprise. Nor does the report of Associate Professor Quadrio that forms part of that statement. That psychiatrist had diagnosed that the complainant is suffering from a chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. The victim says that as a result of her treatment at the hands of the prisoner she has low self-confidence and low self-esteem. She has difficulty with people in authority. She lacks decisiveness. 17 She has produced a medical certificate showing that she now suffers from genital herpes. This condition is incurable. Apart from its recurrent nature and the physical discomfort it causes, it also causes her embarrassment in her relationships. This is a complication which is a constant physical reminder of the abuse which she has suffered.18 The fact that the relationship developed to the extent that it did indicates the extent to which the prisoner had consciously manipulated his stepdaughter to become his sexual toy. His conduct towards her, and to her stepsisters, which led to his earlier conviction, suggests that he does not understand or appreciate the appropriate boundaries for the behaviour of parents. 19 On each charge of aggravated indecent assault there will be a sentence of a fixed term of four years. That is less than the current standard non-parole period for this offence, but it is not, apparently, out of the range of sentences for such offences imposed at the time. The offences of indecent assault must be regarded as being at or, in the case of count 2 perhaps, possibly slightly below the middle range of seriousness for this offence. There is no need to fix a total term because there is no chance that the offender will be released at the expiry of the non-parole periods due to the length of his sentences on the more serious charges.20 The maximum penalty for each aggravated sexual intercourse offence at the time was ten years imprisonment. The prisoner is fortunate in that the penalties for this offence, if committed now, are twice as severe as they were at the time of these offences. His sentences will therefore be lighter than they would be if the offences had been committed now. 21 Because of the manipulative behaviour on his part these offences must be regarded as being amongst the most serious of their kind. Each of these offences, as I say, falls in the upper range of seriousness. I am aware that although there is no standard non-parole period for this offence even now, there is now a standard non-parole period for the offence of aggravated indecent assault on a child between ten and sixteen, which is five years, and a standard non-parole period of fifteen years for a count of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under ten, and those may be useful reference points.22 Each act which led to a charge was not only an abuse of the offender’s authority as a stepfather, which is an element of this crime, but the initial assault and some later ones were also accompanied by threats of violence towards the complainant and perceived actual violence in the home towards her and her mother. The fact that there was little if any actual violence is important, but what is even more important was the constant threat of violence which the victim felt. 23 The principle of totality, however, means that it would not be correct to impose a sentence comprising a non-parole period in the term during which the offender is eligible for parole so that all are totally cumulative.24 The offences are part of a continuing course of conduct, which is an aggravating feature of each offence, but they cannot in any sense be said to be a single episode of criminality. Although it is to some extent artificial, for the purposes of applying the principle of totality, I propose to consider the offences in four groups corresponding to the four residences that the family occupied during the period during which the offences occurred. The sentences imposed for the offences in each group will be concurrent, but because of the principle of totality, and only because of that principle, those sentences will be partly cumulative on those for the group of offences that is immediately prior in time.25 The prisoner gave evidence, as did his mother and his current partner. This is supported by a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Stephen Allnutt, and also by reports which were produced from two other psychiatrists, Associate Professor Quadrio and Dr Clarke, which were evidence in these proceedings and which were also introduced in earlier proceedings. I did have some concerns that Professor Quadrio had prepared reports on both the prisoner and the victim, but those concerns have proved to be unfounded. Dr Allnutt and the two other psychiatrists who examined the prisoner earlier this year are satisfied that he is suffering from anxiety and depression. To some extent this was due to the death of his grandmother in August last year. It is certainly not assisted by his childhood experience.26 Dr Allnutt has diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder. I accept that this is a serious mental affliction, which will have some bearing on the prisoner while he is in custody and supports a finding of special circumstances. It is not, however, the type of mental illness which makes the importance of general deterrence any less important. The offender’s post-traumatic stress disorder did not affect his understanding of the nature and quality of what he was doing. General deterrence is an important factor in sentencing offenders who have committed crimes such as this, and it is important that the court send a message to all stepfathers and people in authority that if they commit sexual offences against their children that they will be punished severely.27 There is no doubt that the prisoner had a very disturbed childhood. According to his mother his natural father was extremely violent towards her, and the prisoner as a young child witnessed this. He also witnessed this person attempting suicide. The mother’s evidence was that he ultimately shot himself. When the prisoner was about eight, his mother, who at the time had an alcohol problem, formed a relationship with a man called Robbie Pearce. They lived together on a farm about forty kilometres from Holbrook and Tarcutta at a very isolated place. Both the prisoner and his mother said that Pearce was constantly violent towards them both. The violence towards the prisoner was at times extreme. He was, for example, locked in the meat room without food or drink for twenty-four hours at a time. He was chained and left outside with the dogs in a padlocked collar. He was stripped naked, tied to a tree and whipped with a hose.28 Pearce frequently threatened to use a shotgun and on one occasion fired several shots at the prisoner. The mother tried to leave on several occasions with her children, but was physically prevented from doing so. 29 If that were not enough, the prisoner says that Pearce regularly abused him sexually, forcing him to have oral intercourse and to masturbate him. He says that this happened on fifty or more occasions. The prisoner said that he developed an extreme hatred of Pearce, which is quite understandable. He says that he joined the army later to learn to fight so that he could fight Pearce and he learnt to drive a truck so that he could run over Pearce, although he never did so.30 Ultimately the mother was able to get her children away from Pearce. She then formed a relationship with another man who also physically abused the prisoner and caused him to be admitted to hospital on one occasion. 31 He left home, he joined the army, but was discharged because he struck an officer. Since then he was continuously employed. As I say, he went into custody, and when he was released in 2002, he met Melica Reid in October of that year. She was seventeen at the time. Since then they have been in a relationship and they have raised a daughter who is now three and a half years old. They plan to marry when the prisoner is released from custody. Both Ms Reid and the prisoner’s mother say that he is a good father, but I have some scepticism about his relationship with his daughter. 32 This was a matter that was raised by the defence and I feel I must allude to it. Protection of the community is an important objective of the sentencing process. Because of his record, the prisoner’s daughter, like any child who is part of his household, must be considered at risk until she becomes an adult. Dr Allnutt says in his report that he must, on the basis of statistics from Canada and the United States, consider that there is a significant chance of re-offending. It is true that the prisoner has indicated a willingness to undertake programs for sexual offenders. He says that his previous time in prison, completion of an anger management course and working with a counsellor, Ms Erica Day, whose report is in evidence, have helped him a great deal. He says that if he undertakes a sexual offenders program it will not only assist him in avoiding re-offending but also he considers it will help him to come to terms with himself, and I think that shows some insight.33 He has mentioned that since he has been in custody he has had no contact with his daughter because the authorities consider that, given the nature of his offence, that should not be permitted. That attitude on the part of the authorities may well be justified, but it will make his time in custody more onerous. I would have considered that completion of a rigorous sexual offenders program would be a necessary condition of parole, and even then, while his daughter is still a child there may be conditions of his parole regarding unsupervised contact with her, but that will be a matter for the parole authorities when the time comes.34 Because of the nature of the offences of which he has been convicted the prisoner is being held in protection. This means that, he says, he is abused by some other prisoners and some correctional officers. He has fewer privileges including less access to courses and recreational facilities than mainstream prisoners and it is almost inevitable that he will serve the remainder of his sentence in protection. 35 It is unfortunate, but unfortunately common. that those who are victims of abuse often themselves become abusers. In an unreported decision, Reynolds, 7 December 1998, Hulme J, with whom Barr and Ireland JJ agreed, said that such matters must be taken into account by a sentencing court. 36 The history of childhood abuse is certainly a factor to be taken into account. The fact that this prisoner will be held in protection is itself a special circumstance. Because of his anxiety and depression and that fact of the protective custody, there are special circumstances.37 The Crown referred me to some cases which it said might be helpful to the court in determining the length of the sentence that must be imposed here. Those cases were for offences under a different section of the Crimes Act and there was a different maximum penalty. They were the cases of Moore (CCA 12 April 1994 unreported), that applied an earlier decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 23 July 1991, the case of Bamford. Finally I was referred to the case of SJF [2002] NSWCCA 294. Those cases may in some ways assist the court in giving some guidance as to what is an appropriate sentence. I must say that in none of those cases were there as many offences as are charged here and in my view the offences in this case on their facts are at least as serious, if not more serious, than the facts in those cases.38 Rodney Thomas Phipps is sentenced as follows. On each charge of aggravated indecent assault there will be a fixed term of four years and on each charge of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child there will be a non-parole period of six years and a total term of nine years. The dates of the sentences are as follows: 39 On counts 1 to 6 the commencing date will be 23 February 2007, the four year sentences will expire on 22 February 2011, the non-parole periods for the more serious offences will expire on 22 February 2013 and the total terms will expire on 22 February 2016. 40 On counts 7 to 11 inclusive the commencing date will be 23 February 2009. The four year sentences will expire on 22 February 2013. The non-parole periods for the more serious offences will expire on 22 February 2015 and the total terms will expire on 22 February 2018.41 On counts 12 to 15 inclusive the commencing date will be 23 February 2011. The four year sentences will expire on 22 February 2015. The non-parole periods for the more serious offences will expire on 22 February 2017 and the total terms will expire on 22 February 2020. 42 On count 16 the commencing date will be 23 February 2012. The non-parole period will expire on 22 February 2018 and the total term will expire on 22 February 2021. 43 The prisoner will first be eligible for release on parole on 22 February 2018.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This was a dreadful crime. An innocent person was attacked and he and his child seriously injured by a group of young people acting from a completely misguided belief that they were entitled to take the law into their own hands. Although the appellant’s role in inflicting the injuries was modest and he was the first to call off the attack he was a major force in initiating the violent pursuit of the person who robbed his girlfriend. 
     
      
    2 Members of the community are entitled to walk the streets without fear of being attacked by others intent upon inflicting physical violence. Those who put people in fear and cause serious injury cannot expect any leniency from the law. 
     
      
    3 In the present case the sentences imposed on each offender were in my view at the lower end of the appropriate range. Although there is a disparity between the sentence imposed on the applicant and the sentence imposed on Benischke, having regard to their leniency I have had reservations as to whether this Court should intervene. However, on balance I have determined that a reduction in the applicant’s sentence to the extent proposed by Rothman J would not take his sentence beyond the permissible range. Accordingly, I agree that although only modest, the grievance which the applicant maintains justifies the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
    4 I agree with the orders proposed by Rothman J. 
     
      
    5 HIDDEN J: I agree, for the reasons given by Rothman J, that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in the light of the sentence passed upon Mr Benischke and that this Court should intervene. I agree with the orders which his Honour proposes.  
     
      
    6 ROTHMAN J: The applicant, Eric Noel McKenna, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by His Honour Judge Walmsley SC DCJ on 13 April 2006 (as amended pursuant to section 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) on 5 April 2007).  
     
      
    7 The applicant was charged with: Count 1: maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm in company, the date of offence being 14 August 2003, contrary to section 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for ten years. In the alternative to Count 1, Count 2: the applicant was charged with maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm contrary to section 35(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the maximum penalty for which is seven years’ imprisonment. The applicant was also charged with: Count 3: assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, the date of offence also being on 14 August 2003, contrary to section 59(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for seven years. And in the alternative to Count 3, Count 4: assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to section 59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years.  
     
      
    8 The applicant pleaded not guilty on all Counts and the jury returned a verdict of guilty on Counts 1 and 3.  
     
      
    9 His Honour Walmsley DCJ imposed a sentence for Count 3 of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 18 months, commencing on 13 April 2006 and expiring on 12 October 2007, with a parole period of 18 months to expire on 12 April 2009. He also sentenced in relation to Count 1 to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 18 months, commencing on 13 June 2006 and expiring on 12 December 2007, with a parole period of 6 months, to expire on 12 June 2008.  
     
      
    10 The overall effective sentence was a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 20 months, commencing on 13 April 2006 and expiring on 12 December 2007, with the remainder of term of 16 months which will expire on 12 April 2009. These sentences recite the sentences as finally imposed, namely, as amended pursuant to section 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  
     
      
    11 The applicant, by notice of appeal, raised two grounds of appeal. The first of which was satisfied by the amendments made by his Honour under section 43 and referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The sole remaining ground of appeal is the allegation that there is a justifiable sense of grievance in the sentence imposed compared to the co-offenders, particularly Mr Penrice and Mr Benischke.  
     
      
    12 Mr Penrice was sentenced by Walmsley DCJ at the same time as was the applicant. Mr Benischke was sentenced by Charteris DCJ on 15 September 2006.  
     
      
    13 The applicant was sentenced, as already stated, to an overall effective sentence of a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 20 months and the remainder of sentence of 16 months. A comparison with the total effective sentences imposed on the co-offenders is best illustrated in table form:

           5 months 
           
         
        
       
       
      The above table is in descending order of length of overall sentence. 
       
      
    14 Further, in the case of the co-offenders Penrice and Benischke they were each sentenced to serve their term of imprisonment as a periodic detention. The only two offenders who engaged in this criminal conduct and received full-time custodial sentences were the applicant, Mr McKenna, and his co-offender Betts. Each of the co-offenders was charged with the same offences. Mr Betts was the only co-offender who pleaded guilty. It is necessary to outline the criminal conduct in question.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    15 The Crown alleged there was a joint criminal enterprise in relation to all four co-offenders and the jury (in relation to all but Betts who pleaded guilty) found, that they were party to a joint criminal enterprise. The offences occurred in the following way.  
     
      
    16 At or about 8.00pm on 14 August 2003 the adult victim was walking along Hinkler Street Maroubra. His daughter who, at the date of the incident, was five weeks old, was strapped to the adult victim’s chest in a baby pouch. As it was a cold night the adult victim wrapped his jacket around the baby and zipped up the jacket. There is in place a non-publication order from the District Court, which has been continued by this Court, in relation to the names of the victims and their immediate family and certain other persons identified other than by their name in this judgment. 17 The applicant’s girlfriend (also subject of a non-disclosure order) had, earlier that evening, been assaulted. The person that assaulted her, who was not the male victim, had punched the girlfriend in the nose and sought to steal her mobile telephone. The applicant and his co-offenders, on being told of the assault, drove around looking for her assailant. They saw the adult victim. The applicant’s girlfriend indicated that she did not think that he was the assailant and seems to have mentioned that the assailant had been wearing a cap. Despite that, the offenders got out of the car and, seemingly at the instigation of Mr Betts, attacked the male victim. After leaving the car the co-offenders attacked the male victim from behind. 
     
      
    18 The male victim was kicked and punched and received head injuries. While he was being attacked his five week old baby was also injured. Her injuries were particularly bad. She received a depressed fracture to the skull and suffered an intracranial haemorrhage. Later she suffered from seizures for which she required medication. Luckily, her injuries did not prove to be permanent although, to some degree, the full extent of the effect of the injuries will not be known until she matures.  
     
      
    19 As the attack was occurring, independent bystanders stopped to give assistance. The attack ceased. The sentencing judge found, as a fact that is not contested, that the applicant, on hearing the baby cry “called off the attack”. His Honour also held that the applicant did not occasion any injury to either the adult or infant victim and did not punch or kick either one of them. On the material before the Court, it seems as if the applicant was approximately one to two metres away from the actual assault.  
     
      
    20 The offenders fled the scene. While some information was given to the Police, none of the offenders were identified and while enquiries were made by the Police in and around the area, they were not able to ascertain the identity of the offenders.  
     
      
    21 Two days after the attack, Mr Penrice, a co-offender of the applicant, of his own accord, attended at the Police Station, gave a lengthy interview describing the attack, and gave Police the names and descriptions of his co-offenders. He denied striking either victim but indicated who had. As a result of that confession his three co-accused were arrested and charged.  
     
      
    22 Mr McKenna was arrested at work and interviewed. During the interview Mr McKenna gave a complete statement of what occurred on the evening, his involvement and the involvement of others. He identified each of the others and the terms of the interview were wholly or substantially in accordance with the factual findings of Walmsley DCJ. Mr Betts declined to be interviewed.  
     
      
    23 Walmsley DCJ ordered a separate trial on application of Mr Benischke. Walmsley DCJ found that, in the charges against each of the accused, it was not necessary for the Crown to prove that any one of the accused knew that the infant victim was present at the time of the offence (the transferred malice issue).  
     
      
    24 After this judgment on the voir dire Mr Betts entered a plea of guilty to both Counts under sections 35(2) and 59(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The applicant and Messrs Penrice and Benischke maintained pleas of not guilty to both counts.  
     
      
    25 At the time that Walmsley DCJ sentenced the applicant, Mr Benischke’s trial had not yet been held. The jury found the applicant and Mr Penrice guilty and on 14 June 2006 another jury found Mr Benischke guilty of the same offences (i.e. the 1st and 3rd Counts on the indictment).  
     
      
    26 Walmsley DCJ found that he could not be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the co-offenders knew of the baby’s presence during the attack on the adult victim.  
     
      
    27 As already stated, Betts was the person whom his Honour found had inflicted the blows (punching and kicking) on the victims and the injury involved. There is some inconsistency in the evidence as to who else, other than Betts, was involved in the altercation. His Honour was not able to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that any of the other co-offenders punched or kicked the victims. However, it is clear that the applicant was not one of the offenders who inflicted injury and, unlike the other co-offenders, there was no suggestion to the contrary. This is the result not only of the statement from the applicant but from other co-offenders who corroborated the applicant on that issue.  
     
      
    28 His Honour found, correctly, that the culpability of Mr Betts was significantly greater than the culpability of the other offenders. In that regard, the finding of his Honour (at [92]) that the applicant called off the attack, being a finding made only in relation to the applicant and not other co-offenders, means that the applicant’s culpability would ordinarily be lower than the others and displays contrition at the time of the attack itself.  
     
      
    29 A number of other factors must be taken into account. First, in relation to the co-offender Penrice, there are significant Ellis factors: R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. The attack in question was the subject of significant notoriety and press coverage at or shortly after the incident. The Police had no or very few leads and were unaware of the identity of the attackers. In this context the assistance offered by the co-offender Penrice, of his own accord, was substantial. His Honour allowed a substantial discount.  
     
      
    30 Mr Betts on the other hand was described as “the main assailant” by Walmsley DCJ, with the applicant and Mr Penrice as having “lesser roles”. Charteris DCJ when sentencing the co-offender Benischke, described Betts as the “ring leader in the event. He delivered both punches and kicks to the body of [the adult victim]. Forensic examination of his boots revealed the presence of the victim’s blood upon them. I am comfortably satisfied that Mr Betts was the ring leader in the attack. He was very much a ‘loose cannon’.” 
     
      
    31 Charteris DCJ, later in his remarks on sentence, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the other evidence before me I am comfortably satisfied that Mr Betts was very much the loose cannon that led to the offences occurring. Indeed, I think it unlikely that there would have been an attack upon [the adult victim] but for the behaviour of Mr Betts. He delivered the initial punches knocking [the adult victim] to the ground. He then engaged in kicking [him].” 
        
       
      
    32 Mr Betts was given the benefit of his plea of guilty and was given a discount, with rounding, of approximately 25% (i.e. the maximum discount for a plea of guilty) on one charge and 20% on the other. Mr Betts gave no statement to the Police and has given no evidence in any trial for any of these offences. He did give evidence, being called by the prosecutor in a Basha inquiry relating to Benischke and was contemptuous of the court proceedings and abusive of Mr Benischke.  
     
      
    33 On any analysis, this attack was a callous and violent attack on an innocent person (and his infant child) who was doing no more than walking home. He was entitled to do so. Even accepting, as I must, that the perpetrators were unaware of the presence of the infant, attacks of this kind strike at the heart of the community and threaten the peace of society that most take for granted.  
     
      
    34 Even if Betts believed, which I do not consider he did, that the adult victim had earlier assaulted the female co-offender, it is for the Police and law enforcement agencies to apprehend perpetrators of crime and for the courts to punish them. The alternative is too chaotic and dangerous to contemplate.  
     
      
    35 The courts must provide significant specific and general deterrence to assaults on people in the street or public places, including, and perhaps especially, assaults purportedly for the purpose of revenge or punishment for an earlier crime.  
     
      
    36 In particular the co-offender Betts, who, because we have evidence from both trials we know, was the instigator of the attack and the perpetrator of the injuries, was treated lightly. That may be true of Penrice, even allowing for the discounts. Benischke’s trial also heard evidence (from other than the applicant) more exculpatory of the applicant than was heard during his own trial. Nevertheless in dealing with this appeal by McKenna, it is with the evidence adduced in his trial, and on his sentencing hearings, that I must deal.  
     
      
       
      Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    37 Ms Francis, Counsel for the applicant before this Court, summarised the subjective circumstances of the applicant in dot points in a manner which has, with some exceptions, been accepted by the Crown. The submission was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “4.1 The applicant’s subjective case can be summarised as follows: 
        
       
      
    · he was born on 12 February 1980 and was twenty six years of age at the time of sentence;· he was the only male in a family of six children;· he had a strict and supportive upbringing;· he left school at fifteen at the end of year ten;· he was an apprentice panel beater;· he had stable employment with the same employer from 1996 until charged with these offences;· after leaving this job on account of the prospect of gaol, he then received work with his father;· he was at the time of sentence in receipt of centrelink payments;· he had begun drinking at fourteen and heavy drinking at sixteen;· after these offences his drinking increased although he had sought help by the time of sentence;· he began to use cannabis at twelve and later used it heavily however claimed to have stopped using it in the year before sentence;· he expressed remorse to the probation and parole officers for his part in the offences but they indicated that he had attempted to minimise his role. In this regard it is unclear that the Probation and Parole officers were appraised of the principles of joint enterprise;· he expressed considerable remorse to Tim Watson Munro, Psychologist, who regarded it as genuine;· by the time of the consultation with Mr Munro the applicant had commenced drug and alcohol treatment and had begun to attend Alcoholics Anonymous;· he was also being treated for depression;· he had before the commission of these offences seen a psychiatrist for depression;· the psychologist considered that the applicant was immature and that his depression had interfered with his capacity to evaluate situations critically;· the psychologist anticipated some improvement with time;· the psychologist characterised his depression and drug and alcohol abuse as amounting to a substance abuse disorder on the DSM – IV criteria and there was a direct nexus between that condition and the offences;· in respect of his criminal record he had no convictions for violence at the time of these offences, however he had three convictions for mid range PCA;· he had since the offences been convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and maliciously destroy or damage property. These offences related to conduct in respect of his sister and she gave evidence before the sentencing Judge that she was confident that the applicant had rehabilitated himself and she was not scared of him;· his sister testified that since the applicant had been going to AA his behaviour had improved significantly;· there was a family plan to move the applicant out of Sydney at such time as the court case was complete;· there were ‘impressive references’ tendered on his behalf which his Honour accepted supported the proposition that he was unlikely to reoffend;· his Honour accepted that he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and he was remorseful (ROS p 21 para 90);· he made admissions when first interviewed although denied assaulting the victims.” 
     
      
    38 The applicant was assessed as unsuitable for periodic detention pursuant to the requirements of section 66(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and sections 65A and 65B of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Periodic and Home Detention) Act 2002 (NSW). The reason for that unsuitability was the mental health instability of the applicant, specifically his depression, and his non-adherence to the prescribed regime of medication. The pre-sentence report nevertheless noted that there had been some positive progress towards rehabilitation in relation to the applicant’s alcohol abuse.  
     
      
    39 As noted above the Crown qualified the summary of the applicant’s subjective case set out above. Those qualifications, themselves, need comment: 
     
      
    · Remorse: the Crown submitted that the issue of remorse needs to be qualified and refers particularly to the applicant’s alleged attempts to minimise his role. This was a reference to the comments made to some of the parole officers as to minimisation. However, in terms of the actual infliction of injury, it is beyond doubt that the applicant was not involved in the infliction of any injury. Moreover, as the Crown itself submits, quoting his Honour, Penrice (a co-offender) “provided more exculpatory material about [the applicant] than he [the applicant] did about himself”. Indeed the impression from the statement given by the applicant to Police that he had “attempted to stop the assault” is significantly less advantageous to his position than Penrice’s recollection of the words used which were: “Stop it, stop it, fucking get off him, he’s got a baby”.  
     
      
    · Treatment for depression: it is accepted, and must be, by the Crown that the applicant is being treated for depression. The issue of qualification relates to the timing of that treatment and whether it occurred before or after the commission of the offences. Further, the Crown accurately submits that, in relation to the characterisation by the psychologist of the applicant’s depression and drug and alcohol abuse, this amounts to substance abuse disorder on the DSM IV criteria. This, it is said, does not mean that the depression caused the applicant to commit the offence, but that the nature of his drug addiction significantly impacted on his judgment and capacity with problem solving, and in conjunction with his depression could cause him to act “in an impulsive manner”.40 None of these issues seem to impact greatly on the aspects of subjective circumstances which were submitted by the applicant or on his behalf.  
     
      
    41 Two other matters need to be mentioned. First, Walmsley DCJ makes no comment, in his remarks on sentence, on the effect on the sentence of the confession of the applicant. Unlike Penrice, the applicant did not come forward of his own volition. He was arrested and questioned. Nevertheless he gave a full and frank admission of all of the facts which led to his conviction, and the conviction of the others. While I infer that at the time of his arrest and questioning he knew that “the game was up” and probably that he had been identified, perhaps by one of his co-offenders, as participating in the attack, that does not mean that the confession was of no assistance.  
     
      
    42 It is clear from that which followed that the confession of the applicant was a more reliable confession (save that he seems to have overstated his involvement in the physical attack and understated his attempts to stop it) than any other version. Even if it added no more than that which had been told by Penrice, given the sentencing judge’s finding that it would have been hard, without Penrice’s assistance for the Police to have traced the offenders, a statement corroborative of that of Penrice would have significant value. Such a statement significantly alters the evidence available to the prosecutor compared with a situation where one of four co-offenders gives evidence that, for example, may have been denied by each of the others. Moreover, it is clear from the later findings that the statement by the applicant did more than simply corroborate the statement by Penrice.  
     
      
    43 Of course, the statement made on interview by the Police is in a different category to the voluntary surrender and statement to the Police, which was the situation in relation to Penrice.  
     
      
    44 The principles as to how each should be treated require a significant difference. The kind of assistance offered by Penrice commonly would be (and was) a ground for substantial leniency. In doing so the discount is not only for the assistance to the administration of justice but also takes account of the subsequent likely threat to the offenders safety, the conditions under which the offender will have to serve a sentence in order to reduce the risk of reprisals, and the steps that will need to be taken to protect the offender when released: York v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1919, per Gleeson CJ at [3].  
     
      
    45 The applicant’s statement was a voluntary disclosure of guilt, albeit at a time that did not warrant the benefits of assistance afforded Penrice. Nevertheless it was made at a time when it could be, although not necessarily, the subject of discount:  
     
      
       
        
        “… Although a sentencing judge should allow some discount for a voluntary disclosure of guilt, a sentencing judge is not required, in every case in which there has been a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the offender, to allow a considerable or significant discount because of the voluntary disclosure of guilt or to say in the judge’s remarks on sentence that the judge has allowed a considerable or significant discount on this ground”:  
        R v GLB  
        [2003] NSWCCA 210 per James J at [33].  
        
       
      
    46 In the current circumstances, the sentencing judge made no reference to the voluntary disclosure of guilt in the context of fixing the level of sentence. It is said, correctly, that the voluntary disclosure made by the applicant is at a lesser level because the applicant maintained a plea of not guilty. In this instance, the voluntary disclosure of guilt was the disclosure of all of the facts which gave rise to guilt. The trial of the applicant did not proceed on the basis of contested facts as to his involvement and the finding of the sentencing judge was that the circumstances of the offence, and the involvement of the applicant, were as described by him in his statement to the Police.  
     
      
    47 Further, in this regard it is submitted, on behalf of the applicant, that the sentencing judge was unaware at the time of sentence, and therefore paid no regard to, the assistance given by the applicant in giving evidence in the trial of Benischke. Generally, post-sentence assistance, such as here described, would not be, of itself, a ground to alter a sentence. While there is no distinction in the policy matters that give rise to the desirability of a discount for such assistance, this Court will not interfere with a sentence already passed except on one or other of the well known bases which require error either identifiable or manifest. If, however, this Court were required, for other reasons, to re-sentence, then the subsequent assistance can be taken into account.  
     
      
       
      Parity  
       
      
    48 The Crown, in its written submissions, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Recently, applying  
        Lowe v The Queen  
        (1984) 154 CLR 606 this Court emphasised that there is no rule of law requiring co-offenders to be given the same sentence for the same offence, even if no distinction can be drawn between them:  
        R v Kai Kong Li  
        [2005] NSWCCA 154 at [40]-[44].” 
        
       
      
    49 The above citation of the judgment of Barr J in Kai Kong Li takes the statement of his Honour out of context. Barr J, applying Lowe v The Queen said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[40] … There is no rule of law that requires co-offenders to be given the same sentence for the same offence, even if no distinction can be drawn between them:  
        Lowe v The Queen 
         (1984) 154 CLR 606, per Dawson J at 623. As Street CJ said in  
        R v Tisalandis 
         [1982] 2 NSWLR 430 at 431, an assertion that there is a disparity between a sentence under challenge and another which ought to be comparable, if not identical, is but a particular instance of the general proposition that the sentence under challenge falls outside what might be described as the general pattern of sentencing for the crime under consideration. The objective on appeal is the attainment of even-handedness in sentencing and there remains in this Court a power to modify a sentence which conforms with the general pattern, and thus does not offend the concept of general even-handedness, so as to bring it into or towards conformity with another leniently disparate sentence in order to achieve particular even-handedness as between individual sentences which ought to be equivalent or at least comparable. His Honour [Street CJ] said this at 431-432 -  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Consistently with the foregoing, it has long been recognised that ordinarily the initial inquiry by the appellate court is directed to whether the sentence under challenge, viewed individually, is so heavy as to attract of itself appellate intervention before it will be corrected with a view to eliminating or diminishing any disparity vis-à-vis another sentence which it could have been expected to be equivalent or comparable. Special significance is to be attached to the adverb ‘ordinarily’ in the foregoing formulation of the general approach of the court. An analysis of many cases where an argument based on disparity has been considered, and either upheld or rejected, in recent years will disclose that, where the interest of justice so require, the Court of Criminal Appeal will not refrain from interfering with a sentence which, in the absence of particular disparity, would not have been the subject of appellate intervention. In the interests of justice it has at times been thought necessary, in eliminating or diminishing disparity, to reduce a sentence to a level which would probably be criticised as inadequate.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    50 The opening sentence of the above citation, which the Crown cited was in turn taken from the judgment of Dawson J in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606. Justice Dawson, with whom Wilson J agreed, dealt with the parity principle in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no rule of law which requires co-offenders to be given the same sentence for the same offence even if no distinction can be drawn between them. Obviously where the circumstances of each offender or his involvement in the offence are different then different sentences may be called for but justice should be even-handed and it has come to be recognised both here and in England that any differences between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not to be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or to give the appearance that justice has not been done.” ( 
        Lowe  
        at 623) 
        
       
      
    51 In the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295, the High Court expanded on its judgment in Lowe in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The parity principle upon which the argument in this court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error. Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice. However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in  
        Lowe v The Queen 
        , recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to ‘a justifiable sense of grievance’. If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options.” ( 
        Postiglione 
        , supra, per Dawson and Gaudron JJ at 301) 
        
       
      
    52 As between co-offenders the principle is that where things are equal, persons concerned should receive the same treatment; and where things are not equal, due discrimination should be made to account for the differences: R v Tiddy [1969] SASR 575 at 577.  
     
      
    53 Discrepancy or difference, of itself, is never sufficient to warrant intervention by an appellate court. The discrepancy must be unjustifiable and the difference must be otherwise than on account of differences in the co-offenders. The test is objective, not subjective. And, even where the differences in sentence between two or more co-offenders cannot be shown to be due to a proper discrimination on the basis of relevant factors, an appellate court will still not intervene if the result would be to reduce the sentence to that which would be inappropriate for the offence in question.  
     
      
    54 While unequal treatment before the law, obviated in sentencing by the application of the parity principle, brings the administration of justice into disrepute, so too does the imposition of a sentence which is inappropriately low for the offence and offender in question. To use the parity principle to reduce a sentence to a level which is inappropriate or insufficient merely replaces one manner of bringing the administration of justice into disrepute by another.  
     
      
    55 Thus, while appellate courts will intervene to implement parity of sentencing between co-offenders, they will not do so unless the discrepancy in sentence gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. “Justifiable” in that context must be objectively ascertained and cannot depend upon a comparison with an inappropriately lenient sentence on a co-offender.  
     
      
    56 I turn then to the discrepancies that are alleged in the sentences for these co-offenders. The initial reaction to the proposition that the applicant, who, in terms of criminal culpability, had the least problematic conduct, should receive the heaviest sentence tends to suggest that the sentence imposed is out of kilter with the remaining sentences. However, the comparison is not so simple. The co-offender Betts was entitled to a discount resulting in a lower sentence than would otherwise be the case. The difference in criminal activity between the activity of Betts and the activity of the applicant seems to warrant a greater discrimination than six months, which was the starting point of his Honour. Nevertheless such a comment may point more to an inappropriately low sentence imposed upon Betts.  
     
      
    57 Likewise, when one considers a comparison with Penrice, one must take into account the substantial discount for the assistance given by Penrice to the authorities.  
     
      
    58 However, when one compares with the co-offender Benischke, there seems to be no rational basis for the distinction in sentence. I do not here refer to the distinction between a full-time custodial sentence and periodic detention. While periodic detention builds in a degree of leniency, the applicant was not entitled to a sentence of that kind and I disregard it for the purpose of comparison.  
     
      
       
      Comparison of Subjective Circumstances  
       
      
    59 It is not only the criminal culpability of each co-offender that must be examined in order to determine whether there is a rational relationship between the sentences imposed on each. An analysis of the subjective circumstances as they apply to Mr Benischke and those that apply to the applicant are extraordinarily similar. While the applicant is two years older than Mr Benischke, the subjective circumstances are otherwise almost identical. Each of them come from large families where the parents’ marriage had broken up. Mr Benischke’s father had issues relating to alcohol consumption and while there seems to be no evidence of that in relation to the applicant, he was prior to the rehabilitation process commencing, far more dependant upon alcohol than was Mr Benischke.  
     
      
    60 Each of them showed considerable remorse. While it is beyond doubt that the applicant did not participate in the occasioning of blows, there is some doubt whether Mr Benischke did. However, Charteris DCJ found that he did not, or rather, that he was not satisfied on the requisite standard that he did, and therefore he was sentenced on the basis of the same participation in the offences as the applicant. Interestingly, Charteris DCJ refers to the sentences of each of the co-offenders and in particular the co-offender, Penrice. Charteris DCJ remarks that he had the benefit, unlike Walmsley DCJ, of seeing Mr Penrice in the witness box. It is clear that he was not impressed with Mr Penrice. He was also not that impressed with the applicant. It may be that the comparison with Mr Penrice is the reason there is a disparity between Mr Benischke and the applicant.  
     
      
    61 Neither Mr Benischke nor the applicant had any prior criminal record at the time of the offence. Mr Benischke had committed offences prior thereto, being driving offences relating to recklessly and furiously driving a motor vehicle and disobeying a request to stop for a breath test, but he had not been convicted of them at the time of the offence in question. The applicant, on the other hand, had committed no offences prior to the incident in question. After the incident, it seems as a result of his alcohol abuse and a level of depression associated with the commission of the offence itself, he assaulted his sister, which was referred to by Walmsley DCJ as was their reconciliation and the improvement in behaviour that was obvious following his partial rehabilitation.  
     
      
    62 All in all the subjective circumstances of each of Mr Benischke and the applicant do not give rise to a rational basis for a distinction in the sentences imposed.  
     
      
      Conclusion 
       
      
    63 The lack of rationality between sentences imposed upon co-offenders points to error. Either there is error because the parity principle has not been properly applied, or there is error because one or other of the sentences must be infected with it. While the sentence imposed upon the applicant is not outside the range of sentences available and does not, of itself, disclose error, nor is the sentence imposed upon Benischke.  
     
      
    64 The Crown does not submit that the sentences imposed upon Benischke were inappropriately low or outside the range of sentences available. In those circumstances a reduction of sentence for the applicant, to bring it in line with the sentence imposed for Benischke, could not bring the sentences for the applicant to a level which would be inappropriate.  
     
      
    65 The disparity between the sentences imposed on the applicant and on Benischke is irrational. There is a justifiable sense of grievance and the appeal should succeed.  
     
      
    66 If this Court were to intervene and re-sentence on the basis of parity, it would be appropriate to bring into account an allowance for the assistance by the giving of evidence in the proceedings against Benischke. In the circumstances a sentence which was below that of the sentence imposed upon Benischke would be inappropriately low and I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) leave to appeal be granted; 
       
       
      (b) the appeal be allowed and the sentence imposed on the applicant by Walmsley DCJ on 13 April 2006 (as amended on 5 April 2007) be quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentences be imposed: 
       
       
        
        (i) for Count 3, the assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company committed on 14 August 2003, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 months to commence on 13 April 2006 and expire on 12 April 2007 with a remainder of term of 12 months to expire on 12 April 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) for Count 1, the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm in company committed on 14 August 2003, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 months commencing 13 July 2006 and expiring 12 July 2007 with the remainder of sentence of 15 months to expire on 12 October 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        (iiii) the total effective sentence imposed is one of 15 months non-parole period with a further 15 months for the remainder of the sentence and a total sentence of 30 months; 
        
       
       
       (iv) the applicant will be first eligible for parole on 12 July 2007.  
       
      
    67 As a matter of abundant caution I make it clear that the remainder of the non-parole period is to be served as part of a continuing full time custodial sentence.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA: I agree with James J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Phillip Edward Smith applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him by his Honour Judge Nield in the Bathurst District Court on 3 August 2006. His Honour sentenced the applicant for two offences, to both of which the applicant had pleaded guilty, namely an offence of supplying a prohibited drug (amphetamine) on an ongoing basis between 30 November 2005 and 12 December 2005 (which I will refer to as “the ongoing supply offence”) and an offence of supplying a prohibited drug (cannabis) between the same dates (which I will refer to as “the supply offence”). In sentencing the applicant for the ongoing supply offence, his Honour took into account four offences of supplying a prohibited drug (cannabis), supplying a prohibited drug (amphetamine), goods in custody and possessing a prohibited drug (cannabis).  
     
      
    3 For the supply offence his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of one year commencing on 12 December 2005, the date on which the applicant was taken into custody, and a balance of the term of one year commencing on 12 December 2006 and expiring on 11 December 2007.  
     
      
    4 For the ongoing supply offence his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years commencing on 12 June 2006 and expiring on 11 June 2008 and a balance of the term of two years commencing on 12 June 2008 and expiring on 11 June 2010.  
     
      
    5 Accordingly, his Honour made the sentence for the ongoing supply offence partly cumulative on the sentence for the supply offence. The total effect of the sentences was that the applicant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling four and a half years, with non-parole periods totalling two and a half years. 
     
      
    6 The ongoing supply offence was the offence under s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, which provides that a person who on three or more separate occasions during any period of 30 consecutive days supplies a prohibited drug (other than cannabis) for financial or material reward is guilty of an offence. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 25A is a fine of 3500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years or both. 
     
      
    7 The supply offence was an offence under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, which provides that any person who supplies a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence. Section 32(1)(h) of the Act provides that, except as provided in ss 30 and 31, neither of which was applicable in the present case, the maximum penalty for an offence under s 25(1), where the offence relates to cannabis plant or cannabis leaf, is a fine of 2500 units or imprisonment for a term of 10 years or both. 
     
      
    8 There is no standard non-parole period for either of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced.  
     
      
    9 A set of agreed facts was admitted in the proceedings on sentence and formed the basis for his Honour’s statement of the facts of the offences in his remarks on sentence. This part of his Honour’s remarks on sentence was quoted in the written submissions of both the applicant and the respondent on this application and I will now reproduce them. 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender had attended school with the children of Ronald Bettles. He obtained the cannabis that he smoked and the amphetamine that he used from Ronald Bettles. Some months before his arrest he commenced to supply cannabis and amphetamine to users of it for Ronald Bettles, for which he obtained cannabis and amphetamine from Ronald Settles at a discounted price. Then a few months before his arrest he commenced to supply cannabis and amphetamine to users of it on his own behalf and he obtained his supplies of cannabis and amphetamine from Ronald Settles 
        . 
         
         
        On 30 November 2005 police executed a lawfully issued search warrant on the home of Ronald Bettles at 25 Carlingford Street in Bathurst. At that time the offender, Ronald Bettles, his wife Alicia Cole, his son Robert Settles and his son's girlfriend were in the home and they were arrested and taken to Bathurst Police 
         
        Station. When he was interviewed, the offender denied knowing anything about the home being used as a place for the supply of prohibited drugs and he was released without being charged with any offence. 
         
         
        However, on that day 30 November 2005 police, when the offender and the others were at Bathurst Police Station, installed a listening device in the home of Ronald Bettles and the device recorded conversations between people inside the home. Moreover, between 30 November 2005 and 12 December 2005, police recorded the movements of cars to and from and people into and out from the home. 
         
         
        Between 30 November 2005 and 12 December 2005, police recorded numerous conversations between the offender and Ronald Bettles, Alicia Cole and Glen Alderton and other unidentified persons related, inter-alia, to the supply of cannabis and amphetamine. These conversations confirmed that the offender, Ronald Bettles, Alicia Cole and Glen Alderton were supplying cannabis and amphetamines to users of them and using the home of Ronald Settles as their base for doing so. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On 12 December 2005 police executed another lawfully issued search warrant on the home of Ronald Bettles. At that time the offender, Ronald Bettles and some other people were in the home and they were arrested. During the search of the home, police found a quantity of cannabis, a quantity of amphetamine, a number of small resealable plastic bags, scales and an amount of money. 
          
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        During the search of the offender, police found twelve small resealable plastic bags, each containing a quantity of cannabis, which he intended to supply to users of it, an eight-ball, that is 3.5 grams, of amphetamine, which he intended to supply to users of it, and $200, of which $140 had been received by him on supplying, cannabis and amphetamines to users of them. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        After the search of the home of Ronald Bettles, the offender was taken to Bathurst Police Station and then, after a search warrant was obtained, he was taken to his parent's home which was searched, during which police found a quantity of cannabis, scales, about 500 small resealable plastic bags and a radio scanner. 
          
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        After being returned to the police station, the offender was interviewed by police. The interview commenced at 8.30pm on 12 December 2005 and concluded at 1.25am on 13 December 2005. The interview was recorded on video and audio tapes. The offender was asked 1,441 questions. During the interview the offender admitted using cannabis and amphetamine and supplying them to users of them.” 
        
       
      
    10 His Honour’s statement of the facts of the offences in his remarks on sentence did not incorporate parts of the agreed facts which gave particulars of the individual drug transactions by the applicant between 30 November 2005 and 12 December 2005. On the hearing of the appeal it was agreed that the applicant had engaged in about a dozen supplies of amphetamine, the total quantity supplied being about 35 grams, and that the applicant had engaged in about half a dozen supplies of cannabis, the total quantity supplied being between 10 and 15 grams.  
     
      
    11 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge made findings about the subjective circumstances of the applicant.  
     
      
    12 The applicant was born on 14 March 1982 and was accordingly 24 years old at the time he was sentenced.  
     
      
    13 The applicant left school at the end of Year 9 or the beginning of Year 10. After leaving school he was employed at two hotels and the owner of those hotels gave evidence favourable to the applicant in the proceedings on sentence. The applicant had returned to Bathurst to live with his parents, after his father had required further treatment for cancer. The applicant had suffered episodes of depression for which anti-depressant medication had been prescribed and he had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt. 
     
      
    14 The applicant had started smoking cannabis at the age of 14 and had started using amphetamine in December 2004.  
     
      
    15 The applicant had what the sentencing judge described as a “minor criminal record”. In July 2005 he had entered into a recognizance to be of good behaviour, after being convicted of an offence of harassing a police officer in the execution of his duty. The applicant was subject to this recognizance at the time of committing the present offences and this was a circumstance of aggravation. 
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge referred to a number of other matters in his remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    17 His Honour considered that the offences were serious offences; that they were planned and organised, and not spur of the moment or opportunistic, offences; and that they were committed for financial gain, although the evidence did not reveal the extent of the financial gain to the applicant.  
     
      
    18 His Honour found that the applicant’s pleas of guilty had been entered at the earliest opportunity, entitling the applicant to a discount in penalty of 25 per cent.  
     
      
    19 His Honour noted that when the applicant had been interviewed by police he had identified other persons involved in the supplying of cannabis or amphetamine. The applicant offered to give evidence for the Crown in the prosecution of four co-offenders. The investigating police considered the applicant’s offer of assistance genuine and valuable, although, as it transpired, by the time the applicant was sentenced all of the co-offenders had pleaded guilty to various charges or were likely to plead guilty, so that the applicant would not need to give evidence at a trial. His Honour found that for the assistance he had provided the applicant was entitled to a further discount in penalty of 25 per cent. Consequently, his Honour allowed a combined discount of 50 per cent for the applicant’s pleas of guilty and assistance.  
     
      
    20 The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant had shown contrition for the offences and found that the applicant had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend. 
     
      
    21 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge referred to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I will consider this part of his Honour’s remarks in dealing with one of the applicant’s grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    22 At the time the applicant was sentenced, two of the co-offenders had already been sentenced. Each of them had been charged with different and less serious offences than the applicant and had been sentenced in the Local Court, rather than the District Court. His Honour concluded that he was not bound to impose on the applicant similar sentences to those which had been imposed on these two co-offenders.  
     
      
    23 Towards the end of his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge explained how he had arrived at the sentences he was about to impose. Leaving aside the discount for the applicant’s pleas of guilty and assistance, his Honour considered that a “starting point” for the sentence of imprisonment for the ongoing supply offence would be eight years and that a “starting point” for the sentence of imprisonment for the supply offence would be four years. Applying the combined discount of 50 per cent for the applicant’s pleas of guilty and assistance, the sentence for the ongoing supply offence would be reduced to four years and the sentence for the supply offence would be reduced to two years. 
     
      
    24 His Honour found special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in that the applicant had not previously served any sentence of imprisonment and, because of the assistance he had provided, he would serve his sentences in protective custody.  
     
      
    25 Counsel for the applicant relied on three grounds of appeal, namely:- 
     
      
    1. The sentencing judge incorrectly referred to the maximum penalty for the supply cannabis charge. 
     
      
    2. The sentencing judge erred by taking into account an element of the offence as an aggravating feature. 
     
      
    3. The sentences are manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    26 I will deal with these grounds of appeal in turn. 
     
      
    1. The sentencing judge incorrectly referred to the maximum penalty for the supply cannabis charge. 
     
      
    27 As I stated earlier in this judgment, under s 32(1)(h) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act the maximum penalty of imprisonment for this offence of supplying a prohibited drug being cannabis is imprisonment for 10 years. However, in the proceedings on sentence the sentencing judge was incorrectly informed by the representative of the Crown that the maximum penalty of imprisonment for the supply offence was imprisonment for 15 years and in his remarks on sentence his Honour stated this figure of 15 years as being the maximum sentence of imprisonment. Imprisonment for 15 years is the maximum sentence of imprisonment for an offence under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act where the prohibited drug is a drug other than cannabis (s 32(1)(g) of the Act). 
     
      
    28 On this appeal the Crown accepted that the sentencing judge had made this error in stating the maximum term of imprisonment.  
     
      
    29 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that the sentencing judge’s error in stating the maximum penalty for the supply offence was a material error, which would of itself warrant intervention by this Court. Counsel referred to R v Mouloudi [2004] NSWCCA 96.  
     
      
    30 In Mouloudi a Crown appeal against sentence was allowed. The sentencing judge, who had regarded the offences as very serious, had imposed sentences of four and a half years. In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge had stated that the maximum penalty for the offences was imprisonment for five years, whereas the maximum penalty was actually imprisonment for 15 years.  
     
      
    31 Bergin J who delivered the leading judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal concluded that the sentencing judge would not have imposed sentences of only four and a half years for offences of such seriousness “had he not felt himself constrained by a maximum penalty of five years”. It was in these circumstances that Bergin J held that “the error as to the maximum penalty was a material error of law warranting intervention by this Court and re-sentencing of the respondent”.  
     
      
    32 I would not regard Mouloudi as authority for a proposition that an error by a sentencing judge in stating the maximum penalty for the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced necessarily amounts to an error of such materiality as to require this Court to intervene.  
     
      
    33 There will clearly be cases where an error by the sentencing judge as to the maximum penalty for the offence for which the offender is being sentenced will require that an appeal against sentence be allowed. An extreme example is Sharwood v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 157 where a sentence imposed actually exceeded the correct maximum penalty.  
     
      
    34 However, an error by the sentencing judge as to the maximum penalty for the offence for which the offender is being sentenced will not necessarily require that an appeal against the sentence be allowed. In R v Kairouz [2005] NSWCCA 247 Wood CJ at CL in considering an application for leave to appeal by Charbel Kairouz, said, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, at [24] of his judgment:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is the case that his Honour did make the error referred to in Ground 5 in that he noted, at p 2 of the reasons, that the maximum sentence for this offence was imprisonment for 25 years whereas it was in fact 20 years. It does not follow that the head sentence and non-parole period should each be reduced, as the Applicants contended, by 25% (or more correctly by 20%), so as to correct this error. Sentencing does not occur in such a linear or mathematical environment. What was important was that the sentence reflect an appropriate penalty in the light of the overall sentencing pattern for the offence in question, and in the light of the objective and subjective circumstances of the particular case. Whether it did so or not depends on the remaining grounds, although it is to be accepted that the patent error which was identified is sufficient to justify the granting of leave to appeal.” 
        
       
      
    35 In Kairouz the Court of Criminal Appeal granted Charbel Kairouz leave to appeal but dismissed his appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    36 The significance of the maximum penalty for an offence was discussed by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in their joint judgment in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 especially at paras [30] and [31]. Their Honours said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “[30] Legislatures do not enact maximum available sentences as mere formalities. Judges need sentencing yardsticks. It is well accepted that the maximum sentence available may in some cases be a matter of great relevance. In their book  
        Sentencing 
        , Stockdale and Devlin observe that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A maximum sentence fixed by Parliament may have little relevance in a given case, either because it was fixed at a very high level in the last century … or because it has more recently been set at a high catch-all level … At other times the maximum may be highly relevant and sometimes may create real difficulties … 
           
          A change in a maximum sentence by Parliament will sometimes be helpful [where it is thought that the Parliament regarded the previous penalties as inadequate]. 
          
         
         
        [31] It follows that careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors, a yardstick….” 
        
       
      
    37 This first ground of appeal has been made out. However, I will reserve my consideration of the materiality of the sentencing judge’s error until I deal with the third ground of appeal. 
     
      
    2. The sentencing judge erred by taking into account an element of the offence as an aggravating feature. 
     
      
    38 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge said that he considered that the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(m) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was present, “because the offences involved a series of criminal acts”.  
     
      
    39 As was submitted by counsel for the applicant, his Honour in making this remark was clearly referring to both offences. His Honour was correct in saying that it was an aggravating factor which was present in the supply offence.  
     
      
    40 However, it was submitted by counsel for the applicant that it was not a aggravating factor which was present in the ongoing supply offence, because the occurrence of three or more separate supplies within a period of 30 days is an element of an offence under s 25Aof the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Counsel referred to R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145 especially per Howie J at [29]. However, it remains open to a judge sentencing for an offence under s 25A to take into account as a matter aggravating the offence the number of occasions on which the offender supplied a prohibited drug, if the number of occasions significantly exceeds three occasions. In the present case, there were about a dozen supplies of amphetamine within the 30 day period.  
     
      
    41 I consider that the part of the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence criticised by counsel for the applicant did contain an error. However, I would not allow the appeal simply on this ground.  
     
      
    3. The sentences are manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    42 In support of this ground of appeal counsel for the applicant pointed to the “starting points” or putative sentences which the sentencing judge adopted in sentencing for each offence, before he allowed the combined discount of 50 per cent for the applicant’s pleas of guilty and assistance. But for the discount, the sentencing judge would have imposed a total sentence of eight years for the ongoing supply offence and of four years for the supply offence. It was submitted that such sentences would have been manifestly excessive and therefore the sentences ultimately imposed, after allowing the discount, were also manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    43 It is convenient to deal first with the supply offence.  
     
      
    44 Factors tending to increase the seriousness of the offence were that there were a number of supplies and that these supplies were clearly not isolated operations but part of a continuing enterprise. The applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of committing the offence.  
     
      
    45 On the other hand, the total quantity supplied in supplies which were the subject of the charge was very small, being between 10 and 15 grams.  
     
      
    46 As was submitted by counsel for the applicant, if the applicant had not also been charged with the ongoing supply offence, he would probably have been dealt with in the Local Court for the supply offence. If he had been dealt with in the Local Court, then, as the quantity supplied was less than the small quantity applicable to cannabis as set out in Sch 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the maximum penalty under s 30 of the Act would have been imprisonment for two years.  
     
      
    47 Furthermore, it seems to me likely that his Honour adopted a starting point as high as four years, at least partly because of the incorrect information he had been given that the maximum penalty for the offence was 15 years, and not 10 years.  
     
      
    48 I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal against the sentence for the supply offence. 
     
      
    49 As his Honour recognised in his remarks on sentence, the ongoing supply offence was clearly the more serious of the two offences. 
     
      
    50 The principles to be applied in sentencing for an offence under s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act have been stated by this Court in a number of cases including R v Smiroldo [2000] NSWCCA 120, R v Hoon & Pouoa [2000] NSWCCA 137, R v Khaled [2001] NSWCCA 169 and R v Kairouz [2005] NSWCCA 247 esp at [86]-[89].  
     
      
    51 In Hoon & Pouoa Dunford J said at [39]:- 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The section is directed to the concepts of repetition, system and organisation, and the objective criminality of any offence under the section should be determined by reference to those features, and not merely to the number and quantities of individual instances of supply. 
          
         
        
       
      
    52 In Khaled at [19] Wood CJ at Cl said that higher sentences are appropriate for bigger and more organised dealers and lesser sentences for those at the bottom of the distribution chain. 
     
      
    53 Repetition, system and organisation were present in the applicant’s activities but at a level much below that of certain other offenders, who have, for example, had employees working in shifts in the business of supplying drugs. The applicant was at or near the bottom of the distribution chain. Although, as the authorities indicate, the quantity of the drug supplied by the offender is not the only relevant factor in sentencing, it remains a factor of some relevance. In the present case, the total quantity of the drug supplied by the applicant during the 30 day period was only about 35 grams.  
     
      
    54 In sentencing the applicant the sentencing judge took into account the applicant’s additional offences. These offences such as deemed supplies or possession of small quantities of prohibited drugs and possession of cash representing the proceeds of sale of drugs were part of the applicant’s ongoing business of supplying a prohibited drug. 
     
      
    55 As in the case of the supply offence, the fact that the applicant was on conditional liberty on a bond at the time of committing the offence was a circumstance of aggravation, although the offence giving rise to the bond had not been a drug offence.  
     
      
    56 We were referred by counsel for the applicant to statistics kept by the Judicial Commission of sentences for offences under s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. This Court has repeatedly stated that caution must be exercised in using such statistics. However, the statistics would indicate that out of a quite large number of sentences for supplying the drug amphetamine on an ongoing basis between July 1999 and June 2006, there is only one sentence exceeding six years in its total length. 
     
      
    57 The conclusion I have reached is that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the ongoing supply offence, the sentencing judge’s starting point of eight years was above the upper limit of the range within a proper exercise of his Honour’s discretion and, hence, the sentence imposed by his Honour, after allowing the discount for the plea of guilty and assistance was manifestly excessive. I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal against the sentence for the ongoing supply offence.  
     
      
    58 It is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the applicant for both offences. Earlier in this judgment I set out the objective facts of the offences and the subjective features of the applicant.  
     
      
    59 In re-sentencing the applicant the Court can take into account an affidavit by the applicant about events occurring after he was sentenced. He has been assaulted twice while in custody, because of the assistance he has provided to law enforcement authorities. The applicant has been drug-free while in custody and he has taken anti-depressant medication.  
     
      
    60 For the supply offence I would adopt a starting point, before allowing the combined discount, of three years. This putative sentence would be reduced to 18 months, by applying the discount. I would find special circumstances, as the sentencing judge did, and I would divide the sentence of 18 months into a non-parole period of nine months and a parole period of nine months.  
     
      
    61 For the ongoing supply offence I would adopt a starting point, before allowing the combined discount, of six years. This putative sentence would be reduced to three years, by applying the discount. Having found special circumstances, I would divide the sentence into a non-parole period of 18 months and a parole period of 18 months.  
     
      
    62 I would make the sentence for the ongoing supply offence cumulative upon the sentence for the supply offence by a period of four months.  
     
      
    63 In my opinion, the following orders should be made:- 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on the applicant by his Honour Judge Nield on 3 August 2006. 
       
        
       
      2. Allow the appeal against the sentences of 3 August 2006. 
       
       
      3. Quash the sentences of 3 August 2006. 
       
       
      4.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act against a decision of his Honour Judge Goldring of the District Court made on 12 March 2007, ruling that evidence of two telephone text messages sent by the respondent to the appeal to a young woman (“the complainant”) on 10 January 2006 would be inadmissible in a trial of the respondent on a number of charges of sexual offences allegedly committed by the respondent against the complainant on 6 January 2006, being a charge of indecent assault and three charges of sexual intercourse without the complainant’s consent. After his Honour made his ruling on 12 March 2007 a trial of the respondent which had been fixed to commence in that week did not proceed.  
     
      
       
      The complainant’s statement  
       
      
    2 The complainant made a statement to police on 3 February 2006 and I will briefly summarise parts of that statement.  
     
      
    3 The complainant and the respondent lived together, with some interruptions, between July 2002 and January 2006. A child was born to them in April 2003.  
     
      
    4 In about late December 2005 the respondent was charged with an unrelated offence and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. At the hospital the respondent occupied a room by himself and had access to a shared bathroom. 
     
      
    5 While the respondent was in the hospital he telephoned the complainant and asked her to bring some of his clothes to the hospital and also to bring their child to visit him.  
     
      
    6 On 6 January 2006 the complainant went to the hospital with the child and with a friend of the complainant’s, a woman KF. 
     
      
    7 At a certain stage during the visit on 6 January 2006 KF left the hospital room to obtain some food for the respondent, taking the child with her. While KF was away, the offences the subject of the charges were committed by the respondent. The respondent led the complainant into a bathroom and then into one of the cubicles in the bathroom. The acts of indecent assault and of sexual intercourse were performed by the respondent in the cubicle in the bathroom. The complainant did not consent to any of the acts.  
     
      
    8 The respondent and the complainant then went back into the respondent’s room. KF returned and after the respondent had left to see a doctor, the complainant said to KF that “(the respondent) had pretty much forced me to have sex with him”.  
     
      
    9 Over the next few days the respondent sent the complainant a number of text messages. In this judgment I will, when setting out the terms of a text message, reproduce the original spelling. The complainant said in her statement:- 
     
      
       
        
        “at 03:48:06pm on the 9th January 2006 from +61427523446 saying “I’m sorry I did wat I did on Friday Is that u y didn’t come in on Sunday. I’m very sorry luv u.” 
        
       
      
    10 On 10 January 2006 the respondent sent the complainant another text message, to which I will refer later in this judgment.  
     
      
    11 On 3 February 2006 the complainant went to a police station and showed a detective the messages stored on her phone.  
     
      
       
      The police officer’s statement  
       
      
    12 The police officer whom the complainant saw on 3 February 2006 made a number of short statements. I will summarise parts of these statements.  
     
      
    13 On 13 February 2006 the police officer took two mobile phones from the respondent.  
     
      
    14 On 15 February 2006 the police officer accessed the message bank of one of the phones taken from the respondent and transcribed the messages in the inbox and the outbox of text messages. This transcript of messages does not include any transcript of the message which the complainant says the respondent sent her at 3:48pm on 9 January 2006.  
     
      
    15 The transcript of outward text messages does include the two following messages:- 
     
      
       
        
        10 January 2006 19:53:16 
        
       
       
        
        “U no that sex is the main way that i no how to show u i love u i’m it was the way it was on Friday but i was hapy 2 c u & it was a week since mum funral i just” 
        
       
       
        
        10 January 2006 19:56:46 
        
       
       
        
        “I fucked up i did’t no how 2 talk 2 u 4 that i would die 4 2 change i luv u with everything in & of me” 
        
       
      
    16 It was the admissibility at a trial of the respondent of these two text messages from the respondent on 10 January 2006, which was in issue before Judge Goldring. 
     
      
       
      Judge Goldring’s judgment 
       
      
    17 Judge Goldring gave a judgment on 12 March 2007.  
     
      
    18 In his judgment his Honour noted a submission by the Crown that the evidence of the two text messages would corroborate the evidence of the complainant that non-consensual sexual acts had occurred between the respondent and the complainant on 6 January 2006 and would also corroborate the complainant’s evidence about the text message which she said had been sent by the respondent on 9 January 2006. 
     
      
    19 His Honour noted submissions by counsel for the respondent that the two text messages lacked any probative value or, alternatively, any probative value they might have was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent and, consequently, evidence of the two text messages should be excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    20 In his judgment Judge Goldring discussed the concepts of “relevance” and “probative value”. His Honour would appear to have concluded that the evidence had some probative value.  
     
      
    21 However, his Honour stated in his judgment that evidence “must be unambiguous, if it is to satisfy the tests in s 137”. His Honour noted a submission by counsel for the respondent that there were a number of possible interpretations of the first of the text messages, including that it might refer, not to sexual conduct having taken place, but to an absence of sexual conduct on the preceding Friday. His Honour held that, the evidence being ambiguous, there was a danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent, which would outweigh any probative value the evidence had. Consequently, his Honour ruled that the evidence of the two text messages should not be admitted at the trial of the respondent on the charges. 
     
      
    22 There are two principal issues on this appeal, namely:- 
     
      
    1. Whether an appeal lies under s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act2. If so, whether the appeal should be allowed  
     
      
       
      To some extent, the two issues overlap. 
       
      
    1. Whether an appeal lies under s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 
     
      
    23 Section 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case”. 
        
       
      
    24 Accordingly, under s 5F(3A) an appeal will lie, only if the decision or ruling sought to be appealed from “eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case”.  
     
      
    25 It is clear that Judge Goldring’s ruling does not “eliminate” the prosecution’s case, because the prosecution would still have the evidence of the complainant. The question for determination is whether his Honour’s ruling “substantially weakens the prosecution’s case”. In determining this question, I am mindful of statements by this Court to the effect that the Crown should make only sparing use of the power to appeal conferred by s 5F(3A) (see R v NKS [2004] NSWCCA 144 at [18]) and that the provision is not intended to enable the Crown to appeal against any adverse evidentiary ruling (see R v Lameri [2004] NSWCCA 217 at [34]). 
     
      
    26 In R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112 it was held by Spigelman CJ, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, that on an appeal under s 5F(3A) the Crown bears the onus of establishing that the exclusion of the evidence would substantially weaken its case (at [30]); that it is necessary to assess the strength of the Crown case, apart from the disputed evidence, in order to determine whether the exclusion of the disputed evidence would substantially weaken the Crown case (at [31]); and that “even a case which is otherwise likely, even very likely, to succeed may still be “substantially weakened” if evidence of cogency or force is withheld (at [37])”. 
     
      
    27 Although other authorities on the meaning of the word “substantial” in other contexts were put before this Court, I consider that the Court should adopt the criterion stated by the Chief Justice in Shamouil for determining whether the prosecution case would be “substantially weakened”. 
     
      
    28 In the present case, if the evidence of the text messages of 10 January 2006 is excluded, the Crown could still rely on the evidence of the complainant about the events of 6 January 2006 and the text message of 9 January 2006 and evidence of a prompt complaint by the complainant to KF. Such a Crown case could well succeed.  
     
      
    29 However, such a Crown case would depend for its success almost entirely on the jury’s forming a favourable view of the credibility of the complainant. It can be anticipated that at a trial the credibility of the complainant would be attacked, on grounds including the complainant’s obvious hostility to the respondent and what, it would be suggested, is the inherent unlikelihood of the respondent engaging in sexual acts with the complainant in a bathroom in a hospital to which other persons had access. 
     
      
    30 In my opinion, the two text messages, which occurred only three minutes apart and without any intervening message from the complainant, are clearly open to the interpretation urged by the Crown that the respondent was admitting that on Friday 6 January 2006 sexual acts had occurred between the respondent and the complainant and that the respondent now regretted what he had done. The respondent’s expressed regret is capable of forming part of the basis for an inference that the respondent knew that the complainant had not consented to the sexual acts. 
     
      
    31 In these circumstances, I consider that evidence of the two text messages, is evidence of cogency and force within the criterion in Shamouil and the exclusion of that evidence would “substantially weaken” the prosecution case.2. Whether the appeal should be allowed 32 As I indicated earlier, Judge Goldring held that evidence of the two text messages had little probative value and that such probative value as the evidence had was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and, consequently, evidence of the two text messages should be excluded. 
     
      
    33 An application by a judge of s 137 of the Evidence Act does not, strictly speaking, involve the exercise of a discretion. In applying s 137 a judge is required to assess the probative value of the evidence in question and to assess the danger of unfair prejudice and then to weigh the probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice. See R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326. 
     
      
    34 However, for the purposes of an appeal, an application of s 137 is to be regarded as analogous to the exercise of a discretion and, therefore, can be reviewed by an appellate court only in accordance with the principles stated in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. See R v Blick at 333 [19], Vickers v Regina (2006) 160 A Crim R 195 at 210 [76]. 
     
      
    35 It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that Judge Goldring had not made any error within the principles stated in House v The King and therefore his Honour’s ruling could not be successfully challenged. 
     
      
    36 As I have already indicated, Judge Goldring held that evidence “must be unambiguous, if it is to satisfy the tests in s 137” and applying this principle and his view that the evidence was not free from ambiguity, he held there was a danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent which outweighed any probative value the evidence had.  
     
      
    37 In my opinion, in directing himself that evidence “must be unambiguous, if it is to satisfy the tests in s 137” his Honour was “acting upon a wrong principle” within the statement of principles in House v The King.  
     
      
    38 It not infrequently happens that evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown in a criminal trial is open to more than one interpretation or is capable of giving rise to more than one inference. However, provided that the evidence is capable of bearing the interpretation or of giving rise to the interference contended for by the Crown, the fact that the defence can suggest some other interpretation or inference which would be consistent with the innocence of the accused does not, of itself, show that any probative value the evidence has is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  
     
      
    39 It is part of the function of the jury as the judges of the facts to determine what interpretation should be given to evidence they accept and to determine what inferences should be drawn from evidence they accept. It is frequently part of the function of the jury to determine which, if any, of a number of competing inferences should be drawn. 
     
      
    40 Some remarks made by McPherson J of the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Berrill [1982] Qd R 508, which were quoted with approval by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Kalajzich (1989) 39 A Crim R 415 at 430 were directed to evidence relied on by the Crown as corroboration but are of general application. McPherson J said in part:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether it (the evidence in question) in fact bears the interpretation placed upon it by the prosecution is a matter of inference, and as such, a matter of fact for the jury to whose decision it should ordinarily be left…For the judge to withdraw it from the jury simply because some possible alternative inference is open involves a usurpation of the jury’s function…” 
        
       
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    41 In my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and the ruling made by his Honour Judge Goldring on 12 March 2007 that evidence of the two text messages is inadmissible should be set aside.  
     
      
    42 I do not, however, consider that this Court should make an order that evidence of the two text messages will be admissible at any trial of the respondent on the charges. There is no current trial in the District Court and it is conceivable that some change in circumstances might occur before any trial takes place. 
     
      
    43 ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of James J. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and generally with the reasons given for them.  
     
      
    44 James J deals with the allegations of sexual assault which were said to have occurred on 6 January 2006. On the voir dire, Goldring DCJ had before him the witness statement of the victim which refers to the circumstances of the alleged assault during which it is said penile penetration occurred. Thereafter the witness statement alleges that the accused went inside to speak to a doctor while the victim was left in the room with her friend. It is alleged that during that time the victim told her friend that she had been forced to have sex with the accused. The witness statement immediately thereafter has the following paragraph: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The accused] came back out and told us what the doctor said and we waited for him to finish his lunch and then we went into the lounge there and then made up a story about [the friend’s] kids so that we could go. We had an argument, I can’t remember the exact words but he said, ‘I want to make sure no one uses me cunt’ I told him to ‘get fucked’ and that’s when we left. [The accused] walked us out and I said, ‘You’re an arsehole.’ He said, ‘Why’ I said, ‘because of what you said’, and he said, ‘Well you can understand for what you did to me while I was in gaol.’ I had slept with another person while he was in gaol. We travelled back to Lithgow and I spoke with [the friend] about what had happened.” 
        
       
      
    45 It is in the context of the foregoing that one must understand the text message said to have been received on 9 January 2006. It was in the context of an allegation of forced sexual intercourse and an allegation about an argument concerning whether the victim would “cheat” on the accused during the time that he was incarcerated.  
     
      
    46 In those circumstances the reference in the text message of 9 January 2006 to being sorry for what occurred on Friday may have a different connotation than a reference to forced sexual intercourse. Those circumstances may also disclose a different connotation to the text messages on 10 January 2006.  
     
      
    47 However, the inference and interpretation sought to be drawn by the Crown is an inference and interpretation that is open and plainly so. Further the text messages are probative both for the reasons given by the Crown and also to disclose the context and relationship between the accused and the victim.  
     
      
    48 While it is true, on one interpretation and inference, the apology relates to the argument which, in turn, refers to sexual activity, there is clearly an inference available that the text messages of 10 January 2006 admit to sexual intercourse having occurred on 6 January. As a consequence it is highly relevant to an issue of fact in the trial.  
     
      
    49 It is not unusual for there to be competing views (each of which may be open) as to the meaning of a statement alleged to be an admission of fact in issue at the trial. I agree with James J that so long as the evidence is capable of bearing the interpretation or giving rise to the inference contended for by the Crown, the fact that there may be other interpretations or inferences available consistent with the innocence of the accused does not, of itself, show that any probative value the evidence has is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  
     
      
    50 In those circumstances Goldring DCJ has erred.  
     
      
    51 Section 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) grants the right of appeal to the Crown on a ruling on the admissibility of evidence only in circumstances where the ruling “eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case”. 
     
      
    52 In my view the term “substantially weakens” must be understood in the context that it is used as an alternative to “eliminates”.  
     
      
    53 The word “substantially” has two quite distinct meanings.  
     
      
       
        
        “The word ‘substantial’ is not only susceptible of ambiguity; it is a word calculated to conceal a lack of precision … [I]t can, in an appropriate context, mean real or of substance as distinct from ephemeral or nominal. It can also mean large, weighty or big. It can be used in the relative sense or can indicate an absolute significance, quantity or size.” (per Deane J in  
        Tillmanns Butcheries v AMIEU 
         (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 348). 
        
       
      
    54 As earlier stated the word “substantial” or “substantially” can generally have two distinct meanings: either “of substance” or “in substance”. As such it has two quite distinct effects. The first of them is to use the words “substantial” or “substantially” to qualify “existence at all” and is used in contradistinction to the term “nominal” or “ephemeral” (see for example Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v AMIEU, supra; O’Brien Glass Industries Limited v Cool and Sons Pty Ltd t/a Wagga Windscreen Service (1983) 77 FLR 441.  
     
      
    55 The second or latter use of the term “substantial” or “substantially”, meaning “in substance”, is used to qualify “totality” and is used in the sense of “essential”, “essentially”, primary examples of which would be “substantial compliance” or “substantially all” (see Bonnard v London General Omnibus (1921) 38 RPC 1; Re: Bonny [1986] 2 Qd.R 80; Re: Migliorini; ex parte Silk Brothers (1974) 22 FLR 491; Marc A Hammond Pty Ltd v Papa Carmine Pty Ltd (1977) 28 FLR 160; Palser v Grinling [1948] A.C. 291; Chatsworth Investments Ltd v Amoco (UK) Ltd [1968] 1 Ch 665; Henry Burford [1932] 2 Ch 122; A.E. Terry’s Motors Ltd v Rinder [1948] SASR 167; Commissioner for Superannuation v Scott (1987) 13 FCR 404).  
     
      
    56 In my view the words “substantially weakens” used in the context of an alternative to “eliminates” must mean that the effect of the evidence must be to weaken the Crown case more than ephemerally or more than nominally. The weakening effect of the exclusion of the evidence must be significant. This will occur when evidence of cogency or force is withheld: R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112, per Spigelman CJ at [37].  
     
      
    57 The current circumstances are such that the evidence in question is probative, has cogency or force if accepted in the manner submitted by the Crown and therefore an appeal lies.  
     
      
    58 Error having occurred in circumstances where there is an appeal from such a ruling, the orders proposed by James J are necessary and I agree with those orders. 
     
      
    59 HARRISON J: I agree with James J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, William Sultana, pleaded guilty on indictment in the District Court to a charge of break, enter and steal. He also asked the sentencing judge to take into account on a Form 1 a further offence of break, enter and steal and another of break and enter with intent to steal. On the charge on the indictment, taking into account those two offences on the Form 1, he was sentenced to imprisonment for two-and-a-half-years, comprising a non-parole period of sixteen months and a balance of term of fourteen months. The sentence was directed to date from 13 April 2006. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
     
      
    3 The application is based only upon the fact that the sentencing judge declined to backdate the sentence to take account of pre-sentence custody in respect of the Form 1 matters. To understand the argument it is necessary to sketch the chronology of the proceedings 
     
      
    4 The three offences were committed between June 2002 and April 2003. The offence of break, enter and steal on the indictment was committed at Macquarie Park in December 2002. Of the Form 1 offences, the charge of break, enter and steal arose from an offence committed at Baulkham Hills in April 2003 and the charge of break and enter with intent from an offence committed at Girraween in June 2002. The three offences were unrelated. 
     
      
    5 For reasons which need not concern us, the applicant was not arrested for any of these offences until much later. In the meantime, in April 2004 he was sentenced for another unrelated offence to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period to expire on 5 January 2005. On 30 November 2004, while in custody serving that sentence, he was charged with the Form 1 offences. As one would expect, bail was refused at that time. However, bail remained refused after 5 January 2005, even though he was granted parole from that day. On 22 March 2005 he was granted bail in the Supreme Court. 
     
      
    6 The period he spent in custody from 5 January to 23 March 2005 was two months and seventeen days. It is that period which is the subject of this application.  
     
      
    7 On 31 March 2005 he was arrested and charged in relation to the break, enter and steal offence on the indictment. He was granted bail in respect of that matter until 13 April 2006 when, for reasons which again need not concern us, bail was revoked. The three charges were to be the subject of a trial, but in June 2006 he pleaded guilty to the Macquarie Park offence and asked that the other two offences be taken into account on the Form 1. He was sentenced on 23 October 2006 and, as I have said, the sentence was to date from 13 April 2006, the day on which bail was revoked in respect of the indictment offence. 
     
      
    8 The submission in the present application is that the sentence should have been backdated by a further period of two months and seventeen days to take account of the period the applicant had spent in custody which was referable exclusively to the Form 1 matters.  
     
      
    9 The matter was argued before the sentencing judge, who expressed his conclusion in the remarks on sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        I am not satisfied that I should take into account for the purposes of backdating the sentences the two months and seventeen days that the defence submitted ought to be taken into account for the matters on Form 1. I am satisfied that the submission by the Crown in answer to the defendant’s submission that a date 13 April was the date on which the offender was put in custody for this offence ought to be the date if I so decide from which a sentence ought to be commenced. 
        
       
      
    10 Section 24(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires a court, when sentencing an offender, to take into account any time which that offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence. Section 47(2)(a) empowers a court to backdate a sentence, and subs(3) provides that in doing so the court “must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence to which the sentence relates”. 
     
      
    11 These provisions, of course, accord with long standing sentencing practice. Allowance for pre-sentence custody can be made by reducing the sentence or by backdating it. There is abundant authority that backdating is the preferable course: see, for example, R v McHugh [1985] 1 NSWLR 588 and R v Deeble (CCA, unreported, 19 September 1991). In McHugh, Street CJ said at 590-1:  
     
      
       
        
        It is desirable sentencing practice that, where there has been a period of pre-sentence custody exclusively referable to the offences for which sentence is being passed, the commencement of the sentence…should be back-dated for an equivalent period. … The desirable practice will promote the accuracy of the record, preventing there being a hidden factor affecting the length of the custody involved in consequence of the sentencing order. … A judge departing from this practice could be expected to indicate his reason for so doing. 
        
       
      
    12 The question arises in the present case because, strictly speaking, the applicant was not sentenced for the form 1 offences. The sentence was passed in respect of the offence on the indictment, with the matters on the Form 1 being taken into account in accordance with the procedure established by Division 3 of Part 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The principles governing that procedure were stated in the now familiar decision in Re Attorney-General’s Application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (No 1 of 2002) (2002) 137 A Crim R 180.  
     
      
    13 The Crown prosecutor in this Court relied upon the statement of Spigelman CJ in that case at [35] that the statutory scheme “emphasises that the court is concerned and concerned only with imposing a sentence for ‘the principal offence’”. For present purposes, however, that statement must be amplified by the oft quoted passage from his Honour’s judgment at [42]:  
     
      
       
        
        The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which (sic) there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence.  
        
       
      
    14 Moreover, earlier in the judgment the Chief Justice said at [18]: 
     
      
       
        
        A number of propositions with respect to the process of taking into account matters on a Form 1 are well established and are uncontroversial. First, the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence (or to alter the nature of the sentence) than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone. Second, it is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small. Sometimes it will be substantial.  
        
       
      
    15 Of course, whether to backdate a sentence for any reason is a matter within the discretion of the sentencing judge, although it is a discretion for which there is ample guidance in the authorities. It seems to me that the terms of ss24(a) and 47(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are capable of embracing pre-sentence custody referable to Form 1 matters, but I do not find it necessary to decide that question. The fact is that Form 1 matters normally have an impact, sometimes a substantial impact, on the sentence passed for the principal offence. Justice demands that pre-sentence custody exclusively referable to such offences should normally be taken into account and, consistently with authority, it is preferable that that be done by backdating the sentence for the principal offence.  
     
      
    16 I have arrived at that conclusion without the benefit of any authority directly on point. In Deeble (supra) the applicant had been in custody since his arrest for the principal offence, but there had been an earlier discrete period of custody referable to an offence taken into account under the procedure then available in the Crimes Act. In delivering the leading judgment, Badgery-Parker J referred to the total of those two periods of pre-sentence custody, saying that that aggregate period was “to be taken into account”. However, having decided that the court should intervene, his Honour substituted a sentence expressed to commence on the date of the applicant’s arrest for the principal offence. Whether the earlier period of custody referable to the offence taken into account led to an adjustment of the substituted sentence is not clear. However that may be, the applicant in that case was unrepresented and the issue arising in the present case was not argued.  
     
      
    17 In oral submissions, argument centred upon whether we should decline to intervene because no lesser sentence was warranted: s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. I have not recited the facts of any of the offences or the subjective material. However, it must be said that the principal offence was a serious one of its kind, as were the Form 1 offences, and the two and-a-half-years sentence is undoubtedly lenient.  
     
      
    18 The Crown prosecutor suggested that this may have been a reason why the sentencing judge declined to backdate the sentence but, as is apparent from the passage from the remarks on sentence quoted above, that is not the reason which his Honour expressed. However that may be, she argued that this Court should not backdate the sentence because to do so would render it inadequate.  
     
      
    19 I would question whether s6(3) is concerned with the date of commencement of a single sentence, as opposed to the length of it. The subsection may be relevant to the commencement dates of multiple sentences in a case where questions of accumulation or concurrency bear upon the length of the overall sentence. However, that also is not a matter which I need to decide. In my view, to backdate this sentence to the extent sought would be to do no more than recognize a period of pre-sentence custody referable to offences which were relevant to the sentence, and the result would not be inappropriately lenient.  
     
      
    20 I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would confirm the sentence passed in the District Court but would backdate it by a period of two months and seventeen days. Accordingly, instead of 13 April 2006, the sentence would commence on 28 January 2006. The non-parole period would expire on 27 May 2007 and the balance of term on 27 July 2008. I would direct the applicant’s release on parole on 27 May 2007.

     TRAN, Ty v R 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant was sentenced in relation to two offences being: 
     
      
       
      1. The ongoing supply of heroin on 5 separate occasions contrary to s 25A of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       1985. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years. 
       
       
      2. Deemed supply of heroin contrary to s 25 of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
      1985. The maximum penalty for this offence is 15 years imprisonment. 
       
      
    2 In relation to the first count the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. In relation to the second count his Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. 
     
      
    3 The sentencing judge determined that the sentences should be made partly concurrent. His Honour adjusted the commencement date of the sentence on the second count so that it commenced 3 months before the conclusion of the non-parole period on the first count. 
     
      
    4 Accordingly, the total effective non-parole period was 3 years imprisonment and the total effective sentence was 4 years and 6 months. 
     
      
    5 The applicant does not complain in relation to the terms of the individual sentences. His complaint is confined to a submission that greater concurrency of the sentences should have been provided. It was submitted “that by ordering that only 3 months of the two sentences should be dealt with concurrently, his Honour did not give sufficient effect to the principle of totality.” 
     
      
    6 The sentencing judge found that the applicant was involved in a commercial business operating “above the street level of sales.” In relation to the first count there was evidence that on four occasions the applicant supplied heroin in approximately 5 gram packages. On the fifth occasion he sold 56 grams of heroin. On that day the applicant was found to be in possession of a further 75 grams of heroin which gave rise to the second charge. 
     
      
    7 Accordingly, in total the applicant either supplied, or had in his possession 151 grams of heroin. 
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge did not distinguish in great detail between the facts relevant to the criminality in relation to each offence. His Honour found that the crimes were serious and that the applicant was further up the chain of sales than street sellers, some of whom were involved in the s 25A matters. His Honour found that the applicant had no regard to where the heroin which he supplied may end up and the consequences for those who might use it. His Honour determined that the potential harm to the community from the supply of the drugs was significant. His Honour found that having regard to the quantities supplied in relation to the first count and in his possession in relation to the second count, the applicant had access and control over an amount of heroin that placed “the offence as being slightly above the middle of any scale constructed for such an offence.” This conclusion was directed to the second count. 
     
      
    9 His Honour had regard to the applicant’s plea of guilty and allowed a discount of 25%. His Honour also addressed the question of totality and determined: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the fact that the second offence relates to the supply of heroin being a deemed supply, being a supply in the possession of the offender, in addition to that which comprises the fifth ingredient of the first offence, I am of the view that the sentence for the second should be partly cumulative and partly concurrent.” 
        
       
      
    10 As I have indicated the applicant does not complain that the individual sentences are excessive. To my mind such a submission would have had no prospects of success. The Court was referred to a number of decisions in relation to sentences for offences contrary to s 25A. Although the Crown contended that these decisions supported the sentence on the s 25A matter the applicant argued that each of them contained features of aggravation which were not present in the applicant’s case. The decisions were R v Siljanovski and Kostadinovic [2003] NSWCCA 38; R v Sakkar [2003] NSWCCA 26; R v Gordon [2002] NSWCCA 476. R v Bruppacher [2002] NSWCCA 182, R v Radford [2002] NSWCCA 122; R v Gill [2002] NSWCCA 93; R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 26; R v Arnott [2001] NSWCCA 497. It is unnecessary to analyse each of these decisions. There are features in some of them which would distinguish them from the circumstances of the applicant. However, the applicant does not contend that the sentence imposed on the first count was excessive. 
     
      
    11 The applicant submitted that his Honour failed to adequately distinguish between the objective criminality of each offence. In particular it was submitted that his Honour’s finding that the applicant was engaged in a commercial business, which was in part informed by evidence in relation to both counts, had caused his Honour to elevate the objective seriousness of each offence. In my opinion there is no substance in this submission. If his Honour did err in the manner suggested the consequence must have been to impermissibly increase the sentence for each offence. However, as I have indicated the applicant does not complain that the individual sentences were excessive.  
     
      
    12 The relationship between offences committed contrary to s 25 and s 25A of the Act was considered by the legislature when s 25A was enacted. Section 25A(5) deals with the possibility of double jeopardy and provides that a person who has been convicted of an offence under s 25A is not liable to be convicted, inter alia, of an offence under s 25 on the same or substantially the same facts. Accordingly, if, as happened in the present case, a person is apprehended in the course of an occasion of supply contrary to s 25A, the drugs supplied cannot form part of a deemed supply offence. Separate sentences for a breach of the separate statutory provisions must be imposed. 
     
      
    13 However, when, as happened in the present case, a person is being sentenced at the same time for breaches of s 25 and s 25A the common law principles provided in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 must be followed. In Pearce McHugh, Hayne, Callinan JJ said (at 623): 
     
      
       
        
        “To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn. Often those boundaries will be drawn in a way that means the offences overlap. To punish an offender twice if conduct falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts.” 
        
       
      
    14 In the present case the sentencing judge was satisfied that the evidence supporting a breach of s 25A and s 25 justified a finding that the applicant was engaged in a commercial business. His operation was further up the chain than a street seller and he was to be sentenced accordingly. Because the final supply of 56 grams occurred on the same day as he was found to possess a further 75 grams of heroin his Honour determined that a degree of concurrency was required. His Honour was otherwise satisfied that the s 25A offences were distinct from the s 25 offence. As was accepted by counsel for the applicant the evidence did not suggest that the earlier occasions of supply had come from a larger quantity of which the residue was the 75 grams ultimately found in his possession. 
     
      
    15 Although his Honour provided a concurrency of non-parole periods of 3 months the total sentences were made concurrent by a period of 21 months. The consequence is that in relation to the breach of s 25 the applicant was sentenced to an effective non-parole period of only 9 months and a total effective term of 9 months. This was undoubtedly a lenient sentence and may in my opinion standing alone have been manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    16 The overall effective sentence was 4 years and 6 months with an effective non-parole period of 3 years. When considering the applicant’s total criminality it was relevant that he had possessed over a short period of time a total of 151 grams of heroin and was engaged in a commercial enterprise supplying to others who would resell to users. This was a significant quantity of heroin which called for a penalty which both punished the applicant, deterred him from reoffending and deterred others from taking up a business of supplying heroin. To my mind the total sentence which his Honour determined, after considering the individual sentences and matters of concurrence was appropriate. 
     
      
    17 Although I would grant leave to appeal I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    18 HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL and with his Honour’s reasons, as I do with the additional observations of Rothman J. 
     
      
    19 ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. I agree generally with the reasons of his Honour and I agree with the orders he proposes.  
     
      
    20 An offence under section 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) is a serious offence carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years. It requires, as an element of the offence, an ongoing actual supply of drugs. Invariably, in order to perpetrate an offence under section 25A, the offender would need to be in possession of illicit drugs of a quantity which would, pursuant to the terms of section 25 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act, be deemed to be supply.  
     
      
    21 In dealing with the issue of totality in sentencing, it is important that the culpability of the offender is not double counted.  
     
      
    22 In the current circumstances, were I sentencing afresh, I would have imposed a more significant sentence for the offence under section 25 and provided for a greater degree of concurrence between the two sentences. But sentencing is not mathematical nor is any one result mandated. Sentencing judges must be allowed as much flexibility as possible provided that the sentencing process is “consonant with consistency of approach and … accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected”: Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at 624 [26].  
     
      
    23 While the approach of his Honour in sentencing may not accord with the same approach I would take to the “orthodox method” espoused in Mill v The Queen (1998) 166 CLR 59 and referred to in Pearce, supra, and Johnson, supra, it neither discloses error nor is error manifest.  
     
      
    24 His Honour seems to have taken an approach slightly at variance with that which is described as “orthodox” in Johnson, supra, at [26]. Nevertheless his Honour has not had regard only to the total effective sentence and his Honour has not committed error.  
     
      
    25 Further the sentence imposed would not pass the limitations imposed by section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  
     
      
    26 I agree with the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL and with the orders he proposes.

      JUDGMENT (on applications by Accused for stay of commencement of trial - see T106) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: By Notice of Motion dated 18 May 2007, the Accused seeks the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) that proceedings on the charges under the  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
       in respect of which the jury was discharged on 16 May 2007 be stayed unless and until the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions pays the reasonable costs incurred by or on behalf of the Accused in relation to the trial that commenced on 26 March 2007; 
       
       
      (b) that proceedings on the charges under the  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)  
      in respect of which the jury was discharged on 16 May 2007 be stayed for a period of two months. 
       
      
    2 The Accused makes three applications in support of the relief sough in the Notice of Motion: 
     
      
       
      (a) an application for a stay conditional upon the Crown paying the Accused’s costs of the aborted trial in accordance with the principles in  
      R v Fisher  
      (2003) 56 NSWLR 625; 
       
       
      (b) an application for a temporary stay of the commencement of the trial for a period of two months as a result of material broadcast concerning the Accused on the evening of 16 May 2007 on the  
      “PM” 
       programme on ABC Radio;  
       
       
      (c) an application to adjourn the commencement of the trial for a period of two months to allow the Accused to put in place arrangements for payment of his legal costs and expenses for the purpose of the forthcoming trial. 
       
       
      General Background 
       
      
    3 The history of the litigation giving rise to this trial may be found in R v Petroulias (No. 1) [2006] NSWSC 788. On 26 March 2007, a jury was selected and the trial of the Accused commenced upon an indictment alleging the following offences: 
     
      
       
      (a) one count of defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s.29D  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      ; 
       
       
      (b) one count of agreeing to receive a benefit on an understanding that the exercise by him of his duty as a Commonwealth officer would be affected contrary to s.73  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      ; and 
       
       
      (c) one count of publishing to a person to whom he was not authorised to publish, documents which came into his possession by virtue of him being a Commonwealth officer and which it was his duty not to disclose, an offence under s.70  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      . 
       
      
    4 The trial that commenced on 26 March 2007 was a retrial following a trial before Sully J and a jury in 2005 at which the jury was unable to agree and was discharged. 
     
      
    5 On 7 May 2007, a juror did not attend Court to continue his participation in the criminal trial of the Accused. Enquiries then undertaken revealed that the absent juror had been disqualified from driving a motor vehicle by court order or orders since 2002 and remained disqualified until 2015. Having heard submissions from the parties, I determined to discharge the absent juror under s.22 Jury Act 1977 and to direct that the trial of the Accused continue before the remaining 11 jurors: R v Petroulias (No. 17) [2007] NSWSC 499. The Accused appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s.5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and on 16 May 2007, by majority, that Court upheld the appeal, vacated my judgment of 10 May 2007 and ordered that the jury be discharged: Petroulias v R [2007] NSWCCA 134.  
     
      
    6 On 16 May 2007, the remaining 11 members of the jury were released following the order for discharge of the Court of Criminal Appeal. Thereafter, I indicated my intention to empanel a fresh jury and to commence the trial of the Accused on 21 May 2007. On 18 May 2007, I was informed that orders of the type now contained in the Notice of Motion would be sought by the Accused. The hearing of those applications proceeded on 21 and 22 May 2007.  
     
      
    7 Having regard to the subject matter of the applications, including a submission that adverse media publicity ought lead to a delay of the trial, both the Crown and the Accused sought an order prohibiting publication of the present applications. That non-publication order extends to the content of this judgment. 
     
      
       
      Application for Stay Conditional Upon Crown Paying Costs of Accused of the Aborted Trial 
       
      
    8 Mr Sutherland SC, for the Accused, submits that, in the circumstances of this case, it is both open and appropriate to stay conditionally the trial of the Accused unless and until the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions pays the reasonable costs incurred by or on his behalf in relation to the aborted trial. The Crown submits that, in the circumstances of this case, such an order ought not be made. 
     
      
    9 I note that Mr Sutherland SC made clear that no application was made by the Accused for a certificate under s.6A Suitors’ Fund Act 1951. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for me to determine whether that Act is available where a jury trial for Commonwealth offences has been aborted: cf Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Owens [No. 2] [1953] 88 CLR 168 at 169; Solomons v District Court of NSW [2002] 211 CLR 119 at 130 [9].  
     
      
    10 Mr Sutherland SC submits that it is not a prerequisite for such a conditional stay that the aborted trial giving rise to wasted costs occurred as a result of some fault or wrongdoing on the part of the Crown. Although acknowledging that this was the factual context in which the principle had been applied in past cases such as R v Fisher, Mr Sutherland SC submits that the power to grant such a stay arises in the exercise of the Court’s power to control abuse of process and to guard against unfairness in the trial process. He submits that fairness to the Accused simpliciter is the test. 
     
      
    11 He cites the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23 referred to in R v Fisher at 631-632 [31]-[34].  
     
      
    12 In support of his submission that fault or wrongdoing on the part of the Crown is not required before such an order may be made, Mr Sutherland SC refers to Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 543, where Mason CJ observed, in the context of a statutory costs regime for summary prosecutions, that, in criminal as well as civil proceedings, costs are not awarded by way of punishment of the unsuccessful party, but are compensatory in the sense that they are awarded to indemnify the successful party against the expense to which he or she has been put by way of reason of the legal proceedings. It was submitted that these principles were capable of extension to the present circumstances. 
     
      
    13 Mr Sutherland SC acknowledges that the failure in this case was a failure of the “machinery of the State” (T38.52, 21 May 2007) with respect to the disqualified juror and that this state of affairs did not become known to the Crown, the Accused or the Court until 7 May 2007, the 25th day of the trial. Mr Sutherland SC advanced an argument that, relevant to the concept of fairness in this case was recent action taken by officers of the Australian Taxation Office which had the effect of preventing funds becoming available for the Accused’s defence. The evidence reveals that officers of the Australian Taxation Office issued an assessment and a notice under s.260-5 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) on 14 May 2007, with respect to a sum of money (about $512,000.00) to be paid to Prepaid Professional Administration Limited (“Prepaid”) pursuant to court proceedings in Queensland (Exhibit C1, Annexures EWC-01 and 02; Exhibit D2, paragraph 26ff). I will refer to this issue again later in this judgment.  
     
      
    14 For present purposes, however, I note that the evidence reveals a type of arrangement where these funds were to be directed to fund the Accused’s defence. Senior Counsel for the Accused points to the temporal coincidence in the issue of such a statutory notice which has the effect of freezing monies which would otherwise become available for use to fund the defence. Mr Sutherland SC advanced a series of submissions on this topic which are recorded in the transcript (T42-49, 21 May 2007). He submits that the timing of the issue of the notice, against the background of the trial of the Accused, gives rise at least to suspicion concerning the motivation of those who issued the notice. He acknowledges that litigation in another forum would be required to determine whether the assessment and notice were valid and justifiable. Mr Sutherland SC submits that I ought find that the action in issuing the assessment and notice in Queensland was done with the full knowledge by the Australian Taxation Office of the intended use of those funds for the defence of the Accused. 
     
      
    15 Mr Sutherland SC submits that, in the present circumstances, fairness requires the grant of a conditional stay as sought in paragraph 1 of the Notice of Motion. To the extent that the judgment of Fullerton J in Selim v R [2007] NSWSC 154 determined that fault or wrongdoing on the part of the Crown was a prerequisite to the grant of such a stay, Mr Sutherland SC submits that I ought not follow her Honour’s decision (T45-46, 21 May 2007). 
     
      
    16 Mr Sutherland SC submits in the alternative, that if fault on the part of the Crown is a requirement, it may be found in “the machinery of the State” and in the conduct of officers of the Australian Taxation Office which, he submits, is the Commonwealth agency which “underpins this prosecution”, by their action to deprive the Accused of funds which he otherwise expected to receive. He submits that, for this purpose, the Crown ought be understood in the “broadest sense of that term” (T46-47, 21 May 2007). 
     
      
    17 The Crown submits that the existence of fault or wrongdoing on the part of the Crown is a requirement for the grant of such a stay. So much is apparent from R v Fisher and the authorities referred to in that decision. The Crown submits that Fullerton J was correct in the statement of principles in Selim v R and that I ought follow her Honour’s decision in that respect. 
     
      
    18 The Crown submits that the recent trial was aborted through no fault of the Crown which, like the Accused, was unaware of the problem of the disqualified juror until the issue emerged following enquiries made on 7 May 2007. 
     
      
    19 With respect to actions of officers of the Australian Taxation Office on 14 May 2007 concerning the Queensland proceedings, the Crown submits that no foundation for an order arises from that conduct. The Crown points to the fact that Australian Taxation Office investigations had been on foot since November 2006 and that consequential action, such as the issue of an assessment and a s.260-5 Notice, could not have been unexpected. The Crown submits that it would have been extraordinary if the Australian Taxation Office had not taken steps to secure a debt said to be owing to the Commonwealth when monies were otherwise about to be released to Prepaid.  
     
      
    20 The Crown submits that no relevant link could be drawn between the present prosecution and the Queensland investigatory action. Nor was the Court in a position to, in some way, make an assessment of the validity or appropriateness of the assessment and notice issued in Queensland. Whichever way this issue is approached, the Crown submits that these events in Queensland do not constitute fault or wrongdoing on the part of the Crown so as to permit the making of an order in accordance with the principles in R v Fisher. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    21 Mr Sutherland SC submits that I should not follow the decision of Fullerton J in Selim v R in certain respects. As a matter of comity, I should follow the decision of a single judge of this Court unless I am convinced that the judgement was wrong: Segal v Waverley Council (2005) 64 NSWLR 177 at 193 [57]; R v Petroulias (No. 1) at [44]-[45]. To the contrary, I am convinced that the decision of Fullerton J is correct. I agree entirely with it and will follow it in this case.  
     
      
    22 Fullerton J observed in Selim v R at [53] that the onus of establishing unfairness of a relevant kind rests on the Accused and that it is not the law that there is any necessary unfairness to an Accused by the mere fact of there being a second or even a third trial in respect of the same alleged criminal conduct. I adopt her Honour’s summary of relevant principles at [51]-[52].  
     
      
    23 I agree also with the analysis of Fullerton J at [57]-[58] that, on an application such as this, there needs to be demonstrated an identifiable injustice for which it can be sensibly said that the prosecuting authorities should be held responsible before a temporary stay is ordered, given that the effect of ordering the stay is to impose on the Crown the costs of previous proceedings before the Crown may be permitted to prosecute again. It is not necessary for an accused, on such an application, to establish fault in the sense of mala fides on the part of the prosecuting authorities. However, fault or error on the part of the Crown ought be established before such relief could be granted. 
     
      
    24 Applying these principles to the present case, I am not satisfied that the Accused has demonstrated an identifiable injustice for which it can be sensibly said that the prosecuting authorities should be held responsible. 
     
      
    25 I acknowledge the lengthy and complicated history of the present litigation, including the first trial before Sully J and a jury in 2005 where the jury could not agree and were discharged without verdict.  
     
      
    26 However, the circumstances in which the jury came to be discharged on 16 May 2007 disclosed no fault or wrongdoing on the part of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, or any Commonwealth agency.  
     
      
    27 I do not consider that events in Queensland, including the issue of an assessment and a s.260-5 Notice on 14 May 2007, assists the Accused on the present application. The evidence does not demonstrate that this action was, in some way, related to the trial and the conduct of the Crown in the trial. The taking of such action by the Australian Taxation Office follows investigatory steps taken in and after November 2006. No basis is revealed in the evidence before me for a finding that such action by the Australian Taxation Office was, in some way, invalid, improper or otherwise inappropriate. I do not consider that this aspect demonstrates any fault or wrongdoing on the part of the Commonwealth Crown. Nor am I satisfied that this feature gives rise to an identifiable injustice for which it can be sensibly said that the prosecuting authorities should be held responsible.  
     
      
    28 I do not consider that Latoudis v Casey assists the Accused on the present application. The statement of Mason CJ which is relied upon arises in the context of a statutory scheme permitting orders for costs to be made in summary criminal proceedings. As Dawson J noted in Latoudis v Casey at 557, historically, in criminal proceedings the basic common law principle is that the Crown neither pays nor receives costs. This principle is well recognised: R v Mosely (1992) 28 NSWLR 735 at 738-9; Director of Public Prosecutions v Deeks (1994) 34 NSWLR 523 at 531-2, 536.  
     
      
    29 The conditional stay costs-ordering power referred to in R v Fisher arises in a context where there is no statutory power to order costs. In my view, a fair reading of the decision in R v Fisher demonstrates that fault or wrongdoing on the part of the Crown (even if unintentional) is a required element for the grant of a conditional stay of this class: R v Fisher at 626 [2]-[4], 633-634 [41]-[47]. The fairness test to be applied in such cases must take into account whether such fault or wrongdoing, in the R v Fisher sense, is demonstrated in the particular case.  
     
      
    30 In my view, fault or wrongdoing on the part of the Crown is not demonstrated in the present case. I decline to make an order as sought in paragraph 1 of the Notice of Motion. 
     
      
       
      Application for Temporary Stay Arising From Media Publicity 
       
      
    31 On 16 May 2007, the Court of Criminal Appeal delivered judgment allowing the appeal from my decision to discharge the absent juror and to continue the trial under s.22 Jury Act 1977 with the remaining 11 jurors constituting the jury. The judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal was published as was my judgment with respect to the same topic. This was done with the knowledge of the Crown and the Accused and without any submission that publication of those judgments should be, in some way, curtailed (T1420, 16 May 2007). 
     
      
    32 On the evening of Wednesday, 16 May 2007, an item was broadcast on ABC Radio on the “PM” programme concerning the aborted trial. It is this broadcast, and this broadcast only, which gives rise to an application by the Accused for a temporary stay of the commencement of the trial for two months. Mr Sutherland SC has not submitted that any other media publicity, print or electronic, following the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 16 May 2007 warrants the making of such an order.  
     
      
    33 The item broadcast on the “PM” programme was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “MARK COLVIN: The retrial of former First Assistant Tax Commissioner Nick Petroulias was aborted today. 
         
         
        It was called off after one of the jurors was found to have been unlawfully empanelled. 
         
         
        Mr Petroulias is charged with three counts, including defrauding the Commonwealth of as much as $1 billion.  
         
         
        His first trial, in 2005, ended with a hung jury.  
         
         
        And in another twist to this long running saga PM has learned that the group bankrolling Mr Petroulias has been hit with a big tax assessment. 
         
         
        Emma Alberici has our report. 
         
         
        EMMA ALBERICI: The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal discharged the remaining 11 jurors today in the Supreme Court case against former First Assistant Tax Commissioner, Nick Petroulias. 
         
         
        The rogue juror was a disqualified driver caught speeding earlier this month. He was refused bail on a string of driving charges. 
         
         
        Under the Jury Act that made him unfit to become a juror in the first place and forced the judge to cancel the trial. 
         
         
        This was the 25th day of Mr Petroulias's retrial. His first trial in 2005 ended with a hung jury. 
         
         
        It's understood the entire legal process, which began with his arrest in 2000, has cost Nick Petroulias $9 million. The Tax Office, which has funded the bulk of the prosecution's case, is thought to have forked out more than $30 million. 
         
         
        PM can reveal that Mr Petroulias's legal costs have been covered by Pleroma, an investment company based in Malaysia. 
         
         
        That company has been embroiled in a legal dispute in Queensland where the relationship with Mr Petroulias first emerged. 
         
         
        Pleroma does business with an Australian based agent and trustee called Prepaid Professional Administration or PPPA.  
         
         
        PPPA owes Pleroma $800,000, money that was supposed to be channelled to Nick Petroulias's legal costs. 
         
         
        This has all become public knowledge in the past month, and coincidentally, this week, as it appeared that PPPA was about to hand over to Pleroma its $800,000, it received an assessment from the Tax Office alleging that that money and other cash it's collected in Australia is in fact taxable income rather than money held in trust on behalf of others. The Tax Office is asking for more than $1 million.  
         
         
        In December last year the Tax Office launched a series of raids in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and in New Zealand of 200 people who'd done business with Nick Petroulias over the past 10 years. At the time, his counsel, Stephen O'Bryan said Petroulias was a man who is ‘a high priority target for the Australian Tax Office.’  
         
         
        Petroulias denied he'd been involved in anything that would merit attention from the Tax Office. Six months later, the Tax Office is yet to detail its latest concerns against its former big gun.  
         
         
        The Tax Office's bribery and fraud case against Mr Petroulias will now go to a third trial which is due to start next Monday.  
         
         
        MARK COLVIN: Emma Alberici.” 
        
       
      
    34 In support of the present application, the Accused has tendered a Media Analysis Report dated 21 May 2007 (Exhibit D1). The objective of the report was to determine the listening audience of the ABC network at 6.38 pm on Wednesday, 16 May 2007 when the relevant broadcast was made on ABC Local Radio (702AM). The present application was approached upon the basis that the same item was broadcast after 5.10 pm on the same evening on Radio National (576AM). According to the report tendered for the Accused, AC Nielsen Media Information suggests that, within the Sydney market, the ABC is the second largest radio station in terms of listener numbers from both commercial and government run radio networks. In the Sydney radio market, the report indicates that 702AM attracts a share of the market between 10.9% and 11.7% between 4.00 pm and 7.00 pm on weeknights with 576AM attracting between 2.1% and 2.3% of the market in the same period. The largest audience component lies within the age groups 40-54 years and 55+ years.  
     
      
    35 Mr Sutherland SC submits that the broadcast contained material prejudicial to the Accused, so that an adjournment in the order of two months ought be granted to avoid the risk of prejudice in the minds of a future jury. He submits that a number of “imputations” arose from the broadcast (T48-53, 21 May 2007). These included: 
     
      
       
      (a) that the Accused had defrauded the Commonwealth  
      “of as much as $1 billion” 
      ;  
       
       
      (b) that the legal process has cost the Accused $9 million, which the reasonable listener might conclude was the product of the $1 billion allegedly defrauded from the Commonwealth; 
       
       
      (c) that the group  
      “bankrolling” 
       the Accused had been  
      “hit with a big tax assessment” 
       thereby supporting the view that ill-gotten gains had been used to fund the defence of the Accused; 
       
       
      (d) that the Accused and others had been the subject of ongoing Australian Taxation Office investigations since late 2006 which had led to the sum of $800,000.00, intended to be  
      “channelled” 
       to the Accused’s legal costs, being demanded by the Australian Taxation Office as  
      “taxable income rather than money held in trust on behalf of others” 
      ; 
       
       
      (e) that large and organised raids by the Australian Taxation Office on the Accused and other persons had taken place with the Accused said to be  
      “a high priority target for the Australian Tax Office” 
      ; 
       
       
      (f) that  
      “channelling” 
       of large sums of money to the legal costs for the Accused, from sources which the Australian Taxation Office regarded as being tainted, attached a sinister label to the matters outlined in the broadcast. 
       
      
    36 Mr Sutherland SC noted that a transcript of the item was retrievable via the internet on the “PM” website for any person who went looking for it. 
     
      
    37 The Crown submits that the application was based upon a radio broadcast aired, at most, twice on the evening of 16 May 2007, and that there was nothing in the broadcast which could not be cured by appropriate directions from the trial Judge. In any event, the Crown submits that, properly understood, the broadcast did not contain the adverse imputations claimed by the Accused. It disclosed that the Accused’s legal costs had come from litigation funding, and not from a reservoir of ill-gotten gains.  
     
      
    38 The Crown submits that it was a transient electronic broadcast, to be contrasted with a newspaper article with a potential for wider and ongoing dissemination. With respect to the transcript of the programme contained on the “PM” website, the Crown submits that an appropriate direction to the jury informing them of the obligation under s.68C Jury Act 1977 would guard against such material being accessed, together with appropriate general directions. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    39 The relevant principles to be applied on an application such as this are not in doubt. A person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to a fair trial by a tribunal which is both independent and impartial: R v Yuill (1993) 69 A Crim R 450 at 452. In each case where an application is made for a stay of proceedings because of adverse publicity, there is a need for the Court to make a judgment on the particular facts before it: R v Yuill at 454. The test of fairness which governs an application such as the present involves balancing the interests of the Accused and of society in the fair trial of allegations of criminal offences and the interests of society to bring to trial, without delay, persons accused of such offences. The public has a high interest in the timely disposition of charges of serious offences and in the conviction of those who are found guilty of crime: R v Yuill at 453.  
     
      
    40 Courts will assume that jurors, properly instructed, will accept and conform to the direction of the trial Judge to decide the case solely on the evidence placed before them in the Court. There is an increasing body of judicial opinion to the effect that whatever pretrial publicity exists, jurors, when they take on the solemn responsibility of the performance of their duties in the courtroom, differentiate between gossip, rumour, news and opinion which they hear before the case and the evidence which they hear in the court in the trial for which they are empanelled: R v Yuill at 453-454. A question remains in each case whether the intensity, proximity and nature of the media coverage of the particular accused, or the particular circumstances, is such as to occasion the risk of unfairness to the accused so as to prejudice the accused’s right to a fair trial for a time after the publicity. A judgment is called upon in each case having regard to the particular facts which are proved: R v Yuill at 454. 
     
      
    41 It is not necessary for the Accused, on the present application, to demonstrate that he would not have a fair trial. It is sufficient if there is such a risk: Re K [2002] NSWCCA 374 at [9]-[10].  
     
      
    42 In assessing whether such a risk exists, it is appropriate to have regard to statements concerning the possible effect of adverse media publicity upon jurors. I have already referred to R v Yuill at 453-454 in this respect. In The Queen v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592, Mason CJ and Toohey J at 603 observed that the possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial, and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence. As Toohey J observed in  
        Hinch 
          
        [(1987) 164 CLR, at 74] 
         in the past too little weight may have been given to the capacity of jurors to assess critically what they see and hear and their ability to reach their decisions by reference to the evidence before them.” 
        
       
      
    43 In the same case, Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said at 623: 
     
      
       
        
        “The central prescript of our criminal law that no person shall be convicted of a crime otherwise than after a fair trial according to law dictates that an accused is entitled to be protected from an unacceptable and significant risk that the effect of prejudicial pre-trial publicity will preclude a fair trial. Ordinarily, that risk will be obviated by appropriate and thorough directions and, if the circumstances also require it, a temporary stay for the minimum period adjudged necessary for the pre-trial publicity to abate. The balancing of the legitimate interests of the accused and the prosecution will, in almost every case, mean that if the proceedings are to be stayed at all, they should only be stayed temporarily and for the minimum period necessary.” 
        
       
      
    44 In John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of NSW (2004) 61 NSWLR 344, Spigelman CJ (Handley JA and MW Campbell AJA agreeing) said at 366 [102]-[103]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As set out above, his Honour expressed his concern that a future trial judge could not effectively ensure a fair trial by giving the jury directions, particularly as this may highlight the issues which establish the possibility of prejudice. In this regard, in my opinion, his Honour was proceeding on a basis which has, in recent years, come to be rejected by the courts in relevantly analogous case law.  
         
         
        There are now a significant number of cases in which the issue has arisen as to whether or not an accused was able to have a fair trial in the light of substantial media publicity, indeed publicity much more sensational and sustained than anything that occurred here. Those cases have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice. Trial judges of considerable experience have asserted, again and again, that jurors approach their task in accordance with the oath they take, that they listen to the directions that they are given and implement them. In particular that they listen to the direction that they are to determine guilt only on the evidence before them.” 
        
       
      
    45 In approaching this application, it is pertinent to observe that Mr Sutherland SC, in the course of his opening to the discharged jury on 29 March 2007 adverted to past media publicity. He said (T219-220): 
     
      
       
        
        “This case is intriguing because the Crown might have, I hasten to say they haven't, they might have run a case, if these rulings were wrong and people claimed deductions they weren't entitled to, and the tax office wrote off mega dollars. No doubt you will find in the documents that early on there were considerable fears held that there had been actual loss by the Commonwealth. You will see estimates of millions of dollars. This is an unusual case for a number of reasons. I will come back to it in a moment. You have already been told that this is a retrial. The jury were discharged without verdict. It is a retrial. You are not revisiting something that somebody else has decided.  
         
         
        It is also unusual because there may well be some of you, I don't know whether there are or not, that remember the name Petroulias or remember the circumstances of his arrest. He was arrested in a blaze of publicity in March of 2000 at Melbourne airport. The Crown said what he said to the officers at the time. There are cases in which the law seeks to avoid any prejudice from the situation where there might have been some notoriety or publicity attaching to a case by sometimes delaying a trial because the adverse publicity will tone down and people think about things. I am now planting in your heads that he had some publicity. Those of you who may well have seen it, you won't be effected by anything you may have read in the past and you certainly won't go searching to look up things that were said.  
         
         
        This man was arrested in a blaze of publicity because there were great fears that this was the greatest defrauding of the Commonwealth since the Constitution. The Crown could have run a case that what this man did was cause loss to the Commonwealth and they could have trotted out figures, and if they wanted to they could have tried to run that sort of a case.” 
        
       
      
    46 Mr Sutherland SC referred again to the arrest of the Accused in a “blaze of publicity” in his opening (T244.54) and in his cross-examination of Mr Ingersoll (T306.39). In the course of submissions in the present application, Mr Sutherland SC observed that he did not know if he would seek to open to the jury in the same way at the next trial (T50.22, 21 May 2007).  
     
      
    47 I have considered the content of the broadcast upon which this application is based. I accept the Crown submission that radio broadcasts of this type are transient in nature. I do not consider that the content of the broadcast is especially prejudicial to the Accused, in any event. 
     
      
    48 I do not consider that there is a risk of an unfair trial as a result of this publicity so that the commencement of the trial ought be adjourned for a period of two months. The bringing of the present applications has caused some delay, and thus a temporal gap will result between the broadcast and the time when any jury will be empanelled. Having regard to the directions which I will give as trial Judge and the provisions contained in s.68C Jury Act 1977, I do not consider that an order ought be made, upon this basis, in accordance with paragraph 2 of the Notice of Motion. 
     
      
       
      Application for Adjournment to Permit Accused to Secure Funds for Legal Representation at Trial 
       
      
    49 The Accused seeks an adjournment of the trial for a period of two months to enable him to secure funding for his private legal representation at the trial. The Crown opposes this application, contending that there is no evidence to support a finding that the Accused is presently unable to obtain funds for his defence.  
     
      
    50 The present application is not brought strictly in accordance with the principles in Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 315 whereby the Accused claims that he is indigent and, through no fault of his own, is unable to obtain or maintain legal representation for his trial. Rather, the application is of the type identified by Barr AJ in R v Yuill (unreported, 1 November 1995, BC9501744, at page 23) where the Accused makes application for an adjournment of the trial to allow steps to be taken to ensure that monies are available to fund his defence.  
     
      
    51 This is not the first application of this type to be made by the Accused before me. On 2 March 2007, I adjourned the commencement of the trial from 5 March to 19 March 2007: R v Petroulias (No. 11). On 9 March 2007, I summarised the information provided to me on this point in the course of another judgment: R v Petroulias (No. 12). On 16 March 2007, I refused a further application by the Accused for an adjournment upon this basis, but adjourned the trial until 26 March 2007 on other grounds: R v Petroulias (No. 13). The trial commenced on 26 March 2007.  
     
      
    52 The evidence before me in March 2007 revealed that the sum of $300,000.00 per month was required to fund the defence of the Accused by senior and junior counsel (from Sydney) and two solicitors (from Melbourne). The evidence and submissions before me on the present application confirm that $300,000.00 per month has been required and expended on the Accused’s defence at trial. In March 2007, the Crown estimated that the trial would take three months and Mr Sutherland SC gave a four-month estimate. 
     
      
    53 With respect to this application, the Accused relies upon affidavits of his solicitor, Edmond William Coady, sworn in March 2007 in the context of applications determined by me in judgments Nos. 11, 12 and 13. In addition, the Accused relied upon a further affidavit of Mr Coady sworn 21 May 2007 and an affidavit of Dr William Peter Boyd sworn 21 May 2007. The Crown did not require the deponents for cross-examination. 
     
      
    54 The Crown relies upon an affidavit of Mr Coady sworn 18 May 2007 (Exhibit C1) and tendered HSBC bank statements for Prepaid for a period between June 2005 and November 2006 (Exhibit C2). In addition, the Crown relied upon the transcript of evidence and argument during earlier applications before me between 1 and 16 March 2007 (Exhibit C3).  
     
      
    55 Mr Sutherland SC submits that the evidence reveals that the Accused has, for some years, relied upon litigation funding from persons in Malaysia. It appears, on the evidence, that original financial support for the Accused emanated from a Mr Joseph Bayoud (now deceased) from Malaysia. In December 2005, Pleroma Limited (“Pleroma”) became involved “as the principal investor in litigation funding arrangements involving Mr Petroulias, and his legal conflict with the Australian Taxation Office and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions” (Affidavit of Dr Boyd, 21 May 2007, paragraph 5). Dr Boyd stated that he “entered into that agreement on the instructions of the descendents of Mr Joseph Bayoud, in accordance with what I, and other members of Mr Bayoud’s family had understood his wishes to be. Prior to that time, the late Mr Bayoud had an arrangement with Mr Petroulias by which funds were made available to Mr Petroulias as part of a litigation funding arrangement. I was not a party to that arrangement”. 
     
      
    56 The evidence does not reveal the precise nature of the commercial arrangement between Pleroma and the Accused in which Pleroma was “the principal investor”. The concept of litigation funding ordinarily, if not exclusively, arises in the context of civil litigation. In the course of submissions in the present application, I enquired of Mr Sutherland SC as to whether the involvement of Pleroma was “litigation funding” in the sense encountered in civil litigation or represented a type of loan. I did not receive an answer to the question (T28-29, 21 May 2007; T86-87, 22 May 2007). 
     
      
    57 However the arrangement be characterised, Mr Sutherland SC submits that the affidavits of Mr Coady and Dr Boyd reveal that Malaysian sources, most recently Pleroma, have provided financial assistance for the defence of the Accused. Dr Boyd states that, as at 15 September 2006, the total contribution of Pleroma to the “litigation funding arrangement” was in the order of $A5.2 million taking into account an additional commitment made by an agreement of that date.  
     
      
    58 As mentioned previously, the evidence before me in March 2007 reveals that Mr Coady had calculated fees and expenses for senior and junior counsel (from Sydney) and two solicitors (Mr Coady and Mr Lambros) from Melbourne at the rate of $300,000.00 per month. 
     
      
    59 For reasons outlined in my judgments Nos. 11, 12 and 13, and in the affidavit material before me on the present application, monies said to have been dedicated by Pleroma for the purpose of the Accused’s funding for his criminal trial have become enmeshed in civil litigation in Queensland. The sum of $785,000.00 is caught up in that process. Until recent orders of the Supreme Court of Queensland, this money was not available to be paid to Prepaid to then be utilised to fund the defence of the Accused. In circumstances where a sum of about $512,000.00 was to become available to be paid to Prepaid on 14 May 2007, officers of the Australian Taxation Office issued a s.260-5 Notice preventing the money being made available. 
     
      
    60 Mr Sutherland SC submits that the unchallenged evidence of Mr Coady and Dr Boyd reveals a willingness by Dr Boyd, for Pleroma, to consider a further payment for the funding of the Accused’s legal representation at the forthcoming trial. However, Dr Boyd states that a period of some two months will be required to allow this possibility to be properly explored with the relevant Malaysian interests (Boyd affidavit, paragraphs 15 and 16). Dr Boyd states that he will confer with Mr Scott, the solicitor for Pleroma, to “consider the legal aspects of any further advances which might be made by Pleroma Limited to or for the benefit of Mr Petroulias and to consider proposed litigation in Queensland” (paragraph 15). 
     
      
    61 Accordingly, Mr Sutherland SC submits that funds gathered by the Accused from various sources have been utilised for his defence to date. Other funds which were to be used for this purpose are tied up in Queensland as a result of actions taken there by officers of the Australian Taxation Office. In these circumstances, he submits that it is fair and reasonable that the commencement of the trial be deferred to allow the Accused to make appropriate arrangements with Dr Boyd and Pleroma for future funding.  
     
      
    62 The Crown submits that the funding arrangement appears to be “an artificial and contrived arrangement devoid of any apparent commercial reality” (T99.41, 22 May 1007). By reference to the HSBC bank account records, the Crown submits that the sum of $785,000.00 was transferred overseas “by some strange coincidence” within a few days after the raids by the Australian Taxation Office (T60.15, 21 May 2007). The Crown points to variations in the explanations provided in evidence of Mr Coady and submissions made on behalf of the Accused during the applications in March 2007 concerning the funds said to have been earmarked by Pleroma, through Prepaid, for the purpose of funding the Accused’s defence at trial. 
     
      
    63 Even if the arrangement between Pleroma, Prepaid and the Accused is entirely above board, however, the Crown submits that there is no evidence at all before the Court on the present application from the Accused to the effect that he is not able to obtain funding for his representation at present from any other source. 
     
      
    64 An affidavit of the Accused sworn 8 March 2007 in the Prepaid proceedings before the Supreme Court of Queensland is exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Coady sworn 8 March 2007 (part Exhibit D5). That affidavit of the Accused is in evidence before me as part of the history of the litigation. Both the Crown and the Accused submit that I am entitled to have regard to it, although it is not an affidavit sworn in support of the present application and the Accused has not made himself available for cross-examination upon it. 
     
      
    65 The Crown notes that, at paragraph 20 of the affidavit, the Accused states that “at this time [8 March 2007] I do not have other funds available to me for payment of costs to solicitors and counsel”. At paragraph 21, the Accused states that “without these funds [the funds tied up in the Queensland proceedings] I will not be able to complete my obligations to counsel and solicitors engaged for that trial, and I am in serious risk of being unrepresented”. 
     
      
    66 The Crown notes that there is no affidavit on the present application in which the Accused deposes to a current inability, as at May 2007, to fund private legal representation from sources other than Pleroma or those tied up in the Queensland Supreme Court proceedings. The Crown submits that the affidavit of Mr Coady sworn 18 May 2007 (Exhibit C1) discloses that arrangements with the Accused for funding the trial which commenced on 26 March 2007 involved “the provision by him of approximately $600,000.00 together with anticipated recoveries from the two actions in Brisbane”. The Crown points to the evidence of Mr Coady (T1011, 16 March 2007, Exhibit C3) that monies which had been received (apart from those associated with Pleroma and the Queensland proceedings) came from Ms Denise Clark, an associate of the Accused from New Zealand. 
     
      
    67 It is common ground that Ms Clark has been present in Court during the aborted trial on a regular basis over a period of about three weeks (T98, 22 May 2007). I infer that she has an ongoing close association with the Accused. 
     
      
    68 The Crown points to the absence of evidence from the Accused and Ms Clark concerning his present ability, or inability, to provide funds for his defence from sources other than Pleroma and the sums tied up in Queensland.  
     
      
    69 Mr Sutherland SC submits that it is understandable that the Accused may not wish to expose himself to cross-examination on the present application concerning his financial dealings. In response, the Crown points out that the Accused was prepared to swear an affidavit on 8 March 2007 in the Prepaid proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland. Further, it was common ground that the Accused gave evidence before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 2006, and was cross-examined extensively with respect to a taxpayer’s involvement with warrant arrangements with Prepaid (T103-104, 22 May 2007). The Crown submits that the willingness of the Accused to give evidence before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 2006, and to swear an affidavit for use in the Supreme Court of Queensland in March 2007, is not consistent with the submission that there may be good reasons for him not wishing to give evidence on the present application. 
     
      
    70 The Crown submits that the Accused has not established a foundation for an adjournment to be granted to permit him to secure funds for his legal representation at trial. The Crown submits that there is no evidence to support a finding that the Accused is presently incapable of funding such representation. The Crown submits that “this whole question of the funds available to the Accused lacks evidentiary support and cogency in order to enable [the Court] to form any view to the effect that the Accused is lacking in funds to enable him to continue to be represented in the trial” (T58.54, 21 May 2007). 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    71 In determining this part of the application, it is appropriate to bear in mind that the Accused bears the onus of establishing a factual foundation for the adjournment which he seeks. Mr Sutherland SC did not submit to the contrary (T89, 22 May 2007).  
     
      
    72 The Crown has raised questions concerning the bona fides of the arrangement said to exist between Pleroma and the Accused to fund his defence in the present criminal proceedings. It is the case that attempts to explain this arrangement through the evidence of Mr Coady in March 2007 and in submissions on behalf of the Accused has occasionally been accompanied by a lack of clarity. That said, it has been contended consistently that an arrangement of some type is in place between the Accused and Pleroma to assist his funding for the trial. On the state of the evidence, and in the absence of any cross-examination of Dr Boyd and any evidence from the Accused, I am not in a position to conclude that no such arrangement exists, however unusual it may appear as a so-called “litigation funding arrangement”. 
     
      
    73 The evidence before me, on the present application, discloses that Prepaid was in the course of recovering monies in the Queensland Supreme Court proceedings which thereafter would have been utilised to assist the funding of the Accused’s defence at trial. However, those funds are not available at this time, as a result of action by officers of the Australian Taxation Office in Queensland. I am in no position to determine the validity and appropriateness of action taken by the Australian Taxation Office with respect to these funds at this time. For present purposes, I accept, as I must, the historical fact that this event has occurred. It appears that, in due course, the disputed claims between the parties will be determined in other curial proceedings. 
     
      
    74 It is the objective fact, however, that those monies are not available at this time to assist the funding of the Accused’s defence.  
     
      
    75 It may be concluded, on the evidence, that some time is required for Dr Boyd and Pleroma to consider whether further funds ought be extended to the Accused for his defence. 
     
      
    76 The difficulty for the Accused, however, is that there is no evidence from him or from Ms Clark to the effect that there is no other source of funding available to him at the present time. It is apparent that Ms Clark was able to obtain a substantial sum, in the order of $600,000.00, to assist with the defence of the Accused in mid-March 2007. The matters deposed to by the Accused in his affidavit of 8 March 2007 were overtaken by events, which saw the obtaining of a substantial sum to assist in his defence.  
     
      
    77 I do not accept that Mr Sutherland SC’s submission that there may be good reasons for the Accused declining to give evidence on the present application. After all, he swore an affidavit of 8 March 2007 concerning the same subject matter in the Queensland proceedings and gave evidence in proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 2006. 
     
      
    78 It is common (if not essential) for accused persons making Dietrich or Yuill applications to give evidence as to their financial circumstances.  
     
      
    79 As I have observed, the Accused does not make a Dietrich application. However, when I raised with Mr Sutherland SC this question early in the hearing of this application, he submitted that the Accused would assert that he is indigent in the Dietrich sense “on, at least, a temporary basis” (T10.14, 21 May 2007) and agreed that “there is a type of temporary Dietrich application and that he’s indigent for the time being” (T10.30-34, 21 May 2007).  
     
      
    80 Thereafter, the application proceeded with no evidence being adduced from the Accused on this point. The Crown opposed the application upon this basis, as well as other grounds. In the course of submissions, I raised with Mr Sutherland SC the consequence of the absence of evidence from the Accused on this aspect. He acknowledged that it was necessary for the application to be determined upon the evidence as it stands and that does not include any evidence from the Accused or Ms Clark on this point (T87, 22 May 2007). 
     
      
    81 In my view, it was open to the Accused to give evidence on the present application. I must approach my present decision upon the basis that he has made a considered decision not to give evidence on the application on a critical issue. It does not seem to me that there is any legitimate apprehension that could arise with respect to his giving evidence and exposing himself to cross-examination. In any event, the provisions of s.128 Evidence Act 1995 may have been called in aid if the Accused saw fit.  
     
      
    82 The onus lies upon the Accused to satisfy the Court that the trial ought be adjourned. The evidence does reveal the existence of an arrangement between Pleroma and the Accused with respect to litigation funding. However, the evidence does not reveal that this is the sole source of funding available to the Accused at this time to assist with his defence at the forthcoming criminal trial. The evidence indicates that the Accused and Ms Clark were able to obtain the sum of $600,000.00 in March 2007 from sources independent of Pleroma and the Prepaid Queensland litigation. There is no evidence that the Accused is unable presently to take similar steps. 
     
      
    83 On the evidence before the Court on this application, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Accused is unable to presently fund his defence so as to justify an adjournment of the trial for a period of two months.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    84 Having regard to these findings, what course of action should the Court take? It is the case that the trial which commenced on 26 March 2007 came to an abrupt end for reasons beyond the control of the Crown or the Accused. It is the case that monies from the Queensland proceedings, which may have become available to the Accused to fund his defence, are not available at the present time. It is the case, however, that the evidence does not demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, that the Accused has no means of obtaining funds at the present time for his defence at the forthcoming trial. 
     
      
    85 In all the circumstances, I do not consider it to be appropriate to refuse the adjournment application entirely and to move without delay to empanelling a jury for the purpose of the trial. I propose to grant the Accused an adjournment of the trial until Wednesday 6 June 2007. The effect of this course will be that the Accused will have three weeks from the time the trial was aborted on 16 May 2007 until the commencement of the next trial. He will have two clear weeks from today to prepare for the trial. In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that this approach accords with the justice of the case, and with the public interest in the timely disposition of charges of serious offences: R v Yuill at 453. Although I have rejected the Accused’s application based upon media publicity, this adjournment will also serve the purpose of extending the time gap between the relevant broadcasts and the empanelment of a jury.  
     
      
    86 The trial of the Accused is fixed to commence at 10.00 am on Wednesday, 6 June 2007. The Accused’s bail is continued until that time and date.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    2 HULME J:  I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of, and the orders proposed by, Hislop J. I agree with his Honour in both areas but wish to add the following. 
     
      
    3 The sentence under appeal imposed for count 1 was shorter than, but otherwise wholly concurrent with that imposed on count 2. The sentences under appeal imposed for count 4, 5, 6 and 7 were shorter than, but otherwise wholly concurrent with that imposed for count 3. Effectively, the Applicant received no punishment for offences 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7, five of the seven with which he was charged. 
     
      
    4 To the extent of 18 months – more than half the non-parole period of each- the sentences imposed for counts 2 and 3 were concurrent. 
     
      
    5 Considerations of totality of course required that the sentences, or the non-parole periods, for the 7 offences not simply be accumulated and that there be a degree of concurrency. However, a degree of concurrency which has the results I have described is completely unjustified. It sends a clear message to those members of the criminal community who chose to live by breaking and entering and stealing or the like that once they have committed a few offences, they can continue offending with virtual impunity so far as further punishment is concerned. 
     
      
    6 Furthermore, a consideration of the Applicant’s record, some details of which I set out below, show that he is a recidivist who has not been deterred by the previous sentences, again mainly concurrent, that have been imposed upon him. If proper regard is had to the considerations of general deterrence, personal deterrence, retribution - the community’s entitlement to feel that justice, including justice to the community and the Applicant’s victims, has been done - and most obviously to the protection of the community (not forgetting the limitations in that regard - see Veen v R (No2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477) – the sentence on the Applicant can only be regarded as extraordinarily lenient. Perhaps fortunately for the Applicant, the Crown has not appealed. 
     
      
    7 The Applicant’s antecedent’s report shows the following. He was born on 24 January 1974. He was first dealt with by, at least an adult’s court, in June 1991. Between then and May 2002, and putting aside appeals, he was dealt with by New South Wales courts on 23 separate occasions for 19 offences of break, enter and steal, 8 other offences of dishonesty, 13 offences involving drugs and 28 other offences some of which were minor but many of which were not. (In March 2003 he was also dealt with in Victoria for 5 offences.) 
     
      
    8 His history of breaking, entering and stealing offences and the sentences imposed are as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
         
         25/06/91 
         3 counts 
         On each charge a 12 month recognisance, concurrent with the others. 
         
         
         14/09/95 
         4 counts 
         On each charge 6 months periodic detention, later converted to full time custody. The terms again seem to have been concurrent. 
         
         
         16/08/99

    9 Although I do not find it necessary to detail it, there was also a deal of concurrency between the sentences for breaking, entering and stealing and the sentences imposed for the other offences. 
     
      
    10 On 14 May last, this Court delivered judgment in a matter of Harris v R [2007] NSWCCA 130. In light of that decision, it is to be hoped that the pattern apparent in the above table, reinforced in the sentences under appeal, is never repeated.  
     
      
    11 HISLOP J: The applicant pleaded guilty to 6 counts of break enter and steal contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 112(1) (Counts1 – 4, 6 and 7) and 1 count of receiving/ disposing of stolen property contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 188(1), (Count 5). The maximum penalty for each of the offences under s 112(1) is 14 years and, for the offence under s 188(1), 10 years. 
     
      
    12 In addition to those offences the applicant asked that the court take into account 18 items on a Form 1. Those items relate to a break enter and steal committed in July 2002, and receiving and disposing of stolen goods, making false statements and the like. 
     
      
    13 On 9 February 2006 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years, to commence on 21 June 2005 and expire on 20 June 2007, with a total term of 3 years, to expire on 20 June 2008.  
         
         
        Count 2: imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2yrs and 6 months, to commence on 21 June 2005 and to expire on 20 December 2007, with a total term of 3 years and 6 months, to expire on 20 December 2008. 
         
         
        Count 3 (including the Form 1 offences): imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, to commence on 21 June 2006 and to expire on 20 December 2008, with a total term of 4 years and 6 months to expire on 20 December 2010. 
         
         
        Counts 4, 6 and 7: imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, to commence on 21 June 2006 and to expire on 20 December 2008, with a total term of 3 years 6 months, to expire on 20 December 2009. 
         
         
        Count 5: imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months, to commence on 21 June 2006 and to expire on 20 December 2007. 
        
       
       
      The overall sentence was thus imprisonment for 5 years 6 months which included a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months. 
       
      
    14 His Honour briefly stated the circumstances of the offences in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        … the counts cover the period from 3 February 2005 to 16 May 2005. In the case of the breaking and entering, much the same method was employed by the offender on each occasion. He would walk down a suburban street, select a house, knock on the door to see whether anybody was home, and having established there was an absence of occupants he would break a window or a glass door, obtain entry by that method, then go through the house, selecting the property to be stolen, and then decamp … He tended to steal cameras, computer monitors, playstations, some jewellery. In other words portable and expensive items. In each case, within a very short time he went to some pawn shop or other, and declaring the items to be his, falsely, he then disposed of them. 
        
       
      
    15 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against sentence on the grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) His Honour erred in giving no or insufficient weight to the factor of voluntary disclosure of guilt, as per R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. 
         
         
        (2) His Honour’s determination of the appropriate sentence was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    Ground 1- His Honour erred in giving no or insufficient weight to the fact of voluntary disclosure of guilt, as per R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 
     
      
    16 In R v Ellis at 604 this Court held:  
     
      
       
        
        When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision. Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence.  
        
       
       
        
        The leniency that follows a confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well-recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned. 
        
       
      
    17 In R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at [351] this court held:  
     
      
       
        
        Furthermore, (an offender) is entitled to added leniency because of his voluntary disclosure of guilt, which would otherwise have remained undetected. 
        
       
      
     18 In Ryan v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 267 at 272 - 273 McHugh J said: 
     
      
       
        
        The statement in Ellis that “the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency” is a statement of a general principle or perhaps more accurately of a factor to be taken into account. It is not the statement of a rule to be quantitatively, rigidly or mechanically applied. It is an indication that, in determining the appropriate sentence, the disclosure of what was an unknown offence is a significant and not an insubstantial matter to be considered on the credit side of the sentencing process. How significant depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. 
        
       
      
    19 During the sentencing proceedings the applicant’s legal representative said: “There has been a plea of guilty entered at the earliest opportunity in the Magistrates Court following on a very frank and cooperative meeting with the police during which he has demonstrated contrition and has disclosed matters which the Crown accepts some of which were unknown to the police officers”. 
     
      
    20 His Honour did not refer to such disclosures in his remarks on sentence and gave no express indication he had given an Ellis discount. The applicant submitted that his Honour erred by not giving any or any sufficient weight to the voluntary disclosure of guilt. 21 The disclosures relied upon by the applicant occurred during an electronically recorded interview on 21 June 2005. At the commencement of the interview the applicant was informed he was to be asked questions about a series of break and enters which the police were investigating. Initially the applicant, in response to questions, gave police a version as to how he had come by various goods. The questioning police officer then asked a second officer to “Grab those pawn slips”, whereupon the applicant said “I can tell you what busts I’ve done and make it a lot easier for you”. He then disclosed details of the subject break enter and steal counts. 
     
      
    22 At the time of the interview each of the subject offences had been reported to the police. This included the break enter and steal at Newtown (Count 4) of which the questioning police officer was unaware at the time. Thus this was not a case where, but for the applicant’s disclosure, the offences, or any of them, would have remained undetected.  
     
      
    23 The applicant’s modus operandi was to pawn the stolen goods promptly and when pawning the goods to produce evidence of his true identity and sign the pawn slips in his own name. The police had obtained the pawn slips in the applicant’s name signed by him. Thus the evidence available to the police would have established at least offences of receiving and disposing of stolen goods which offences carried significant penalties. In the case of two of the break enter and steal offences the applicant had left his fingerprints at the site of the break in. In those circumstances establishing the applicant’s guilt in respect of those offences should not have posed any difficulty. As to the remaining offences there was a very strong possibility that, even without the applicant’s admissions his guilt would have been established. 
     
      
    24 In my opinion, the facts and circumstances of this case are such that the disclosures which the applicant made were not of such significance as to warrant an added element of leniency in quantifying the sentences.Ground 2 – His Honours determination of the appropriate sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    25 The applicant was born on 24 January 1974. He had a troubled destabilising adolescence. He was showing signs of anti-authoritarian behaviour during his schooling and felt an outcast at home. He left home at the age of 14 and thereafter lived for a while on the streets and in refuges. He is now married and has 2 very young children one of whom was born prematurely and required constant medical attention. The children are in the care of their mother. The applicant said he had been a heroin addict for a time but had not used heroin or methadone since 2000. He had used cannabis daily for many years right up until he went into custody in June 2005. He denied that the subject offences were committed for the purpose of financing his drug habit and said he got his cannabis free from a friend. He claimed his motivation to steal was the need to sustain his family. 
     
      
    26 His Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        The subject offences, though capable of being described as common or garden-type break enter and steal offences were serious and such as to have had a significant emotional impact upon the victims. The totality of the criminality involved was considerable. Each offence must be regarded as part of a series of criminal offences;  
        
       
       
        
        The value of the property taken was considerable though there was no element of vandalism or significant damage;  
        
       
       
        
        The applicant’s first recorded criminal offence occurred when he was aged 16. Thereafter he has a long and sorry history of conflict with the law, with a number of examples of dishonesty and a number of examples of breaking, entering and stealing for some of which he has in fact been in the past sentenced to terms of imprisonment, some suspended, some periodic, but ultimately, of course, full-time custody. In those circumstances there is little room for the exhibition of any particular level of leniency;  
        
       
       
        
        Two of the subject offences were committed whilst the applicant was bound by a suspended sentence and the remainder whilst he was on bail. Regard must be had to the application of the principles of deterrence both specific and general. 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour also found: 
     
      
       
        
        The applicant is being kept in strict protection because of previous terms of incarceration during one of which, at least, he reported on drug running within the prison. He is right to have fears for his safety and prison therefore impacts more harshly upon him; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. He is entitled to the maximum benefit which such a plea attracts for its utilitarian value. I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to apply 25% to the sentences which otherwise would have been imposed, but the series of offences requires, on the other hand, in my view, some partial, at least, accumulation; 
        
       
       
        
        Though there were some elements which might be taken as a point in favour of a good outcome from rehabilitation ‘one has to reach that conclusion with some dubiety’, having regard to his past history, his long involvement with cannabis, his previous involvement with heroin and, the psychologist’s assessment that the applicant has unstable personality functioning.  
        
       
      
    28 It is trite law that there is no single correct sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies - Markarian v R (2005) 215 ALR 213 at [27].29 In Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325 the High Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellant court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.  
        
       
       
      This principle applies to appeals based upon alleged excessiveness of sentence. 
       
      
    30 What must be looked at in determining if a sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust:  
     
      
       
        
        … is whether the challenged sentence is within the range appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range. -  
        Morgan 
         (1993) 78 A Crim R 368 at [371]. 
        
       
      
    31 Counsel for the applicant placed reliance upon a table of break enter and steal cases and some particular cases therein. This is legitimate in evaluating a sentence, as the Court may have regard to statistics such as those provided by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales and to similar cases in determining sentence patterns and the appropriate sentencing range - R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734 at 739. However caution must be exercised in the use of such materials as the sentence depends on the facts of each case and bare statistics tell the judge very little which is useful - and see Wong v R (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 605. 
     
      
    32 In my opinion the table of cases suggests the range of sentence is a very broad one. It does not establish the sentences imposed in the Court below were otherwise than within the legitimate range open to his Honour.  
     
      
    33 The matters referred to by the sentencing judge .in his remarks on sentence, which are briefly set out above, amply justify the sentences imposed by him. Such sentences, in my opinion, are neither unreasonable nor unjust. 
     
      
    34 This is a court of error. Its powers in respect of an appeal on sentence are prescribed by section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The Court will interfere with the sentence imposed in the Court below only if it be shown that the sentencing judge was in error and then only if it forms a positive opinion that some other, less severe, sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed- R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79].  
     
      
    35 In my opinion error has not been established nor has it been established that some other sentence, less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed. Accordingly, whilst I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    36 I propose the following orders. 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal granted. 
         
         
        2. Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I agree with Harrison J. 
     
      
    2 ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Harrison J and I generally agree with those reasons. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour.  
     
      
    3 His Honour refers to the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence and to the fact that authority reveals that cases of sexual assault upon young children are properly to be regarded as crimes of the utmost seriousness.  
     
      
    4 The relative seriousness of a criminal offence, including sexual assault, compared with other criminal offences is a matter determined by the legislature. It is an unenviable task imposed upon sentencing judges, even for those offences that are themselves repulsive, to determine where the particular offence committed fits within the range of criminality described by the offence in question. Thus, it is a sentencing judge’s task to determine whether a particular sexual assault is mid range, worst case or some other category within the range of sexual assaults covered by the particular offence charged.  
     
      
    5 This is a sometimes difficult task and requires an evaluation which, in one sense, disregards the repugnance that one would generally feel for offences of this kind. It looks, rather, at the relative criminality within the range of offences of this kind that are capable of being committed.  
     
      
    6 In making the assessment that he did, the sentencing judge discloses no error and I agree with the orders proposed by Harrison J.7 HARRISON J: The applicant was committed for sentence to the District Court of New South Wales on five charges of aggravated indecent assault under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, two charges of aggravated sexual assault and one charge of attempted aggravated sexual assault under s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    8 The victim of these offences was the applicant's stepdaughter. Tendered in the sentencing proceedings, without objection, was a statement of facts. The statement set out a brief description of the circumstances giving rise to the offences. They were as follows: - 
     
      
       
      Aggravated Indecent Assault (Seq 1) 
       
      Between 1 June 2005 and 31 July 2005, the applicant had moved his family from Queensland to Wentworth in New South Wales. An incident occurred soon after the family moved into their new home. The applicant and the child were situated next to each other on a mattress in the lounge area. The applicant removed the child's pants and began fondling her vagina with his hand. A short time later he stopped and put her pants back on. The child was 10 years old at the time. 
       
       
      Aggravated Indecent Assault (Seq 2) 
       
      On the night of 4 October 2005, the child and the applicant were lying on the mattress on the floor of the master bedroom of the family home. Other members of the family were also in the room. In the early hours of the morning, the applicant fondled the child's shoulders and breasts on the outside of her clothes for a short time before falling asleep. The child was 11 years old at the time. 
       
       
      Aggravated Indecent Assault and Aggravated Sexual Assault (Seq 3 & 4) 
       
      During the night of 5 October 2005, the child was in her bedroom. The applicant came into the room, positioned himself naked on the bed and removed the child's clothes. He lay down and made the child straddle him. The applicant began rubbing his penis against the child's vagina. The child stated that the applicant attempted to put his penis into her vagina although he did not penetrate. The child was 11 years old the time. 
       
       
      During the night of 6 October 2005, the child and the applicant were in the master bedroom with other members of the family watching television. The child was lying next to the applicant on a mattress on the floor. The child was 11 years old time. The following further offences occurred during the night of 6 October 2005. 
      
     
     
      
      Aggravated Indecent Assault (Seq 7 & 8) 
       
      Sometime late in the evening, the applicant began caressing the child's back and towards the bottom. The applicant fondled the child's bottom inside her underpants. A short time later the applicant fondled the child's vagina with his fingers. 
       
       
      Aggravated Sexual Assault (Seq 5) 
       
      The applicant then took off the child's underpants and put his head between her legs and performed cunnilingus on the child for a short time. 
       
       
      Aggravated Sexual Assault (Seq 6) 
       
      The applicant then got on top of the child and began rubbing his penis on her vagina. He then penetrated the child’s vagina with his penis for a short time. 
       
      
    9 The applicant pleaded guilty. On 25 August 2006 he was convicted and sentenced as follows: -  
     
      
     9.1 With respect to the charge, sequence number 1, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 25 August 2006 and expiring on 24 August 2007. 
      
      
      
       
      
     9.2 With respect to the charge, sequence number 2, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 9 months commencing on 25 February 2007 and expiring on 24 November 2007. 
      
       
        
       
      
     9.3 With respect to the charge, sequence number 3, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 25 August 2007 and expiring on 24 February 2009. 
      
       
        
       
      
     9.4 With respect to the charge, sequence number 4, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years commencing on 25 August 2007 and expiring on 24 August 2010. That sentence was to be served concurrently with the sentence in relation to sequence 3. 
      
       
        
       
      
     9.5 With respect to the charge, sequence number 7, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 9 months commencing on 25 August 2008 and expiring on 24 May 2009. 
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
     9.6 With respect to the charge, sequence number 8, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 25 August 2008 and expiring on 25 August 2009. That sentence was to be served concurrently with the sentence in relation to sequence number 7. 
      
      
      
     9.7 With respect to the charge, sequence number 5, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years commencing on 25 May 2009 and expiring on 24 May 2012. 
      
      
      
     9.8 With respect to the charge, sequence number 6, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years imprisonment commencing on 25 May 2010 and expiring on 24 May 2012 and a balance of term of 4 years commencing on 25 May 2012 and expiring on 24 May 2016. 
      
       
        
       
      
    10 In the result, the effective total sentence was a sentence of 9 years and 9 months commencing on 25 August 2006 and expiring on 24 May 2016. The total effective non-parole period was 5 years and 9 months commencing on 25 August 2006 and expiring on 24 May 2012. 
     
      
    11 The offence of aggravated indecent assault carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment and attracts a standard non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment. The offences of aggravated sexual assault and attempted aggravated sexual assault carry a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and attract a standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment in each case. 
     
      
    12 The applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court and appeals on the single ground that his Honour's determination of the appropriate sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    13 The applicant was born on 25 November 1972 and was accordingly 33 years of age when sentenced. He gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. He said he was of Samoan descent but was born in New Zealand. He was one of eight children and came to Australia with his family when he was 12 years of age. He attended high school in Sydney. His family later moved to Ipswich in Queensland where he completed his Higher School Certificate. After he left school he worked with his father managing a plastics factory. At the age of 25 he obtained work in the meat industry as a knife hand. He met his wife. At that time she had a little girl who was then aged three years and who is the victim of these offences. Subsequently the applicant and his wife had three children of their own. They married in June 2000. 
     
      
    14 The applicant said in evidence that his wife did not get on very well with his family and so they decided to move to Wentworth in New South Wales. There he obtained employment with Link Distribution which is a business distributing soft drinks and confectionery. When sentenced the applicant was still in that employment. 
     
      
    15 The applicant said that the offences came to light on 7 October 2005 when his wife telephoned him at work and told him that the victim had told her about the sexual abuse. He said in evidence that he immediately admitted the offences to his wife. He went home to find that his wife had packed his belongings and she wanted him to leave the house immediately. Before doing so the applicant wrote a letter that was tendered in the sentencing proceedings. In that letter the applicant said that he had sexually molested his stepdaughter and that he had made an agreement with his wife never to see her or any of his children again in his lifetime. He wrote that he was extremely sorry for his actions. 
     
      
    16 The applicant left the family home that day. He said in evidence that he felt ashamed and disgusted with himself, but at the same time that he was relieved that the abuse had been discovered. He said that whilst he was committing the offences he felt so bad he felt like committing suicide, but said he could not stop himself. The applicant gave evidence that he understood that the abuse caused a breaking down of the bond and trust between himself and his stepdaughter. He said he understood that his actions had destroyed her emotionally and mentally. 
     
      
    17 The applicant said that when he was a young boy of about seven years of age living in New Zealand with his family, he and his two younger brothers were the subjects of sexual abuse by a number of family members. Details of that abuse are set forth in a report from a psychologist which was tendered before the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    18 The applicant gave evidence that when he left the family home he moved to Mildura to live with a friend. He sought out counselling immediately which he started in October 2005. He said the saw a counsellor regularly, initially weekly but later fortnightly. He was referred to a psychologist. The applicant gave evidence that the counselling helped him to understand the nature of what he had done. He said that almost all of his wages have continued to be paid into a joint bank account with his wife for the purpose of supporting his family. He said that although he had agreed never to see the victim or his other children again, his wife had contacted him a few weeks after he moved out telling him that their three children wanted to see him. Accordingly, arrangements were made for the applicant’s wife regularly to bring their three children to Mildura to meet him. He continued to see those children but has not seen his stepdaughter since the day he moved out. He said he would not see her unless or until she made the decision that she wanted to see him. 
     
      
    19 A report from a psychologist, Mr Bruton, was tendered in evidence. In his report, Mr Bruton said that upon assessment the overall valuation of the applicant was that he may have been suffering from an adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct - DSM 309.3. He said that the applicant attended at his clinic on five occasions and that rapport was easily established with him and that he answered all questions honestly although with some hesitation and embarrassment. He said that the applicant appeared remorseful about his sexualised behaviour towards his stepdaughter, and that as time progressed he appeared cognisant of the fact that he had lost his marriage and close relationship with his children. 
     
      
    20 Mr Bruton referred to the sexualised behaviour of the applicant during his upbringing. He suggested that the applicant was offering an excuse. However, Mr Bruton had no doubt of the fact that the applicant knew that it was against the law to do what he did to his stepdaughter. Mr Bruton spoke of the applicant's ""apparent lack of emotional understanding of the effect his behaviour would have on his stepdaughter in the longer term"". He spoke of the applicant's ""apparent lack of empathy (a psychotic characteristic identified in the MMPI)"" that was ""a cause of concern"". 
     
      
    21 The sentencing judge did not share the view expressed by Mr Bruton. In his opinion, the applicant displayed considerable emotional understanding of the effect of his behaviour upon his stepdaughter and the ramifications of it in the course of giving evidence before him. The sentencing judge said he was impressed by the applicant's evidence and by what he regarded as the empathy that he had for the victim. The sentencing judge noted that Mr Bruton had said in his report that in his opinion the applicant did not display the characteristics of a serial paedophile. 
     
      
    22 The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant entered pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity. He observed that the applicant in fact admitted his guilt the moment he was first confronted with the allegations by his wife. He made full and frank admissions to the police when interviewed. The sentencing judge said that the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty was extremely high and that the applicant was entitled in those circumstances to a reduction in the sentences he would otherwise impose in the order of what he described as ""a figure at the top of the range as identified by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Thomson and Houlton"". His Honour does not appear to have quantified the reduction that he applied. 
     
      
    23 His Honour's Remarks on Sentence then went on as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""But in addition to moderation of the sentences I must impose, because of the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty, saving as they do the victim from the ordeal of giving evidence about such terrible matters, . . . I am satisfied that his expressions of remorse and contrition are genuine and in the particular circumstances of this case my view is that his genuine expressions of remorse and contrition require that considerable weight be given to those matters in moderation of the sentence. This case, in my experience, is quite exceptional. In cases of sexual assault, particularly with respect to child sexual assault offences, [the] prosecution is commonly confined, in its case, to relying upon the word of a complainant against the word of the accused. In my view, the pleas of guilty, as entered by the offender and his prior immediate admissions of guilt demonstrate a very high level of remorse and contrition. The offender could easily have denied the allegations or exercised his right to silence when interviewed by the police and said nothing and put the Crown to strict proof. In other words, he could have taken his chances at trial, but the offender determined right from the moment he was confronted with these allegations that he would not take such a course but rather would take full responsibility for his actions. The genuineness of his remorse, in my view, is further demonstrated by the fact that almost immediately after admitting to the abuse he sought out and has continued to receive counselling. This is a further exceptional feature of this case."" 
        
       
      
    24 The sentencing judge then dealt with the applicant's good character. He observed that the applicant came before him as a man without any prior convictions. Moreover, as his Honour observed, the applicant had never been before a court or in trouble with the police. His Honour observed therefore that the applicant was entitled to be sentenced as a man of prior good character. However, his Honour took into account the fact that with respect to offences of the kind before him less weight is to be given to the factor of good character. His Honour referred to R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527. His Honour observed that if an offender’s good character and high reputation have enabled him to have the opportunity to commit or to continue to commit such offences, good character might attract less weight than normal in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    25 His Honour noted correctly that the offences for which the applicant was charged attracted standard non-parole periods. He referred to R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 in which this Court considered the provisions of Div 1A Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in which it said that in order to give those provisions practical utility, a sentencing judge must ask and answer the question, are there reasons for not imposing the standard non parole period? This Court said in that case that the question will be answered by considering first the objective seriousness of the offence and the circumstances of aggravation and mitigation which are present in the instant case, all of which apply to the particular offender as listed in s 21A(2) and (3), and as incorporated by the general provisions in s 21A(1)(c) and by the concluding sentence of s 21A(1). This Court said that by this approach the standard non-parole period could properly take its place as a reference point or benchmark or sounding board or guidepost along with the other extrinsic aids such as authorities, statistics, guideline judgments and the specified maximum penalty, as they are applicable and relevant. 
     
      
    26 His Honour expressed the view that nothing other than a custodial sentence should be imposed upon the applicant in relation to each of the offences for which he was to be sentenced. No submission on his behalf was made to the contrary. His Honour's Remarks on Sentence relevantly included the following passage: - 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""As I have stated previously, these offences cannot be characterised as isolated offences demonstrating aberrant behaviour. They are part of systematic sexual abuse of a young child. But in sentencing the offender with respect to all of the offences I do not propose to impose the standard non-parole period and I propose to impose a non-parole period below the standard non-parole period, principally for the reason that these sentences to be imposed today follow upon the entry of pleas of guilty. Further, in assessing not only the non-parole period but the total sentence I must take into account what I believe to be a compelling subjective case. As I have stated earlier in these reasons, I regard this case as wholly exceptional, particularly taking into account the immediate taking of responsibility by the offender for his actions in that he admitted to the offences immediately he was confronted with the allegations. Further, he immediately left the family home, agreed never to see his children again, and immediately sought out counselling for his clearly sexual deviant behaviour. As I say, in my experience this case is quite exceptional and the subjective case cannot be described as anything other than compelling. However, at the same time, as I have already said, when referring to the principles applicable to sentencing for these offences, suitable deterrent sentences must be imposed"". 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour then described the course he proposed to take in light of the principles that guided him. He said: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""Clearly, special circumstances are demonstrated, requiring, in my view, that there be a variation between the term of the sentence and the non-parole period. What I propose to do in sentencing the offender is to impose sentences either partly accumulated upon other sentences or wholly concurrent, but to also determine, when looking at the effective total sentence and the effective non-parole period, that a variation to the statutory ratio is reflected in the total sentences. 
         
         
        In sentencing the offender I must, of course, comply with the principles as set out by the High Court in  
        Pearce 
        . I must set an appropriate sentence for each offence and then . . . consider questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality. I must, after imposing appropriate sentences for each offence, stand back and determine whether the total sentences I impose reflect the totality of criminality"". 
        
       
      
    28 After setting out details of the facts which constituted the offences with which the applicant was charged, his Honour then made the following comments: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""Those facts disclose the commission of extremely serious offences. The seriousness of such offences is clearly reflected in the maximum penalty applicable, particularly for the offence of aggravated sexual assault which attracts a maximum penalty, as I have said, of 20 years imprisonment. All the offences are aggravated by the fact that they involve a gross breach of trust in that the victim is the offender's stepdaughter. It was the offender's responsibility as the stepfather of the victim to care for and protect her. The offender betrayed the trust that was placed in him by the community, his wife, and by the victim. 
         
         
        In  
        R v BJW 
         [2000] NSWCCA 60 Sheller JA at para 20, with respect to maximum penalties imposed by the legislature for child sexual assault offences . . . said: 
         
         
          
          ""The maximum penalties the legislature has set for such offences reflect community abhorrence of and concern about adult sexual abuse of children. General deterrence is of great importance in sentencing such offenders and especially so when the offender is in a position of trust to the victim . . .” 
          
         
         
        In  
        R v Hudson 
         (Court of Criminal Appeal, 30 July 1988, unreported at page 3) Sully and Ireland JJ with whom Spigelman CJ agreed said: 
         
         
          
          ""Recognition is also given to the fact that children in a family situation are virtually helpless against sexual attack by the male parent and the children have a right to be protected from sexual molestation within the family and that this can only be achieved by the Courts imposing sentences of a salutary nature"". 
          
         
         
        At paragraph 21 of the judgment his Honour (sic) said: 
         
         
          
          ""Similarly, a child under 13 or younger is virtually helpless in the family unit when sexually abused by a stepparent. All too often the child is afraid to inform upon the stepparent (see generally  
          R v Bamford 
           Court of Criminal Appeal, 23 July 1991, unreported). The younger the victim the more serious is the criminality (see  
          R v PWH 
           Court of Criminal Appeal 20 February 1992, unreported)."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    29 It is submitted on behalf of the applicant by Ms Loukas of Counsel that the sentences imposed by his Honour are disproportionate in the circumstances. She submitted that the offences committed by the applicant were serious and placed him in a position where a significant sentence was required. However, Ms Loukas submitted that the overall sentence was beyond the appropriate range, taking into account the applicant's early plea of guilty and the exceptional nature of the case as found by his Honour. Ms Loukas attached to her written submissions a table, which she contended, contained examples of sentences indicative of an appropriate range. Although the sentences imposed upon other offenders following appellate review by this Court did not represent precedents, she submitted that they afford assistance as to what might be regarded as a permissible range. 
     
      
    30 I have had particular regard to the cases listed in the table and to the comparison between the sentences imposed for the offences described and the sentences imposed by his Honour. In my opinion, such comparisons are informative but not particularly helpful. Although a large number of cases, such as those contained in the table, provide a broad base for comparison with the present case, any insight that they produce must ultimately yield to a principled consideration of the facts of the particular case. 
     
      
    31 Finally, Ms Loukas submitted that what she described as ""the sentencing outcome"" did not sufficiently reflect the finding of exceptional features identified by the sentencing judge. She submitted that, in essence, the application for leave to appeal was based upon the proposition that a broad range of discretion, appropriate to the circumstances identified by his Honour, had been exceeded to a degree representing manifest excess.  
     
      
    32 The Crown submitted that, with the exception of two cases contained in the table, it related to offences committed before 1 February 2003. Accordingly, by far the largest number of cases contained in the table predated the commencement of the standard non-parole provisions in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and could not assist in providing a range of appropriate sentences for s 61J offences committed after 1 February 2003. 
     
      
    33 In R v AD [2005] NSWCCA 208, the applicant sought to rely on the decision of R v Slack [2004] NSWCCA 128 which involved a s 61J offence committed before 1 February 2003 to demonstrate that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. The Court distinguished the objective and subjective factors in Slack and then stated, at [43]:  
     
      
       
        
        ""… the offence in  
        Slack 
         did not attract a consideration of the standard non-parole provisions. As I have already indicated, the judge in the present matter was obliged to have regard to the standard non-parole period of 10 years even though it was not applicable to the applicant's case. In  
        R v Pellew 
         [2004] NSWCCA 433 it was made clear that the effect of the standard non-parole period will generally be to increase the level of sentencing for offences to which it applies. If the provisions prescribe a standard non-parole period of 10 years as against the maximum penalty of 20 years, as is the case with an offender under s 61J, it follows that the head sentence must exceed half the maximum penalty for the offence notwithstanding that the offence is one of only mid-range seriousness"". 
        
       
      
    34 In R v Sangalang [2005] NSWCCA 171 the applicant sought to demonstrate that a sentence imposed for an offence of aggravated indecent assault committed after 1 February 2003 was manifestly excessive by reference to Judicial Commission statistics for s 61M offences committed prior to 1 February 2003. Hunt AJA made the following observation, at [28] -[29]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Finally, the applicant has argued that, notwithstanding the judge's finding that the objective seriousness of the offence was ""just below"" the mid-range, the total sentence imposed falls within the upper end of the range of sentences for this offence as revealed by the sentencing statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission, and that the sentence was thus manifestly excessive. 
         
         
        That the sentence bore such a relationship to the statistics is hardly surprising. As this Court said in  
        Regina v Way 
         (at [134], [142]), the effect of Division 1A of Part 4 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         is that the pattern of sentencing will move upwards for some offences above the range demonstrated by the previous sentencing statistics. The standard non-parole period for this offence, as I have said, is set at almost 71.5 per cent of the maximum sentence, which is far above the medium range of sentences imposed before Division 1A came into effect. The nominated standard non-parole period for this offence of aggravated indecent assault was the clearest indication of an intention by the legislature in Division 1A that such an increase was to be the case for this offence:  
        Regina v Pellew 
         [2004] NSWCCA 434 at [37], [52]. And, as the standard non-parole period is a reference point for all offences of aggravated indecent assault to which such a non-parole period does not directly apply, it was the intention of the legislature that the sentences for all those offences were also to increase. The statistics of sentences imposed for offences which were committed before Division 1A of Part 4 of the Act came into operation (1 February 2003) are, therefore, of very limited use indeed:  
        Regina v Porteous 
         [2005] NSWCCA 115 at [49]"".  
        
       
      
    35 The Crown submits that these observations are pertinent to offences of aggravated sexual assault committed after 1 February 2003. The Crown submits that the cases in the table relied upon by the applicant are of little or no assistance for this reason alone, as well as the more general limitations to which this Court has referred in relation to reliance on comparable cases. 
     
      
    36 R v Hopkins [2004] NSWCCA 105 and R v AD [2005] NSWCCA 208 are the two cases contained in the table which did involve offences that were committed after 1 February 2003. The first was a Crown appeal against a sentence imposed for a single offence of aggravated sexual assault in which the circumstance of aggravation was that the offender maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on the victim, his former girlfriend. This Court found that the degree of divergence from the statutory non-parole period and the sentence imposed was appropriate as the culpability of the offender was considerably attenuated because of his mental illness. In the second, the offender was a juvenile (15 years at the time of the offence) and the circumstance of aggravation was that he was in the company of another person. 
     
      
    37 The Crown points out that there have been four further matters under s 61J dealt with in this Court. They are R v Reyes [2005] NSWCCA 218; R v Doolan [2006] NSWCCA 29; R v Doherty [2006] NSWCCA 133 and R v TV [2006] NSWCCA 174. The circumstances of aggravation in each of these matters involve either the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm on the victims or a threat with an offensive implement. The Crown contends that the facts in these cases bear no resemblance to the applicant's case and are accordingly of no assistance either as comparable cases or in establishing a range of sentences. 
     
      
    38 The Crown also emphasises that this Court has on many occasions stressed the need to protect children from sexual abuse by adults and that this is especially so when the perpetrator is the victim's parent. In R v Dent (Court of Criminal Appeal, 14 March 1991, unreported) Lee J at [6], with whom Gleeson CJ and Loveday J agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        ""One begins with the proposition 
          
        . . 
          
        . that our community views with great concern the sexual molestation of children by adults and that has been acknowledged by the legislature in providing for greater penalties when the victim is under sixteen 
          
        . . 
          
        . That acknowledgement has been in our legislation over a long period of time. Little children are entitled to grow up free from defilement by sexual predators and free from risk of psychological upset, confusion and difficulties in later life, caused by such conduct. 
         
         
        When a child is living in a family situation, he or she is particularly vulnerable to sexual molestation from the male parent, or stepparent. The community regards the family unit as one in which each parent is in a position of trust in respect of the child, under a duty to rear it and give it proper guidance and to refrain from using the child for sexual pleasure. The child is usually helpless to protect itself against sexual attack from the parent - as in this case - and that can be seen in so many other cases of a like kind that come before us. One sees in such cases that the child is too embarrassed, too afraid or develops too great a sense of guilt to complain. When the male parent takes advantage of the helplessness of the child, he not only commits a breach of trust, but it is a cowardly breach of trust. The protector of the child's body, the guide and mentor of the child, in those circumstances has abandoned his proper role in order to gratify his lust on the child"".  
        
       
      
    39 It is well established that the age of the victim is important in determining the criminality of the offending behaviour. Generally speaking, the younger the victim the more serious the criminality due to the helplessness of a young child in a family unit: R v BJW (2000) 112 A Crim R 1 at [21], a case involving a 13 year old child. 
     
      
    40 The Crown submits further that this is a case where no relevant sentencing principle was ignored or misapplied. No submission was made on behalf of the applicant to the contrary. The Crown submits that the sentences imposed were entirely warranted in law on the undisputed facts and that his Honour correctly applied Pearce v The Queen in setting the individual sentences and in applying the principle of totality by partially accumulating most of the sentences, and in the case of two offences (sequence 4 and 8) by making those sentences entirely concurrent with other sentences. The Crown points out that the aggregate sentence of 9 years and 9 months imposed for eight offences was less than the applicable standard non-parole period in respect of each of the three s 61J offences, and the effective non-parole period was half that standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    41 In summary, the Crown submits that the applicant has not demonstrated that the individual sentences are, or the total aggregate sentence is, manifestly excessive. It is submitted that a no less severe sentence is warranted in law: s 6 (3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    Decision42 In R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79], Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        "" [79] Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: ""If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process"". That is not the statutory formulation. By s 6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that ""some other sentence ... is warranted in law and should have been passed"". Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential precondition for the exercise of the power to ""quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor"" is not satisfied. As the judgments in  
        Dinsdale 
         to which I have referred indicate, the exercise of the power in s 6(3) further requires the identification of error in a requisite sense."" 
        
       
      
    43 In the same case, Sully J had this to say at [99] and [100]: 
     
      
       
        
        "" [99] Whenever an applicant for leave to appeal against sentence submits that there is cause to show why this Court should intervene and reduce the primary sentence, it is, as I think, obvious that the first thing to be established by the applicant is that the primary sentencing discretion has miscarried, by reason of some error of fact or of law; or because of the cumulative effect of errors of both fact and law. The errors, whether of fact or of law, may be either latent or patent; but whether latent or patent, some error must be demonstrated before this Court becomes entitled at all to consider interfering with the sentence passed at first instance 
        : R v Vachalec 
         [1981] 1 NSWLR 351 at 353 F;  
        R v Visconti 
         [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 108 G. 
         
         
        [100] Error once demonstrated, it does not follow automatically that this Court will, without more, intervene in fact and resentence. Before that can happen properly in law, the conditions specified in s 6(3) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912 must be satisfied: that is to say, this Court must be persuaded, not only that error has been shown in the process of reasoning of the primary sentencing Court, but that some other sentence is ""warranted in law"". I agree with the observations made in this connection by Lee A-J In  
        R v Astill (No 2) 
         (1992) 64 A Crim R 289 at 303, 304."" 
        
       
      
    44 The burden of the applicant's submission would appear to be that the sentencing judge's discretion miscarried because, or to the extent that, he failed to give sufficient weight, or to have proper regard, to what he described on a number of occasions as the exceptional features of this case. His Honour's Remarks on Sentence employ that adjective on at least three relevant occasions. In particular, the applicant relies upon his Honour's use of the expression in the sentence quoted above, part of which includes the words ""in my experience this case is quite exceptional and the subjective case cannot be described as anything other than compelling"". 
     
      
    45 In my opinion, this misconceives the course adopted by his Honour. As his Honour's Remarks on Sentence indicate, and as authority reveals, cases of sexual assault upon young children, such as the present, are properly to be regarded as crimes of the utmost seriousness. Nothing pointed to by the applicant in this case suggests that the offences with which he was charged should be treated in any other way. In arriving at the sentences which he imposed, the sentencing judge clearly, and in my opinion correctly, balanced the seriousness of the offences on the one hand with the exceptional factors favourable to the applicant on the other hand. The structure of his Honour’s careful and detailed remarks makes this clear. There is, in my opinion, no good basis upon which to suggest that the primary sentencing discretion miscarried 
     
      
    46 It follows in my opinion that it cannot be said that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    CONCLUSION 
     
      
    47 In my opinion, leave to appeal against sentence should be granted and the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: In this matter his Honour Judge Solomon of the District Court referred certain questions of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination, pursuant to s 5A of the Criminal Appeal Act. His Honour, in submitting the questions of law for determination by this Court, signed a document in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Factual background 
         
         
        On 8 November 2006 the respondent was arraigned before me and a jury of twelve in the District Court at Grafton and pleaded not guilty to 2 counts of produce child pornography and 13 counts alleging various sexual offences upon a child victim. 
         
         
        Counts 9 and 10 on the indictment alleged that, between 4 February 2002 and 22 May 2003, the respondent had sexual intercourse with the victim, a person above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years, namely 11 years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely the victim was under the authority of the respondent. 
         
         
        Counts 11 and 12 on the indictment alleged that, between 26 January 2003 and 25 December 2003, the respondent had sexual intercourse with the victim, a person above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years, namely 12 years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that the victim was under the authority of the respondent. 
         
         
        On 16 November 2006, the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of 14 of the 15 counts on the indictment, including counts 9-12. 
         
         
        Section 66C of the Crimes Act 1900 [sexual intercourse — child between 10 and 16] was inserted in the Act in 1985. 
         
         
        Since 13 June 2003 s 66C (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 provides: 
         
         
        Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years in circumstances of aggravation is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 
         
         
        Prior to 13 June 2003 s 66C (2) provided: 
         
         
        Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who —  
         
         
        (a) is of or above the age of 10 years, and under the age of 16 years; and 
         
        (b) is (whether generally or at the time of the sexual intercourse only) under the authority of the person, 
         
        shall be liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 
         
         
        The prosecution was listed before me for sentence on 2 March 2007, at which time I indicated that I was not prepared to sentence the respondent in respect of the guilty verdicts entered for counts 9-12 on the indictment because they did not disclose offences known to law. I have deferred sentencing the respondent pending determination of the within referral. 
         
         
        Questions referred for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 5A of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912 
         
         
        1. Do counts 9-12 on the indictment disclose offences known to law? 
         
        2. Does the present form of the indictment preclude me from proceeding to sentence the respondent in respect of counts 9-12? 
         
        3. If the answer to question 2 is “yes”, am I empowered to amend the indictment in respect of counts 9-12 post verdict? 
         
         
        R Solomon 
         
        Judge 
         
        Date: 23-3-07” 
        
       
      
    2 The provisions of s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act, both before and after 13 June 2003, are set out in the document signed by Judge Solomon. However, it is necessary to refer to other parts of s 66C, as in force since 13 June 2003. Under sub-section (5) of s 66C the expression “circumstances of aggravation” includes a fairly large number of circumstances, including that “(d) the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender”. Under s 66C(4) a person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years in circumstances of aggravation is liable to imprisonment for 12 years.  
     
      
    3 After the jury returned verdicts of guilty on 16 November 2006, the proceedings were adjourned to 2 February 2007. 
     
      
    4 On 2 February 2007 the Crown’s representative drew the Court’s attention to what was described as an “error” in counts 9-12 in the indictment. In each of counts 9 and 10 the offence alleged had been described as having sexual intercourse with a person “above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years, namely 11 years”, whereas, it was said, the offence should have been described as having sexual intercourse with a person “above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, namely 11 years”. In each of counts 11 and 12 the offence alleged had been described as having sexual intercourse with a person “above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years, namely 12 years”, whereas the period within which it was alleged that the offence had been committed included:-  
     
      
       
        
        (1) a period up to 13 June 2003, during which s 66C(2) made it an offence, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years, to have sexual intercourse with a person of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, where the victim was under the authority of the offender, and  
         
         
        (2) a period on and from 13 June 2003, during which s 66C(2) made it an offence, carrying a different maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, to have sexual intercourse with a person of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years, where the victim was under the authority of the offender.  
        
       
      
    5 On 2 February 2007 the Crown’s representative sought Judge Solomon’s leave to amend counts 9 to 12 in the indictment. This would appear to have been an application under s 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which provides that an indictment may not be amended after it is presented, except by the prosecutor (a) with the leave of the Court or (b) with the consent of the accused.  
     
      
    6 In support of the application the Crown’s representative referred to the decision of the English Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Dossi (1918) 13 Cr App Rep 158. In Dossi Atkin J, who gave the leading judgment, referred to s 5(1) of the English Indictments Act 1915, which permitted an indictment to be amended “before a trial or at any stage of the trial”.  
     
      
    7 This expression is also used in sub-s (4) of s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  Sub-section (1) of s 21 provides that the Court, if of the opinion that an indictment is defective but that, having regard to the merits of the case, it can be amended without injustice, may make such order for the amendment of the indictment as it thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case. Sub-section (4) of s 21 provides that an order under the section may be made “either before trial or at any stage during the trial”.  
     
      
    8 On 2 February 2007 Judge Solomon enquired of the parties whether there was any Australian authority on the meaning of the word “trial” in sub-s(4) of s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Neither party was able to cite any Australian authority. Consequently, his Honour stood over the proceedings to 2 March 2007 to enable the parties to conduct further research and to lodge written submissions.  
     
      
    9 On 2 March 2007, no Australian authority on the meaning of “trial” in s 21(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act having been cited to Judge Solomon, his Honour delivered a judgment on the Crown’s application that the indictment should be amended.  
     
      
    10 In his judgment Judge Solomon found that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, the indictment could be amended, without causing any injustice. His Honour noted the Crown’s submission that the words “during the trial” in s 21(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act should be interpreted as extending to the period after the jury has returned its verdict or verdicts and before the final disposition of the matter by way of sentencing the offender. However, his Honour considered that Dossi did not support the Crown’s submission and noted that the Crown had been unable to find any other authority. His Honour had been referred by counsel for the offender to s 572(3) of the Queensland Criminal Code, which provides that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If the Court is satisfied no injustice will be done by amending the indictment, the Court may make the order (amending the indictment) at any time before or at any stage of the trial on the indictment  
        or after verdict 
        ” (emphasis supplied). 
        
       
      
    11 Judge Solomon concluded that the “trial” of the respondent had concluded, as soon as the jury returned their verdicts and that he had no power to amend the indictment under s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act. His Honour thereupon declined to sentence the respondent on counts 9-12 in the indictment and, having been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions would be giving the matter further consideration, declined to sentence the respondent on any of the counts in the indictment, until the position was clarified.  
     
      
    12 Section 5A of the Criminal Appeal Act provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The judge before whom any person is tried and convicted on indictment may submit any question of law arising at or in reference to such trial or conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination and such submission shall be dealt with as if it were an appeal under section 5”. 
        
       
      
    13 A submission was made by counsel for the respondent that this Court lacked jurisdiction under s 5A, for the reason that there was no evidence that the respondent had been “convicted”.  
     
      
    14 Whether a person has been “convicted” depends on the context in which the question is asked (Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 507 per Dawson J, McHugh J). In Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293, a case in which there was a plea of guilty, Barwick CJ at 301-2 and Aickin J at 334 stated in obiter dicta that, at least generally, a return of a verdict of guilty by a jury itself amounts to a conviction of the offender. There is no need for the trial judge, after the jury has returned its verdict, to make any announcement that he is convicting the offender of the offence (see Griffiths per Jacobs J at 312 and per Aickin J at 335-336). In some special contexts, such as where a defence of autrefois acquit is raised in subsequent proceedings, a verdict of guilty will not of itself amount to a “conviction”. However, the present case is not within any of those special contexts.  
     
      
    15 In my opinion, the dicta of Barwick CJ and Aickin J in Griffiths should be followed and the Court should hold that in the present proceedings the respondent was “convicted” when the jury returned their verdicts of guilty and hence this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the Crown’s appeal. 
     
      
       
      Questions 1 and 2  
       
       
      1. Do counts 9-12 on the indictment disclose offences known to law? 
       
      2. Does the present form of the indictment preclude me from proceeding to sentence the respondent in respect of counts 9-12? 
       
      
    16 It is convenient to deal with these questions together. If counts 9-12 in their present form disclose offences known to law, then the present form of the counts in the indictment would not preclude Judge Solomon from proceeding to sentence the respondent on those counts.  
     
      
    17 It was submitted by the Crown on this appeal that counts 9–12, as framed, disclose offences known to the law and do not require any amendment. 
     
      
    18 In support of this general submission, it was submitted that it is not necessary that a count in an indictment charging an offence under a particular statutory provision should use the specific words of that statutory provision; that what is essential is that a count in an indictment alleges the essential factual ingredients of the offence charged; that, for the purposes of all of counts 9-12 in the present indictment, the elements of the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse charged were that the respondent had had sexual intercourse with the victim, that at the time of the sexual intercourse the victim was of an age which would fall within the range of ages stated in s 66C, as then in force, and that at the time of the sexual intercourse the victim was under the authority of the respondent; that in each of counts 9-12 the essential factual ingredients of the offence had been alleged, including the age of the victim at the time of the sexual intercourse alleged being an age which was within the range of ages stated in the section as then in force; and that, the age of the victim having been stated, it had not been essential to set out in each count that the complainant was above a certain age and below a certain other age.  
     
      
    19 It was further submitted by the Crown that any objection to the form of the indictment should have been taken at an earlier stage of the proceedings, in accordance with s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and that any defect in the counts had been cured by the verdicts of guilty, because the jury must have been satisfied on each of counts 9-12 that all the elements of the offence charged had been proved. In support of this last submission the Crown referred to Heymann v The Queen (1873) 8 LRQB 102, R v Aspinall and Ors (1876) 2 QBD 48, R v Stroulger (1886) 17 QBD 327, Taylor v The Queen (1895) 1 QB 25. 
     
      
    20 It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that each of counts 9-12 was defective because, contrary to the submission made by the Crown, each count had failed to specify the essential factual ingredients of any offence; that the defects were not cured by s 16 of the Criminal Procedure Act; that the necessity of strict compliance with conditions for the validity of an indictment had been emphasised by the Court of Criminal Appeal in such cases as R v Janceski (2005) 64 NSWLR 10; and that the 19th century English cases relied on by the Crown were not applicable and had not survived the introduction of a statutory power to amend indictments. With regards to counts 11 and 12, it was submitted that the existence of a different maximum penalty before and after 13 June 2003 demonstrated that counts 11 and 12 were defective. It was submitted that it was merely fortuitous that in the present case the circumstance of aggravation pleaded had been a circumstance of aggravation, both before and after the amendments taking effect on 13 June 2003. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    21 Section 11 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides, in part, that the description of an offence in the words of an act of Parliament creating the offence is sufficient. However, it is not essential to the validity of a count in an indictment charging an offence created by a statutory provision that the count should use the specific words of the statutory provision. 
     
      
    22 As was submitted by both parties, what is essential to the validity of a count in an indictment is that the count should allege the essential factual ingredients of the offence. John L Proprietary Ltd v Attorney General for the State of New South Wales (1987) 163 CLR 508 at 519-521, R v Mai (1991) 26 NSWLR 371 at 377-378 per Hunt CJ at CL and the cases there cited.  
     
      
    23 In my opinion, each of counts 9-12 satisfied this condition by stating the essential factual ingredients of the offence charged, namely that the respondent had had sexual intercourse with the victim, the age of the victim at the time of the sexual intercourse and that at the time of the intercourse the victim was under the authority of the respondent.  
     
      
    24 It was not essential to state the range of ages of victims to which s 66C is capable of applying. Provided that the age of the victim at the time of the alleged offence was stated, as it was, the part of each count stating that the victim was above a certain age and under a certain other age could have been omitted, without affecting the validity of the count. In the case of counts 9 and 10 an allegation that the victim was above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years necessarily amounted to an allegation that the victim was above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years.  
     
      
    25 I am further of the opinion that, as was submitted by the Crown, any defect in the counts would have been cured by the verdicts of guilty, because the jury must have been satisfied on each of counts 9-12 that all the elements of the offence charged had been proved. There was no issue at the trial about the age of the victim or that her age had been correctly alleged in the counts in the indictment. 
     
      
    26 It is true that the 19th century English cases which were relied on by the Crown as establishing this principle do no appear to have been referred to in recent years. However, it is likely that this is because an occasion for applying them has seldom arisen, since the introduction of a statutory power to amend an indictment and of statutory provisions that defects of certain kinds will not invalidate an indictment. I would not regard these statutory provisions as having effected an implied overruling of the cases relied on by the Crown. 
     
      
    27 With regard to counts 11 and 12, it is true that the extended period alleged in each count straddles two periods in which there were different maximum penalties. However, in such a case, if the Crown is unable to establish that the offence was committed during the period in which the higher maximum penalty applied, the offender must be sentenced on the basis of the lower maximum penalty. Difficulties could arise in a case where the Crown charges an aggravated offence, if the circumstance relied on by the Crown was a circumstance of aggravation in one period but not in the other, but such a difficulty does not arise, and need not be addressed, in the present case.  
     
      
    28 In my opinion, question 1 should be answered “yes” and question 2 should be answered “no”.  
     
      
       
      Question 3 
       
       
      3. If the answer to question 2 is “yes”, am I empowered to amend the indictment in respect of counts 9-12 post verdict? 
       
      
    29 Question 3 does not arise, because, in my opinion, question 2 should be answered “no” and I do not propose to determine what answer should have been given to question 3, had it arisen. However, as it was the question Judge Solomon addressed in his judgment of 2 March 2007, I will make some comments.  
     
      
    30 Earlier in this judgment I referred to the provisions of s 21(1) and s 21(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act. Under s 21(4) an order under s 21 may be made “before trial or at any stage during the trial”. There was, as noted earlier, a similar provision in the English Indictments Act 1915.  
     
      
    31 In Dossi, the English case cited before Judge Solomon and again before this Court, the accused had been charged with indecently assaulting a child “on March 19th 1918”. When returning their verdict, the jury said that they found the accused “with regard to the date March 19th not guilty. If the indictment covers other dates, guilty”. On the application of the prosecution the presiding judicial officer amended the indictment by substituting the words “on some day in March” for the words “on March 19th 1918” and the jury then found the accused guilty on the amended indictment.  
     
      
    32 Atkin J, who delivered the judgment of the English Court of Criminal Appeal, disposed of the appeal on the ground that the date specified in the indictment as being the date on which the offence was committed was not a material matter and that “the jury were entitled, if there was evidence on which they could come to that conclusion, to find the appellant guilty of the offence charged against him, even though they found that it had not been committed on the actual date specified in the indictment”. Atkin J continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is, therefore unnecessary to consider whether there was power to amend the indictment, but we must not be taken to express any doubt that the wide words in section 5(1) of the Indictments Act, 1915, which give the court power to amend an indictment “at any stage of a trial” might, in a proper case, permit of an amendment in circumstances similar to those which exist here”.  
        
       
      
    33 This comment by Atkin J on behalf of the English Court of Criminal Appeal would give some support to the Crown’s contention about the proper interpretation of s 21(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act. However, the comment was clearly obiter dicta and limited in its application to circumstances similar to those in Dossi. 
     
      
    34 The further researches of counsel turned up the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Burns (1920) 20 SR (NSW) 351.  
     
      
    35 In Burns, the accused had been charged with making a false pretence to one person N but the evidence given at the trial was to the effect that any false pretence had been made to two other persons A and W. Section 365 of the Crimes Act, as then in force, conferred the power to amend an indictment “on any trial”.  
     
      
    36 All members of the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the Court of Criminal Appeal had no power to amend an indictment.  
     
      
    37 Gordon J, with whom Pring J agreed, said at 358:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court of Quarter Sessions might have before verdict amended the indictment so as to cover the case made by the evidence but no such amendment had been made or asked for”. 
        
       
      
    38 The Chief Justice said at 354:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If this discrepancy had been noticed at the trial the indictment might have been amended before the verdict. But it is not, and cannot be disputed, that an amendment under the provisions of the Crimes Act would be too late after conviction”. 
        
       
      
    39 It would seem that the dicta of the members of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Burns would be an obstacle in the way of holding that an order under s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act can be made after the jury has returned its verdict but I reiterate that I do not propose to determine question 3. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion, the questions asked should be answered:- 
     
      
       
      1. Yes 
       
      2. No 
       
      3. Does not arise 
       
      
    41 ROTHMAN J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of James J. I agree generally with the reasons of his Honour and I agree with the orders he proposes.  
     
      
    42 The agreement with the reasons of his Honour is subject to the following additional comments which do not detract and are not intended to detract from his Honour’s reasons. I do not repeat the factual background summarised by James J nor the questions posed by his Honour Judge Solomon.  
     
      
    43 The rules of natural justice require, at least in proceedings seeking to impose a penalty, civil or criminal, notice of the case to be met and a fair opportunity to present a case in reply to it. As a general proposition the foregoing is trite.  
     
      
    44 In the case of criminal proceedings there are at least two requirements that necessarily flow from the requirements of natural justice in order for an indictment to be valid. James J has referred to John L Pty Limited v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 163 CLR 508. However, John L deals particularly with a complaint that the indictment did not identify the necessary elements and material particulars of the offence alleged.  
     
      
    45 In order for an indictment to be valid it must not only disclose the particular act alleged it must disclose an offence known to the law and the legal nature of the offence.  
     
      
       
        
        “… A defendant is entitled to be apprised not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he is charged but also of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge. ( 
        Johnson v Miller  
        (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 489, per Dixon J) 
        
       
      
    46 The history of technical objections taken against indictments gave rise to the provisions now contained within section 11 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). That history was briefly summarised by Jordan CJ in Ex parte Ryan; re Johnson (1943) 44 SR(NSW) 12. The passage is cited with approval by Brennan J in John L in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “As Jordan CJ explained in  
        Ex parte Ryan; Re Johnson 
        :  
         
          
          ‘The person accused is entitled to sufficient particulars of the matter charged against him to enable him to meet the charge. Hence, in earlier times, it was repeatedly held that to follow the words of the statute in alleging the offence in the information was not necessarily sufficient. `Where a particular act constitutes the offence, it may be enough to describe it in the words of the Legislature; but where the Legislature speaks in general terms, the conviction must state what act in particular was done by the party offending to enable him to meet the charge':  
          R v James 
          . In many cases it was open to doubt whether it was necessary to add particulars to the language of the statute in framing the information:  
          Fletcher v Calthrop 
          , and this led to its being expressly enacted that `the description of any offence in the words of the Act, or any order, by-law, regulation, or other document creating the offence, or any similar words, shall be sufficient in law' (Justices Act 1902, s 145A(1), taken from Summary Jurisdiction Act 1879 (42 and 43 Vict. c 49), s 39(1)).’"" (Citations omitted) 
          
         
        
       
      
    47 Prior to the existence of such provisions objection was taken to criminal charges proffered in the words of an Act of Parliament creating the offence because of the generality of the words and because it did not particularise the conduct in question. Provisions such as section 11 of the Criminal Procedure Act were not intended and do not require the repetition of the words of an Act of Parliament in order for the indictment to be effective. They overcome an argument that to repeat the words renders the indictment invalid.  
     
      
    48 Any words which disclose the nature of the offence charged (assuming it is an offence known to the law) is sufficient to satisfy that aspect of the requirements for a valid indictment. Further, whatever words are used they must be words which allow the defendant to know the nature of the offence charged and the case that the defendant must meet.  
     
      
    49 Ignoring for present purposes the impact of the amendment to section 66C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), there can be no doubt that the indictment discloses an offence known to the law; it discloses the nature of the offence; and, although not relevantly an issue, it discloses the material facts necessary in order for the accused to have met the case presented against him. In those circumstances, subject to the issue that I next deal with relating to the amendment to section 66C of the Crimes Act, the indictment is valid.  
     
      
    50 The amendment to section 66C has an impact on the above. The amendment and its effect is set out in the judgment of James J and I do not repeat it. The first and somewhat ironic impact is that a repetition of the words of the statute in the indictment would have, if it used the words of the statute as they existed prior to 13 June 2003, misled the defendant as to the elements of the offence charged against him, at least in relation to the offence if it had occurred after 13 June 2003. The use of the age of 14 years in the indictment may point to a deliberate attempt to specify, with particularity, the elements of the offence sought to be charged against the defendant so that it would meet the elements of both the pre and post 13 June 2003 offences.  
     
      
    51 There is little doubt that the indictment as charged discloses the elements of an offence under section 66C(2) as it existed prior to 13 June 2003 and also as it existed after 13 June 2003. If, on the other hand, the indictment had charged in terms of an age range between 10 years and 16 years it would have complied with the elements of the offence as it existed prior to 13 June 2003 but would have been insufficiently detailed to provide the elements of an offence if it occurred after 13 June 2003. In those circumstances the wording of the offence, assuming that the amendment to the Act did not, of itself, invalidate the indictment, would be the only way in which an offence of this kind could be charged, and appropriate material particulars provided, such that the defendant would know the charge he had to meet.  
     
      
    52 The amendment to the provisions of section 66C that occurred on 13 June 2003 has another effect. Given that the indictment charged, relevantly, that the sexual assault occurred between 26 January 2003 and 25 December 2003, the indictment does not disclose whether the offence charged is section 66C of the Crimes Act as it existed since 13 June 2003 or before that date.  
     
      
    53 It is not uncommon in cases of sexual assault, particularly on young children, and particularly in cases where the assault occurred some years earlier, for the criminal offence to be particularised in a way that alleges the offence occurred at a time or on a date within a period specified in the indictment. Such a particular makes it more difficult for a defendant to meet the case presented, but does not necessarily invalidate the indictment.  
     
      
    54 An amendment to the offence, of the kind here effected, will occasion a problem not only in circumstances where the offence is alleged over a range of dates. For example, a sexual assault that occurs over night, say between 11pm and 1am the next morning may involve a time period encompassing an amendment to the Act.  
     
      
    55 Ultimately whether it is permissible to charge an offence of this kind in these circumstances must be answered on the basis of two fundamental concerns. The first of them is that the defendant is entitled to be treated fairly and to have a fair hearing. In other words, the defendant must know precisely the facts that are sought to be proven against him and how, if at all, those facts may be met. In the present proceedings, this is easily done. The elements of each offence, as particularised in the indictment, are identical. The only distinction is the sentence that is capable of being imposed. Where the finding of guilt does not allow a discrimination as to which of the two offences apply, the lesser sentence is applicable.  
     
      
    56 Nothing in the foregoing should be taken to suggest that it is possible, in other circumstances, to frame an indictment in a manner that allows two different offences to be proven. Any duplicity in an indictment would invalidate the indictment and require an election or variation by the Crown. But here, only one offence can operate at any one time.  
     
      
    57 It is essentially an issue of fairness and the proper construction of the Act.  
     
      
    58 A similar issue was dealt with by the High Court in Saraswati v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 1 and, in particular, the High Court adumbrated the principles to be applied in the construction of an Act: see also Project Blue Sky v ABA (1998) 194 CLR 355. His Honour Justice McHugh said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 33 of the  
        Interpretation Act 
         directs a court in interpreting a provision in an Act to give preference to a construction ‘that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act’ over a construction ‘that would not promote that purpose or object’: cf  
        Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd 
        .  
        Moreover, the terms of s. 34 of that Act, which provides for the use of extrinsic material, make it plain that ‘the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision’ is the meaning conveyed by that provision after ‘taking into account its context in the Act or statutory rule and the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule’. Hence, it is always necessary in determining ‘the ordinary meaning’ of a provision such as s. 61E(2) to have regard to the purpose of the legislation and the context of the provision as well as the literal meaning of the provision. Sometimes the purpose of the legislation is expressly stated; sometimes it can be discerned only by inference after an examination of the legislation as a whole; and sometimes it can be discerned only by reference to the history of the legislation and the state of the law when it was enacted. It need hardly be said that a particular Act may have many purposes.  
         
        In many cases, the grammatical or literal meaning of a statutory provision will give effect to the purpose of the legislation. Consequently, it will constitute the ‘ordinary meaning’ to be applied. If, however, the literal or grammatical meaning of a provision does not give effect to that purpose, that meaning cannot be regarded as ‘the ordinary meaning’ and cannot prevail. It must give way to the construction which will promote the underlying purpose or object of an Act:  
        Interpretation Act 
        , s. 33. In  
        Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty. Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation 
        , Mason and Wilson JJ. said:  
         
          
          ‘when the judge labels the operation of the statute as “absurd”, “extraordinary”, “capricious”, “irrational” or “obscure” he assigns a ground for concluding that the legislature could not have intended such an operation and that an alternative interpretation must be preferred. But the propriety of departing from the literal interpretation is not confined to situations described by these labels. It extends to any situation in which for good reason the operation of the statute on a literal reading does not conform to the legislative intent as ascertained from the provisions of the statute, including the policy which may be discerned from those provisions.’  
          
         
        Moreover, once a court concludes that the literal or grammatical meaning of a provision does not conform to the legislative purpose as ascertained from the statute as a whole including the policy which may be discerned from its provisions, it is entitled to give effect to that purpose by addition to, omission from, or clarification of, the particular provision.” ( 
        Saraswati 
         at 21-22 per McHugh J, with whom Toohey J agreed). (Citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    59 It seems unnecessary to decide finally whether section 66C as it applied after 13 June 2003 created one offence with aspects of aggravation or two offences each with an aggravating feature, or four separate offences. My preliminary view is that there are four separate offences created by each of the first four subsections of section 66C of the Crimes Act: cf Kingswell v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 264. The proper construction of section 66C would seem to require a jury to determine whether the child was between 10 and 14 years of age or between 14 and 16 years of age and whether the circumstances of aggravation arise. As earlier stated, it is unnecessary to determine this issue finally.  
     
      
    60 It is sufficient, for my purposes, to determine that the clear purpose, derived from the terms of the Act itself, is that there not be a hiatus between the commission of an offence under 66C prior to 13 June 2003 and after that date. It would be an absurd result if the amendment of the legislature to increase the sentences applicable to an offence and to divide an offence into four sub-categories was construed in a way which prevented prosecution because it was impossible to determine whether the offence occurred at 11.59pm or 12.01am.  
     
      
    61 Different issues may arise if the elements of the offence sought to be proven were different. Here no such difficulty arises. There is no unfairness in giving effect to the clear purpose of the legislature that a person charged (and convicted) of sexual intercourse with a person of 14 years of age during a period that spanned 13 June 2003, in circumstances of aggravation, may be convicted of an offence under section 66C of the Crimes Act, the penalty for which must, in the present circumstances, be the lower of the offence available before and after 13 June 2003.  
     
      
    62 I agree with James J that the questions asked should be answered in the manner that he proposes.  
     
      
    63 HARRISON J: I agree with James J.

     Judgment 
    1 JAMES J: I agree with Harrison J. 
     
      
    2 ROTHMAN J: I agree with Harrison J. 
     
      
    3 HARRISON J: On 22 June 2005 the applicant entered a plea of guilty in the District Court of New South Wales to a charge of robbery in company on 26 September 2003 at Newtown. This is an offence under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence of robbery in company carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 On 25 November 2005 the applicant entered pleas of guilty in the District Court of New South Wales to charges of affray, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, assaulting a police officer in the execution of her duty and thereby occasioning actual bodily harm, and resisting police officers in the execution of their duty. The maximum penalties in the Crimes Act 1900 for these offences are, respectively, imprisonment for 5 years under s 93C(1), 5 years under s 59(1), 7 years under s 60(2), and 5 years under s 58 for each offence. The offence of assaulting and occasioning actual bodily harm to a police officer attracts a standard non-parole period of 3 years. 
     
      
    5 At the sentencing hearing before Hulme DCJ on 19 May 2006, on the charge of robbery in company, the applicant asked that his guilt in respect of a further similar charge committed on the same occasion upon the same victim be taken into account. 
     
      
    Facts 
     
      
    6 In respect of the robbery in company offences, the facts were agreed. 
     
      
    7 On the night of Friday 26 February 2003, Andrew O'Kane went to a work function. In the early hours of the morning he caught a cab to Newtown. When he alighted from the cab about 3.45am, he was approached by the applicant and an unidentified male. He was grabbed by the arms by both men and punched in the face. One of them asked him for all of his money and he produced his wallet and handed them $50. That was the robbery itemised on the Form 1. The following is what constitutes the offence on the indictment. 
     
      
    8 One of the offenders said, ""That's not enough, we're going to the bank.” Mr O'Kane was down on his knee at this time and was grabbed by the hair and pulled up from the ground. He was then walked along King Street, Newtown to an automatic teller machine and commanded to insert his card. He did so. Notwithstanding his co-operation, the applicant punched Mr O'Kane with a closed fist to the side of the face, chipping his tooth and cutting his lip. 
     
      
    9 The applicant then tried to make withdrawals from the machine in the amounts of $900 and $5000. This was unsuccessful and the applicant proceeded to punch Mr O'Kane several times with a closed fist around the right eye. The applicant then made an enquiry on the machine as to the balance of Mr O'Kane's account and said, ""I'm going to kill you if you have a lot of money in your account"". After the printout appeared from the machine the applicant asked Mr O'Kane what was the limit he could withdraw and Mr O'Kane replied that he thought it was $400. He was then commanded to withdraw that amount, and he did so. 
     
      
    10 The applicant then said, ""Okay, we're going to do this again"". When Mr O'Kane hesitated he was punched in the face again. 
     
      
    11 At about this time the applicant's co-offender suggested that they should leave. The applicant moved away from Mr O'Kane who spun around and crossed the footpath onto the roadway, narrowly missing a passing car. The applicant and his co-offender then fled. Mr O'Kane returned to his home and contacted the police. He was subsequently examined by a doctor who observed bruising and abrasions to his face. 
     
      
    12 In respect of the charges of affray and assault, the facts were also agreed. 
     
      
    13 About 3.10am on Wednesday 18 February 2004 the applicant and a number of Islander males became involved in a fight with an unknown male on the north-eastern corner of George and Goulburn Streets, Sydney. A security officer from a hotel on the south-eastern corner of the intersection intervened and broke up the fight. The applicant and his companions then crossed to the south-eastern corner of the intersection and purchased some food. They then crossed to the north-western corner and began to assault a group of male and female Irish tourists. During the course of this melee, one of the tourists, Philip Fleming, was knocked to the ground. One man stomped on his head whilst the applicant kicked him in the head. The applicant's companions continued assaulting the other tourists. Two road workers came to assist Mr Fleming and as they approached, the applicant and his companions ran off. 
     
      
    14 Mr Fleming was taken to hospital and found to have suffered a closed head injury, contusions to the face and right side of his head. He was discharged later that day but was readmitted on 1 March 2004 suffering continuing headaches and dizziness. A diagnosis of concussion following head injury was made. He was discharged the next day. 
     
      
    15 After the assault upon Mr Fleming, the applicant and his companions chased another of the tourists, Mr Ian Doyle, and caught him on the footpath outside a convenience store on the western side of George Street. The applicant and his companions were pulling their T-shirts up over their faces, presumably to avoid detection from security cameras. When they caught Mr Doyle they began to assault him. The applicant then moved away from Mr Doyle and approached another man who ran away. He then returned to where Mr Doyle was still being assaulted by the others. The applicant and the other men then walked away. This incident is said to constitute the offence of affray. 
     
      
    16 Two female police officers arrived at the scene. At this stage the applicant was walking in George Street with two females. He again pulled his T-shirt over his face. The police officers chased him north along George Street. He ran across George Street into Liverpool Street to the area outside Central Local Court. At this point he turned and took hold of Constable Dumas by her face with one hand and struck her with a heavy blow to the left of her head with his other fist. Constable Dumas fell backwards. Constable Gao then struck the applicant with her baton. This incident is said to constitute the offence of assault on Constable Dumas. 
     
      
    17 The applicant then proceeded to run but soon turned and pushed Constable Dumas to the ground. He fell over and as he attempted to get up and run again, Constable Dumas tripped him. He fell down again and Constable Gao took hold of him. This incident is said to constitute the offence of resisting Constable Dumas. 
     
      
    18 Constable Gao then turned the applicant face down and placed her knee on his shoulder to restrain him. The applicant struggled against her. She held him whilst Constable Dumas handcuffed him. Other officers attended and took the applicant to the City Central Police Station. He was not interviewed because he was too intoxicated. 
     
      
    19 A doctor at Sydney Hospital examined Constable Dumas on 18 February 2004. The doctor noted swelling and tenderness behind her left ear and left sided neck pain with reduced range of movement. On 16 March 2004 her neck pain flared up. An x-ray was taken and muscle spasm with minimal disc space narrowing at C4/5 was reported. She suffered several more flare-ups of neck pain between that date and 1 June 2004. She was treated with anti-inflammatory medication on these occasions. 
     
      
    The sentence20 The applicant was convicted and sentenced as follows: - 
     
      
     20.1 In respect of the offences of resisting a police officer, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months commencing on 18 August 2004 and expiring on 17 November 2004. 
      
       
        
       
      
     20.2 In respect of the offence of affray the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 1 year and 4 months commencing on 18 August 2004 and expiring on 17 December 2005 with the non-parole period of 12 months expiring on 17 August 2005. 
      
       
        
       
      
     20.3 In respect of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Mr Fleming, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 1 year and 4 months commencing on 18 February 2005 and expiring on 17 June 2006 with a non-parole period of 12 months expiring on 17 February 2006. 
      
       
        
       
      
     20.4 In respect of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Constable Dumas, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years commencing on 18 August 2005 and expiring on 17 August 2008 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months expiring on 17 November 2007. 
      
      
      
     20.5 In respect of the offence of robbery in company, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years commencing on 18 August 2006 and expiring on 17 August 2010 with a non-parole period of 2 years expiring on 17 August 2008. 
      
       
      
    21 In the result, the effective total sentence was a sentence of 6 years commencing on 18 August 2004 and expiring on 17 August 2010. The total effective non-parole period was 4 years commencing on 18 August 2004 and expiring on 17 August 2008.22 The applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court and appeals on three grounds. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
      : The sentencing judge erred in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to a police officer Constable Dumas by taking into account the fact that the applicant was on parole at the time of the offence. 
       
       
      Ground 2 
      : The sentence imposed in respect of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to a police officer Constable Dumas is manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      Ground 3 
      : The [overall] sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    23 In support of the first ground of appeal the applicant draws attention to his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence, and in particular to the following paragraphs: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""As for the affray, assault and resist offences, it is difficult to describe with precision the level of criminality they represent. The affray I would assess as approaching the middle of the range of objective seriousness as it represented a display of wanton gratuitous undiscriminating violence. The assault upon Mr Fleming, involving as it did the infliction of a closed head injury, is also towards the middle of the range, whilst the assault upon Constable Dumas I would assess as being in the middle of the range. The resist offences are fairly typical examples of their type, not of an overly serious kind. 
         
         
        In making these assessments I have taken into account the serious aggravating feature that the offender was on parole at the time of the offences 
        . The only mitigating feature relating to objective gravity of these offences is that they were probably spontaneous rather than being planned criminal activity"". ( 
        Emphasis appearing in applicant’s written submissions). 
        
       
      
    24 In R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 Spigelman CJ, in referring to the assessment of the objective seriousness of offences carrying a standard non-parole period, emphasised the need to confine factors to matters that are directly or causally related to the commission of the offence. This involves the inquiry that would take into account ""the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct, and those factors that might properly"" affect the ""mens rea of the offender"": at [85]. In particular, the Chief Justice, in discussing the treatment of antecedent criminal history and re-offending whilst on conditional liberty before the introduction of standard non-parole periods said at [98] -[99]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Prior to enactment of legislation of the kind which is seen in Div 1A of Pt 4 it was probably not necessary for any strict line to be drawn between matters which related to the offence, and to the offender, respectively, since the focus was placed upon the question of setting a sentence that reflected the overall criminal culpability involved. 
         
         
        The position has now changed in relation to sentencing in respect of offences for which standard non-parole periods have been set, in so far as there needs to be an examination of the level of objective  
        seriousness 
         involved in the offence, in which considerations that do not have a nexus with its commission are to be placed to one side."" 
        
       
      
    25 In R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242 Spigelman CJ determined that the principle of proportionality required that the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence should be set by the objective circumstances of the offence which did not encompass prior convictions: at [24]. The Chief Justice went on to say at [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Section 21A(1)(c) refers expressly to ""any  
        other 
         objective or subjective factor"", clearly indicating that the lists of aggravating and mitigating factors in section 21A(2) and (3) encompass both kinds of considerations. Some of the matters listed in section 21A(2) appear to me to encompass matters which, in the terminology that has come to be adopted in the case law are, at least in part, ""subjective"" rather than ""objective"", e.g. motive in (h) and offending whilst on conditional liberty in (j). I can see no reason why the reference to prior convictions should not be interpreted as referring to the use of that consideration in the ways authorised expressly in  
        Veen No. 2. 
        "" 
        
       
      
    26 The Crown concedes that the sentencing judge fell into error in the way contended by the applicant, but submits that it does not follow that the sentence imposed for the offence of assault police officer occasioning actual bodily harm should be quashed or that a lesser sentence should be imposed. The Crown draws attention to the well-known words of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 that ""some other sentence . . . is warranted in law and should have been passed"" and to the decision of this Court in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79] and [99]-[100]. 
     
      
    27 In my opinion his Honour fell into error in the way contended for by the applicant. The effect, if any, which this has had upon the appropriateness of the sentences imposed by his Honour, will be considered following an analysis of the applicant’s other grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    28 In support of the second ground the applicant submits that the sentence for this offence was manifestly excessive because: - 
     
      
       
        
        28.1 it was an offence that fell below the middle range of offences and not in the middle of the range; 
        
       
       
       
        
        28.2 in determining where the offence fell in terms of objective seriousness the sentencing judge erred in taking into account conditional liberty (to this extent the applicant repeats the submissions made in support of ground one). 
        
       
      
    29 The applicant submitted further that although the offence was serious, it was not an offence that fell within the middle range of such offences because: - 
     
      
       
        
         
        29.1 the substance of the assault was constituted by one ""heavy blow to the left side"" of the victim's head; 
         
         
        29.2 this was not an offence characterised by a number of blows to the face or head or one that involved kicking or more serious violence; 
         
         
        29.3 the assault occurred spontaneously rather than as a planned criminal activity. 
        
       
      
    30 The applicant conceded that the fact that the victim of this assault was a female police officer who suffered injury was relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. However, the applicant contended that a comparison of that fact with the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph meant that this particular offence fell below the mid range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    31 The Crown contends that in order for a sentencing judge's assessment to be challenged it is necessary for an applicant to demonstrate not merely that there may be a range of different opinions as to where an offence falls on the scale of seriousness, but that it was not open to that judge to regard the offence as falling within a particular range. The Crown concedes that the nature and number of blows is a relevant consideration but does not concede the fact, because the assault involved only one blow, that it was not open to his Honour to regard the matter as falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness.32 Moreover, the Crown emphasises the extent of the actual bodily harm that resulted. Although Constable Dumas would not appear to have been permanently disabled or disfigured, she did suffer from pain and discomfort requiring treatment with anti-inflammatory medication together with some radiologically demonstrated spinal pathology. 
     
      
    33 With respect to the question of spontaneity, the Crown emphasises that his Honour took into account the fact that the assault occurred in this way and was, in effect, neither planned nor premeditated. As his Honour said, ""The only mitigating feature relating to objective gravity of these offences is that they were probably spontaneous rather than being planned criminal activity"". It is difficult to see what better, or other, exposition of this proposition more favourable to the applicant could have been given by his Honour. The applicant's submission in this Court cannot advance his case in the circumstances, for the reason that his Honour would appear clearly to have taken it into account in a way favourable to the applicant.  
     
      
    34 If this were not the end of the matter, the Crown draws attention to the terms of the section describing the offence as one of a police officer ""while in the execution of the officers duty"". The Crown submits that the very way in which the offence is described encompasses a range of criminal activity that is unlikely in the majority of cases to be anything but spontaneous. Although the submission was not made in these terms, the Crown's submission suggests that the very words of the section contemplate spontaneous criminal activity of the type committed by the applicant. For the reasons given in the preceding paragraph, it is not necessary to consider this matter further. 
     
      
    35 The Crown also emphasises that in determining whether or not it was open to his Honour, in the exercise of his discretion, to impose the sentence that he did, it was not simply a question of determining where in the range of objective seriousness the offence stood. On the contrary, there were other matters relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence that his Honour was entitled to consider. These included, in the applicant's favour, his plea of guilty, his youth and immaturity, and his need for rehabilitation. 
     
      
    36 On the other hand, so the Crown contends, his Honour was entitled to take into account the fact that the offence was committed while the applicant was on parole. It is settled law that the commission of an offence by an offender who is on conditional liberty is a matter of aggravation relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence: see R v Readman (1990) 47 A Crim R 181; R v Richards (1981) 2 NSWLR 464 at 465 per Street CJ; R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [15]. 
     
      
    37 In R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114, Badgery-Parker J stated at 128: 
     
      
       
        
        "". . . an offender who takes advantage of his liberty on parole to commit further crimes should not only suffer the revocation of his parole and the consequent need to serve out the balance of the original sentence, but should also suffer a significant punishment for the later offence to mark the gravity of his conduct in thus abusing his parole"". 
        
       
      
    38 Even though in the present case, apparently through some administrative error, the applicant was not required to serve the balance of his parole, the Crown submits that the sentence imposed was required properly to mark to some degree the seriousness of the applicant's conduct in abusing the conditional liberty that he had been granted.39 In Re Attorney-General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (No 2 of 2002) (2002) 137 A Crim R 196 Spigelman CJ affirmed (at [22]), that offences involving assault upon police officers in the execution of their duty are serious offences requiring a significant element of deterrence in the sentences to be imposed. His Honour stated (at [26]), that the courts must support the authority of the police, in the performance of their duties. In cases involving assaults against police there is a need to give full weight to the objective of general deterrence and, accordingly, sentences at the high end of the scale, pertinent in the light of all the circumstances, are generally appropriate in such cases.40 It is convenient at this stage to deal with the third ground of appeal. This is because the applicant submitted in this Court that, with the exception of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to the police officer (the subject matter of the second round of appeal), no complaint was made with respect to the sentence imposed by his Honour for any of the other offences. 
     
      
    41 Therefore, in submitting that the overall sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive, the applicant’s only additional submission was that the extent of the accumulation led to a sentence that in its overall effect was manifestly excessive.42 The applicant drew attention to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 which determined that a correct sentence should be fixed for each offence and then consideration be given to questions of totality, concurrence and accumulation: R v Keen [2004] NSWCCA 86 at [42]. The applicant accepted that the decision whether or not to accumulate was a matter within the discretion of the sentencing judge and that in that regard the sentencing judge had a degree of flexibility: Keen at [44]. 
     
      
    43 It was the applicant's submission that, even allowing for a degree of flexibility, his Honour had erred in the exercise of his discretion because, in partially accumulating all of the sentences apart from the sentence for the resist police offences, he had, in effect, extended the effective sentence non-parole period to such an extent that he committed error. In particular, so it was submitted, in relation to all of the offences other than the robbery in company offence, there were clear features pointed toward the need for concurrence including first, that there was one continuing episode of criminality and secondly, that the acts were committed over a distinct and relatively short period of time. It was submitted that if the sentences for those offence were to be accumulated, it should have been in what was described as ""a much less significant manner"". Further, it was submitted that if the sentence imposed for the robbery in company offence were to be accumulated upon the sentences imposed on the other offences, the accumulation should have been less extensive than it was. In the result, it was submitted that this Court should intervene to reduce the aggregate non-parole period and the total effective sentence. 
     
      
    44 It was submitted on the behalf of the Crown that these submissions fail to recognise the appropriateness of partial accumulation in circumstances where the offences, although committed on the one occasion, are distinct and involve different victims. It was submitted by the Crown that it is not the law that because several offences arise from what is described as ""one continuing episode of criminality"" or that the ""acts were committed over a distinct and relatively short period of time"" they should be dealt with by way of concurrent sentences: see Simpson and Howie JJ in R v Price [2004] NSWCCA 186 at [46]-[52]. 
     
      
    45 The Crown drew attention to the remarks of Simpson J in R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219, a case where three victims were stabbed during an altercation. In considering the question of accumulation, her Honour remarked, at [37] and [38]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[37] … It is well established that questions of accumulation are, subject to the application of established principle, discretionary. What is important is that, firstly, an appropriate sentence is imposed in respect of each offence; and, secondly, that the total sentence imposed properly reflects the totality of the criminality. 
         
         
        [38] In my opinion, it was not only well open to his Honour to accumulate one sentence upon the other two; I doubt that would have been correct not to do so. There were, in fact, three separate offences committed, even though all were committed as part of the same event. In this context the Crown appropriately reminded the Court of the purposes of sentencing set out in section 3A of the  
        Sentencing Procedure Act 
        . The first purpose so specified is ensuring adequate punishment for crime; others here relevant include crime prevention by deterrence, denunciation, making an offender accountable and recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community.  
        To fail to accumulate, at least partially, may well be seen as a failure to acknowledge the harm done to those 
          
        individual victims 
         …"" (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    46 The Crown submits that in the present case there was in any event a significant degree of concurrency. The two offences of resist police, committed against different police officers, were not only wholly concurrent with each other but wholly subsumed by the sentence for the affray. The affray in turn was partially concurrent with the assault committed on Mr Fleming, and the sentence for the offence committed on Constable Dumas commenced only six months after the sentence imposed for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Mr Fleming. 
     
      
    47 The Crown contends that, subject to considerations of totality, it would have been open to his Honour to make the robbery in company offence wholly cumulative upon an appropriate sentence for the other offences for the reason that the offences were wholly unrelated, taking place on different occasions, and involving different victims. The Crown submits, therefore, that the applicant benefited from the order that the sentence for the robbery in company commence only 12 months after the sentence for the assault on Constable Dumas. 
     
      
    48 Having regard to the competing submissions on these grounds of appeal, it is important to have regard to the actual approach taken by his Honour when sentencing the applicant.49 In his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour dealt in some detail with the relevant subjective features of the applicant's case. He had a criminal history comprising matters of armed robbery, possession or use of a prohibited weapon, goods in custody and assault at the age of 16; assault, affray, malicious destruction or damage to property at the age of 17; driving a vehicle taken without the consent of its owner, low range prescribed concentration of alcohol, driving without a licence, driving in a manner dangerous to the public, goods in custody and affray at the age of 18. 
     
      
    50 The applicant had been in custody since his arrest on 18 February 2004. His Honour noted that, of that time, the period from 1 August 2004 to 31 January 2005 was referable to time spent serving sentences for other matters. As already mentioned, the applicant's parole in respect of the armed robbery sentence was revoked but administrative errors meant that this was not enforced by requiring him to serve the balance of the sentence for that offence. 
     
      
    51 His Honour had the advantage of a pre-sentence report and a medical opinion from Dr Bruce Westmore. The applicant's upbringing was extremely unsettled. He was removed from his mother's custody when he was four. He and his four siblings moved between various foster homes until he was placed in the care of foster parents when he was six. He had access visits with his natural mother until she moved interstate when he was still very young and he has had no contact with her since. In more recent years, the applicant's natural father initiated contact with him and since then he has alternated between living with his foster parents in Tempe and his father at Berala. 
     
      
    52 The applicant's foster sister reported that the applicant experienced difficulty adjusting to life with his foster family and that anger management had constantly been an issue for him. That family, however, remains supportive of him.53 The applicant left school midway through year 10 when he was expelled. He has had no further education and has never been employed. 
     
      
    54 The applicant began daily use of alcohol at the age of 17 and indicated to the Probation and Parole Officer that his drinking ""was problematic"". The applicant started using ecstasy at age 15 on a weekly basis. He also smoked ice methamphetamine two to three times a week continuing up until the time he went into custody. 
     
      
    55 The applicant told the Probation and Parole Officer that he was intoxicated on the night of each of the offences. In relation to the robbery he said that he was heavily intoxicated and was accompanied by a friend. They required money. They saw the victim and decided to take the opportunity to rob him.  
     
      
    56 The applicant said that he had a limited recollection of the events of 18 February 2005, also by reason of his intoxication. He said that his friends became involved in an altercation and that he simply went to assist them. The officer reported that the applicant showed little remorse for his actions and did not indicate any understanding of the impact his actions would have upon his victims. 
     
      
    57 At the time of the applicant's appearance before his Honour he was being kept at the MRRC and was said to present as a management issue due to his violent nature. The Probation and Parole Officer concluded her report by saying in part: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Mr Kafovalu presents as an immature young man who displays limited insight into his behaviour. Despite a dysfunctional start to life, he appears to have enjoyed the benefit of a supportive foster family. His attitude, violent and aggressive behaviour, which continues to be demonstrated in custody, is of concern. He has expressed a desire to cease further drug and alcohol use and may benefit from treatment with regard to same upon his eventual release."" 
        
       
      
    58 Dr Westmore's report contains more detail than the history obtained from the applicant but is broadly consistent with the summary contained in the pre-sentence report. Dr Westmore made a diagnosis of ""conduct disorder arising in adolescence"", ""alcohol abuse"", ""polysubstance abuse"" and possibly ""depression"". 
     
      
    59 Dr Westmore said that ""concerns must be raised in relation to Mr Kafovalu’s personality, he may be developing an antisocial personality disorder, he certainly has some antisocial personality traits” but he refrained from making a diagnosis because of the applicant's youth and because he had only seen him on one occasion. 
     
      
    60 His Honour observed that the applicant's past offences clearly indicated that the applicant was capable of extremely violent rages. Dr Westmore noted that the applicant claimed as a general rule that he was not aggressive when intoxicated. In his Honour's opinion, the applicant's history of offending in Juvenile Justice facilities, and history of an assault in the MRRC, indicated that the applicant could be aggressive even when not intoxicated. Dr Westmore suggested that anything that the Court could do to direct the applicant towards a long term community-based and strictly supervised drug and alcohol rehabilitation service would be in the best interests of the applicant and the community. 
     
      
    61 His Honour dealt as well with factors touching the objective gravity of the applicant's offences. He said that the robbery in company was ""fairly typical in most of its features in the context of offences involving the mugging of an innocent victim in public at night"". However, his Honour said that two particular features made it worse. Those features were the applicant's gratuitous violence and the threat to kill Mr O'Kane. His Honour said that it was quite unnecessary for the applicant to punch Mr O'Kane in the head but he proceeded to do this a number of times. Mr O'Kane was also dragged up from the ground by his hair. His Honour said that the applicant and his companion could easily have achieved their criminal purpose simply by force of the intimidating effect of their greater numbers. 
     
      
    62 His Honour noted that the applicant was on parole at the time of the first of the offences and that that was a serious aggravating feature. 
     
      
    63 The Crown made submissions to his Honour that he should regard the applicant's criminal history as indicating a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law in the sense described in Veen v The Queen (No 2). However, after consideration, his Honour did not accept that submission. In this regard his Honour expressly took into account the age of the applicant. On the other hand, his Honour was of the view that his criminal history denied the applicant any leniency that he might otherwise have received without such a history. 
     
      
    64 In assessing the objective gravity of the robbery offence, his Honour took into account the fact that any planning between the applicant and his co-offender appears to have been minimal. 
     
      
    65 Having made his assessment of the gravity of that offence, his Honour then made a comparison with the typical robbery case described in the guideline judgement of R v Henry. Apart from the obvious difference that the present case was a robbery in company and not an armed robbery, his Honour expressed the view that the features were broadly the same. The present case involved the actual violence to which his Honour earlier referred. However, his Honour emphasised that the victim was not in the same degree of vulnerability as a shopkeeper or a taxi driver. In his Honour’s view, the criminality and subjective circumstances described in the typical case in R v Henry approximated those in the case before him. His Honour said, ""Accordingly, the guideline is quite pertinent as a benchmark for sentencing here"". 
     
      
    66 With respect to the affray, assault and resist offences, his Honour said that it was difficult to describe with precision the level of criminality they represented. As noted earlier, his Honour assessed the affray as approaching the middle of the range of objective seriousness as it represented a display of wanton gratuitous undiscriminating violence. The assault upon Mr Fleming, involving as it did the infliction of a closed head injury, was also towards the middle of the range, whilst the assault upon Constable Dumas was assessed by his Honour as being in the middle of the range. His Honour said that the resist offences were fairly typical examples of their type and not of an overly serious kind. 
     
      
    67 In making the assessments referred to in the preceding paragraph, his Honour expressly indicated that he took into account the serious aggravating feature that the applicant was on parole at the time of the offences. His Honour said that the only mitigating feature relating to the objective gravity of these offences was that they were probably spontaneous rather than planned criminal activity. 
     
      
    68 In terms of subjective mitigating features his Honour took into account, in assessing the appropriate sentence, the applicant's obvious youth. He accepted the assessment of the Probation and Parole Officer that the applicant was ""an immature young man"". 
     
      
    69 His Honour said that the pleas of guilty entered by the applicant were also matters operating in mitigation. His Honour said that they were not early pleas. The applicant was committed to the District Court for trial and entered the plea to the robbery in company charge on 22 June 2005, the third day of the week in which the matter was listed for trial. An extensive pre-trial hearing proceeded at that time in relation to the 18 February 2004 offences, including the calling of witnesses via video link from overseas. Subsequent representations were made to the DPP that the proceedings be terminated. Pleas of guilty were ultimately entered on 25 November 2005. In his Honour's view, those were pleas of guilty that still attracted a discount for the utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system but at the bottom of the 10 per cent – 25 per cent range indicated in R v Thomson and Houlton. 
     
      
    70 His Honour said that there was no evidence from which he could conclude that the applicant was remorseful for his conduct. He accepted that the applicant had a limited recollection of the incident by reason of his intoxication but said that that did not prevent the applicant from having some contrition or remorse upon being made aware of the gravity of his actions and the harm done to the victims. 
     
      
    71 Similarly, his Honour said that there was insufficient material before him for him to conclude that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation or was unlikely to re-offend. The applicant had a history, which, in his Honour’s opinion, counted against the applicant in both respects. His Honour accepted that the applicant had expressed a desire to undergo rehabilitation in respect of alcohol and drugs and that that would assist, although would not assure, his avoidance of criminal behaviour in the future. His Honour said that there had been some further confirmation that the applicant had expressed a desire to undergo rehabilitation and the applicant's father gave evidence to the effect that he was willing to provide accommodation for the applicant after he was released and to assist him in finding work and supporting him in whatever was necessary for his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    72 His Honour expressed reservations about whether or not the applicant was truly genuine in his stated intention to reform. 
     
      
    73 Having regard to all of these matters, I am unable to conclude that his Honour fell into error in any of the ways contended for by the applicant in support of the second and third grounds of appeal. His Honour patently and transparently undertook, in a thorough and painstaking way, the very difficult balancing exercise that is the task of a sentencing judge. He gave weight, it seems to me appropriately, to the whole range of factors of which the applicant was both entitled to have the benefit, as well as those that were not favourable to his case. Indeed, his Honour in fact dealt in terms favourable to the applicant with some of the matters that the applicant now contends he should have considered. 
     
      
    74 The error referred to by me in paragraph 25 above did not, in my opinion, relevantly infect the sentencing process. As I have already indicated, in my opinion his Honour properly took into account the fact that the applicant was on parole at the time he committed the earlier offences as a matter of aggravation relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence. In order for this Court to interfere, it would be necessary for the applicant to demonstrate that his Honour’s erroneous application of this fact to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence amounted to an error in the process of reasoning necessarily requiring that some other sentence be warranted in law. 
     
      
    75 In R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79], Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        "" [79] Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: ""If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process"". That is not the statutory formulation. By s 6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that ""some other sentence ... is warranted in law and should have been passed"". Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to ""quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor"" is not satisfied. As the judgments in  
        Dinsdale 
         to which I have referred indicate, the exercise of the power in s 6(3) further requires the identification of error in the requisite sense."" 
        
       
      
    76 In the same case, Sully J had this to say at [99] and [100]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[99] Whenever an applicant for leave to appeal against sentence submits that there is cause to show why this Court should intervene and reduce the primary sentence, it is, as I think, obvious that the first thing to be established by the applicant is that the primary sentencing discretion has miscarried, by reason of some error of fact or of law; or because of the cumulative effect of errors of both fact and law. The errors, whether of fact or of law, may be either latent or patent; but whether latent or patent, some error must be demonstrated before this Court becomes entitled at all to consider interfering with the sentence passed at first instance 
        : R v Vachalec 
         [1981] 1 NSWLR 351 at 353 F;  
        R v Visconti 
         [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 108 G. 
         
         
        [100] Error once demonstrated, it does not follow automatically that this Court will, without more, intervene in fact and resentence. Before that can happen properly in law, the condition specified in s 6(3) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912 must be satisfied: that is to say, this Court must be persuaded, not only that error has been shown in the process of reasoning of the primary sentencing Court, but that some other sentence is ""warranted in law"". I agree with the observations made in this connection by Lee A-J In  
        R v Astill (No 2) 
         (1992) 64 A Crim R 289 at 303, 304."" 
        
       
      
    77 One of the ways in which the applicant may possibly have established that some other sentence was warranted in law would have been to demonstrate that his Honour had, in effect, dealt with the issue of the applicant's offending while on parole at two separate and distinct stages of the sentencing process so as to lead reasonably to the conclusion that that factor had, or may have, been taken into account by his Honour more than once. Although having regard to the fact that his Honour actually referred to this issue more than once, and in separate and distinct portions of his Remarks on Sentence, I have not been able to discern a clear, or even a faint, pathway from what I consider to be his Honour’s erroneous reference to this factor to an obviously inappropriate enlargement of the sentence which he imposed. Even accepting, as I do, that an error was made in fact, I am unable to conclude that some other sentence is warranted in law or should have been passed. 
     
      
    78 There is in my opinion no good basis upon which to suggest that the primary sentencing discretion miscarried. It follows that it cannot be said that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.CONCLUSION 
     
      
    79 In my opinion, leave to appeal against sentence should be granted and the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.

     CTM  
     v 
      Regina 
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Howie J and with his reasons. 
     
      
    2 I agree that there is a presumption that a Proudman v. Dayman defence is available to charges of criminal offences, particularly those of strict liability. 
     
      
    3 I agree also that there are powerful indications of legislative intention that such a defence should not be available in respect of s.66C offences. 
     
      
    4 Before its repeal on 13 June 2003, s.77(2) of the Crimes Act provided for a defence in respect of the then existing s.66C offences where “the person charged and the child to whom the charge relates are not both male” and the accused proves, on the balance of probabilities, that the child was over 14, that the child consented, and that the accused did, with reasonable cause, believe that the child was of or over 16. 
     
      
    5 That provision conveyed a clear legislative intention that there should not be the wider Proudman v. Dayman defence to cases in which it applied. In my opinion, it also conveyed a clear legislative intent that there should not be the wider Proudman v. Dayman defence where both the accused and the child were male, but rather that there should be no defence of that general kind in such cases. 
     
      
    6 Further, in my opinion there was a clear legislative intention that, where the child was not over the age of 14, there should be no defence based on honest and reasonable mistake as to the child’s age; that is, that in relation to offences under s.67 (carnal knowledge of a girl under 10) and s.71 (carnal knowledge of a girl of or above 10 but under 14), a reasonable belief that the child was 16 could not be a defence. It would make no sense to have a Proudman v. Dayman defence in relation to those offences, when the only defence where the child was over the age of 14 was the narrower s.77(2) defence. 
     
      
    7 It is inconceivable that the repeal of s.77(2) would activate a Proudman v. Dayman defence in those cases where s.77(2) had not operated, that is, in relation to cases where both the accused and the child was male or where the child was not over 14. In my opinion also, it was not the intention of the legislature to replace the narrow s.77(2) defence with a broader Proudman v. Dayman defence where s.77(2) did apply, or in relation to offences under the amended s.66C covering generally the same field. The intention appears to have been to restrict defences, not to broaden them; and otherwise there would be the anomalous situation that, in the absence of anything in the legislation as amended to suggest this result, a Proudman v. Dayman defence would apply to some age-related sexual offences and not to others. 
     
      
    8 Accordingly, the appeal against conviction must fail.  
     
      
       
      Introduction 
      
    9 HOWIE J: This appeal raises a significant question of law that has been the subject of controversy in both the District and Local Courts. It concerns the consequences of the repeal in 2003 of s 77(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, a section that provided a limited defence to certain sexual assault offences. 
     
      
    10 The matter was first listed before this Court on 13 September 2006. On that date, in light of submissions filed by the Crown, the appellant sought and was granted an adjournment in order to meet those submissions which first raised the issue of the consequence of the repeal of s 77(2). The matter was relisted for hearing before this Court on 13 December 2006. At the conclusion of the hearing both parties sought liberty to place further submissions before this Court but, because of the summer vacation, asked to be allowed to file submissions by the second week in February 2007. On 6 February the appellant made further submissions to which the Crown replied on 16 February. On 12 April the appellant notified the Court that he would not be making any reply in answer to the Crown’s further submissions. 
     
      
    11 The appellant and a co-accused stood trial before a jury in the District Court on a charge of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act. The appellant was at the time of the alleged offence under 18 years of age. The circumstance of aggravation relied upon by the Crown was that the complainant was under the age of 16 years, being aged 15: see s 61J(2)(d). This was not a “serious children’s indictable offence” for the purposes of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987: see the definition in s 3 of the Act that exempts an offence under s 61J(1) where the circumstance of aggravation alleged is under s 61J(2)(d). The offence, therefore, could have been dealt with in the Children’s Court but the District Court also had jurisdiction to determine the matter: see Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v PM [2006] NSWCCA 297; 164 A Crim R 151. 
     
      
    12 The indictment presented before the jury contained an alternative count contrary to s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act being an offence of having sexual intercourse with a child between the age of 14 and 16 in circumstances of aggravation. The aggravating circumstance alleged was that the appellant took advantage of the complainant being under the influence of alcohol to commit the offence: see s 66C(5)(g). 
     
      
    13 The appellant was found not guilty by the jury of the two charges contained in the indictment but found guilty of a statutory alternative to the s 66C(4) offence being an offence under s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act, a non-aggravated form of the offence of having sexual intercourse with a child between the age of 14 and 16: see s 66E(1A) of that Act that provides for alternative verdicts. He was as a consequence sentenced to imprisonment but that sentence was suspended. 
     
      
    14 The appellant initially appealed against his conviction on a single ground as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The appellant appeals against his conviction on the ground that the verdict was unsafe and/or incapable of being supported by the evidence. 
         
        
       
      On 8 December 2006, shortly before the second hearing date for the appeal, an additional ground was filed as follows: 
       
        
         
        1. The trial judge erred in his directions on the onus and standard of proof in respect of the issue of the Accused’s belief of the age of the complainant. 
        
       
       
      Even later, on 12 December, being the day before the hearing of the appeal, a further additional ground was filed in respect of sentence as follows: 
       
        
         
        1. The trial judge erred by failing to apply the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 on sentence. 
        
       
       
      On the day of the hearing a further ground of appeal against sentence was filed being: 
       
        
         
        2. The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
      The Crown case 
      
    15 The Crown case was that in October 2004 the complainant was a schoolgirl living in the far North Coast of the State and then aged 15. During the night and the morning of 23-24 October 2004, she had been out drinking with some girlfriends and eventually ended up at the residence of the appellant. He was then aged 17. Due to the effects of alcohol upon her the complainant fell asleep and was taken to one of the bedrooms. It was the Crown case that the appellant, a co-accused, and another male, whom the complainant could not positively identify, there sexually assaulted her. She alleged that the appellant had penile penetration of her vagina. 
     
      
    16 The complainant made three audio interviews with a police officer. Each of these was played to the jury. The first was made at 7.15am on 24 October 2004 in the appellant's residence, a unit. The second was made at 9.15am the same morning at the local hospital. The third was conducted on 30 March 2005 at the local Police Station. 
     
      
    17 In her first interview the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Well, I was drinking and I was kind of falling asleep and stuff like that and they told all my friends to leave and that I was asleep and they should come get me in the morning or something like that and then they left and they kind of just, I don't know, like started to having (sic) sex with me"" 
        
       
       
      The complainant nominated the persons she was speaking about as the appellant, the co-accused and the co-accused’s brother, M, although she was not sure that it was he. 
       
      
    18 The complainant said that she had met the appellant at school the year before and knew the other two males through him. She had known them for about seven months or probably longer. She said there were two other males at the unit at the time, a person named T and someone who was referred to as B. She arrived at the unit at about 10.30pm with some friends. She had been drinking alcohol over a period of about three hours. The males at the unit were drunk and “acting stupid”. 
     
      
    19 At some point in time she was about to leave with a friend. As she went to walk out, M grabbed her and she fell into his lap and passed out. She became aware of her friends leaving. Eventually she was taken by M and the appellant and placed on a mattress in the appellant’s room. There was a doona on the mattress that she described. 
     
      
    20 She fell asleep. The next thing she remembered was having almost no clothes on and the appellant having intercourse with her. She heard the appellant say something to M but she could not remember what it was but she recognised the appellant’s voice. She opened her eyes for a moment and saw that the appellant was naked. She also saw his face. She asked him what he was doing but he did not answer. She tried to roll over but he stopped her. She felt useless, “like I couldn't do anything about it and I didn't know what to do and I was scared"". She said that the alcohol that she had consumed had made her very tired and all she wanted to do was sleep. 
     
      
    21 She said that nothing happened for a minute and then she could hear talking in the background. She could hear M telling B to do it, but he refused. She fell asleep again and then woke to find the co-accused having sex with her. He heard him say to the appellant, “How long did it take you?” She tried not to think about what was happening: “I thought it was my fault, that I should do something but I didn’t know what to do, I was just scared”. 
     
      
    22 Then someone else started to have sex with her but she wasn't sure who it was, although she thought it was M. B came into the room and lay down next to them on the bed. When she later woke, B was still there but fully clothed. 
     
      
    23 B offered her the use of his phone if she needed it. She found all her clothes, dressed and then went downstairs. The appellant, the co-accused, M and T were there. She did not say anything to them but M asked her where she was going and what was the matter. The complainant told them that they were ""fucked in the head about what had happened”. She left and the appellant followed her outside with her phone that she had left inside. He asked her why she was upset, to which she replied, ""if you don't think that would make someone upset, then you've got problems"". M then walked out and started yelling at her, calling her a ""dirty slut"". He said that he had done nothing to her and, if she said he had, she was a liar. He then threw a bottle at her that smashed on the ground. 
     
      
    24 She later met one of her friends who asked her why she was crying. She said, ""I didn't know what I was doing and they had sex with me and I didn't want to"". Her friend told her that it was rape and that, if she did not go to the police, she would. Eventually the complainant told the police what had happened when an officer approached her at about 2.30am. 
     
      
    25 In evidence at the trial the complainant gave her date of birth and was in Year 9. The appellant was at the same high school in Year 11. She had known the appellant for about six months. In cross-examination she had agreed that she had always regarded the appellant as a good friend. They had talked about becoming boyfriend and girlfriend but had decided that they would just remain friends. 
     
      
    26 At the trial M, B and T gave evidence but it is unnecessary for the resolution of this appeal to refer to their evidence. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s account 
      
    27 The appellant participated in an ERISP with the police. In summary his account was as follows. He said that towards about 8 pm, after he finished work, he started receiving text messages from the complainant saying that they should “hang out and get on together”. When he went back home, the co-accused, M, T and B were there. They were “sitting around” drinking beer. At about 10 pm he talked to the complainant by phone to see where she was. She said she was with friends. The appellant and the others went to buy another carton of beer. On the way back they met the complainant. She went with them to the unit but later left to find her friends. A short time later the complainant and her friends arrived. Most of the girls were drunk. 
     
      
    28 An argument occurred between T and one of the girls and she decided to leave. The complainant was upstairs, almost passed out on the lounge. Her friend tried to wake her up but was unsuccessful. The appellant told her to leave the complainant and come back in the morning. As the complainant's friends were making too much noise and he was worried about complaints from the neighbours, the appellant told them to leave. 
     
      
    29 The appellant decided to move the complainant to M’s room but, when he tried to do so, she awoke and started talking to him. Eventually they started kissing and he thought that M would not be happy if they were doing it in his room. So he stopped, helped the complainant up and took her into his room. They lay there for a bit and then started kissing. M walked in, stood there for a moment and then left. The complainant and the appellant continued kissing. He started “making my way down towards her body like she had her hands on my head and sort of, she is guiding me downwards and then that's when I asked her if she was okay with what was going on and she said ‘yes’”.  
     
      
    30 M then walked back in and the appellant told him to leave. He said that he took off his shirt and then ""all the guys walked in"". He told them that he was planning on having sex with the complainant and had a condom. He asked the others to leave but they would not. He stood up and went into the bathroom and thought about what he was doing because he had a girlfriend himself. T came out and the appellant asked what they were doing in there. He said, ""Nothing much, you know, they're just talking and [C’s] flirting a little bit"". The appellant walked into the room and saw the complainant still lying on the bed. M was sitting on T’s bed and B was lying on the mattress on the left side of the complainant. The co-accused was sitting on the end of the mattress with his shirt off. 
     
      
    31 The appellant left the room and went downstairs to play a computer game with T. Every now and then M and the co-accused went up and down the stairs. Each time he noticed that one of them would have his shirt off. M said to him that the co-accused was being an idiot and flirting trying to get ""close to her"". The appellant said, ""Just, just leave her be, just let her go to sleep"". The appellant never went back into the bedroom and never had intercourse with the complainant. 
     
      
    32 The appellant said that he had known the complainant since the start of the year. He knew she was 16 years old because she had told him that when he first met her. He just assumed that she was 16. He thought that she was in year 10 at school. 
     
      
    33 The appellant did not give evidence at trial. However he called a character witness. 
     
      
       
      The relevant statutory provisions 
      
    34 The offence for which the appellant was convicted was that under s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (3) Child between 14 and 16  
         
        Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years is liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 
        
       
       
      At the time of the trial s 77 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       provided: 
       
        
         
        77 Consent no defence in certain cases  
         
        (1) The consent of the child or other person to whom the charge relates shall be no defence to a charge under section 61E (1A), (2) or (2A), 61M (2), 61N (1) or 61O (1) or (2), 66A, 66B, 66C, 66D, 66EA, 66F, 67, 68, 71, 72, 72A, 73, 74 or 76A or, if the child to whom the charge relates was under the age of 16 years at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed, to a charge under section 61E (1), 61L, 61M (1) or 76. 
         
         
        (2) (Repealed) 
        
       
       
      The effect of this section was that the Crown did not have to prove that the complainant was not consenting and in effect the issue of consent and the accused’s knowledge in relation to consent was irrelevant. 
       
      
    35 The repealed s 77(2) was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (2) It shall be a sufficient defence to a charge which renders a person liable to be found guilty of an offence under section 61E (1A), (2) or (2A), 61N (1), 61O (1) or (2), 66C, 66D, 71, 72 or 76A or, if the child to whom the charge relates was under the age of 16 years at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed, to a charge under section 61E (1), 61L, 61M (1) or 76 if the person charged and the child to whom the charge relates are not both male and it is made to appear to the court or to the jury before whom the charge is brought that:  
         
          
          (a) the child to whom the charge relates was of or above the age of 14 years at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed,  
           
          (b) the child to whom the charge relates consented to the commission of the offence, and  
           
          (c) the person so charged had, at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed, reasonable cause to believe, and did in fact believe, that the child to whom the charge relates was of or above the age of 16 years. 
          
         
        
       
       
      That provision was repealed by s 3 and Schedule 1[14] of the  
      Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 
       2003 
        
      which came into operation on 13 June 2003. 
       
      
    36 Had that section been in operation at the time of the appellant’s trial, it would have meant that there was a defence provided to an offence under s 66C because the complainant was above the age of 14. That defence would have arisen where it was proved that the complainant was consenting to sexual intercourse and that the appellant reasonably believed that the complainant was of, or above, the age of 16 years. Because the complainant said she was not consenting and because consent was, so far as proof of the offence was concerned, irrelevant, the appellant would for all practical purposes have had to prove, on the balance of probabilities, both the consent of the complainant and his belief that she was over the age of 16. 
     
      
       
      The trial 
      
    37 A question arose at the trial as to the effect of the repeal of s 77(2) on the issue of the appellant’s belief, as stated in the ERISP, that the complainant was above the age of 16. 
     
      
    38 The first submission made to the Judge was that he should direct a verdict on the charge under s 61J. It was argued that the aggravated circumstance alleged was that the complainant was under the age of 16, yet the evidence before the jury was that the appellant believed she was 16 years of age and, therefore, he could not be convicted of that offence. The Judge rejected that application on the basis that it was an element of the offence that the complainant was in fact under the age of 16 and that the prosecution needed only to prove that fact and not the appellant’s knowledge that she was under that age. As the appellant was acquitted of that offence, it is unnecessary to consider the correctness or otherwise of the trial judge’s ruling. 
     
      
    39 The next submission was that there was a defence available to the s 66C offences on the basis that the appellant reasonably believed that the complainant was of, or over, the age of 16. The argument was that, in light of the repeal of s 77(2), the common law applied to the offences under s 66C so that there was a defence available in accordance with the decision in Proudman v Dayman (1941) 67 CLR 536. This is a “defence” arising from a reasonable mistake of fact. The “defence” was described as a rule by Dixon J in Proudman v Dayman in the following terms (at 539): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “As a general rule an honest and reasonable belief in a state of facts which, if they existed, would make the defendant's act innocent affords an excuse for doing what would otherwise be an offence.” 
        
       
      
    40 The defence operates so that in any criminal offence, and particularly one of strict liability, if there is evidence that the accused reasonably but mistakenly believed in the existence of a fact which, if it had existed, would have meant that no offence was committed, the Crown must negative the accused’s belief in the existence of that fact beyond reasonable doubt. The application of the common law defence to an offence of having sexual intercourse with a person under a certain age would be that it was a “defence” to the charge if the accused had an honest and reasonable belief that the complainant was above the specified age in circumstances where that belief would make “the defendant’s act innocent”. 
     
      
    41 In response to this submission the Judge referred to three judgments by other judges of the District Court dealing with the effects of the repeal of s 77(2) and determined that “the common law defence is still available”. Accordingly he permitted the appellant and his co-accused to argue the defence of an honest and reasonable mistake of age in relation to the s 66C offences but not in respect of the s 66J offence. 
     
      
    42 In summing up to the jury on the issue of the appellant’s knowledge of the complainant’s age in respect of the s 66C offences the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “There is in this case, a defence. That defence is one in which the onus of proof switches slightly. Only in this one small area. The defence is one of having an honest belief that she was not under the age of 16 years. The Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt but where there is a defence such as this the onus switches. There is no onus of proof of any matter on an accused person except where such a defence as this and there are other such defences raised. The accused needs only to establish what the accused relies on in this regard to a lower standard of proof than beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is required to prove the accused's case in this regard only on the balance of probabilities. That is to say the accused needs only to show that it is more likely than not that what the accused asserts is so. I will come to the evidence on that but I have put that to you as a matter of law. You probably did not hear it argued but it is a matter I have to put to you.” 
         
         
        
       
      The Judge later told the jury: 
       
        
        “If you are satisfied of that defence, of course, it would be a full answer to the charge.” 
        
       
      
    43 At the conclusion of the summing up and in the presence of the jury counsel for the co-accused asked the Judge to identify to the jury the alternative offence open under s 66C(3). The Judge said this to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…….. the third one is simply sexual intercourse with [the complainant], [she] being 15 years of age. And if you come to that, look at the defence. The defence being did they reasonably, either one, believe that she was 16 or more years of age? That is….” 
        
       
       
      Defence counsel then interrupted saying, "" 
      I think I might leave it at that 
      ”. 
       
      
    44 Counsel for the appellant asked the Judge to identify for the jury the evidence concerning the appellant's belief of the complainant's age. The Judge directed the jury as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “……. I told you there was a defence not in the first charge each is charged with but in the alternate charge. That is that they reasonably believed that [the complainant] was 16 years or more of age and I must remind you that as far as each of them is concerned there are the questions and answers given in the records of interview which I referred you to in addition to that, with [the appellant] he was at school with [the complainant]. Knew what year she was in and knew her from school.” 
         
        
       
      
    45 It is clear that, if the Proudman v Dayman defence applied, the Judge was in error in directing the jury that the onus of proof of that defence was on the appellant. Therefore, if that defence did apply to the offence under s 66C(3), the ground of appeal asserting that the judge misstated the onus of proof in that regard must succeed. Notwithstanding that no objection was taken to those directions, it would seem to me to be a fundamental error that might well have affected the jury's decision to convict the appellant of that offence. Therefore, in my view, rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules could not be applied. 
     
      
    46 However a significant issue litigated between the parties in the hearing of this appeal is whether, as a consequence of the repeal of s 77(2), the common law defence applied or whether the offence under s 66C(3) was thereafter one of absolute liability, so far as the element of the complainant’s age was concerned. There was also an issue raised by the Crown as to whether, even if the Proudman v Dayman defence applied, the applicant could have the benefit of it when he was asserting that he did not have sexual intercourse with the complainant. 
     
      
    47 Before considering these difficult issues, it is appropriate to deal with a ground of appeal where a consideration of the repeal of s 77(2) does not arise. 
     
      
       
      Unreasonable verdict. 
      
    48 The argument raised by the appellant is that the verdict of guilty of the offence under s 66C(3) was, in the circumstances of the issues raised at the trial, unreasonable. There was a suggestion that in some way it must have been a compromise on the part of the jury. That suggestion should be rejected at the outset in light of what was said to the jury about the alternative counts. The Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I should also say to you with alternative verdicts, you should not regard that as an invitation to compromise. Supposing, for example, that six of you were for a verdict of guilty on the major count and six believed he was not guilty of anything at all. It would be quite wrong, in those circumstances, to compromise by convicting him on the lesser charge. You understand that I am sure. It is commonsense.” 
        
       
       
      It would, in my view, be quite wrong for this Court, in light of that specific direction, to find that the verdict of guilty of the least serious offence charged against the appellant may have been a compromise on the part of the jury. 
       
      
    49 The appellant’s argument is, however, that the real issue litigated before the jury was whether intercourse took place, and not whether the complainant was consenting. As the jury must have had a doubt about whether the complainant was consenting, and hence acquitted the appellant of the s 61J offence, so, the argument ran, they could not have found beyond reasonable doubt that intercourse did take place regardless of whether or not she was consenting. In other words it was submitted that, if the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the complainant’s account, they should have convicted the appellant of the offence under s 61J but, if they were not so satisfied, they should have acquitted the appellant of every offence. 
     
      
    50 It was made perfectly clear in the summing up that, if the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that intercourse had taken place, they should acquit the appellant of all charges. The Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Now what you have to do first is you have to decide whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, considering each of the accused’s cases separately and the circumstances separately, whether they had sexual intercourse with [the complainant]. They say they did not. She says they did. I will come to that in a minute. Secondly, and I should say this and it is commonsense I suppose, if you decided that you could not be satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt and that is the end of all charges because they all rely on sexual intercourse so if you came to that conclusion then that is the end of all of them. If you're satisfied that they did then you would go on to look at the next matter.” 
        
       
       
      Therefore it is to be assumed that the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that sexual intercourse took place in accordance with the complainant’s evidence. 
       
      
    51 Although consent was not really an issue because the appellant’s case was that he did not have intercourse with the complainant, the jury still had to consider, for the purpose of the offence under s 61J, whether, if he did have intercourse with her, the appellant knew that she was not consenting. In the summing up the Judge gave the jury a full direction relating to the appellant’s knowledge as to the fact that the complainant was not consenting. It included a direction that, if the appellant’s state of mind was that he honestly but wrongly believed she was consenting, the charge would not be made out. After these directions the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “You may wonder why I put all that to you because the case that has been presented to you is no sexual intercourse but the fact is if you were to find to the contrary, beyond reasonable doubt, you still have got to consider each of the other elements. I will shortly come and refer to some evidence in relation to that.” 
        
       
      
    52 There was evidence from which the jury could have had a doubt as to whether the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting. The complainant stated that the “boys” were drunk and the effect of her evidence was that, although she was not consenting, she did very little to indicate this fact because of her tiredness and fear. There was no direction to the jury on recklessness in respect of lack of consent. It was, therefore, in my opinion well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the complainant’s version and yet have a doubt that the appellant knew that she was not consenting and so acquit him of the s 61J offence. 
     
      
    53 Reliance is also placed upon the fact that the jury acquitted the appellant of the offence under s 66C(4), the aggravated offence under that section. It will be recalled that the circumstance of aggravation relied upon was that the appellant took advantage of the complainant being under the influence of alcohol in order to commit the offence. It was submitted that the acquittal on this charge must have been on the basis that the jury had a doubt about the complainant’s account of events including whether intercourse occurred. 
     
      
    54 In this respect the jury were directed as to what the aggravating circumstances meant. The Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Now this charge is somewhat different as you see from reading it. It still involves sexual intercourse but consent is not an issue. The other issue is the circumstance of aggravation, namely that they took advantage of [the complainant] being under the influence of alcohol in order to commit the offence. To take advantage is simply to do something to gain a benefit. The benefit which is alleged is sexual intercourse. The rest of it, the wording, speaks for itself. I don't have to go through all those other matters again with you…………….” 
        
       
      
    55 During the course of their deliberations the jury asked the following question: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Are we to assume that if [the complainant] was under the influence of alcohol and that sex took place does that automatically imply she was taken advantage of?” 
        
       
       
      The Judge directed the jury that the answer to that question was ""No"". He then went on: 
       
        
         
        “Can I just say this to you - you need, of course, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was under the influence of alcohol and that the accused took advantage of her while she was under the influence of alcohol to commit the offence. That is what you need to be satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    56 With respect this explanation was hardly helpful to the jury who obviously wanted some assistance as to the matters that the Crown had to prove in order to make out the element of aggravation. Again with respect the Judge’s direction in the body of the summing up made little sense by explaining that “to take advantage” meant “to do something to obtain a benefit”. The Judge should have at least explained to the jury in answer to the question, that the appellant must have known that the complainant was under the influence of alcohol. They should also have been told that the Crown had to prove that the appellant knew that her intoxication affected her attitude to sexual intercourse, making it more likely that she would consent to it. Unless it was proved that the appellant had that knowledge, I do not understand how the aggravated offence under s 66C(4) could have been made out. 
     
      
    57 I think it very likely that, after the question was asked, the jury had no more understanding of what was needed to be proved under the s 66C(4) offence than before they asked the question. It is quite possible that the jury did not convict of that offence because they were unsure of how it was to be proved once they accepted that sexual intercourse took place and that the complainant was under the influence of alcohol. The Judge told them those two facts were not enough, but did not tell them more. In my opinion, the jury did not convict of this offence simply because they did not understand what the Crown had to prove to make out the offence. 
     
      
    58 In any event, the test for unreasonableness in apparently inconsistent verdicts was discussed in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606. In the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ, their Honours wrote (footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “[34] Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in MacKenzie [v The Queen]. They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others. Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in R v Kirkman, and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. And there may be an interaction between this consideration and the two matters earlier discussed.” 
        
       
       
      Their Honours pointed out at [36] that the test to be established under s 6(1) of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       was “ 
      unreasonableness, not inconsistency 
      ”. Although that decision was concerned with different verdicts on an indictment containing multiple counts, the reasoning seems to apply equally where there is one count with alternative counts containing different elements. 
       
      
    59 Further it is curious, in light of the appellant’s argument, that neither defence counsel advanced the submission that a verdict of guilty on the alternative under s 66C(3) was not open to the jury on the issues raised at the trial. There was no application to withdraw that alternative from the jury. All counsel and the Judge addressed the jury on the basis that it was open for them to acquit the appellant on the s 61J and s 66C(4) counts yet convict him on the s 66C(3) count. In those circumstances it seems to me that an appellant has a very difficult, if not impossible, task of persuading this Court that it was unreasonable for the jury to convict of an offence that was placed before them as an available alternative if they did not convict on a more serious offence. 
     
      
    60 A similar situation arose in Boulattouf v R [2007] NSWCCA 102 where an alternative count was left to the jury without any clear instruction as to how they would acquit on the first count but convict on the alternative count. This Court held that in such a situation it was open to the jury to take a merciful approach and convict on the less serious offence in light of the strong subjective case placed before them as to the appellant’s character. 
     
      
    61 If defence counsel believes that, as a matter of practical reality on the issues raised before the jury, there would be no foundation for the jury to convict on a particular count in the indictment, this should be raised with the judge on an application to have the count withdrawn. But in this case there was a statutory power for the jury to convict on the s 66C(3) count and I am not satisfied that it was not open to them to do so. 
     
      
    62 In any event, I am unpersuaded by the appellant’s argument that the jury must have found as a fact that the intercourse was consensual. They were told that consent was irrelevant except for the s 61J offence. As I have already noted, a finding of not guilty on that offence meant only that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew she was not consenting. That they should have such a doubt was unsurprising. When they moved from that offence to the offences under s 66C they must have understood that consent was not a relevant issue. They had to form no view about consent or knowledge of lack of consent to determine those charges. 
     
      
    63 Nor am I persuaded that the jury should have found that the appellant had a reasonable belief as to her age. The jury presumably found that his account generally was not credible and there is no reason why they should have found in his favour on that issue. He had more than a passing knowledge of the complainant. The close familiarity between the two was established in cross-examination of the complainant when she indicated that at one stage they were thinking of forming a relationship. They were clearly close friends and defence counsel was relying on this fact. The appellant had been in the same high school with her. It was well open to a jury to have a doubt about his assertion that he believed she was 16 or that the belief was a reasonable one, when the onus was put erroneously on the appellant. 
     
      
    64 In my opinion this ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      The Proudman v Dayman defence 
      
    65 In order to understand the competing arguments as to the effect of the repeal of s 77(2) it is necessary to have regard to the history of the provision. The arguments of both parties are substantially based upon competing views as to whether the common law applied to the offences with which the appellant was charged from the date of the repeal of the statutory defence. It seems to have been conceded by the appellant and accepted by the Crown that the common law did not apply to the offences while s 77(2) or its equivalent was in force. That concession is obviously correct because, as will be seen, the statutory defence was completely inconsistent with the common law defence both as to the matters to be proved and the onus of proof. 
     
      
    66 The common law defence in this regard is the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact or, as it is sometimes known in this country, the Proudman v Dayman defence. It is a defence that was recognised in R v Tolson (1889) 23 QBD 168 at 181 and referred to in Bank of New South Wales v Piper [1897] AC 383 at 389-390. It was extensively considered by the High Court in R v Thomas (1937) 59 CLR 279 in relation to an offence of bigamy and where Dixon J reviewed the history and ambit of the defence. The ambit and applicability of the defence was also considered in He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1984) 157 CLR 523. 
     
      
    67 The defence operates where the statutory offence does not require full mens rea to prove an element of the offence. The defence arises where the offence being considered would otherwise be an offence of strict liability generally or in regard to a particular element of the offence. The appellant did not suggest that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he knew the complainant was under the age of 16 years in order to make out either of the s 66C offences. The appeal was argued on the basis that the offence was at least one of strict liability so far as the element of age of the complainant was concerned. 
     
      
    68 In Proudman v Dayman Dixon J held that there was a presumption that the defence, there described as a rule, would apply in a case where there was no full mens rea. But his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The strength of the presumption that the rule applies to a statutory offence newly created varies with the nature of the offence and the scope of the statute. If the purpose of the statute is to add a new crime to the general criminal law, it is natural to suppose that it is to be read subject to the general principles according to which that law is administered. But other considerations arise where in matters of police, of health, of safety or the like, the Legislature adopts penal measures in order to cast on the individual the responsibility of so conducting his affairs that the general welfare will not be prejudiced. In such cases there is less ground, either in reason or in actual probability, for presuming an intention that the general rule should apply making honest and reasonable mistake a ground of exoneration, and the presumption is but a weak one.” 
         
        
       
      
    69 It is unusual to find an offence of strict liability arising under the provisions of the Crimes Act. That Act is generally concerned with criminal offences of some seriousness, most of them indictable offences. Strict liability offences are generally found in offences of a regulatory nature such as under the provisions dealing with the control of motor traffic or public health. However there is at least one category of offence found in the Act where strict liability applies so far as one of the elements of the offence is concerned. These are the offences of dangerous driving or dangerous navigation under sections 52A and 52B. In those offences the common law defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact applies notwithstanding that there are specific defences provided in sections 52A(8) and 52B(8). The application of the Proudman v Dayman defence to culpable driving, a similar offence to that now found in s 52A, was considered in Jiminez v The Queen [1992] HCA 14; (1992) 173 CLR 572. 
     
      
    70 In that case, in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, the defence is summarised as follows (footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “A statutory offence which imposes absolute liability is one which, in addition to excluding the requirement of mens rea, also excludes a defence of honest and reasonable mistake. In a well-known passage in Proudman v Dayman, Dixon J drew a distinction between mens rea as an ingredient of an offence and an honest and reasonable belief in a state of facts which, if they existed, would make a defendant's act innocent. If honest and reasonable mistake is not excluded in the case of a statutory offence, it will afford an excuse for what would otherwise be an offence, although the burden of establishing the excuse will in the first place be upon the defendant. The burden on the defendant is evidentiary only, and the prosecution retains the burden of proving guilt by establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant did not honestly believe on reasonable grounds in the existence of facts which, in the circumstances, would take his act outside the operation of the statute……………………..” 
        
       
      
    71 This consideration of the Proudman v Dayman defence arose in that case where the prosecution was alleging that the accused drove in a manner dangerous to the public because he fell asleep at the wheel of his vehicle in circumstances where he was so tired that it was objectively dangerous for him to drive. The High Court held that it was open to the accused to raise a defence that he reasonably believed that it was safe for him to drive (at 583). 
     
      
    72 The defence only applies where the accused had a reasonable belief of the existence of facts that, if they existed, “would make his conduct innocent”. A question arises as to what “innocence” means in the statement of the defence. Does it mean that, if the fact existed, the accused would not have been guilty of the offence charged? Or does it mean that, if the fact existed, the accused would be innocent of any wrong doing at all? In Jiminez, in the passage quoted above, the defence was expressed in two ways: the existence of facts, that if true, would make a defendant’s act innocent, and, the existence of facts which would take his act outside the operation of the statute. 
     
      
    73 In R v Iannazzone [1983] 1 VR 649 the appellant argued that he was not guilty of murder on the ground that he honestly and reasonably believed that he was involved in a suicide pact and, relying upon a provision of the Victorian Crimes Act, argued that he should be guilty of manslaughter. Brooking J, during the course of rejecting the argument for a number of reasons, stated (at 655): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In the first place, the honest and reasonable belief doctrine requires belief in a state of facts which, if they existed, would make the defendant's act innocent. The meaning of innocent for this purpose has been the subject of considerable debate, but it is at all events made clear by the judgment of Fullagar, J in Bergin v Stack (1953) 88 CLR 248, at p 262, that a belief does not excuse if its truth would have meant, not that no offence was being committed, but that some other and different offence was being committed. Williams, ACJ, at p 253, and Taylor, J, at p 277, concurred in the judgment of Fullagar, J, and Webb, J, at pp 253-4, appears to have been of the same opinion as Fullagar, J on the point now under consideration. If the supposed belief in the present case had been true, the applicant would have been guilty of manslaughter; and this circumstance is itself enough to render the mistake doctrine inapplicable.” 
        
       
       
      This decision was applied by Hulme J in  
      R v Dib 
       [2002] NSWCCA 934; 134 A Crim R 329. 
       
      
    74 It is unnecessary for present purposes to consider this issue further or determine whether, on the basis of the passage in Jiminez quoted above, some limit should be put on the concept of “innocence” for the purpose of the defence; see also State Rail Authority of NSW v Hunter Water Board (1992) 28 NSWLR 721 at 722. It seems to me that in the present case at least the belief in the existence of facts should be that which, if true, would remove the accused from the ambit of the sexual assault offences contained in the Crimes Act. It could hardly be a defence to an offence of having intercourse with a child under 16 that the accused believed he was having non-consensual intercourse with a person over the age of 16. 
     
      
    75 In order for the defence to arise the accused must have formed a positive belief in the fact relied upon so that the accused must actually have attended to the fact: ignorance of, or inadvertence to, a fact are insufficient to give rise to the defence: Von Lieven v Stewart (1990) 21 NSWLR 52 at 66. In SRA v Hunter Water Board Gleeson CJ considered in depth the operation of the defence. His Honour wrote (at 724): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The word “mistake” is, itself, ambiguous. Suppose, for example, that a person permits someone who is in fact unlicensed to drive that person's car. The owner of the car may have a positive belief that the driver is licensed, or, having considered the matter in a general way, may be of the view that there is no particular reason known to the owner why the driver should not be permitted to drive, or might simply not trouble to think about the subject at all. In any of these cases, the owner might well say that he or she was surprised to learn subsequently that the driver was unlicensed. However, it is another thing to say that the owner had made a mistake about the matter. This is not an exhaustive list of the possible states of mind that might exist, but it is sufficient to illustrate the problem. It seems clear enough that, of the three states of mind just described, the first would, in the present context, be accepted as a mistake of fact, and the third would not. Whether the intermediate possibility would also be accepted might depend upon a closer examination of the particular case and a consideration of the legislative purpose in creating the offence.” 
         
        
       
      
    76 It should be noted that the defence only applies to a belief as to fact and does not arise from a mistaken belief about the law; Orstrowski v Palmer [2004] HCA 30; 78 ALJR 957, or a mistaken opinion which is a result of a judgment based upon facts: The Queen v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; (2005) 222 CLR 67. In Lavender a belief that “it was safe to proceed” was held not to be a belief of fact but an opinion; see at [59]. However, as has been noted, in Jiminez it was held to be a fact within the ambit of the defence that the driver honestly believed “it was safe to drive”. 
     
      
       
      The Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2003 
      
    77 It has to be said at the outset that I find it remarkable that a section that had existed from time immemorial should be repealed without a clear and uncompromising statement being made, either by the draftsperson or by the Minister responsible for the repeal, as to it’s intended effect. On the face of it a defence to a number of serious criminal offences, carrying substantial sentences of imprisonment as the maximum penalties, was being repealed and yet nothing is expressly stated to indicate any clear understanding by Parliament of the consequence of that repeal. And this in an area of the criminal law which is of continuing concern to the community and, hence, the Parliament. There is probably no part of the Crimes Act that has been subject to more change in recent years than the provisions dealing with sexual assaults against children, much of those changes intended to increase penalties for the offences and to make it easier for children to give evidence and, thereby, easier to secure convictions. 
     
      
    78 As Priestly JA said in Binskin v Watson (1990) 48 A Crim R 33 in another, but related, context and in the light of the lengthy ancestry of the Proudman v Dayman defence (at 43): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Only if Rip Van Winkle was the draftsman in the present case could he be unaware that the present argument was highly likely to come before a court in some prosecution.” 
         
        
       
      
    79 The subsection was repealed as part of a series of legislative changes to that part of the Crimes Act dealing with sexual assault offences against children effected by the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2003 (the Amending Act). The Long Title of the Act was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        An Act to amend the Crimes Act 1900 to provide for the equal treatment of sexual offences against males and females and to increase the penalties for sexual offences against children; and for other purposes. 
        
       
       
      Some at least of the stated purpose of the Act was achieved by the redrafting of the then existing s 66C by creating new offences with different penalties and in the repeal of the provisions containing homosexual offences. 
       
      
    80 Before the Amending Act came into operation the offences of having sexual intercourse with a child over the age of 14 years but under 16 years were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        66C Sexual intercourse—child between 10 and 16 
         
         
        (1) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of 10 years, and under the age of 16 years, shall be liable to imprisonment for 8 years. 
         
         
        (2) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who: 
         
          
          (a) is of or above the age of 10 years, and under the age of 16 years, and 
           
          (b) is (whether generally or at the time of the sexual intercourse only) under the authority of the person, 
          
         
         
         shall be liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 
        
       
      
    81 The Amending Act replaced these offences with the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        66C Sexual intercourse—child between 10 and 16 
         
         
        (1)  
        Child between 10 and 14 
         
        Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years is liable to imprisonment for 16 years. 
         
         
        (2)  
        Child between 10 and 14—aggravated offence 
         
        Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years in circumstances of aggravation is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 
         
         
        (3)  
        Child between 14 and 16 
         
        Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years is liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 
         
         
        (4)  
        Child between 14 and 16—aggravated offence 
         
        Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years in circumstances of aggravation is liable to imprisonment for 12 years. 
         
         
        (5) In this section, circumstances of aggravation means circumstances in which: 
         
        (a) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, the alleged offender maliciously inflicts actual bodily harm on the alleged victim or any other person who is present or nearby, or 
         
        (b) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, the alleged offender threatens to inflict actual bodily harm on the alleged victim or any other person who is present or nearby by means of an offensive weapon or instrument, or 
         
        (c) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons, or 
         
        (d) the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender, or 
         
        (e) the alleged victim has a serious physical disability, or 
         
        (f) the alleged victim has a serious intellectual disability, or 
         
        (g) the alleged offender took advantage of the alleged victim being under the influence of alcohol or a drug in order to commit the offence. 
        
       
      
    82 In addition to the general offences dealing with sexual assaults against children, before the commencement of the Amending Act, the Crimes Act contained an offence of homosexual intercourse with a child over 10 years but under 18 years; s 78K. There was also an offence of homosexual intercourse by a teacher: s 78O, and an offence of gross indecency: s 78Q. In respect of those offences s 78R provided that consent was no defence. There was no provision in relation to homosexual offences such as was found in s 77(2) providing a defence based upon mistake of age. However in Chard v Wallis (1988) 12 NSWLR 453 Roden J held that the common law defence of reasonable mistake of age applied to an offence of gross indecency. I shall return to this decision later. These provisions were repealed by the Amending Act and not replaced. 
     
      
    83 Therefore, before the commencement of the Amending Act, a male who sexually assaulted a male under the age 16 could have been charged with an offence under the general child sexual assault provisions or with the relevant homosexual offence. In both cases consent was no defence. There was no statutory defence available, as s 77(2) did not apply where both the complainant and the accused were male. It is inconceivable in my opinion that by preventing the s77(2) defence from applying to offences of child sexual assault where both the complainant and accused were male, that Parliament could have intended that the common law defence would apply instead having regard to the less stringent requirements of the common law defence and the difference in the onus of proof between the two defences. However, the common law defence had been applied at least to an offence of gross indecency. A male who sexually assaults a male over the age of 16 but under the age of 18, could have been charged with the relevant homosexual offence. Consent was no defence but the common law defence of mistake of age may have applied. 
     
      
    84 In summary the effect of the changes wrought by the Amending Act were: (1) there was no longer any difference in the age of consent between males and females, the age of consent in both cases being 16 years; (2) the same offences applied to a sexual assault of a child under 16 years regardless of the nature of the sexual act or the gender of the victim; (3) consent was no defence to an offence against a child under 16; (4) there was no longer any statutory defence of mistake of age in relation to offences where the victim was between the age of 14 and 16; (5) the penalties for offences of having intercourse with a child between the age of 10 and 16 were increased; and (6) the number of aggravating circumstances relevant to offences of having sexual intercourse with a child over the age of 10 but under the age of 16 were increased. 
     
      
    85 The question raised on this appeal is the effect of the repeal of s 77(2) in light of the other consequences brought about by the provisions of the Amending Act and in particular the new offences created under s 66C of having intercourse with a child between the age of 14 and 16. The Crown contends that there is no longer any defence based upon mistake of age of the complainant so that the offences in s 66C are offences of absolute liability, so far as the age of the child is concerned. The appellant contends that the offences under s 66C are offences of strict liability so far as the age of the child is concerned, so that the Proudman v Dayman defence applies in respect of an honest and reasonable mistake of age. 
     
      
    86 Because there is no clear statement of Parliament’s intention as to the effect of the repeal of s 77(2) it is necessary to see whether that intention can be inferred or construed from what was said in relation to the purpose of the Amending Act and the changes it made to the provisions of the Crimes Act relating to sexual assaults against children. Because there is a presumption in favour of mens rea applying to a newly created offence, any inference to the contrary must be clear and compelling. However such an inference can arise from a consideration of the provisions creating the offence in the context of the legislative history of such provisions and in light of the legislative scheme in which the new provisions are to reside. 
     
      
    87 In B (a minor) v Director of Public Prosecutions [2000] 1 All ER 833 and R v K [2001] 3 All ER 897 the House of Lords considered the relevant principles of statutory construction in relation to specific child sexual assault offences and determined that no inference contrary to the presumption of full mens rea could be discerned from the history and context of the provisions. I shall return to consider those decisions later in this judgment. 
     
      
       
      Historical background 
      
    88 In Lavender at [41] the Justices in the joint judgment pointed out the significance of considering the history of legislation in attempting to construe the intention of parliament and the effect to be given to statutory provisions. 
     
      
    89 Kirby P in Hickling v Laneyrie (1991) 21 NSWLR 730 at 736 listed a number of aids to the construction of the statute then before the Court, two of which were: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “3. Where, as in the present case, the legislation has been amended over time, it is relevant to derive the legislative purpose of the current provision by comparing it with its predecessors. From the course of amendments it may be possible the more readily to derive the policy which lies behind the provision in order to ascertain whether, even a strong presumption is rebutted. The permissibility of examining legislative history for this purpose is not in doubt: see  
        Mathieson v Burton 
         (1971) 124 CLR 1 at 14 per Windeyer J; see also  
        O'Grady v Northern Queensland Co Ltd 
         (1990) 169 CLR 356 at 365f per Brennan J; and 
         
         
        4. The foregoing rule must not permit distortion of the task of ascertaining Parliament's purpose from the language of legislation. It is an aid to the achievement of that purpose. Care must be taken in the use of such tools of construction so as not to stray from the language used by Parliament, whether by the use of legislative history or extrinsic materials such as Second Reading Speeches or antecedent reports. The dangers of doing this have been repeated in many decisions: see, eg,  
        Regional Director of Education,Metropolitan East, Department of Education NSW v International Grammar School Sydney Ltd 
         (1986) 7 NSWLR 302 at 308;  
        Black-Clawson International Ltd v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg AG 
         [1975] AC 591 at 613 (HL); 
        Yuill v Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales 
         (1990) 20 NSWLR 386;  
        Gibbs v State of New South Wales 
         (1990) 21 NSWLR 416. If the words are plain, the duty of the court is to give effect to them: see  
        Re Bolton; Ex parte Beane 
         (1987) 162 CLR 514 at 518.” 
         
        
       
      
    90 It is unnecessary in the present case to delve into history further than the enactment of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1883 (“the 1883 Act”). The circumstances in which that Act came into being are described in Lavender at [42] where reference is made to the significance of the Criminal Law Manual (“the Manual”), a commentary on the 1883 Act by Sir Alfred Stephen and Alexander Oliver, the parliamentary draftsman. The 1883 Act was in effect a response to six Imperial Statutes passed in 1861, one of which was concerned with “Offences against the Person”. 
     
      
       
      The 1883 Act 
      
    91 Part 1 of the 1883 Act was concerned with offences against the person. It included a series of offences under the heading “Rape and Similar Crimes”. Section 41 dealt with “carnally assaulting or knowing girl under ten”. Section 42 dealt with “carnally knowing girl between 10 and 14”. It was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Whosoever unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of ten years, and under the age of fourteen years, shall be liable to penal servitude for ten years - and whosoever assaults with intent unlawfully and carnally to know any such girl, or attempts to have such knowledge, shall be liable to penal servitude for five years - And the consent of the girl shall be no defence to any charge under this or the preceding section.” 
        
       
      
    92 The commentary in the Manual states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In the Bill submitted to Parliament, the words were ‘whosoever carnally knows any girl of or above the age of ten years, and under the age of twelve years,’ &c. The latter age was inserted, because of its being by law that at which a girl could consent to marriage. In the course of the passage of the Bill, the word ‘fourteen’ was substituted for ‘twelve’ - and the words ‘unlawfully and’ were inserted, as they now appear.” 
        
       
       
      Also see G D Woods  
      A History of Criminal Law in New South Wales 
       (2002) p348 as to the increase of the age of consent from 12 to 14 years. 
       
      
    93 Section 61 provided that carnal knowledge shall be “deemed upon proof of penetration”. Homosexual offences were contained in section 59, being “the abominable crime of buggery” with man or beast, and s 60, being an attempt to commit an offence in s 59. Section 60 also provided: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “….And whosoever commits an indecent assault upon a male person, of whatever age, with or without consent of such person shall be liable penal servitude for the like term.” 
        
       
      
    94 There was in s 369 an alternative verdict provision. The commentary in the Manual described it as “wholly new”. This section permitted a jury on a charge of rape, 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…where it appears that the female was a girl under the age of fourteen years but above ten years – and the jury are satisfied that the accused had carnal knowledge of her, but with her consent..” 
        
       
       
      to acquit the accused of rape but find him guilty of carnal knowledge. There was also an alternative verdict, where on a charge of carnal knowledge of a child under ten, it appeared that the child was over that age but under 14. 
       
      
    95 It should be noted that in the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 (UK) in relation to an offence of having carnal knowledge with a girl of, or above, the age of thirteen but under the age of 16, there was a proviso that it would be a defence to the section if the accused “had with reasonable cause to believe that the girl was above the age of 16”. 
     
      
       
       The Crimes Act 
      
    96 In 1900 the Crimes Act was passed. “Rape and similar offences” were contained in sections 66 to 78. Section 67 made it an offence to have carnal knowledge of a girl under 10 years. Section 71 provided for the offence of carnal knowledge of a girl of or above the age of 10 years but under the age of 14. Section 76 stated that consent was no defence. Otherwise the provisions were very much those that had been in the 1883 Act. Significantly there was no defence by way of mistake of age as found in the UK legislation at that time. 
     
      
    97 In 1910 the Crimes Act was amended by the Crimes (Girls’ Protection) Act 1910. The Long Title of this Act was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “An Act to extend to girls of and above the ages of fourteen and sixteen years respectively, and under the ages of sixteen and seventeen years respectively, the protection given to girls under the ages of fourteen and sixteen respectively, by certain provisions of the criminal law relating to offences against the person; to bring stepfathers within certain of those provisions; to enable certain of those offences to be dealt with in the summary way; to exclude girls under the age of eighteen years from brothels; and to amend the Crimes Act, 1900.” 
        
       
      
    98 The effect of this Act was to increase the age of consent from 14 to 16 years by amending the carnal knowledge provisions. More significantly a defence was provided in respect of ss 71, 72, and 77 where: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…the girl in question was over the age of 14 years, if it shall be made to appear to the court or jury before whom the charge is brought that the girl was at the time of the offence a common prostitute, or an associate of common prostitutes, or that the person so charged had reasonable cause to believe that she was of or above the age of 16 years.” 
         
        
       
       
      Colonel Onslow, the Member for Waverly, in introducing the bill into the Assembly said ( 
      Hansard 
       27 July 1909, p 780): 
       
        
         
        “I think that the present law does not afford protection to the personal purity of young girls, and therefore I am doing what I can in furtherance of this bill, which has been sent down from the Council to this House. The principle underlying the principal Act is that a girl under the age of 14 is incapable of judging the results of a certain act, and therefore it is made criminal to take advantage of her ignorance. The age at which she is supposed to become capable of judging the results of that act is, under the present law, 14 but I submit that girls under 16 are at least as incapable of judging the effects of that act as girls under 14 are, and therefore entitled to, and should have similar, protection from the law of this country.” 
        
       
      
    99 The statutory defence applied to the offences of carnal knowledge of a girl between 10 and 14, an attempt to commit that offence, and indecent assault of a girl under 16 with or without her consent. 
     
      
    100 Act 21 of 1911 was the Crimes (Girls’ Protection) Act 1911. This Act inserted into the defence in s 71, after the words “over the age of 14 years”, the following words “and consented to the commission of the offence”. Thus a reasonable belief that the child was over the age of 16 was no longer a sufficient defence. It also had to be shown that the child consented to the intercourse. 
     
      
    101 Act 10 of 1924, the Crimes (Amendment) Act, amended the sexual offences by redrafting the offences of carnal knowledge. Section 71 was amended so that it read: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Whosoever unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of ten years, and under the age of sixteen years, shall be liable to penal servitude for 10 years.” 
         
        
       
       
      A new s 77 was enacted which was relevantly as follows: 
       
        
         
        “The consent of the…. girl… shall be no defence to any charge under section…. seventy-one of this Act: 
         
         
        Provided that it shall be a sufficient defence to any charge which renders a person liable to be found guilty of an offence under section seventy-one of this Act… if it be made to appear to the court or jury before whom the charges brought: 
         
         
        (a) that the girl was over the age of fourteen years at the time of the alleged offence; and 
         
         
        (b) that she consented to the commission of the offence; and 
         
         
        (c) either:- 
         
         
         i. that she was at the said time a common prostitute or associate of common prostitutes; or 
         
         
         ii. that the person so charged had at the said time reasonable cause to believe, and in fact believe, that she was of or above the age of sixteen years.” 
        
       
      
    102 In 1981 there was a major reform of sexual offences contained in the Crimes Act but those reforms did not impact upon the provisions dealing with sexual offences against children. In that regard the law, as it was after the 1924 Amending Act, continued to apply. 
     
      
    103 In 1985 there was a significant reform to the child sexual assault offences effected by the Crimes (Child Assault) Amendment Act 1985. This was the principal Act in a package of cognate legislation relating to evidentiary provisions, a diversionary treatment scheme, and increased reporting obligations of sexual assaults upon children. The changes to the Crimes Act included: restructuring the offences relating to child sexual assault generally; abolishing the concept of carnal knowledge and widening the nature of sexual assault; the offences were made gender neutral; the offences were categorised according to age; and the penalties for the offences were revised. These reforms, however, did not impact upon the offences relating to homosexual intercourse. 
     
      
    104 As part of these reforms section 77 was redrafted into the form it was at the time of its repeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (2) It shall be a sufficient defence to a charge which renders a person liable to be found guilty of an offence under section 61E (1A), (2) or (2A), 61N, 61O, 66C, 66D, 71, 72 or 76A or, if the child to whom the charge relates was under the age of 16 years at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed, to a charge under section 61E (1), 61L, 61M (1) or 76 if the person charged and the child to whom the charge relates are not both male and it is made to appear to the court or to the jury before whom the charge is brought that: 
         
        (a) the child to whom the charge relates was over the age of 14 years at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed, 
         
        (b) the child to whom the charge relates consented to the commission of the offence, and 
         
        (c) the person so charged had, at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed, reasonable cause to believe, and did in fact believe, that the child to whom the charge relates was of or above the age of 16 years. 
         
        
       
      
    105 So at the time of the repeal of s 77(2) the situation was that offences of having sexual intercourse with a child under 14 years were treated as absolute offences, so far as the age of the child was concerned: the Crown did not have to prove that the accused knew of the age of the child and there was no statutory defence as to mistake of age. However, where the offence was having intercourse with a child between the ages of 14 and 16, the Crown did not have to prove that the accused knew the age of the child but there was a statutory defence available but only where: the child was in fact over 14; was apparently consenting; and the accused had a reasonable belief that the child was over the age of 16 years. Such a defence was normally conducted on the basis that the accused had to prove on the balance of probabilities that the child consented and that he had a reasonable belief that the child was over the age of 16 years. 
     
      
    106 At the time of its repeal the statutory defence under s 77(2) applied to the following offences: s 61L, indecent assault of child under 16; s 61M(1), an aggravated indecent assault with a child under 16; s 61N(1), an act of indecency with a child under the age of 16; 61(O), an aggravated indecent assault with a child under 16 years; 66C, sexual assault of a child between 14 and 16; and 66D, attempted sexual assault with a child between 14 and 16. Although the section referred to offences under ss 61E, 71, 72, 76 and 76A, those offences had by this time been repealed. 
     
      
       
       
      Homosexual offences 
      
    107 In respect of offences dealing exclusively with sexual activity between males, there was at the time of the introduction of the Amending Act the following offences: 78K, homosexual intercourse with male between 10 and 18; 78L, attempt homosexual intercourse with male 10 to 18; 78N, homosexual intercourse by teacher; 78O, attempt homosexual intercourse by teacher; 78Q, act of gross indecency. Section 78G defined “homosexual intercourse” for these offences and 78R provided that consent was no defence. There was no statutory defence. 
     
      
    108 However since the reform of the child sexual offences in 1986, those offences were gender neutral and offences by a male on a male child under 16 could be, and generally were, prosecuted under those sections. 
     
      
    109 As has been noted earlier, in 1988 Roden J held in Chard v Wallis that, in relation to the offence under s 78Q, gross indecency, there was a defence arising from a reasonable mistake of age. Before his Honour the Crown argued that the offence was one of absolute liability, so far as the age of the complainant was concerned, basing its submission largely upon R v Prince (1875) LR 2, CCR 154. The appellant argued that the Proudman v Dayman defence applied. In holding for the existence of the defence, Roden J stated at 455: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “To those brought up under the Common Law, there is something repugnant about the notion that a person can be guilty of a serious criminal offence by accident. Over the years, that has been reflected in a number of landmark decisions on the concepts of mens rea and the onus and standard of proof. Prominent among them, and each containing a major statement of principle, are R v Tolson (1889) 23 QBD 168; Woolmington v Director of Public Prosecutions [1935] AC 462; “The Australian Line” including Maher v Musson (1934) 52 CLR 100 and Proudman v Dayman (1941) 67 CLR 536; Iannella v French (1968) 119 CLR 84; and more recently Director of Public Prosecutions v Morgan [1976] AC 182, and He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523. 
         
         
        Between them, those decisions have reaffirmed fundamental rules as to onus and standard of proof and the general need to establish guilty intention; and have introduced, confirmed and widened the operation of the defence of mistaken belief on reasonable grounds for those offences in respect of which there is no general mens rea requirement.” 
         
        
       
      
    110 After referring to various statements in He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1984) 157 CLR 523, Roden J wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The impact of He Kaw Teh upon another statutory offence was recently considered in the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Wampfler (1987) 11 NSWLR 541. Street CJ there said (at 545-546):  
         
          
          “He Kaw Teh is authority for the proposition that for the purpose of considering criminal intent, statutory offences fall into three categories: 
           
           
          (1) Those in which there is an original obligation on the prosecution to prove mens rea;  
           
           
          (2) Those in which mens rea will be presumed to be present unless and until material is advanced by the defence of the existence of honest and reasonable belief that the conduct in question is not criminal in which case the prosecution must undertake the burden of negativing such belief beyond reasonable doubt; 
           
           
          (3) Those in which mens rea plays no part and guilt is established by proof of the objective ingredients of the offence.” 
          
         
         
        (Glanville Williams might describe those three categories as offences of full mens rea, half mens rea, and strict or absolute liability, respectively.) 
         
         
        It is not only offences which have to be fitted into one or other of those categories, but different ingredients of the same offence may belong to different categories. For example, that for which the plaintiff contends in these proceedings, would make the “inciting” element of this offence one of full mens rea, and the age element one of half mens rea. On the first defendant's argument, the incitement element would be of full mens rea, and the age element of no mens rea, that is, a matter of strict or absolute liability.” 
         
        
       
      
    111 Roden J, in effect, refused to apply R v Prince. He looked to the intention of the bill relating to the enactment of the most recent homosexual offences and stated (at 459): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The fact that “the principle inherent in the Bill” was the decriminalisation of sexual activity between consenting males, also has significance when assessing the degree of mens rea which is attracted by provisions such as s 78 
        Q 
        (2). The act which the plaintiff was charged with inciting, was an act of homosexual intercourse. Had it not been for the age of the complainant, that would have been a lawful act, in consequence of the 1984 legislation. If the plaintiff believed that he was dealing with a person over age, and was correct, then nothing he was doing or intending or inciting was, so far as the law is concerned, culpable. His position may be contrasted with that of a person charged with an aggravated assault, where the intent to commit the common assault can provide sufficient mens rea to make him liable for an unintended consequence; or that of a person convicted of sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of sixteen, where a mistaken belief as to the age might be of no assistance to him, as the intent to have sexual intercourse without consent provides the necessary mens rea.” 
         
        
       
      
    112 A little later he wrote (at 460): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The true position, I believe, is that the greater the seriousness and criminality of the offence, the greater the need to establish an intention to commit it. On principle, it could be argued that the offence created by s 78 
        Q 
        (2), especially within the context of the “decriminalisation” of homosexual acts between consenting adults, requires full mens rea, and that a successful prosecution requires proof of knowledge of the complainant's age. The argument was not taken as far as that before me, and I express no opinion on it. In the absence of more direct authority than has been cited, however, I am certainly not prepared to rule that even a reasonably founded mistaken belief as to age cannot exculpate.” 
         
        
       
      
    113 As I have noted, in the raft of amendments made to child sexual assault offences in 1986, s 77(2) was amended to delete references to words with the female gender, such as “girl”, because the child sexual assault offences had been made gender neutral. However, the words “if the person charged and the child to whom the charge relates are not both male” were inserted before the words “and it is made to appear to the court and jury……..”. The apparent consequence of the decision in Chard v Wallis was that, if the accused was charged with an act of gross indecency with a child under 16 under the homosexual offences, a defence arose under Proudman v Dayman. But if he were charged with an offence under the sexual assault provisions, which would cover exactly the same conduct, there was no defence. This was apparently not a matter considered by Roden J. 
     
      
       
      The repeal of s 77(2) 
      
    114 It has already been noted that at the time of the introduction of the Amending Act nothing was explicitly stated to explain what Parliament intended to be the effect of the repeal of s 77(2) so far as proof of the child sexual assault offences, either new or existing, was concerned. However, this is not to suggest that Parliament was not aware that it was repealing an existing defence. The Explanatory Memorandum notes: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The Bill also removes the current statutory defence of a person who has consensual sexual intercourse with a child under 16 years of age if the child was over 14 years of age and appeared to be over 16 years of age……..” 
        
       
      
    115 The second reading speech also includes reference to the fact that the defence was being repealed. The Attorney General said, Hansard 7 May 2003 p 374: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In proposing a uniform age of consent in New South Wales the bill employs further strict safeguards to protect children from exploitation by sexual predators. The sexual exploitation of our children is critical conduct of the most heinous and abhorrent kind and must be deplored by the Legislature through the imposition of heavy deterrent penalties. The bill therefore increases penalties for sexual offences upon children under the age of 16 years. The bill eliminates the defence currently available to consensual sexual activity with young people aged between 14 and 16 years, formerly known as carnal knowledge. The Bill removes the expressed statutory defence presently provided in section 77(2) of the Crimes Act that the person charged had reasonable cause to believe, and did in fact believe, that the child was of or above the age of 16 years. As a consequence, it will no longer be possible to argue that a uniform age of consent of 16 years creates effective age of consent of 14 years.” 
        
       
      
    116 After debate upon the bill, the Attorney General stated, Hansard, 21 May 2003, p 898: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “There can be no rational objection to an equal age of consent provided that adequate safeguards are put in place to protect young people against sexual exploitation. 
         
         
        Equalising the age of consent to 16 is just one of the many objectives of the Bill. The safeguards now include the removal of the express defence of carnal knowledge based on reasonable mistake of age, establishment of new aggravated child sexual assault offences and the rationalisation of offences to bring greater rigour and consistency to penalties involving child sexual assault.” 
        
       
       
      The effect of the repeal 
      
    117 Since He Kaw Teh there can be no doubt that a statutory offence should be read as requiring mens rea unless there is a clear legislative intention that it should be otherwise. As Brennan J said in He Kaw Teh (at 567): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “… It requires clear language before it can be said that a statute provides for a person to do or to abstain from doing something at his peril and to make him criminally liable if his conduct turns out to be prohibited because of circumstances that that person did not know.” 
         
        
       
       
      In the same case Gibbs CJ stated (at 532): 
       
        
         
        ""There has developed a principle that an honest and reasonable mistake of fact will be a ground of its core patient in cases in which actual knowledge is not required as an element of the offence.” 
        
       
       
      And later (at 533): 
       
        
         
        “…….. a middle course, between imposing absolute liability and requiring proof of guilty knowledge or intention, is to hold that an accused will not be guilty if he acted under an honest and reasonable mistake as to the existence of facts, which if true, would have made his Act innocent.” 
        
       
      
    118 There seems to be no point in extending this judgment by reference to decisions stressing the fundamental principles in the construction of statutory offences since Proudman v Dayman or either before or after He Kaw Teh. Anything I say about the construction of the provisions creating sexual assault offences in the Crimes Act accepts and attempts to apply these principles.  
     
      
    119 It is clear that there were new offences created by the Amending Act to replace the repealed s 66C offences and the repealed homosexual offences. It was obviously the intention of the Parliament to finally do away with offences that resulted in discrimination because of the sex of the participants. The appellant argues that common law principles should apply to the construction of the new offences. However, he does not argue that Parliament should be taken as having intended that full mens rea applied to the new offences. It has not been suggested that the prosecution has to prove that the accused knew that the child was under the proscribed age. 
     
      
    120 The appellant concentrated only on the new s 66C(3) offence in making submissions as to the consequence of the repeal of s 77(2). This is not surprising in light of the fact that this was the offence for which the appellant was convicted. But it seems to me that a consideration of what Parliament intended should be the effect of the repeal of s 77(2) and the creation of the new offences cannot be carried out in a vacuum. That is why I have spent so much of this judgment considering the history of these provisions. 
     
      
    121 In my opinion it is also necessary to consider what would be the consequences of interpreting the new offences as giving rise to the common law defence, as the appellant suggests, in the context of the other offences in the Crimes Act that remained unchanged by the Amending Act. The new offences were created with the intention that they would be inserted into an existing scheme of provisions dealing generally with sexual assault offences against children. It can be assumed that Parliament intended that a consistent approach should apply across the offence-creating provisions once the amendments came into operation. It should not be overlooked that some of the offences to which s 77(2) applied before its repeal remained in the same form as they did before its repeal. Some of those offences had been present in the Crimes Act in one form or another since at least 1981. It seems to me that one of the legitimate aids in construing the new offences is to have regard to them in the context of the Act as a whole: He Kaw Teh per Gibbs CJ at 529. 
     
      
    122 Section 61N, an act of indecency with a child under 16, existed in the Act before the repeal of s 77(2) and remained after its repeal in the same form. Yet s 77(2) applied to that offence. What was the effect of the repeal of the statutory defence on that offence? I do not understand that the common law would thereafter apply, in circumstances where it had not previously applied to any of the manifestations of the offence since it was first enacted. Dixon J in Proudman v Dayman referred to the presumption of the existence of the defence “to a statutory offence newly created”. Can it really be contemplated that Parliament intended that, with the repeal of the statutory defence, a less onerous common law defence would apply? The consequence of the application of the common law defence would be to cast the onus onto the prosecution to prove that the accused had no reasonable belief that the complainant was over the age of 16 once that defence was raised. But under the repealed statutory defence the accused effectively had the onus of proving that belief as well as the consent of the complainant. A similar situation pertains to ss 61(O)(1) and (2). 
     
      
    123 There were two offences to which the statutory defence applied but only where the complainant was a child under the age of 16 years. These were sections 61L and 61M(1). Those sections were unchanged by the Amending Act. What was the effect of the repeal of s 77(2) on those offences? There is no element of those offences that involves the age of the complainant. However, if the complainant is under the age of 16, consent is not a defence: s 77(1). Does a Proudman v Dayman defence arise, where the accused believes that the complainant is aged 16 and consenting, even though such a defence has never applied to those offences in the past? In my opinion it cannot. I do not understand that the common law defence can be activated simply as a result of some legislative amendment not touching the actual elements of the offence so as to create a new offence. 
     
      
    124 It follows that in my opinion the repeal of s 77(2) did not activate the common law defence so that it applied to offences otherwise unaffected by the provisions of the Amending Act. Therefore, to find that the common law defence now arises in respect of the newly created offences in s 66C would result in a significant inconsistency between those offences and the offences that remained unchanged in the Act after the repeal of s 77(2). Yet frequently different types of offences are alleged involving the same complainant in the one indictment either as additional charges or alternative charges. It would not be at all surprising to find an offence under s 66C(3) on the same indictment as an offence under s 61N arising from the same facts. It would be confusing, to say the least, for defences to come and go depending upon what offence the jury was considering, notwithstanding that the offences all arose in the very same factual matrix and that the accused’s state of mind was identical for each offence. I find it impossible to see how such a situation could be consistent with any legitimate policy in relation to the protection of children under the age of consent. 
     
      
    125 But even if the new offences are considered in isolation, in my opinion it can only be concluded that Parliament did not intend that there should be a defence of mistaken belief of age. Take for example the new s 66C(1) offence, having sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14. There can be no doubt that ever since at least 1921 the offence of having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 14 was one of absolute liability, so far as the age of the child was concerned. Mistake of age has never been a defence. But does the common law apply to the new offence so that a reasonable belief that the child was over 16 would operate? True it is that a Proudman v Dayman defence does not apply merely because the accused thought that the child was over 14. Such a belief would not make the accused’s conduct innocent because he would be committing an offence under s 66C(3). But what if he honestly believed the child was aged over 16? I am not prepared to say that such a defence is so unlikely that it is of only theoretical significance. In any event, merely because such a defence might be improbable, it does not follow that it has no application. Clearly Parliament could not have intended that there be such a defence available to the new offence. Such a result would be completely inconsistent with the purpose of the Amending Act and the history of such an offence. 
     
      
    126 But anomalies arise even when the offence under s 66C(3), the offence of which the appellant was convicted, is considered with the application of the common law defence. In order for the common law defence to arise, the accused must reasonably believe in facts that, if true, would cause his conduct to fall outside the statute. Although the concentration in the submissions has been on that part of the defence based upon a reasonable mistake of age, that fact alone would not avail the accused. This is because the accused would still be exposed to liability for an offence of sexual assault under s 61I unless he reasonably believed that the complainant was consenting. He cannot escape liability under s 66C(3) if he knew that he was having non-consensual intercourse but with a person he thought was over the age of 16. 
     
      
    127 Therefore the common law defence would only apply if the accused reasonably believed that he was having consensual sexual intercourse with a person of or over the age of 16. If he raised that defence, the Crown would be required to disprove that he had such a belief. And yet consent is not an element of the offence: s 77(1). In effect the existence of such a defence would require the Crown to prove a sexual assault offence under s 61I, that is non-consensual intercourse. But under the statutory defence that was repealed the accused had to show that the complainant was in fact consenting. His belief about that matter was irrelevant. If the complainant was not in fact consenting, it did not matter whether he reasonably believed that she was. 
     
      
    128 To read this offence as involving a common law defence is to put at nothing the history of the legislation or the intention of Parliament in enacting the new offences and repealing the defence. Since 1911 the accused has had to prove that the child was consenting or no defence arose notwithstanding his belief in the age of the child. It seems to me that the only reasonable conclusion is that Parliament intended that there should be no defence applicable to the new offences created by the Amending Act. Such a conclusion is consistent with the history of the offences, the scheme of the existing offences after the repeal of the statutory offence and the purpose of the Amending Act. 
     
      
    129 The appellant relies strongly upon the asserted inconsistencies between the homosexual offences and the general offences for the existence of the common law defence. Before the Amending Act there was no defence under s 77(2) where the accused and the complainant were both male. Yet there was a defence, according to Chard v Wallis, in respect of the homosexual offence of act of gross indecency. The appellant argues that such a defence would have also applied to the other homosexual offences before their repeal. Whether it did or not has never been considered. 
     
      
    130 It should be said that I doubt that Chard v Wallis was correctly decided in light of the history of homosexual offences where no defence was ever enacted despite a statutory defence existing from a very early stage in the history of the legislation for offences against female children. Although the decision was cited with approval in Jiminez, that was only in reference to a statement as to the onus of proof; see at 582 footnote 35. As I have noted already, at the time of that decision the operation of s 77(2) was excluded for offences where both the victim and offender were males. That was a relatively recent amendment, given the history of the provisions, when Chard v Wallis was decided. With respect, I find it difficult to see why the existence of that provision did not indicate a clear contrary intention on the part of Parliament that the common law defence should not apply to homosexual offences. However I accept that the decision has stood for some years and Parliament did nothing to overcome it. 
     
      
    131 It is argued by the appellant that, as there was, at the time of the repeal of s 77(2), a defence based upon honest and reasonable mistake of age for male homosexual offences, that defence would carry over to the new offence where both the victim and the complainant were male. That would then give rise to an unacceptable inconsistency, so it is argued, with offences where the participants were not both male. The inconsistency should be cured, the argument runs, by applying the same defence to the new offence regardless of the gender of the participants. I do not find that argument compelling. 
     
      
    132 Even if the common law defence did exist for offences of homosexual intercourse, it is unlikely in the extreme that it would practically have arisen in relation to complainants who were under the age of 16. The age of consent for those offences was 18 so that the accused would have to have a reasonable belief that the complainant was over that age. Although I accept, as I have done with females under the age of 14, that such a defence might arise, it does not seem to me that to deny the defence to cases involving children under 16 is so manifest of injustice, that it should dictate the whole policy to the construction of s 66C(3). The stronger policy consideration is that such a defence should not apply where the male was under 14. 
     
      
    133 In any event, it seems clear that, since the amendments in 1986 that made child sexual assault offences gender neutral, male homosexual offences against children under 16 have been almost invariably prosecuted under the child sexual assault offences and not under the homosexual offences. The statistics kept by the Judicial Commission show that between October 1999 and September 2006 there were only 49 convictions under s 78K of having homosexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 18 and only two cases of attempting that offence. In the same period there were only three convictions of gross indecency with a male under s 78Q, the offence with which Roden J was concerned. 
     
      
    134 An argument that has led at least one District Court Judge to favour the existence of the common law defence to the offence under s 66C has been to inquire whether Parliament intended to abolish the defence and then to find that it did not. In my view, with respect, that is asking the wrong question. It seems plain from the history of the legislation that the common law defence never existed for any of the child sexual assault offences and certainly not since 1910. It is impossible to conceive that the common law defence existed notwithstanding the statutory defence provided, when that defence was considerably more restricted than the common law defence and effectively placed the onus upon the accused to prove the facts that would bring him outside the statute. Therefore it is not appropriate, in my opinion, to inquire whether, in repealing the statutory defence, Parliament also intended that the common law defence should not operate. Parliament should be taken as having repealed the statutory defence in the belief that no other defence applied or would apply. 
     
      
    135 Insofar as s 31(1) of the Interpretation Act might be relevant to existing offences under the Act, there was in my view, no existing common law defence that survived the repeal of the statutory defence. It is not correct, with respect, to refer, as one District Court Judge has done, to the “’firmly entrenched’ common law defence”. It is the principle of statutory construction presuming the application of the common law defence that is entrenched. There was no common law defence lurking, as it were, to arise when unshackled by the legislature’s repeal of the statutory defence. 
     
      
    136 There has been a submission, based on a principle of statutory construction in relation to repealed legislation, that, once s 77(2) was repealed, it was as if it never existed and, therefore, the common law applied to the offences existing after the repeal. Whether or not such a principle can apply in general, it does not apply where the history of the legislation suggests otherwise: Hickling v Laneyrie, at 738. Here the common law defence never applied to sexual assault offences against children at least since 1911. The limited defence introduced in that year has existed in one form or another throughout the history of the Act for almost 100 years until s 77(2) was repealed. And yet it is argued that a more liberal defence has now arisen than the one that had been provided by Parliament and intentionally taken away. In my opinion that argument cannot be accepted. I would not construe any of the sexual assault offences as giving rise to the Proudman v Dayman defence. 
     
      
    137 The strongest argument to support the submission that Parliament should not be taken as having intended that the common law defence would not apply to an offence under s 66C(3) is what the appellant referred to as “the absurdly Draconian result” of the possibility of a person being convicted of such an offence who genuinely and reasonably mistakes the age of a consenting complainant. I feel the repugnance that Roden J expressed and that is found throughout the judgments in He Kaw Teh to a serious offence being committed by accident. The immediate reaction to the Crown submission is surprise, if not shock, at the suggestion that the Crimes Act can have what are in effect absolute liability offences carrying substantial gaol penalties. Of course that was always so with a child under 14 but there can be no denying that as the child becomes older the likelihood of an innocent mistake becomes more likely. I also accept that it is notoriously difficult to tell the age of person with such accuracy as an absolute offence would require, and it is not uncommon for children approaching the age of 16 to disguise or lie about their age in order to be treated more favourably as an adult. 
     
      
    138 The Crown submits that the fact of a person honestly mistaking the age of the child without any fault on his or her part can be taken into account on sentence even to the extent that, where there is no moral blame on the part of the offender, the charge could be dismissed without conviction: see Reg v Karaiskakis (1957) 74 WN (NSW) 457. But the offence is still an objectively serious one with a potential penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. The appellant points to the stigma and consequences that could follow a conviction regardless of the penalty imposed. 
     
      
    139 This is a powerful argument but I am compelled largely by the history of the provisions, the manifest inconsistencies that would arise if the common law defence applied to the offences under s 66C, and the clear policy of Parliament, to find that there was a legislative intent that such a defence would not apply to the new offences, or otherwise, once s 77(2) was repealed. I come to this conclusion bearing in mind the significance of finding against the presumption of mens rea for serious offences. As I have already noted, it is clear that the repeal of the statutory defence was not accidental but was done with a full awareness that a defence that had existed was no longer going to exist and that as a consequence it must make it more difficult for an accused to escape conviction. I cannot believe that Parliament intended the consequence that the repeal of the statutory defence would make it more difficult to secure a conviction. Admittedly the Parliament appears to have been concerned with sexual predators but its intention was obviously to toughen child sexual assault offences generally, both so far as conviction and penalty was concerned, as a consequence of effectively lowering the age of consent for males. 
     
      
    140 In Proudman v Dayman Dixon J indicated that, in determining whether the defence arose, the court is entitled to consider the subject matter of the legislation. In my opinion the purposive approach in construing offences of child sexual assault supports a finding that Parliament intended that no defence would apply in relation to sexual offences with children under 16 years. But I accept that of itself this consideration would not be sufficient to find in favour of absolute liability. 
     
      
    141 In the Attorney General’s second reading speech he said:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “The bill rationalises the age of consent in New South Wales to 16 years of age for all persons irrespective of gender or sexual orientation. The lower age limit is absolute – no specific statutory defence is provided for.” 
        
       
       
      The reference to the “ 
      lower age limit 
      ” is a reference to the reduction in the age of consent for males from 18 to 16. The reference to “ 
      absolute 
      ” can only mean that it was intended that there was to be no defence where the child is under that age. I do not take the reference to the absence of a statutory defence to suggest that the Attorney and Parliament believed that some other defence would apply: one that had never existed for child sexual offences in general and one that was considerably less onerous for an accused than the statutory defence that had been repealed. 
       
      
    142 Before concluding this part of the judgment some reference should be made to the relatively recent decisions of the House of Lords concerned with the interpretation of child sexual offences to which I made reference earlier. In B v DPP the Court was concerned with the construction of an offence of inciting a child under the age of 14 to commit an act of gross indecency. A 15 year old boy had repeatedly asked a 13 year old girl to perform oral sex on him. It was accepted that the boy honestly believed the child was over 14 years of age. It was held that Parliament had not expressly or sufficiently clearly by necessary implication shown an intention that full mens rea should not apply. Therefore, the appellant should have been acquitted of the offence unless the prosecution proved that he knew that the child was under the age of 14 years. 
     
      
    143 In that case the prosecution had argued that the offence was one of absolute liability so far as the age of the child was concerned relying upon the statutory context in light of decisions denying the common law defence to offences of sexual assault such as R v Prince, R v Forde [1923] 2 KB 400 and R v Maughan (1934) 24 Cr App R 130. That argument was rejected. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead stated (at 841): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “This is a formidable argument, but I cannot accept it. I leave on one side Mr O'Connor QC's sustained criticisms of the reasoning in R v Prince and R v Maughan. Where the Crown's argument breaks down is that the motley collection of offences, of diverse origins, gathered into the 1956 Act displays no satisfactorily clear or coherent pattern. If the interpretation of s 1 of the 1960 Act is to be gleaned from the contents of another statute, that other statute must give compelling guidance. The 1956 Act as a whole falls short of this standard. So do the two sections, ss 14 and 15, which were the genesis of s 1 of the 1960 Act.” 
         
        
       
      
    144 Similarly Lord Steyn could not find an intention that Parliament intended that there be no mens rea in relation to the offence under consideration from the context of other child sexual assault offences having regard to the history of the offences and their differing elements: see at 847 to 851. Lord Hutton also was unable to find, as a necessary implication from the context of the statutory scheme, that Parliament intended the new offence to be one of absolute liability. One of the reasons for this decision was that the various provisions “have not been drafted to give effect to a consistent scheme but are a collection of diverse provisions derived from a variety of sources……….”: at 855. 
     
      
    145 In R v K the House of Lords had cause to consider the mental element of an offence of indecently assaulting a girl under the age of 16 years under s 14 of the same Act considered in B v DPP. The question arose as to whether there was a defence based upon a belief that the girl, who was aged 14, was consenting and was over the age of 16. Again the members of the Court considered the context of the legislative provisions to determine whether any intention on the part of Parliament that the offence should be one where no mens rea applied in relation to the age of the child could be clearly ascertained. 
     
      
    146 Lord Bingham of Cornhill referred to the significance of the fact that the provisions of the Act under consideration were “not part of a single, cohesive legislative scheme” in determining that no such intention of Parliament could be ascertained: at [4] and [9]. The other Lords who agreed with Lord Bingham, likewise failed to find a coherent scheme in the legislation such that the intention of Parliament to displace the presumption of full mens rea could not be found. 
     
      
    147 It is clear in my opinion that the reasoning expressed by their Lordships in finding against the implication that Parliament intended to create an offence of absolute liability can be distinguished when considering the legislative context of the provisions under the Amending Act both before and after its commencement. The descriptions given to the provisions under consideration in those decisions could not be applied to the legislative scheme relating to child sexual assault in the Crimes Act at least since 1986. In the present case the history and context of the legislation provides a clear and unambiguous inference that Parliament intended that there be no defence available to the newly created offences by way of mistake of age. 
     
      
    148 In my opinion there is no common law defence based upon mistake of age for an offence under s 66C(3) or otherwise in child sexual assault offences. 
     
      
       
      Did the defence apply in any event? 
      
    149 The Crown has argued that, even were the Proudman v Dayman defence to apply to s 66C(3), it did not apply on the facts in the present case. I have already noted that the defence is not made out by ignorance or inadvertence of a fact. There must be an advertence to a positive finding made by the appellant about the relevant fact. The Crown’s contention is that the appellant could not assert that he did not have intercourse with the complainant yet also assert that, if he did, he was mistaken as to her age and the fact that she was not consenting. The Crown submitted that a “contingent defence” would be “offensive to basic principle”. That submission must be rejected. It would be no more offensive than a judge being required to leave the issue of self defence to the jury even though the accused was raising an alibi for the time of the offence: see Pemble  
     
      
    150 It cannot be doubted that, even if an accused does not give evidence, a fact can be proved in the Crown case. For example, in the appellant’s trial the assertion that he believed the complainant was over the age of 16 years arose in the record of interview tendered by the Crown. But it could arise in other ways, for example by a witness giving evidence of what the appellant had been told about the complainant’s age or what he had said about it at some relevant point of time. It is not unusual for a jury to infer a state of mind of an accused, such as a belief that an object was stolen on a charge of receiving, notwithstanding that there was no direct evidence of that belief and, even if the accused was denying being in possession of the object. It seems to me that whether there is evidence to raise the defence will depend upon the facts of the particular case. Generally a judge must leave a defence to the jury if there is evidence upon which a jury could reasonably find the defence established. That is so for other “defences” where the ultimate onus is upon the Crown. It arises in cases of self-defence and provocation and would arise in respect of a common law defence. 
     
      
    151 However having made that observation in answer to the Crown’s contention, it is unnecessary to go on to determine whether there was evidence to support the common law defence in the present case.  
     
      
    152 In my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
      
    153 It was accepted by the Crown that the Judge had failed to take into account the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act when sentencing the appellant. Unfortunately the Judge seems to have given no consideration at all to the fact that the appellant was a child at the time of the commission of the offence. Therefore, he did not consider whether the appellant should be dealt with at law or in accordance with the provisions of Division 4 of Part 3 of that Act, a fundamental issue where an offence is not “a serious children’s indictable offence” as this offence was not. Nor did he apparently take into account s 6 or any other provision of the Act relevant to sentencing an offender who was under the age of 18 at the time of the offence. Most significantly he failed to obtain a background report in accordance with s 25 of the Act. The sentence was invalid: R v Hoang [2003] NSWCCA 237. 
     
      
    154 It is regrettable that neither counsel brought this to the Judge’s attention. In particular the Crown bears the obligation of ensuring that a Judge is aware of the jurisdiction that is being exercised. It was a serious failure of the Crown’s duty to the court that it permitted the Judge to sentence without bringing his attention to the relevant legislation. 
     
      
    155 There is no option but to return the matter to the District Court for further determination. 
     
      
    156 I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed but the application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted, the appeal allowed and the sentence quashed. The matter is remitted to the District Court. 
     
      
    157 PRICE J: I agree with Howie J.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: In these unusual, and quite tragic, proceedings, the plaintiff claims against the defendant damages for severe personal injury he sustained on 17 March 2001. During the evening of that day the plaintiff fell from a very high tree that he had climbed, in an emotionally disturbed and possibly intoxicated state, and suffered injury to his spine that resulted in quadriplegia. The plaintiff alleges that his conduct in climbing the tree, and the dire consequences thereof, are attributable to the negligence of the defendant in the manner in which it had earlier afforded him medical (psychiatric) treatment. 
     
      
    2 The plaintiff is a young man, now 25 years of age. The defendant is a statutory corporation which administers public health services in and around the Blue Mountains of NSW, where the plaintiff was, in 2001, resident. The plaintiff’s claim can be outlined briefly. 
     
      
    3 In 2000-2001, when he was 18 and 19 years of age, the plaintiff was deeply troubled, even disturbed, exhibiting serious psychiatric and/or psychological symptoms. These included suicidal ideas. On 28 February 2001, after a suicide attempt, he was taken by a police officer to the Nepean Hospital (one of the facilities administered by the defendant). There he was examined and admitted as a voluntary patient to the psychiatric ward of the hospital, known as Pialla. On 6 March 2001 he was discharged. On the evening of 17 March 2001, after consuming a (disputed) quantity of alcohol, he climbed the tree in the backyard of his mother’s home in Glenbrook (in the Blue Mountains), and, subsequently, fell, suffering the injury I have mentioned.  
     
      
    4 It will, of course, be necessary to say a good deal more about the factual circumstances. The foregoing is a sufficient sketch for present purposes. 
     
      
    5 The plaintiff alleges that, in a number of respects, the defendant, through its employees, failed to discharge the duty of care it undoubtedly owed to him. The claim is governed by the provisions of the Civil Liability Act 2002. 
     
      
    6 The defendant denies that it was negligent; its denies that the plaintiff’s injuries are causally related to the treatment he received from it; and it invokes several provisions of the Civil Liability Act, specifically s 5O (concerning the standard of care in cases where the practice of a profession gives rise to the cause of action), s 43A (concerning liability for the negligent exercise of special statutory powers), ss 48-49 (concerning the effect of alcohol consumption on the part of the plaintiff on the award of damages). The defendant asserts that the plaintiff was intoxicated at the time he climbed the tree, and that this constituted a break in any chain of causation the plaintiff might otherwise be able to establish. Finally, it asserts that, if it is found to be liable as alleged on behalf of the plaintiff, the plaintiff was in part at least responsible for his own injury and that it is entitled to a reduction in any damages awarded by reason of his contributory negligence. 
     
      
    7 The parties have agreed on the quantification of damages should the plaintiff be entitled to a verdict. (Although it was not explicitly so stated, I assume that this means a verdict unaffected by a finding of contributory negligence.) This judgment, therefore, is concerned only with the issue of liability, and, should the plaintiff be successful, with the issue (and quantification) of contributory negligence. 
     
      
    8 The area of factual dispute between the parties is relatively narrow. The contest primarily concerns the correct application of well established principles of tort law, and the provisions of the Civil Liability Act, to largely unchallenged facts, and will be decided on the acceptance or otherwise of expert medical opinion, based upon interpretation of comprehensive medical records. There is, however, one factual matter that is seriously in dispute. That concerns the quantity of alcohol consumed by the plaintiff on the day and/or evening of his fall, and the extent to which he was affected thereby. 
     
      
    9 This is relevant both to the issue of causation, and also to the application of ss 49 and 50 of the Civil Liability Act. 
     
      
    10 I turn now to a more comprehensive account of the relevant facts and circumstances. 
     
      
    11 The plaintiff was born on 26 July 1981. He lived with his parents and brother Ben, three and a half years older, in the Blue Mountains. When he was quite young his parents separated. Apart from a brief period after their separation when he lived with relatives in Sydney, he has lived all his life in the Blue Mountains.  
     
      
    12 The plaintiff’s history of psychiatric disturbance began early, at the latest when he was in his mid-teens. He had a troubled childhood and adolescence, exhibiting symptoms of psychiatric or psychological disturbance at least from that time. This included a suicidal gesture at about the age of 15, although this does not appear to have translated into a real attempt on his own life. Another such gesture occurred in early 2000, when an apparently trivial incident at a party precipitated him into an angry confrontation, followed by violence, and finally by his threatening or attempting to jump out of a window (from which he was restrained). He was affected by alcohol at the time. 
     
      
    13 In 1996, before his fifteenth birthday, he was registered with the Western Area Mental Health Service (which I take to be the mental health branch of the forerunner of the present defendant, the Sydney West Area Health Service) and was referred to a psychiatrist who prescribed anti-depressant medication (which the plaintiff soon ceased taking). 
     
      
    14 By 2000 his behaviour was of increasing concern to his mother (to whom I will refer by the name she has subsequently adopted, Ms Linda Pike) and Mr David Pike (now the plaintiff’s stepfather). He expressed disgust at what he perceived as the untrustworthiness of others, corruption and “rottenness” in the world, and a desire (which he recognised was unrealistic) to kill everybody in the world except himself, and, as an alternative, to kill himself. He abandoned his bedroom to sleep on a sofa in the living room, because he “need[ed] to watch the front door”. He sometimes slept with a knife concealed in the sofa cushions, because “I feel safer that way”. He neglected his appearance and his hygiene and sometimes dressed in an outlandish, and often unclean, fashion. At an early age he became a regular and heavy consumer of alcohol. 
     
      
    15 These behaviours clearly demonstrate that his parents’ concern about his mental health were soundly based.  
     
      
    16 At some stage (which is not clear, but may have been late 2000 or early 2001, since it followed the break up of the plaintiff’s relationship with a girlfriend) Ms Pike became sufficiently concerned to contact what she called the “Mountains Access Team”. Whether this was administered by the defendant (or its forerunner) is not clear, although I am prepared to infer that it was. After the plaintiff had been assessed by that organisation, Ms Pike had a conversation with a counsellor whose response created some alarm in her. The counsellor said that the plaintiff needed immediate help, and hinted that he may have been dangerous and/or suicidal. 
     
      
    17 The events immediately giving rise to the present proceedings began in mid-February 2001. Ms Pike, concerned at the plaintiff’s mental state, made an appointment for him to see the Area Health Service, and emphasised to him the importance of keeping the appointment. The plaintiff’s response was vehemently hostile. On 16 February Mr Pike telephoned the Service to inform it of the plaintiff’s state of mind, as Mr Pike perceived it. At that point he considered the plaintiff to be suicidal. Mr Pike was, however, unable to make contact with any individual and left a message expressing his concerns. He received no response. 
     
      
    18 On the evening of 28 February the plaintiff was in Glenbrook Park and at the Glenbrook Railway Station in company with his brother Ben and a friend, Joel Watson, who was then about 15 years of age. He argued with Ben. He said that he wished to commit suicide by jumping under a train. He jumped over a fence and made his way down an embankment to the railway tracks. A train was approaching. He told Mr Watson that he was going to stand in front of it. Mr Watson seized the plaintiff and threw him off the tracks and narrowly avoided being hit by the train himself. The train driver stopped the train and called police. The plaintiff was taken to the Nepean Hospital where he was seen, firstly, by a Dr Kethes, a senior Resident Medical Officer in the Emergency Department. 
     
      
    19 Inter alia, Dr Kethes recorded the following (for convenience, throughout this judgment I will quote from the records as they have been translated from the shorthand and abbreviations used by the various reporters): 
     
      
       
        
        “Depressed for more than one year

        Impression: major depression with suicidal[ity]” 
        
       
      
    20 The plaintiff was then seen by a Mr Keevers, a registered nurse with the Mental Health Team. Mr Keevers relevantly recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        “History of depressed mood since at least July 2000. 
         
         
        Tonight argument with brother and subsequently tried to lay on railway tracks.” 
        
       
      
    21 Mr Keevers then recorded a history he obtained from Ms Pike (who attended the hospital on being notified of her son’s presence there), to the effect that the plaintiff had been depressed for some time, and exhibiting “paranoid” and vigilant behaviour, peculiar thinking (that the world is “corrupt and horrible”). 
     
      
    22 Recording what appear to be his own observations, Mr Keevers noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “Young man, dishevelled and dirty, co-operative, but frequently flippant, minimising situation. Still alcohol affected.

      Mr Keevers proposed discussion and further review by the psychiatric registrar and queried whether the plaintiff ought to be admitted. 
       
      
    23 The plaintiff was next assessed by Dr Panagiota Tsovolos, then a psychiatric registrar. This occurred some time before 4.30am, at which time Dr Tsovolos recorded her observations. She noted multiple stressors leading up to the suicide attempt that evening. The “multiple stressors” included “accommodation issues”, a break up of a relationship, and unemployment, the plaintiff having lost his job as a bartender two days previously. After recording what the plaintiff told her about the suicide attempt Dr Tsovolos wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “NOW feels ‘numb’ re suicide attempt. 
         
         
         “I don’t think I could do it again, but it might happen’ 
         
         
         “I might change my mind again’. 
         
         
        Depressive symptoms [which she itemised] 
         
         
        First suicide attempt at 14 years old as per tonight: train ‘but I missed the train … didn’t try again, I just went home and cried’. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Deliberate self-harm:

        punches walls 
         
         
        burns cigarettes on skin 
         
         
        stabs himself with pens 
         
         
        ‘and other things, I dunno’.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    24 Dr Tsovolos turned to “homicidal ideation”, quoting the plaintiff as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Better to end everyone else’s life not mine – I wish I could.” 
        
       
       
      She considered the themes to be consistent with depression and ruminating. As to suicidal ideation she quoted the plaintiff as saying: 
       
       
        
        “I just figure if I can’t have it my way, it’s easier to end it.” 
        
       
       
      She noted that the plaintiff did not then display suicidal ideation but quoted him as saying: 
       
       
        
        “But that could change.” 
        
       
      
    25 Dr Tsovolos then noted her plan for the plaintiff’s treatment in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Lengthy discussion with patient re admission. I feel patient will  
        not  
        benefit from admission as his behaviour and problems are  
        chronic  
        and not amendable to correction/reversing with a hospital admission. Needs  
        long term 
         treatment. 
         
         
        Patient though is manipulative and aware of the difficulty of his situation and requesting ‘a break for a couple of days or I don’t know what I’ll do’.” 
        
       
      
    26 She noted that she was unable to “collaborate” (sic) the history at that time with the plaintiff’s case manager who, she said, knew the plaintiff well. She noted that the plaintiff’s mother was “pushing for admission”. She then recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Patient to be admitted as  
        voluntary 
         patient to open ward onus is to be on patient to make adult and responsible decisions re his welfare and his future.” 
        
       
      ` 
       
      Thereupon the plaintiff was transferred to Pialla. The plaintiff remained as a voluntary inpatient in Pialla until he was discharged during the afternoon of 6 March.  
       
      
    27 The hospital’s progress notes are in evidence. They contain entries by various registered nurses, and by a Dr Morell (another psychiatric registrar) and Dr Charles Stones (then a consultant psychiatrist employed at Pialla). 
     
      
    28 Dr Morell saw the plaintiff on 1 March. Her recorded notes do not throw any further light on the issues. 
     
      
    29 At 11.30 on that day the plaintiff was seen by Ms Susanne Willmott, a registered nurse employed as a drug and alcohol counsellor. Ms Willmott made a lengthy note recording the history she obtained from the plaintiff but noted that the plaintiff refused her offer of community counselling, and of contact numbers to a drug and alcohol counselling service. She therefore decided that no further follow up was required unless requested by the plaintiff.  
     
      
    30 On 2 March Dr Stones saw the plaintiff. Dr Stones also recorded the discussion he had with the plaintiff and observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “No real sign of depressive illness.” 
        
       
       
      He then noted: 
       
       
        
        “Once he has more concrete plans for the immediate future he can go. Brief nurse manager. Follow up on discharge. No treatment.” 
        
       
      
    31 A nursing note at 3.00pm on 2 March described the plaintiff as: 
     
      
       
        
        “Settled and appropriate. Bright and reactive.” 
        
       
       
      and having been visited by friends. 
       
      
    32 The following day, 3 March, he was recorded as again having been settled and to have slept well throughout the night (although disturbed twice by a fellow patient); and, later, to have been settled and pleasant throughout the day, and interacting with others. 
     
      
    33 That the plaintiff was “settled” is a recurring theme of the nursing notes thereafter. 34 The notes of 4 March record a complaint by the plaintiff of another patient having awakened him during the night, standing over him, and touching his leg. The plaintiff therefore requested transfer to another room. (The other patient is said to have denied the conduct alleged.) 
     
      
    35 A “Team meeting” took place on 6 March. It is apparent that this was directed to consideration of the plaintiff’s discharge, and follow up care.  
     
      
    36 Later that day, on two occasions, the plaintiff could not be found. At 4.00pm, however, he was seen by Dr Morell who recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        “ feeling ‘better’ and happier, accepting of his breakup with girlfriend

         No medication indicated” 
        
       
      
    37 The plaintiff was critical of the care and treatment he was afforded in Pialla. He said that he made daily requests to see a doctor but was fobbed off by nursing staff. He said that he saw a doctor towards the end of his stay, just once.  
     
      
    38 In this respect the hospital notes demonstrate that the plaintiff’s recollection (perhaps not surprisingly) is faulty. He was seen by Dr Morrell on three occasions and Dr Stones on one, after his comprehensive assessment by Dr Tsovolos. The plaintiff also said that he made several requests for medication but was told this could not happen until he was seen by a doctor.  
     
      
    39 He said at this time he did not feel good and: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was feeling very depressed and lonely, scared, confused, frustrated, very frustrated and very angry.” 
        
       
       
      He complained that the routine in the institution provided little activity and that it was necessary that he entertain himself, although with little facilities for doing so. He said he spent his time walking around the hospital, and going into the nearest town.  
       
      
    40 He recounted his version of the incident in which he said he had been molested by another patient. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “After that I was stressing lots and trying to, yeah, think of – come up with some solution and I really didn’t want to go back to that room with that guy. And I thought that maybe if I had done something like if I break a window or if I, you know, I was thinking maybe hit the nurse in the thigh or something like that, just break something like a window or something like that, that they would put me in the lockup ward.” 
        
       
      
    41 He said that he came to the view that the hospital authorities were wasting his time and that there was no point in remaining. He said that, when they asked how he was, he told them: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I never felt better.” 
        
       
       
      That, he said, was not true. He said that he still felt the same about his life and did not want to live. 
       
      
    42 When the plaintiff was discharged from the hospital his mother was not advised, and he left alone, going first into Penrith, and then to Glenbrook. He went to a park for a time, where he encountered his brother, and went to his mother’s home about midnight.  
     
      
    43 Mr Pike also offered considerable criticism of the manner in which the plaintiff was treated at Pialla. He said that Ms Pike (to whom he was not then married) was telephoned on the evening of 28 February or the early morning of 1 March and told that the plaintiff had been found on the railway tracks and taken to the hospital. They went immediately to the hospital. Mr Pike described him as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, he was – he was fully dressed but in a very – but his clothing was torn and filthy. He was actually in bed although he was fully dressed. But he was quite – his mental – his state was quite incoherent. He kept muttering – he kept getting out of bed and muttering as he walked up and down the ward, ‘There just aren’t enough bullets. There just aren’t enough bullets’.” 
        
       
      
    44 He said that he and Ms Pike spoke to a number of medical practitioners, seeking to impress upon them that the plaintiff had a psychiatric history, had possibly made other recent suicide attempts or gestures, and that he had a record with the Area Health Service which, they suggested, ought to be consulted before a decision on his treatment was made. They made it clear that they considered the plaintiff to be psychiatrically ill and that they wished to have him admitted to the psychiatric ward for treatment. 
     
      
    45 The response to this, he said, was that the plaintiff would be assessed and a decision then made about whether or where he would be admitted. They were told that probably no decision would be made until much later on the morning of 1 March, and that they might as well go home and get some sleep. This they did. They telephoned the hospital later on that day and were told that, about 5.30am, the plaintiff had been admitted to Pialla. 
     
      
    46 Thereafter Mr and Ms Pike visited the plaintiff daily. Mr Pike said that the plaintiff complained that there was nothing to do, that he was not receiving treatment, that there were no programmes, that he was allowed to wander around the hospital at will, and that the staff told him that they did not care how he filled his day as long as he presented himself for roll call.  
     
      
    47 A particular complaint concerned one staff member. Mr Pike said that he and Ms Pike approached her and asked who was the plaintiff’s “assigned nurse”. She replied that she did not know, but then consulted the record and said (apparently in tones of some surprise): 
     
      
       
        
        “Oh, it’s me.” 
        
       
       
      This occurred on about 3 or 4 March.  
       
      
    48 Mr Pike said that while in Pialla the plaintiff was always very unkempt, badly dressed, dirty, uncared for, barefooted. He said that the plaintiff repeated his complaint of inadequate treatment and added that he had asked, on a daily basis, to see a doctor but that he had not done so except on the day of his admission. He also continued to repeat his theme concerning the corruption in the world. Mr Pike and the plaintiff’s mother continued to press the nursing staff for information and consultation. They expressed the view that the plaintiff was not receiving appropriate treatment. They were told to make an appointment to see a psychiatrist but when they telephoned in an attempt to do so the call was not returned. 
     
      
    49 Mr Pike said that in the early evening of 6 March he and Ms Pike travelled to the hospital in order to visit the plaintiff. It was then that they were told, for the first time, that he been discharged earlier in the day. He said he was told: 
     
      
       
        
        “… well, we asked him if he was suicidal today and he said no so we discharged him.” 
        
       
       
      Ms Pike gave a similar account. 
       
      
    50 Mr Pike said that when the plaintiff arrived at his mother’s home, at about midnight, on 6 March, he was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… in a highly agitated, furious state. He – was abusive, he appeared to be almost out of control … He punched the walls, he tried to run up the wall on one occasion. He snarled at Linda and at me with a devilish sort of face.” 
        
       
      
    51 He attacked them for having him incarcerated in Pialla where he was almost “raped”. The following morning, however, his agitation had subsided and he seemed “very flat and depressed”. He apologised for his conduct saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “I’m sorry but I was pushed beyond my limit” 
        
       
       
      but would not elaborate upon that statement. 
       
      
    52 Of his activity during the next few days, the plaintiff said that he kept to himself and tried to be by himself; he spent a lot of time sitting in his car in the garage. He said that his emotional outlook became worse as days went by.  
     
      
    53 Mr Pike was more expansive. He said that the plaintiff appeared to be “extremely disturbed” and very angry but on occasions uncommunicative. Again, Ms Pike gave a similar account. She said that the plaintiff arrived at her home with his brother, both intoxicated. Of the plaintiff she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… Tim was standing over me as I was sitting in my chair and Tim was frothing at the mouth, just, you know, ‘you put me in that mad house. I nearly got raped’.” 
        
       
       
      She said that she and Mr Pike “fled” to his home. 
       
      
    54 She described the plaintiff in the days following his discharge as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… worse after being in hospital than before … It was like walking on eggshells. He was very explosive, argumentative, he wanted to die. He was still talking about, ‘there’s not enough bullets to go around so there’s only one thing I can do’.” 
        
       
      
    55 The plaintiff said that he was visited by a member of the Mental Health Team once only. He had no recollection of the duration of the visit or the content of the conversation they had. Ms Pike also gave evidence of one visit by a member of the Mental Health Team, Mr Barber. She said that, in answer to her enquiry, Mr Barber said he could not discuss the plaintiff’s condition because of “the Secrecy Act”. She said that from that date until 17 March Mr Barber did not again visit, although she and the plaintiff lived at the home during the whole of that time. 
     
      
    56 Again, the records paint a different picture. The note of the “Team Meeting” prior to the plaintiff’s discharge on 6 March explicitly noted that the case manager, Hugh Barber, would “follow up after discharge”. They also noted that “old notes” would be obtained by facsimile from “Blue Mountains”. This was a reference to an earlier contact with the Child and Adolescent Team.  
     
      
    57 Mr Barber was a registered nurse with psychiatric training, which he completed in 1981. He had a little under 20 years’ experience in the practice of that profession. He was appointed as the plaintiff’s case manager. His notes confirm that the projected home visit on 7 March did take place. He noted that the plaintiff was “welcoming” and said that he was coping well and hoped to get work quickly. He was happy to be out of Pialla. He made a reference to the sexual advance by the other patient. He said that the plaintiff minimised his problems, particularly in respect of alcohol consumption. He noted that the plaintiff: 
     
      
       
        
        “… says he is depressed, with poor sleep and appetite. But he denied suicidal thoughts ‘at the moment’.” 
        
       
      
    58 He also recorded that the plaintiff was “very irritable and angry”, using quite violent language about Pialla staff, and that he did not think his anger was of proportion to the circumstances. Of some interest is the following note: 
     
      
       
        
        “Also disturbed by images of knifes (sic) flashing at him. Might happen 20 times in a day. Very real and upsetting causing him to move in fear.” 
        
       
      
    59 Mr Barber also recorded a meeting with Ms Pike who, he said, felt that the plaintiff was “very depressed” and that she was concerned about his “impulsivity” because he had attempted suicide when drunk.  
     
      
    60 The notes then record a “home visit” on 12 March, but that the plaintiff was not at home. Mr Barber said in evidence that this would have been arranged during the course of the visit of 7 March. He then made another visit on 13 March, this time unannounced, as he was unable to contact the plaintiff on the telephone (which was not working). The note is brief. It reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “Tim reports to be ok.” 
        
       
      
    61 He made another arrangement for a visit on 16 March. That visit took place, and the plaintiff was at home. Mr Barber recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Tim appears brighter.” 
        
       
      
    62 He noted difficulty in getting to sleep and that the plaintiff had been looking for work without success. He then noted that the plaintiff did not appear to have a major depression at that time “but was possibly depressed in 2000”. He noted that the plaintiff denied an alcohol problem, although a later note records that the plaintiff recognised that he needed to control his alcohol consumption. 
     
      
    63 Mr Barber’s final note of the consultation was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Also noted that he has not been bothered by images of knifes (sic) etc that he had complained of previously.” 
        
       
      
    64 His plan for the future included discussion of case review, short term case management with problem solving and goal setting and a meeting with the plaintiff’s mother. 
     
      
       
      The events of 17 March 2001 
       
      
    65 The plaintiff’s account of the events of 17 March is as follows. He had planned to go to a party in Woodford, by catching a train from Glenbrook. He missed the train, and wandered up to the shops to fill in time until the next train, which he also missed. He returned to the park where he knew there were some acquaintances, with his brother. At this point he was feeling depressed, angry and lonely. He had consumed one beer, and then bought himself another two 700ml bottles of full strength beer, which he thought he shared with others. He said that he was not then sober, but he had control over himself. His feelings towards himself were negative, particularly after missing the second train. He made a decision that he was going to kill himself by climbing a tree and hanging himself. He spoke about this decision to his brother Ben. He told Ben: 
     
      
       
        
        “Just that I hate my life, that I want to die, I’m going to kill myself.” 
        
       
       
      Ben told him that his life was not that bad, and that he was not going to commit suicide. 
       
      
    66 The two then returned to Ms Pike’s house, together with Joel Watson, the young acquaintance who had saved him from death on the railway on 28 February. 
     
      
    67 In the backyard he told his brother again that he was going to hang himself. His brother told him that he (Ben) would hang himself in order to teach the plaintiff a lesson, so that he would understand what he had been putting Ben and Ms Pike through. Ben then went a grabbed an extension cord and formed a noose. The plaintiff seized the noose and climbed the tree. The plaintiff attempted to loop the noose over a branch, but Ben prevented him from doing so. He tried to talk the plaintiff into coming down from the tree.  
     
      
    68 The plaintiff said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… something happened, I just, just had – my, yeah, just the fact that he wouldn't let go of the extension cord just, yeah, this wasn't, yeah, it wasn't happening then, and I don't know it just – it was just too much. I didn't want to talk to anyone, I didn't want anything, I just wanted to be, I don't know. I just couldn't cope. And seeing that I couldn't hang the noose up I just climbed up the tree.” 
        
       
      
    69 He let go of the noose. Ben remained on the ground, trying to coax him down out of the tree. The plaintiff said: 
     
      
       
        
        “And then just like everything went still and quiet and everything just seemed simple and, yeah, I don't know it didn't – things just didn't seem as hard as they did before … And just I felt better, better than I had for a long time and so I started climbing down.” 
        
       
       
      At this point he fell from the tree, whether by slipping or by reason of a broken branch to this day he does not know. An ambulance was called and the plaintiff was taken to the Liverpool Hospital and thereafter to Prince of Wales Hospital. 
       
      
    70 The plaintiff remained an inpatient at the Prince of Wales, or at Prince Henry Hospital, for some time. It is only necessary to note one aspect of the treatment he there received. A psychiatrist prescribed a combination of anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medications. This had a beneficial effect on the plaintiff’s mood, which was unsurprisingly, by then depressed. 
     
      
    71 The events of 17 March gave rise to the only real factual dispute in the proceedings, the quantity of alcohol the plaintiff had consumed on 17 March. I have already recorded the plaintiff’s account, given in evidence in chief, of his alcohol consumption on that night. In cross-examination he denied having drunk, in addition to two bottles of beer, half a bottle of whisky.  
     
      
    72 Mr Watson also gave evidence about the plaintiff’s alcohol consumption on that evening. He said that he first came across the plaintiff in Glenbrook Park some time after sunset. He himself had been drinking since about 10 or 10.30 in the morning of that day, in Glenbrook Park. He had drunk only cask wine and beer. He was very definite that he had not consumed any spirits. He said that he and the plaintiff had consumed “a couple of long necks together” and that he had not observed the plaintiff drinking any whisky that night. He said that the plaintiff had bought three “long necks” from a nearby bottle shop, of which Mr Watson drank one and the plaintiff drank two. Mr Watson also denied that the plaintiff had consumed any whisky. 
     
      
    73 Following his admission to the Prince of Wales Hospital the plaintiff was seen by a psychiatric registrar, Dr Farzaan Mehta, on 26 March. Dr Mehta took a history from the plaintiff which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the Sat night 
         
        
       
      
     · had been drinking ½ bottle of whisky and a couple of long necks of beer” 
     
      
    74 It is of some interest that other matters recorded by Dr Mehta in relation to the evening of 17 March are substantially in accord with the evidence given by the plaintiff. For example Dr Mehta noted that the plaintiff had been drinking with his brother, that he denied other drug use, that he “ended up” back at his mother’s house, that he had an argument with his brother and climbed the tree, that he calmed down in the tree and that after five minutes he started climbing down and that his brother called an ambulance. That is, it claims that, on 26 March, the plaintiff gave to Dr Mehta a generally accurate account of the events of 17 March, consistent with the evidence he gave six years later in this Court. 
     
      
    75 Two other matters, however, ought to be mentioned. Dr Mehta recorded that the plaintiff’s brother was climbing up the tree to get him down, and that while he was climbing down, the plaintiff stepped on a branch which snapped, causing him to fall. These assertions do not accord with the evidence given by the plaintiff.  
     
      
    76 I will return to these significance of the evidence concerning alcohol consumption.  
     
      
       
      The plaintiff’s claim of negligence 
       
      
    77 On behalf of the plaintiff it was pleaded that the defendant was negligent in the following respects: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) failing to treat or properly treat the plaintiff whilst he was a patient at Pialla. 
         
         
        (b) discharging the plaintiff from Pialla when it was not appropriate to do so. 
         
         
        (c) failing to make any or any proper arrangements for the care of the plaintiff following his discharge. 
         
         
        (d) failing, on the part of the said mental heath worker from the Springwood Community Mental Health Team, to properly assess to treat the plaintiff. 
         
         
        (e) (abandoned) 
         
         
        (f) failing to appreciate, or adequately appreciate, the fact that the plaintiff was a high risk mental health client. 
         
         
        (g) failing, or failing adequately, to take into account the plaintiff’s high risk during each episode of medical triage in relation to the plaintiff. 
         
         
        (h) failing, or failing adequately, to take into account the plaintiff’s high risk when managing the plaintiff as both a community patient and during his periods of in hospital treatment. 
         
         
        (i) failing, or failing adequately, to appreciate the plaintiff’s psychopathology, both as to the longer term commencing from July 2000, and particularly during his period of in hospital treatment beginning on 1 March 2001. 
         
         
        (j) failing to treat the plaintiff with medication during his period in-hospital from 1 March 2001. 
         
         
        (k) misjudging the plaintiff’s level of psychopathology during the plaintiff’s period as a hospital inpatient at Pialla. 
         
         
        (l) at the time of the plaintiff’s discharge from Pialla on 6 March 2001, failing to seek a longer term community treatment order in relation to him so as to ensure ongoing management.” 
        
       
      
    78 Counsel for the defendant grouped these particulars into four broad categories. They are: 
     
      
       
      (1) a claim that the plaintiff ought to have been detained as an involuntary patient for a period of at least two weeks for the purpose of the administration and monitoring of anti-depressant medication; and that, pursuant to the  
      Mental Health Act 1990  
      the defendant ought to have sought a compulsory Community Treatment Order; 
       
       
      (2) a claim that the plaintiff ought, during the period of his hospitalisation and following his discharge, have been prescribed medication, or given a trial of medication, incorporating either anti-depressant or anti-psychotic medication, or both; 
       
       
      (3) a claim that the defendant failed, during the period of the plaintiff’s hospitalisation, to provide adequate counselling or other therapies; 
       
       
      (4) a claim that the defendant failed to provide adequate care for the plaintiff following his discharge. 
       
       
      Counsel for the plaintiff did not take issue with this categorisation.  
       
       
      The Civil Liability Act 2002 
       
      
    79 As I have indicated above, the claim is governed by the provisions of the Civil Liability Act. The relevant provisions are the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Division 3 Causation 
        
       
       
        
        5D General principles 
         
        (1) A determination that negligence caused particular harm comprises the following elements:  
         
         (a) that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm ( 
         factual causation 
         ), and 
          
         (b) that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person’s liability to extend to the harm so caused ( 
         scope of liability 
         ). 
         
        (2) In determining in an exceptional case, in accordance with established principles, whether negligence that cannot be established as a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm should be accepted as establishing factual causation, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party. 
         
        (3) …  
         
        (4) For the purpose of determining the scope of liability, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party. 
         
         
        Division 6 Professional negligence 
         
         
        5O 
          
        Standard of care for professionals 
         
        (1) A person practising a profession ( 
        a professional 
        ) does not incur a liability in negligence arising from the provision of a professional service if it is established that the professional acted in a manner that (at the time the service was provided) was widely accepted in Australia by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice. 
         
        (2) However, peer professional opinion cannot be relied on for the purposes of this section if the court considers that the opinion is irrational. 
         
        (3) The fact that there are differing peer professional opinions widely accepted in Australia concerning a matter does not prevent any one or more (or all) of those opinions being relied on for the purposes of this section. 
         
        (4) Peer professional opinion does not have to be universally accepted to be considered widely accepted. 
         
         
        Division 8 Contributory negligence 
         
         
        5R 
          
        Standard of contributory negligence 
         
        (1) The principles that are applicable in determining whether a person has been negligent also apply in determining whether the person who suffered harm has been contributorily negligent in failing to take precautions against the risk of that harm. 
         
        (2) For that purpose:  
         
         (a) the standard of care required of the person who suffered harm is that of a reasonable person in the position of that person, and 
          
         (b) the matter is to be determined on the basis of what that person knew or ought to have known at the time. 
         
         
        5S 
          
        Contributory negligence can defeat claim 
         
        In determining the extent of a reduction in damages by reason of contributory negligence, a court may determine a reduction of 100% if the court thinks it just and equitable to do so, with the result that the claim for damages is defeated. 
         
         
        43A 
          
        Proceedings against public or other authorities for the exercise of special statutory powers 
         
        (1) This section applies to proceedings for civil liability to which this Part applies to the extent that the liability is based on a public or other authority’s exercise of, or failure to exercise, a special statutory power conferred on the authority. 
         
        (2) A  
        special statutory power 
         is a power:  
         
          
          (a) that is conferred by or under a statute, and 
           
          (b) that is of a kind that persons generally are not authorised to exercise without specific statutory authority. 
          
         
        (3) For the purposes of any such proceedings, any act or omission involving an exercise of, or failure to exercise, a special statutory power does not give rise to civil liability unless the act or omission was in the circumstances so unreasonable that no authority having the special statutory power in question could properly consider the act or omission to be a reasonable exercise of, or failure to exercise, its power.

        Part 6 Intoxication 
         
         
        48 
          
        Definition of “intoxication” 
         
        A reference in this Part to a person being  
        intoxicated 
         is a reference to a person being under the influence of alcohol or a drug (whether or not taken for a medicinal purpose and whether or not lawfully taken). 
         
         
        49 
          
        Effect of intoxication on duty and standard of care 
         
        (1) The following principles apply in connection with the effect that a person’s intoxication has on the duty and standard of care that the person is owed:  
         
          
          (a) in determining whether a duty of care arises, it is not relevant to consider the possibility or likelihood that a person may be intoxicated or that a person who is intoxicated may be exposed to increased risk because the person’s capacity to exercise reasonable care and skill is impaired as a result of being intoxicated, 
           
          (b) a person is not owed a duty of care merely because the person is intoxicated, 
           
          (c) the fact that a person is or may be intoxicated does not of itself increase or otherwise affect the standard of care owed to the person. 
          
         
        (2) …  
         
         
        50 
          
        No recovery where person intoxicated 
         
        (1) This section applies when it is established that the person whose death, injury or damage is the subject of proceedings for the recovery of damages was at the time of the act or omission that caused the death, injury or damage intoxicated to the extent that the person’s capacity to exercise reasonable care and skill was impaired. 
         
        (2) A court is not to award damages in respect of liability to which this Part applies unless satisfied that the death, injury or damage to property (or some other injury or damage to property) is likely to have occurred even if the person had not been intoxicated. 
         
        (3) If the court is satisfied that the death, injury or damage to property (or some other injury or damage to property) is likely to have occurred even if the person had not been intoxicated, it is to be presumed that the person was contributorily negligent unless the court is satisfied that the person’s intoxication did not contribute in any way to the cause of the death, injury or damage. 
         
        (4) When there is a presumption of contributory negligence, the court must assess damages on the basis that the damages to which the person would be entitled in the absence of contributory negligence are to be reduced on account of contributory negligence by 25% or a greater percentage determined by the court to be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. 
         
        (5) This section does not apply in a case where the court is satisfied that the intoxication was not self-induced.” 
        
       
       
      Intoxication 
       
      
    80 It is convenient to dispose firstly of the issue of intoxication.  
     
      
    81 I accept that the plaintiff told Dr Mehta that, in addition to the two bottles of full strength beer he now admits he consumed during the evening of 17 March, he had also consumed half a bottle of whisky. In evidence, he denied that he had done so. He did, however, acknowledge that he was not sober by the time he arrived at his mother’s home and climbed the tree. That is sufficient to bring him within the definition of intoxication contained in s 48. 
     
      
    82 Contrary to the argument advanced on behalf of the defendant, I am satisfied that s 49 is irrelevant to the present proceedings. S 49(1)(a) is directed only to the effect of intoxication upon the determination of whether or not a duty of care arises. Here, there is no question, and no issue, that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care. S 49(1)(a) can be put to one side. S 49(1)(b) is similarly concerned with whether or not a duty of care is owed. It does no more than state categorically that intoxication of itself does not give rise to a duty of care where such a duty does not otherwise exist. For the same reasons, s 49(1)(b) can be put to one side. S 49(1)(c) is concerned with the standard of care. It excludes any increase or other effect of the fact that the person to whom the duty of care is owed “is or may be intoxicated” upon the standard of care. I accept that neither the existence, nor the standard of the duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff is in any way affected by his intoxication on the evening of 17 March. The standard of the care owed to him is precisely that owed to any other patient in his circumstances (absent intoxication).  
     
      
    83 Counsel for the defendant then made the following submission (in their written outline of submissions): 
     
      
       
        
        “7. Since the plaintiff’s injuries occurred whilst he was intoxicated (within the meaning of the CLA) the defendant owed him no duty of care with respect to that conduct.” 
        
       
      
    84 This is a distortion of the effect of s 49, or alternatively of s 50. S 49 does not exclude a duty of care which otherwise exists merely because the person to whom the duty of care is owed is intoxicated.  
     
      
    85 Part 6 of the Civil Liability Act has no bearing upon the assessment of the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant acted in breach of its duty of care to him. S 50 may well have a bearing upon the assessment of any damages to which the plaintiff would be entitled if he were to succeed in his claim that the defendant was negligent. 
     
      
       
      Professional services 
       
      
    86 Prior to the introduction of the Civil Liability Act the test to be applied where persons practising professions were alleged to have been negligent was well established. It was stated, inter alia, in Rogers v Whitaker [1992] HCA 58; 175 CLR 479 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The law imposes on a medical practitioner a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in the provision of professional advice and treatment. That duty is a ‘single comprehensive duty covering all the ways in which a doctor is called upon to exercise his skill and judgment’ … In Australia, it has been accepted that the standard of care to be observed by a person with some special skill or competence is that of the ordinary skilled person exercising and professing to have that special skill.” 
        
       
      
    87 The Court rejected the notion that the standard is determined solely or even primarily by reference to the practice followed or supported by a responsible body of opinion in the relevant profession or trade. This was a version of the principle stated, firstly in Bolan v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 582; [1957] 2 All ER 118, and restated in Sidaway v Governors of Bethlem Royal Hospital [1985] AC 871 as: 
     
      
       
        
        “The  
        Bolan  
        principle may be formulated as a rule that a doctor is not negligent if he acts in accordance with the practice accepted at the time as proper by a responsible body of medical opinion even though other doctors adopt a different practice. In short, the law imposes the duty of care: but the standard of care is a matter of medical judgment.” 
        
       
      
    88 The High Court held, for Australia, that Bolan no longer stated the law. It reserved to the court the determination of the standard of care and skill required in any individual case, recognising, of course, the need for guidance from the relevant profession (p 489). 
     
      
    89 Rogers was a case concerning the provision of relevant information to a patient. However, the principles concerning the determination of the standard of care are of general application. 
     
      
    90 The effect of the decision in Rogers has been modified by s 5O. Indeed, the section may be seen as reinstating the Bolan test. 
     
      
       
      The treatment given to the plaintiff: was it adequate? 
       
      
    91 I turn now to the evidence concerning the appropriateness or otherwise of the standard of care and treatment provided to the plaintiff. This emerges from a series of reports provided by Dr Jonathan Phillips, a consultant psychiatrist who advised and gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiff, and Dr James Telfer, also a specialist psychologist, who performed the same function on behalf of the defendant. Dr Phillips reviewed what he described as “a substantial file of documents” which are itemised in his letter of instruction dated 20 May 2004. Dr Phillips first reported on 23 June 2004. At that point, although he had read the documentation, he had not personally met or assessed the plaintiff. Dr Phillips acted on the basis that the material provided to him was factually accurate. He advised that, as he had not met the plaintiff, this report should be regarded as a “preliminary document”.  
     
      
    92 He approached his task on the basis that the plaintiff: 
     
      
       
        
        “… had always been a relatively high risk mental health client.” 
        
       
       
      He considered it necessary that this fact be taken into account during each episode of medical triage and ought to have influenced his management both as a community patient and during his hospitalisation.  
       
      
    93 Dr Phillips described the examination conducted by Dr Tsovolos as “first class” and her record as “comprehensive”. He then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Unfortunately Dr Tsovolos appears to have made a significant error of judgment in electing to admit Mr Walker as a voluntary patient in a general ward and had put faith in the plaintiff ‘making adult and responsible decisions’ with regard to his welfare and the future. Additionally the registrar [Dr Tsovolos] may have made an error in not choosing to treat the plaintiff with psychotropic medication at that time.” 
        
       
      
    94 In Dr Phillips’ opinion, as expressed in the report, the plaintiff was “significantly disturbed” at the time of the examination and admission and was not in a state of mind to have been relied upon to make rational judgments or to have insight into the nature and/or depth of his psychological disturbance. This was a reference to Dr Tsovolos’ note that, in being admitted as a voluntary patient, the onus was on the plaintiff to make adult and responsible decisions concerning his welfare and future. 
     
      
    95 Dr Phillips considered that a second error of judgment occurred on 4 March 2001, at the time the plaintiff complained of the molestation or harassment by the other patient. Dr Phillips said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given denial by the second person, there is probability that the patient was experiencing paranoid symptoms at the time, these becoming a further marker for the depth of his psychological disturbance.” 
        
       
       
      He then added: 
       
       
        
        “In keeping with the above and irrespective of some evidence that [the plaintiff] was improving, the decision to discharge the plaintiff from hospital on 6 March 2001 was premature.” 
        
       
      
    96 Dr Phillips then said that, from the documents provided to him, he could not determine whether a proper follow up plan had been devised. He considered that “highly assertive follow up” should have been maintained and recorded, and that this should have been done in conjunction with the plaintiff’s mother.  
     
      
    97 He considered that “a case could have been made” for seeking a longer term Community Treatment Order (under the Mental Health Act). Dr Phillips returned to the question of “follow up”, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “The issue of [the plaintiff’s] discharge planning is clear. There is no evidence that the medical and other personnel at Pialla provided a comprehensive documented discharge plan which ensured assertive community follow up. Further, Professor Boyce verified that the plaintiff had been discharged without involvement of his mother, into whose care he was being entrusted. Hospital personnel and the hospital generally must face significant criticism in this domain.” 
        
       
       
      (There was no evidence that Professor Boyce had verified the plaintiff’s discharge without the involvement of his mother, but that this had occurred was not in issue.) 
       
      
    98 He recognised and acknowledged the home visit of 7 March, but found no evidence of the further visits (to which I have referred above). He therefore considered the follow up care to have been inadequate. Subsequently Dr Phillips became aware of two later visits, and modified this position. 
     
      
    99 With respect to the medication issue, Dr Phillips said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The issue of whether [the plaintiff] required medication with psychotropic agents during his period of in hospital treatment beginning 1 March 2001 and following his discharge from hospital on 6 March 2001 is hard to resolve. On balance and given the extent of the plaintiff’s symptoms (across the depression spectrum, including his hazardous use of alcohol and the presence of at least transient psychotic symptoms) he almost certainly may have benefited from medication with a modern anti-depressant agent and/or an anti-psychotic agent (with the latter used only for a brief period).” 
        
       
      
    100 Dr Phillips summarised his opinion as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        ·  
        There was inadequate appreciation of the plaintiff’s psychopathology, both during his period of in-hospital treatment at Pialla beginning 1 March 2002, and with regard to the longer term. 
         
         
        ·  
        There is a reasonable case that the plaintiff should have received medication as part of his package of treatment during his period of in-hospital treatment at Pialla, beginning 1 March 2001. 
         
         
        ·  
        It is more likely than not that the plaintiff’s level of psychopathology was misjudged by personnel at Pialla and that his discharge form the hospital on 6 March 2002 was premature. 
         
         
        ·  
        There was inadequate attention to discharge planning in all its aspects, particularly with regard to consultation with [the plaintiff’s mother] and the provision of appropriate assertive follow-up by the community mental health team. 
         
         
        ·  
        There is at least an argument that a longer term community treatment order should have been sought to ensure ongoing management of the client, noting particularly the complexity and severity of this psychopathology and his apparent ambivalence regarding treatment.” 
        
       
      
    101 In February 2006 Dr Phillips was provided with a copy of a report prepared at the request of the defendant by Dr Telfer dated 1 August 2005. He was asked to comment upon this report. Dr Telfer’s opinion of the assessment and diagnosis made by Dr Tsovolos was that it was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… competent and adequate, soundly based on a direct examination of the patient and also on detailed background information from Mr Keevers who had seen the patient in October 2000, 27 February 2001 and again on 1 March 2001.” 
        
       
      
    102 With respect to the admission of the plaintiff as a voluntary patient, Dr Telfer said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion the patient had the capacity to make an informed consent at this time and could contract to be admitted voluntarily. He was so submitted. This is in accord with the principle of the Least Restrictive Form of Care.  
        
       
       
      (The reference to the principle of the Least Restrictive Form of Care will be explained below.) 
       
      
    103 Dr Telfer considered that, in the absence of a diagnosis of depression, it was to be expected that no medication would be prescribed. It was common ground between Dr Telfer and Dr Phillips that no major depression disorder existed; both accepted a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood.  
     
      
    104 Dr Telfer considered that the follow up arrangements were “within accepted standards of practice”. He considered there were no reasonable grounds for the use of a Community Treatment Order, even if the admission had been involuntary. He therefore considered that the plaintiff’s treatment at Pialla was appropriate as were his discharge and planned aftercare. 
     
      
    105 Reading Dr Telfer’s report did not bring about any change in Dr Phillips’ views. Dr Phillips reported again on 13 July 2006. By this time he had interviewed the plaintiff on 19 August 2004. He had also been made aware of the visits and case notes made by the mental health worker on 12 March, 13 March and 16 March 2001. These, also, did not alter his opinion. Dr Phillips said [referring to his previous report of 23 June 2004]:  
     
      
       
        
        “… [the plaintiff] had a difficult combination of disorders: a depression spectrum disorder and a personality disorder and … the plaintiff used alcohol in a hazardous manner. In keeping with this, I rated the plaintiff as having been a person who, over an extended period, would be at risk of self-harming behaviour. All these matters should have alerted professional staff within the Wentworth Area Health Service (hospital staff, community staff) to the plaintiff’s need for close surveillance and assertive treatment … 
         
         
        Whilst the mental health worker carried out a satisfactory consultation at the time of the first home visit, he should have, on information given to him, reached the conclusion that [the plaintiff] was a young man of considerable risk for self-harm, and organised for either more assertive home visits (initially on a daily basis) and/or reviewed by more senior mental health personnel (psychiatrist, psychiatric registrar) or organised re-admission of the plaintiff to hospital (assuming the plaintiff would agree). I doubt, however, that the situation had reached the point where compulsory transfer to hospital under the  
        New South Wales Mental Health Act 1990 
         was warranted. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Whilst there had been less room for concern by the mental health worker at the home visit on 16 March 2001, the mental health worker should have appreciated that one of the most dangerous times for self-harm occurs when a person is emerging from the depths of a depressive disorder and is becoming more active. The mental health worker should have appreciated that the plaintiff remained a person at substantial risk for self-harm. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        I acknowledged the attempts by the case worker to maintain contact with [the plaintiff], beginning 7 March 2001. Notwithstanding his attempts, I hold to my previous opinion that if [the plaintiff’s] level of psychopathology had been better assessed by the treatment team and if he had been given greater protection during his period of in-hospital treatment beginning 1 March 2001 and had been provided with a longer period of hospitalisation and/or had assertive follow-up consistent with his need, the event leading to his permanent quadriplegia might have been avoided. 
         
         
        … the Wentworth Area Health Service will continue to face substantial criticism for not providing [the plaintiff], at a time of high level of psychological disturbance, greater safety whilst he was receiving treatment. It had been the plaintiff’s premature discharge from hospital which set in train events leading eventually to his permanent quadriplegia. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        It is my firm opinion that, in the context of known facts at the time of [the plaintiff’s] admission and treatment at Pialla, professional staff at the psychiatric centre should have judged his psychopathology more seriously. 
         
         
        Specifically, on the basis of all material available to me, I hold that professional staff should have reached the conclusion that [the plaintiff] would require a reasonable period of hospitalisation (probably 2-3 weeks) to allow for comprehensive treatment (counselling, medication) and additionally that the plaintiff required high level protection (at least during his earlier period of in-hospital treatment). 
         
         
        … professional staff should have kept [the plaintiff] longer in hospital than they did. 
         
         
        … I do not believe it could be stated that professional staff provided a detailed discharge plan for [the plaintiff]. The final file entry (6 March 2001) was written by a nurse and merely states that the plaintiff was discharged after review by the treating team. The interim discharge summary is little more explicit. It notes merely that the plaintiff was to be followed by the Lower Mountains community team. No explicit discharge instruction or plan was provided. 
         
         
        Professional staff will face considerable criticism from colleagues of good standing for failing to provide a specific and comprehensive treatment plan for [the plaintiff] at the time when he was discharged from hospital, noting particularly the seriousness of his psychopathology at the time of his admission to hospital and during the period of his in-hospital treatment. 
         
         
        … On the information available to me, it would have been prudent to plan to keep the plaintiff in hospital for 2-3 weeks, but to review the situation on the basis of his progress. 
         
         
        … The patient’s safety should have been the dominant concern. There was ample evidence to verify that [the plaintiff] was not in a personally safe situation (and at risk for self-harm) at the time of his admission to Pialla, during his period of in-hospital treatment, and at the time of his initial follow-up visit. 
         
         
        …  
         
         
        In my opinion, [the plaintiff] had been discharged prematurely from Pialla. Further the plaintiff’s mother should have been involved closely in the process of developing a discharge plan, and that arrangements should have been assured (if the plaintiff had to leave hospital) to have him reviewed by a mental health worker at his home on a daily basis until there was conclusive clinical evidence that he had returned to normal psychological functioning. This did not occur. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Inadequate arrangements were made for outpatient follow-up. Daily assessment was required initially by the plaintiff. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst I believe the mental health worker from the Springwood Mental Health Team made a clinical error at the time of his first assessment of the plaintiff at home, in failing to organise urgent further assessment by a more senior member of staff (psychiatrist, psychiatric registrar), that worker faced a difficult task in providing a comprehensive assessment in the setting. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Given the seriousness of the plaintiff’s psychopathology at the time of his admission to Pialla, and during his period of in-hospital treatment, and the time of his initial follow-up at home, it would have been prudent to have medicated the patient with a modern ant-depressant agent and/or an anti-psychotic agent … 
        
       
       
        
        … Particularly, given that the plaintiff was ambivalent about treatment, his ongoing necessary treatment should have been mandated, as far as this was possible, using provisions within the  
        New South Wales Mental Health Act 1990 
        .” 
        
       
      
    106 Dr Phillips reported again on 8 September 2006. This report was made in response to a series of six specific questions posed to him by the solicitors for the plaintiff.  
     
      
       
      Dr Phillips opened with the observation: 
       
       
        
        “It almost goes without stating that personnel within Wentworth Area Health Service should have appreciated [the plaintiff’s] psychological vulnerabilities and given proper consideration and weight to them on every occasion when he was assessed within the community, at times of triage when he presented at hospital, and during any period of in-hospital treatment.” 
        
       
       
      (Dr Phillips stopped short, however, of asserting, here, any failure on the part of the defendant’s personnel to familiarise themselves with the plaintiff’s psychological vulnerabilities.) 
       
      
    107 The specific questions asked of Dr Phillips included questions about the prescription of anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medication of the kind subsequently prescribed by Dr Mehta at Prince of Wales. Dr Phillips replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “Assuming that [the plaintiff] was suffering from a depression spectrum disorder at the time of his admission to Pialla … and noting his past history of mental health problems generally and his history of nihilistic thinking, he should have been medicated initially with a modern anti-depressant agent and/or a modern anti-psychotic agent. If the patient had failed to settle within one week of admission to hospital, or where there was evidence that he had or may have had psychotic symptoms, a modern anti-psychotic agent should have been added to his medication regime. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        I have no doubt that a proper treatment programme for [the plaintiff] would have included safe accommodation during his period of in-hospital treatment, medication (almost certainly including anti-depressant and anti-psychotic agents) and counselling … If the plaintiff had been afforded a treatment programme of this type, his risk for self-destructive and/or suicidal behaviour would have been substantially reduced.” 
        
       
      
    108 In response to a question whether it was within the defendant’s capacity to reduce the risk of any further suicide attempts by the plaintiff, Dr Phillips replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “The defendant had at least two major ways of reducing the risk of the plaintiff attempting suicide, at least in the short-term, and probably in the longer term. 
         
         
        First, the defendant should have offered [the plaintiff] a secure therapeutic environment for as long as it was required, (this to be determined mainly on the basis of repeat formal risk assessment). A safe environment may have included a closed-ward, good sightlines between nursing station and the patient’s bed, frequent observations which were recorded formally, or one-to-one nursing.” 
        
       
      
    109 In response to a further, specific, question concerning the length of time over which the plaintiff ought to have been admitted to Pialla, Dr Phillips declined to be categorical or offer a precise time frame, but said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given what was known about [the plaintiff] at the time of his admission to Pialla, he required in-hospital treatment until such time as his treatment team considered that he was no longer a danger to himself and where he could be managed within the community. 
         
         
        As a rule of thumb and accepting the risk for suicide will generally increase as the patient becomes more animated and has greater energy levels, it is best to hold a patient in the hospital setting until there is evidence for stable improvement. 
        
       
       
        
        … given what was known about the plaintiff at the time of admission to hospital, it would have been reasonable to anticipate a period of in-hospital care of at least two weeks duration.” 
        
       
      
    110 He restated his view that the plaintiff ought to have been offered “supportive/protective” counselling initially, followed by “more practical counselling” as he began to settle. 
     
      
    111 Dr Phillips’ final report is dated 21 February 2007. On this occasion he was asked to focus his attention upon the issue of intoxication, this having been raised by the defendant in an amendment, pursuant to the Civil Liability Act, to the defence filed.  
     
      
    112 Dr Phillips, acting on the material before him, accepted that the plaintiff had consumed alcohol on 17 March. He was unable to quantify the alcohol consumed, or assess his level of intoxication. He considered it unlikely that the plaintiff would have been able to climb the tree if he had been heavily intoxicated. 
     
      
    113 Dr Phillips noted various of the entries made by Dr Tsovolos in her notes, these being of acts of deliberate self-harm, including punching walls, inflicting cigarette burns on his skin and stabbing himself with pens; and he noted the entry in which the plaintiff appeared to be “ambivalent” about possible future suicide attempts, saying that he did not think he could do it again, but it might happen, he might change his mind again. 
     
      
    114 Dr Phillips thought the materials showed that, at the time of his hospitalisation, and (possibly) thereafter, that the plaintiff was “highly likely” to engage in further self-destructive or frankly suicidal acts. This was because of his past behaviour, which, Dr Phillips said, is the best predictor for future behaviour; because the plaintiff was suffering a chronic depression spectrum disorder; and because the plaintiff was young and of male gender, both factors linked to self-destructive and suicidal behaviour. 
     
      
    115 Dr Phillips then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the balance of probabilities, [the plaintiff] was going to again act in a self-destructive/frankly suicidal manner … whether or not he consumed alcohol and whether or not he became intoxicated secondary to the consumption of alcohol.” 
        
       
      
    116 He therefore considered it likely that the plaintiff would have acted in a self-destructive or suicidal manner on that day with or without the consumption of alcohol, but that it was possible (but unproven) that he may have become disinhibited as a consequence of his alcohol consumption. He expressed the “strong opinion” that the plaintiff’s alcohol use on that day was not the cause of his dangerous behaviour. He considered that, had the plaintiff received “timely, appropriate and comprehensive treatment” from the defendant he would suffered fewer or no symptoms of depression spectrum disorder. He would have been significantly less likely to use alcohol in a hazardous manner. 
     
      
    117 Dr Telfer took a different approach. He reported, firstly, on 1 August 2005, and commented on Dr Phillips’ reports (excluding the 8 September 2006 and February 2007 reports) on 15 May 2006. He endorsed Dr Phillips’ favourable view of the assessment and record taking by Dr Tsovolos. 
     
      
    118 Dr Telfer noted that Dr Tsovolos had initially determined not to admit the plaintiff to Pialla, but changed her mind upon the request of the plaintiff and his mother. In Dr Telfer’s view, the plaintiff had the capacity to give informed consent to this course and could contract to be admitted voluntarily, as, indeed, he was. This, according to Dr Telfer, was in accord with the principle of the Least Restrictive Form of Care – a principle which is read into, or derived from, the approach taken in the Mental Health Act.  
     
      
    119 Dr Telfer considered the issue of the diagnosis (or otherwise) of depression: he noted that Dr Tsovolos diagnosed depression or dysthymia (severe disturbance of mood); but that Dr Stones found no sign of depressive illness. The nursing care manager Mr Barker, who interviewed the plaintiff on 2 March, also noted some features of depressive illness; but other, subsequent, notes (including those of Dr Morrell) were to the contrary. On the whole, the notes did not support a diagnosis of depression, and it is to be recalled that Dr Phillips himself agreed that there was no evidence of “major depression”.  
     
      
    120 This meant that the decision not to treat the plaintiff with medication for major depression was appropriate. Dr Telfer considered that this decision was supportable on another basis, that is, the plaintiff’s history of heavy alcohol abuse, some substance abuse, risk taking behaviour, impulsivity and poor judgment. The prescription of psychoactive medication can be hazardous because of the interaction with alcohol and other drugs, with only a small chance of beneficial effect.  
     
      
    121 Dr Telfer considered that the attempts made to address the plaintiff’s alcohol consumption to have been “reasonable”. He also considered the follow up arrangements to be within accepted standards of practice. Dr Telfer considered that there were no reasonable grounds for the use of a Community Treatment Order. It is, he pointed out, essential to the making of such an order that the admission be involuntary, under the Mental Health Act (I will deal with this below). Moreover, given his view that it was appropriate not to prescribe medication, a Community Treatment Order, the purpose of which is to ensure compliance with prescribed medications, would have had no utility. The treatment for alcohol problems cannot be compulsory. 
     
      
    122 Dr Telfer could see no benefit in any of the alternatives for the management afforded to the plaintiff, such as more prolonged hospital admission, drug and alcohol programmes, medications for depression, and psychotherapy. Further hospital admission, he thought, would not achieve more than a respite. Compulsory admission to prevent alcohol consumption is not available under the Mental Health Act. Long term abstinence from alcohol would offer a chance of increased stability of mood and reduce suicidal preoccupations, but this could not be achieved without the commitment of the plaintiff to total abstinence, something which the plaintiff had rejected. 
     
      
    123 Dr Telfer thought that the management, post discharge, by the Community Health Team was appropriate and effective as possible given the severe limitations on effectiveness.  
     
      
    124 Overall, he concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “The incident of 27 February 2001 in which the patient sustained multiple injuries in a fall from a tree was an outcome of alcohol abuse, risk taking behaviour, personality disorder and dysfunctional personal relationships. These were long standing, habitual difficulties that are not usually amenable to Mental Health interventions when they occur together. The assessments and care provided by the Mental Health Service were competent and met the standard of practice accepted in Australia by professional peers as appropriate. The incident was not the outcome of negligence but rather the result of the patient’s actions arising from conditions … not remediable by available forms of care …” 
        
       
      
    125 In his second report Dr Telfer analysed and commented upon Dr Phillips’ reports. Significantly, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion the plaintiff would have been unlikely to climb a tree and threaten suicide on 17 March 2001 had he not been under the influence of alcohol at the time. His heavy consumption of alcohol that night led to an altercation with his brother culminating in an impulsive action: climbing a pine tree while making suicide threats.” 
        
       
      
    126 Dr Telfer specifically commented then upon the failure of the defendant, through its Pialla employees, to consult the plaintiff’s mother before discharging him, or, at least, to notify her of the decision to do so. He considered that it would have been “proper and best practice” to discuss the proposed discharge with her, and that the failure to do so rendered the standard of care “suboptimal”. He did not consider, however, that the outcome would have been any different even if there had been a great deal of consultation with her. The plaintiff’s difficulties past and present were of a type not amenable to her interventions. 
     
      
    127 It will be seen, then, that there exists a conflict in the opinions, as expressed in the reports of the two experts. However, a good deal of that conflict evaporated when Dr Phillips gave oral evidence.  
     
      
    128 In cross-examination Dr Phillips’ expressed view about the need for medication to have been prescribed was approached from a number of different directions. He had, I think it is fair to say, extrapolated from the evidence that the combination of medications the plaintiff was prescribed at Prince of Wales had been successful, to posit that the same, or a similar, combination of medications ought to have been prescribed for him in Pialla. He agreed that this retrospective approach was not easy; in effect, although he did not use the words, his evidence may be interpreted as acknowledging that such an approach is unreliable. The fact that after the plaintiff’s injury he was prescribed a combination of drugs that was effective to combat his depression is not evidence that those drugs ought to have been prescribed whilst he was in Pialla; still less is it evidence that failure to prescribe that combination (or a similar one) of drugs amounted to a breach of duty on the part of the defendant.  
     
      
    129 Dr Phillips also accepted that, having regard to the plaintiff’s alcohol use, and his manifest intention not to abstain therefrom, called for caution in the prescription of drugs; particularly when the drug is likely to be used in combination with alcohol. 
     
      
    130 He also acknowledged that anti-depressant medication was associated with side effects such as anxiety, nervousness and insomnia and others in a not insignificant proportion of patients.  
     
      
    131 Dr Phillips’ final position on this was that although he himself would have taken a different course, the decision to admit the plaintiff to Pialla and to watch and observe him without immediate medication was “not unreasonable”. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… you're talking about standing back and looking from a distance and I accept that some people might say that at least for a short period of time to observe before you make a decision to medicate is not unfair.” 
        
       
      
    132 Finally, Dr Phillips was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “… although you may hold a different view, you don't criticise the view that not prescribing anti-depressant medication was a reasonable one?” 
        
       
       
      to which he replied: 
       
        
          
         
        “Well, I think I have to move to that point … I would mount a strenuous argument otherwise but, yes, I can't be excessively critical of the decision, given what you've put to me, of the [psychiatric] registrar not commencing anti-depressant medication immediately and then making the decision to wait and watch.” 
        
       
      
    133 This really concludes the case against the plaintiff in respect of the negligence particularised as the failure to administer appropriate medication. As Dr Phillips also acknowledged, the notes, taken as a whole, between 1 March and 6 March, showed a steady improvement in the plaintiff’s mood, not suggestive of a need to medicate where that need had not previously been identified. 
     
      
    134 Dr Phillips also accepted that, when due regard was had to the notes showing improvement, and to the assessment of Dr Morrell, there was no reason for the plaintiff not to be discharged at the time he was. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I think there's two points that raise a caution but I'm not taking it much beyond that and that is the continuation of a restricted affect and the issue of the recovering insight. Certainly there's no suggestion there that the patient has total insight … It would lead me to ask the question whether it's now that the patient should be discharged or whether one should hang on somewhat longer, but that's one person's view.”  
        
       
       
      He agreed that this represented a debate in which two professionals may regularly engage.  
       
      
    135 For similar reasons those particulars of negligence which assert inadequate counselling or therapy during the patient’s hospitalisation cannot be sustained. Nor, in the light of the recorded home visits, can the criticism that inadequate follow up was afforded to the plaintiff after his discharge.  
     
      
    136 That leaves only the question of whether the plaintiff ought to have been admitted as an involuntary patient under the provisions of the Mental Health Act. 
     
      
       
      Mental Health Act 1990 
       
      
    137 Dr Phillips’ view concerning the exercise of powers under the Mental Health Act was in two parts. Firstly, he considered that the plaintiff ought to have been detained as an involuntary patient. This, I take it, would, in Dr Phillips’ view, have facilitated a longer stay as an in-patient and have permitted whatever treatment those (medical) employees of the defendant considered necessary to be administered, whether with or without the concurrence and cooperation of the plaintiff.  
     
      
    138 A less drastic position was that the defendant’s employees ought to have exercised an option to ensure that a Community Treatment Order under s 131 of the Mental Health Act was operative. Properly characterised, each of these involves an allegation that the defendant, as a public authority, failed to exercise special statutory powers conferred upon it. Such a claim is subject to the strictures imposed by s 43A of the Civil Liability Act – it cannot succeed unless the plaintiff establishes that the failure to exercise the power was, in the circumstances, so unreasonable that no authority (Area Health Service) could properly consider not taking that course to be a reasonable exercise of the power. 
     
      
    139 Each of these requires analysis, in the context of specific provisions of the Mental Health Act. Given that the powers conferred by the Mental Health Act provide for detention, possibly against the will and even over the violent or strenuous opposition of the patient, it is hardly surprising that the procedures it lays down are highly circumscribed and quite rigid. 
     
      
    140 What follows should not be taken as a substitute for detailed analysis of the provisions of the Mental Health Act. It is not intended to be a comprehensive paraphrase of that legislation. 
     
      
    141 The starting point is s 20. S 20 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        20 Detention of persons generally 
         
        A person must not be admitted to, or detained in or continue to be detained in, a hospital under this Part unless the medical superintendent is of the opinion that no other care of a less restrictive kind is appropriate and reasonably available to the person.” 
        
       
      
    142 This is the statutory formulation of “the least restrictive option” to which reference was made in the evidence, and which is the philosophy underlying the procedures for which the Mental Health Act provides. 
     
      
    143 The Mental Health Act draws a distinction between two categories of persons: those who are “mentally ill” and those who are “mentally disordered”. 
     
      
    144 By s 9 a person is a mentally ill person if suffering from a mental illness and, owing to that illness, there are reasonable grounds for believing that care, treatment or control is necessary for the protection of that person, or others, from serious harm. 
     
      
    145 “Mental illness” is defined in the Dictionary as a condition which seriously impairs, either temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of the person and is characterised by the presence of any one or more of five specified symptoms – delusions, hallucinations, serious disorder of thought form, a severe disturbance of mood, or sustained or repeated irrational behaviour indicating the presence of any one or more of those symptoms. 
     
      
    146 By s 10 a mentally disordered person is a person whose behaviour for the time being is so irrational as to justify a conclusion on reasonable grounds that temporary care, treatment, or control is necessary for the protection of that person, or of others, from serious physical harm.  
     
      
    147 The Mental Health Act provides for a variety of ways by which a person considered to be mentally ill or mentally disordered may be subjected to involuntary detention in a hospital. These include: on the certificate of a medical practitioner or a person accredited for that purpose (s 21); at the request of a relative or friend of the person to the medical superintendent of the hospital (s 23); after apprehension by police (s 24); by order of a court under s 33 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (s 25); on information of a welfare officer (designated for that purpose under the Mental Health Act) (s 26); and by order of an “appropriate person” authorising medical examination or observation (s 27). However, the extent of the detention authorised following any of these scenarios is extremely limited. A person so detained is required to be examined as soon as practicable, and within no more than 12 hours, by the medical superintendent (or his or her medical nominee) (s 29). By s 28 the medical superintendent is obliged (“must”) to refuse to detain a person if of the opinion that the person is not mentally ill or mentally disordered. 
     
      
    148 Where the medical superintendent, under s 29, certifies that a person is mentally ill or mentally disordered, s 32 obliges him/her to arrange for examination by a second medical practitioner who is (if the medical superintendent is not) a psychiatrist; where the second medical practitioner is of the opinion that the person is not mentally ill or mentally disordered, sub-s (3) requires a third examination, again by a psychiatrist. 
     
      
    149 The Mental Health Act then provides different regimes in the case of persons who are found to be mentally ill, and those who are found to be mentally disordered.  
     
      
    150 By s 35 a mentally disordered person may not be detained in the hospital (involuntarily) for a continuous period of more than three days, and must be examined at least once every 24 hours. No more than three detentions, each of three days, are permitted in any one month (sub-s (4)). Even so, where the medical superintendent is of opinion that other care of a less restrictive kind is appropriate and reasonably available, the person must not be further detained in the hospital (sub-s (3)).  
     
      
    151 Special provisions are made for dealing with persons conveyed to the hospital (as was the plaintiff) pursuant to s 24, after apprehension by police (see ss 36, 37). These are designed, so far as I understand them, to ensure that any police action necessary in relation to the events that gave rise to the apprehension may be taken. 
     
      
    152 By s 38 the medical superintendent is obliged, after receiving advice that a person is mentally ill, to bring that person before a magistrate as soon as practicable. This is for the purpose of enabling the magistrate to hold an inquiry under s 41. By s 51, where, having held an inquiry, a magistrate is satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, the person is mentally ill, the magistrate has one of two courses of action open. He or she may order the discharge of the person to the care of a relative or friend if satisfied of that person’s capacity properly to take care of the mentally ill person, or may take other actions which are considered appropriate, including (significantly for present purposes) making a Community Treatment Order. If of the opinion that no other care of a less restrictive kind is appropriate and reasonably available, or that for any reason it is not appropriate to take that course, the magistrate must direct that the person be detained in a specified hospital for further observation or treatment or both, as a temporary patient and for such periods (not exceeding three months) as the magistrate specifies. 
     
      
    153 From the foregoing analysis, it can be seen that the options available to the defendant’s employees depended upon whether the plaintiff was found to be mentally ill, mentally disordered, or neither. If mentally disordered, then, by reason of s 35, he could only be detained for three days. Although the section is not completely clear, it does not appear to envisage consecutive periods of involuntary detention in the circumstances. 
     
      
    154 If, after the implementation of the statutory procedures, the plaintiff had been found to be mentally ill, within the meaning of the Mental Health Act, then his involuntary detention by the defendant would have been authorised only until it became possible to bring him before a magistrate for the purpose of an inquiry under s 41. If at any time pending that inquiry the medical superintendent had formed the view that he was no longer mentally ill, but was mentally disordered, the effect of s 40(1A) is that he could only have been held for three days (excluding weekends and public holidays) pending that course. 
     
      
    155 From that time, the outcome would have been in the hands of the magistrate, and not the defendant’s employees. In other words, it was not open to the defendant’s employees to detain the plaintiff involuntarily, as suggested by Dr Phillips, for longer than three days. Nor would involuntary detention, in the light of his willingness to remain as an informal patient, have been in accord with the philosophy of, or, indeed the command, expressed in s 20, of the Mental Health Act. As a reading of s 131 of the Mental Health Act makes clear, a Community Treatment Order may only be made by the Mental Health Tribunal or a magistrate on the application of an authorised applicant. It was not open to any employee of the defendant to make such an order. The most that any such individual could do would be to apply to a magistrate: however, such an order may be made only by a magistrate in relation to a person in respect of whom the magistrate is holding an inquiry under s 41.  
     
      
    156 It is here that s 43A of the Civil Liability Act is relevant. The Mental Health Act confers only very limited powers upon individuals (such as Dr Tsovolos, or the medical superintendent of Pialla). What it confers upon them are powers that, in appropriate circumstances, if exercised, would result in the referral of the plaintiff to a magistrate for judicial consideration of the options available under s 51 of the Mental Health Act. The medical superintendent was exercising a “special statutory power” within the meaning of s 43A of the Civil Liability Act; but that special statutory power did not extend to detaining the plaintiff for more than three days, nor to making a Community Treatment Order. The course proposed by Dr Phillips was simply not open to any of the defendant’s employees. The most they could do was to take such action as would ensure that consideration was given by the person duly authorised to do so (the magistrate) to those courses of action. 
     
      
    157 Further, it is by no means plain, on the material, that, at relevant times, the plaintiff was either mentally ill or mentally disordered. 
     
      
    158 The definition of mental illness includes suffering from a condition which seriously impairs, either temporarily or permanently, mental functioning, and characterised by the presence, inter alia, of a severe disturbance of mood. I would be prepared to infer from the circumstances of his admission that, at the time he sought to throw himself under a train, the plaintiff did suffer from a severe disturbance of mood. However, that appears to have abated by the time he was examined by Dr Tsovolos, and to continue to abate throughout the duration of his period as an inpatient at Pialla. It is difficult to identify any time at which it would have been open to the medical practitioners to have certified the plaintiff as suffering from a mental illness – that is, as a mentally ill person. His disturbance was diminishing day by day.  
     
      
    159 In cross-examination Dr Phillips recognised this.  
     
      
    160 In one respect, Dr Phillips was misled by a misinterpretation of symbols used by Dr Tsovolos. Dr Tsovolos used a small, elevated open circular symbol to denote “no”. This, she noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        ° 
         FTD [formal thought disorder] 
         
         
        ° 
         psychotic phenomena” 
        
       
       
      Dr Phillips read the symbol as a marker, or dot point, signifying the presence (not the absence) of formal thought disorder and psychotic phenomena. This is obviously a matter of considerable significance in the formation of his opinion. That a basis existed for the plaintiff’s involuntary detention. 
       
      
    161 In applying the test contained in s 43A to the Civil Liability Act, it is necessary to examine the language used by Dr Phillips, even as early as in his first report. He regarded the election to admit the plaintiff as a voluntary patient in a general ward, putting faith in his capacity to make adult and responsible decisions with regard to his own welfare and future as “a significant error of judgment”; and that not choosing to treat him with psychotropic medication at the time “may” also have been an error. He identified a second error of judgment as having occurred on 4 March 2001, following the plaintiff’s complaint of harassment by another patient. However, Dr Phillips appears to have assumed, because the other patient denied the harassment, a “probability” that the plaintiff was experiencing paranoid symptoms, demonstrating further the depth of his psychological disturbance. 
     
      
    162 There were, as Dr Phillips acknowledged, other possibilities – the plaintiff’s account may have been correct, or at least a reasonable perception of what had occurred. In this case, the incident would be no indication of “paranoid symptoms”. The records do not contain any other such indications. 
     
      
    163 Dr Phillips then considered the decision to discharge the plaintiff on 6 March as “premature”, and expressed concern about the absence of evidence of a proper follow up plan. Follow up, he said, should have been “highly assertive” and should have been maintained in conjunction with the plaintiff’s mother. 
     
      
    164 Dr Phillips then considered that “A case could have been made at the time to seek a longer term community treatment order …”.  
     
      
    165 He thought that the plaintiff “almost certainly may have benefited from medication …” and that “there is a reasonable case” that the plaintiff should have received medication. 
     
      
    166 These observations are the high point of the plaintiff’s case in negligence against the defendant. They are not capable of establishing, in the language of s 5O, that any professional employee of the defendant failed to act:  
     
      
       
        
        “… in a manner that … was widely accepted in Australia by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice.” 
        
       
      
    167 S 5O is framed in such a way as to suggest that the onus of proving that a professional acted in a manner that was widely accepted by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice lies upon the person against whom the action is brought, or the allegation made. I recognise that what I have said above may give the appearance of reversing that onus. I have not done so. I am affirmatively satisfied, from the oral evidence of Dr Phillips, and the evidence of Dr Telfer, that Dr Tsovolos in particular, and the other medical staff of Pialla, acted in accordance with practice that was widely accepted in Australia by a peer professional opinion as competent professional practice. It is insufficient to say, as Dr Phillips did, that he would have made different decisions. It is, particularly, insufficient to say, on the basis of after-acquired intelligence, that a particular combination of medications ought then to have been prescribed for the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s stated intention to continue to use alcohol was a contra indication to the prescription of any drugs. 
     
      
    168 Even less are the observations capable of establishing, in the language of s 43A, that the failure to exercise the powers conferred by the Mental Health Act was so unreasonable that no Area Health Service could have regarded it as a reasonable exercise of power. 
     
      
    169 No separate argument was addressed to the asserted failure to provide “counselling or other therapies”. That allegation must also fail. 
     
      
    170 That is sufficient to dispose of this matter. The only order I can make is that there be a verdict for the defendant. Plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs. Exhibits returned.

     GEORGE DAVID MORDAUNT v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS & ANOR 
      
      
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with McColl JA. 
     
      
    2 HODGSON JA: I agree with McColl JA. 
     
      
    3 McCOLL JA: George David Mordaunt, the claimant, seeks orders in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of his Honour Judge Donovan QC to refuse his application for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (the “CCC Act”). He also seeks a declaration that he was entitled to that certificate and an order in the nature of mandamus remitting the matter to the District Court to be dealt with according to law. The active opponent is the Director of Public Prosecutions. The District Court of New South Wales filed a submitting appearance. 
     
      
    4 The application raises issues concerning the CCC Act which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        2 Certificate may be granted  
         
        (1) The Court or Judge or Magistrate in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may:… 
         
          
          (b) where, on appeal, the conviction of the defendant is quashed and:  
           
            
            (i) the defendant is discharged as to the indictment upon which he or she was convicted, or  
            (ii) the information or complaint upon which the defendant was convicted is dismissed,  
            
           
          
         
        grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) For the avoidance of doubt, a certificate may be granted in accordance with subsection (1)(a) following an acquittal or discharge of a defendant at any time during a trial, whether a hearing on the merits of the proceedings has occurred or not. 
        
       
       
        
        3 Form of certificate  
        
       
       
        
        (1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate:  
         
          
          (a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and  
          (b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        3A Evidence of further relevant facts may be adduced  
        
       
       
        
        (1) For the purpose of determining whether or not to grant a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the reference in section 3(1)(a) to ‘all the relevant facts’ is a reference to:  
         
          
          (a) the relevant facts established in the proceedings, and  
          (b) any relevant facts that the defendant has, on the application for the certificate, established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate, and  
          (c) any relevant facts that the prosecutor, or in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, has established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate that:  
           
            
            (i) relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made, and  
            (ii) were not adduced in the proceedings.  
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Where, on an application for a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the defendant adduces evidence to establish further relevant facts that were not established in those proceedings, the Court or Judge or Magistrate to which or to whom the application is made may:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) order that leave be given to the prosecutor in those proceedings or, in the absence of the prosecutor, to any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, to comment on the evidence of those further relevant facts, and  
          (b) if the Court, Judge or Magistrate think it desirable to do so after taking into consideration any such comments, order that leave be given to the prosecutor or to the person representing the Minister to examine any witness giving evidence for the applicant or to adduce evidence tending to show why the certificate applied for should not be granted and adjourn the application so that that evidence may be adduced.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) If, in response to an application for a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the prosecutor or, in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application adduces evidence to establish further relevant facts that were not established in those proceedings, the Court or Judge or Magistrate to which or to whom the application is made may:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) order that leave be given to the defendant to comment on the evidence of those relevant facts, and  
          (b) if the Court or Judge or Magistrate think it desirable to do so after taking into consideration any of those comments, order that leave be given to the defendant to examine any witness giving evidence for the prosecutor or that authorised person.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Statement of the Case 
      
    5 The claimant was charged with assaulting his former wife, Ms Nellie Seba, on 28 November 2001. On 12 February 2002 an interim Apprehended Violence Order was made by the Local Court at Wyong naming Ms Seba as the “protected person” and the claimant as the defendant, being a person with whom Ms Seba “has or had a de facto relationship”. The substantive portion of the interim AVO stated:  
     
      
       
        
        “ORDERS MADE UNDER SECTION 562BC 
         
         
        A. The defendant must not engage in conduct that intimidates the protected person(s) or any other person having a domestic relationship with a protected person(s). 
        
       
       
        
        B. The defendant must not stalk the protected person(s). 
        
       
       
        
        OTHER ORDERS MADE: 
         
         
        1. The defendant must not assault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfere with the protected person(s). 
        
       
       
        
        11. The defendant must not destroy or deliberately damage or interfere with the property of the protected person(s). 
        
       
       
        
        OTHER ORDERS: 
        
       
       
        
        4. Not to go, loiter about metres of the premises at which the protected person(s) may from time to time reside or work or other specified premises i.e. 1035 Ourimbah Creek Road Ourimbah. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The defendant must not approach, contact or telephone the protected person(s) except for the purpose of arranging or exercising contact to children.” 
         
        
       
      
    6 In April 2002 the claimant was charged with six counts of breaching the interim AVO on various dates in April of that year. 
     
      
    7 On 2 May 2002 the claimant was convicted of assaulting Ms Seba on 28 November 2001 and placed on a s 10 bond to be of good behaviour for two years. An Apprehended Violence Order was granted in the same terms as the interim AVO of 12 February 2002. 
     
      
    8 On 8 May 2002 the claimant filed an appeal to the District Court in respect of his assault conviction. 
     
      
    9 On 10 October 2002 the claimant was convicted of four counts of breaching the interim AVO. The other two counts were dismissed. On 28 October 2002 the claimant filed an appeal to the District Court from his convictions for breaches of the interim AVO. 
     
      
    10 Freeman DCJ heard the assault appeal on 5 June 2003. According to a letter written to the claimant by his solicitors, Messrs Conditsis & Associates on 17 June 2003, which the claimant tendered before the primary judge after hearing the evidence and submissions, Judge Freeman adjourned the proceedings until 2pm. The letter continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst the matter was stood down to enable his Honour to consider the submissions, the Crown Prosecutor put forward the following proposal: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) If you were successful in the assault appeal, he invited you to make written representations with a view to the AVO charges (in respect of which you were convicted at Wyong Local Court) being withdrawn, given that, in the event, his Honour would have made certain adverse findings against the credit of Ms Seba. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            If you had been successful in the assault appeal, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that he would recommend that the charges in respect of the alleged breaches of the AVO be withdrawn. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) In the event that you were unsuccessful in the appeal, that the AVO (restraining order) remain in place until it is due to expire, and the Crown would then ‘offer no evidence’ in relation to the AVO appeal and withdraw the breach of the AVO charges. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        After your consideration of the matter, you instructed Mr Conditsis that you would agree to either of the proposals put forward by the Crown, dependent on the findings of his Honour.” 
        
       
      
    11 When he returned to the Bench at 2pm, Judge Freeman found the assault offence proven, dismissed the assault appeal and confirmed the sentence imposed in the Local Court. In so finding he preferred the evidence of Ms Seba whose recollection he described as “impressive”. His Honour said the appellant’s evidence “raise[d] doubts about his conduct on this day.” The Crown then informed his Honour that having regard to the findings he had made in the assault appeal, he had instructions to withdraw the AVO breach charges. He did so by not offering any evidence in relation to the AVO appeal. His Honour then upheld each AVO appeal, quashed the convictions for the AVO breaches and set aside the orders made by the Magistrate consequential upon the convictions. He did not formally dismiss the informations or complaints upon which the claimant was convicted (s 2(1)(b)(ii)) but the opponent properly has not objected to the grant of a certificate on this basis. Indeed the course taken by his Honour conformed to that provided by s 133A of the Justices Act 1902 (since repealed). 
     
      
    12 On 4 May 2006 the claimant wrote to the District Court asking that he be granted a certificate under the CCC Act. The application was listed before the primary judge on 7 June 2006. On that day, his Honour observed that in order for him to determine the matter he would have to know “what all the relevant facts were” and that “to a degree this would appear from the transcripts before the Magistrate”. He also expressed the view that it was “relevant … to know why the prosecution did not continue with the matter after Judge Freeman gave his decision about the common assault”. This view appears to have emerged at least from his Honour’s concern that the AVO breach charges may have been withdrawn because fresh material had come to the prosecution’s attention which, if known to the prosecution at the outset, would have meant the proceedings would not have been commenced (Transcript, 7 June 2006, p14–15; 26 June 2006, p1). He expressed the view that the prosecution should place before him, by way of evidence, the matters it considered relevant to s 3. He then adjourned the matter. 
     
      
    13 The substantive application was heard on 26 June 2006. In the course of the hearing before the primary judge, the claimant handed up a written submission in support of his application. It outlined the circumstances in which he contended the Crown had withdrawn the Apprehended Violence Orders breach charges and attached Mr Conditsis’ letter. Next, it drew the primary judge’s attention to what I understand the claimant to have contended were the “relevant facts” to be taken into account on his s 2 application. It pointed out that the claimant had recounted his version of events before he was charged and asserted “the Police were not interested in [it]”. It complained that the police had failed in their duty to interview the owner of a vehicle (whose registration number they had) in which the claimant was alleged to have driven to his wife’s property in breach of one of the interim Apprehended Violence Orders. That person gave evidence before the Magistrate. In the course of his oral submissions the claimant acknowledged he had been lent this vehicle from time to time, but asserted the owner had had possession of it at the time the claimant was alleged to have used it to drive to Ms Seba’s property. He said the police had refused to investigate this, presumably before the proceedings were instituted. Next, the document drew attention to what the claimant asserted were deficiencies in the evidence before the magistrate who heard the Apprehended Violence Orders breach charges to the effect that two witnesses had asserted he had driven to his wife’s property in a brown car, but the car whose registration number the police had been given was silver. He asserted the witnesses who claimed they had seen him in the car had “fabricated [their] stories”. In a section of the document headed “alleged harassing telephone calls”, whose relevance is difficult to understand, the claimant referred to a complaint apparently received by the Police from Ms Seba about the claimant ringing and speaking to his children with which the Police did not proceed because this conduct was not precluded by the interim Apprehended Violence Order. Later it appears the Police laid, but then withdrew, a charge in relation to Ms Seba’s complaint on this occasion. The claimant submitted to the primary judge that he had “suffered because of this non disclosure”. How he had “suffered” did not clearly emerge from the document. Finally, the document noted that the claimant had not unreasonably prolonged the proceedings, no doubt a submission anticipating s 3(1)(b) of the CCC Act. The DPP did not rely upon s 3(1)(b) before his Honour and this matter can be set to one side.  
     
      
    14 The DPP submitted in essence that the hearing before the magistrate had turned on the respective credibility of the witnesses called by the prosecution and the defendant. 
     
      
    15 In his ex tempore judgment the primary judge summarised each of the AVO breaches the Magistrate had found to be established and referred briefly to the evidence led in relation to each charge. They were, in short (I have added paragraph numbers to his Honour’s judgment for ease of reference): 
     
      
       
        
        “[4] In summary each of the AVO breaches which were found to be established by the Magistrate are as follows: the first breach was on 2 April 2002 charge number 13796144 sequence 1. The allegation was that the appellant attended the complainant’s premises at 1435 Ourimbah Creek Road, Ourimbah. Evidence was given by a witness Chapman, on 4 July 2002 at pages 22 to 57. There was another witness Alex Mordaunt who gave evidence on 3/9/2002 at pages 3 to 15 and a witness Annette Patricia McCain who gave evidence on 3/9/02 at pages 15 to 27. The allegation was that the appellant attended at the victim’s premises in breach of the AVO. The Magistrate found the charge made out and convicted the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        [5] The second charge related to events on 8 April 2002 charge number 1434632 sequence 3. The evidence here was given by Nellie Sebas, the complainant and protected person under the apprehended violence order. The allegation was that at about 12.45pm on 8 April 2002 the appellant contacted the victim by telephone and attempted to carry out conversations about the property between them. The appellant gave evidence before the Magistrate and that evidence was given on 10 October 2002 at page 8 and following. The Magistrate accepted the evidence of the complainant and found the offence proved and convicted the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        [6] The third charge occurred on 17 April 2002, charge number 14346321 sequence 5. The evidence in support of this charge was given by Nellie Sebas on 3 September 2002 pages 39 to 48. The appellant also gave evidence on 10 October 2002 at page 4 and pages 8 to 12. The allegation was that at about 3.15pm on 17 April 2002 the appellant phoned the victim’s telephone which was answered by her daughter. He called at least six times. The daughter then activated a call trace. The bench found that the appellant admitted he made the call. The appellant had argued that the reasons for the call were legitimate. The Magistrate rejected this and found the offence proved and convicted the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        [7] The fourth and final charge also occurred on 17 April 2002, charge 14346321 sequence 6. It was alleged that on the night of 17 April the complainant was at home with her daughter when the telephone rang. The daughter answered the phone, she recognised her father’s voice. The evidence in support of this was given on 3 September 2002 at page 39 to 48 by Ms Sebas. The appellant denied it. The Court accepted Ms Sebas’ evidence. The allegation was that the call was repeated on about nineteen occasions. On the twentieth occasion a Mr Neubauer answered and activated the call trace. Mr Neubauer gave evidence on 4 July 2002 at page 58 and following. The Magistrate found the offence made out and convicted the appellant.” 
        
       
      
    16 After referring to the relevant legislation, the primary judge noted that the Crown did not submit that there was any act or omission of the defendant which contributed to the continuation of the proceedings (s 3(1)(b), CCC Act), so that the issue with which he was concerned was whether s 3(1)(a) had been satisfied. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[13] The matter which concerns me is the condition under subsection 1(a). In order to further understand the prosecution’s position, when the matter was before me on Wednesday 7 June 2006 I gave a direction to the prosecution and indeed to the appellant asking for affidavit evidence about why the prosecutions for the breach of the AVO were not proceeded with and no evidence was offered. While there may have been an inference that having obtained the conviction of the assault, the complainant had achieved what she wanted, it seemed to me it would have been helpful to me to have that evidence. Despite this direction Ms Baht on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions told me that the Crown had decided not to offer any evidence about this matter. In so doing of course the Crown has left itself open to a finding against it in relation to the application. 
        
       
       
        
        [14] Ms Baht said that she was authorised to make a statement from the bar table. I remind the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Crown that such a statement is not evidence. Nevertheless she said that the reason why no evidence was offered and the matters were not proceeded with was that the complainant in the matter had indicated to the Crown Prosecutor that because the conviction for assault was confirmed and because there was potential that the hearing of the breaches of the Apprehended Violence Orders would be adjourned, and because the complainant said she did not want anyone to go through any more stress in relation to the incidents, the Crown did not proceed with the breaches of the Apprehended Violence Orders on appeal before Judge Freeman. Ms Baht said that the DPP had received instructions on 23 June 2006 from the complainant that such a statement could be made to the Court. 
        
       
       
        
        [15] Ms Baht further said that at the time there was discussion between the officer of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the complainant, the complainant was informed that the media might be here today but she was happy for the Crown to inform the Court of her reasons.  
        Even if evidence was put on by way of hearsay affidavit, it would be preferable to the statement made by Ms Baht from the bar table. I cannot take it into account as evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        [16] The appellant has addressed me on a number of matters and also provided a written submission. The appellant’s first statement is that the DPP has not answered why no evidence was offered and the matters were dismissed.  
        The DPP in my view have made a statement giving an answer.  
        The question to me seems to be whether I should accept that. 
        
       
       
        
        [17] The appellant in his submission referred to a letter from the solicitors who appeared for him before Judge Freeman dated 17 June 2003. He says that this letter shows that the Crown Prosecutor put forward a set of proposals at some stage of the hearing. The first proposal was in effect that if the appellant was successful in the assault appeal then the appellant could make written representations with a view to the breach of AVO charges being withdrawn, given that if the assault was dismissed, Judge Freeman would have made certain adverse findings against the credit of Ms Sebas (sic), the complainant. Alternatively, if the appellant was unsuccessful in the appeal against the assault, then the AVO [would] remain in place till it was due to expire and the Crown would then offer no evidence in relation to the breach of [the] AVO appeal and withdraw the breach of the AVO charges. That submission which is in the appellant’s document, is said to flow from the letter from his solicitors, Conditis (sic) & Co, of 17 June 2003. 
        
       
       
        
        [18] The assault appeal was heard before Judge Freeman who adjourned the proceedings until 2pm to enable him to consider the submissions. These are the submissions on the assault appeal. The letter said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Whilst the matter was stood down to enable his Honour to consider the submissions, the Crown Prosecutor put forward the following proposal: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            a. If you were successful in the assault appeal, he invited you to make representations with a view to the AVO charged (in respect of which you were convicted at Wyong Local Court) being withdrawn, given that, in the event, his Honour would have made certain adverse findings against the credit of Ms Sebas (sic). 
            
           
           
            
            If you had been successful in the assault appeal, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that he would recommend that the charges in respect of the alleged breaches of the AVO [be] withdrawn. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            b. In the event that you were unsuccessful in the appeal, that the AVO (restraining order) remain in place until it is due to expire, and the Crown would then ‘offer no evidence’ in relation to the AVO appeal and withdraw the breach of AVO charges.’ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The letter says further: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘After your consideration of the matter, you instructed Mr Conditsis that you would agree to either in (sic) the proposals put forward by the Crown, dependent on the findings of his Honour.’  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [19] There was apparently no question of costs raised at that time. Had costs been raised at that time it may have been that the Crown would have taken a different position. This in my view is a matter which is relevant to my discretion in awarding a certificate or otherwise. 
        
       
       
        
        [20]  
        In any event, I can find nothing inconsistent between what is said in the letter and the explanation given by Ms Baht from the bar table. The two stand together and indeed the reason put forward why the complainant gave certain instructions to the DPP about the breaches of the AVO appeals seems to make commonsense 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        [21] Further, the test that I have to apply under the Act is ‘If the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, be[en] in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings …’. I have had an opportunity to examine the evidence placed before the Magistrate. I note that the Magistrate convicted on that evidence but that is not by any means conclusive about the test in subsection 1(a). Indeed, in one sense it is irrelevant. 
        
       
       
        
        [22] Ultimately I have come to the conclusion however, looking at all the evidence, that there is no basis upon which I could make a finding that if the prosecution had before the proceedings were instituted been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings.  
        Rather, it seems to me looking at the evidence, that it was reasonable for the prosecution, on all the facts that were known to it and all the relevant facts that came out during the hearing, to have instituted the proceedings. It is true that at all times the appellant denied the various breaches but it is not incumbent on a prosecuting authority to accept the appellant’s version. It had a version given to it by a number of witnesses, not just the complainant and therefore it seems to me that in relation to each of the offences it was reasonable having regard to all of the relevant facts for the prosecution to issue the proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        [23] In those circumstances I am unable to grant a certificate in the form required by s 3. There are other factors which weigh against the grant of the certificate. There is a three year delay in the application. Looking at the transcripts it seems likely that if the appeals had been fully heard the appellant would have lost. The merits are against the exercise of my discretion in granting a certificate. The application is refused.” (emphasis added)  
        
       
       
      Issues 
       
      
    17 The claimant raises the following grounds of complaint in his Amended Summons: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “1. His Honour erred in law because he failed to exercise his discretion in accordance with the  
          Costs in Criminal Cases Act  
          1967 s 3. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2. His Honour erred in law because he failed to give proper and adequate reasons of the exercise of his discretion in regards to ‘Facts Issue’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          3. His Honour erred in law [in] not considering the relevant fact that the claimant was 100% successful on appeal and by accepting the DPP unsupported statement from the bar table as ‘commonsense’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          4. His Honour erred in law because there is a real apprehension of bias. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          5. His Honour erred in law because he took into consideration extraneous and irrelevant matters thus his discretion miscarried. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          6. His Honour erred in law by taking into consideration adduced irrelevant unsupported statements from the bar table and drawing inference and conclusions and thus his discretion miscarried. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          7. His Honour erred in law by not affording procedural fairness, natural justice. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          8. His Honour erred in law because he mistakes [sic] the facts.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Submissions on appeal 
       
      
    18 Two matters lie at the heart of the claimant’s complaint and were referred to, either alone or with other matters, in relation to the eight paragraphs of the Amended Summons. The first matter is the claimant’s assertion that the primary judge failed to give detailed consideration to the evidence which grounded his convictions for breach of the interim Apprehended Violence Orders. He submitted that the primary judge erred in law in that he failed to determine “all the relevant facts” (cf Ramskogler v Director of Public Prosecutions & Anor (1995) 82 A Crim R 128 at 135 per Kirby P) and, further, did not decide the “reasonableness issue” (ibid). 
     
      
    19 The claimant complained that the primary judge had not taken the matters set out in his written submission into account in determining whether to grant a s 2 certificate. In this Court the claimant undertook a detailed written analysis of the proceedings before the Magistrate, far more detailed than that placed before the primary judge. 
     
      
    20 The second matter with which the claimant takes issue is the manner in which the primary judge dealt with the circumstances in which the AVO breach charges were withdrawn. The claimant asserts that he (i.e. the claimant) was led to believe that the charges were withdrawn because of deficiencies in the evidence, and that the DPP had “informed the Complainant of this decision”. 
     
      
    21 In support of grounds 3 and 4 the claimant submitted there was a “real apprehension of bias” because the primary judge failed to take into account the fact he had been “100% successful on appeal and by accepting the DPP’s statement from the bar table as ‘commonsense’.” He also relied upon a complaint that he had been denied procedural fairness because he was not given the opportunity to cross-examine Ms Seba about her “instructions” to the DPP, a complaint also made in relation to ground 7. The facts relied upon in this respect were also relied upon in relation to the complaint under ground 6 that the primary judge had taken into consideration irrelevant statements given by Ms Baht from the bar table.  
     
      
    22 The claimant argued that notwithstanding his Honour’s statement that he could not take Ms Baht’s statement into account as evidence, he had nevertheless proceeded to do so and had drawn an inference from her statement about “instructions” given to the DPP by the complainant. He also complained that a fair-minded observer may have reasonably apprehended that the primary judge did not act impartially and without prejudice when he dismissed the claimant’s application because he expressed the view that Ms Baht’s statement “seems to make commonsense.” 
     
      
    23 Another matter which the claimant complained was an irrelevant consideration, was the primary judge’s reference to the fact the claim under the CCC Act had not been foreshadowed when the Apprehended Violence Orders breach charges were withdrawn. The claimant pointed out that the DPP did not raise the issue of costs on that day. He also pointed to the fact that the DPP had not made this submission before the primary judge. He argued that the fact the DPP had not indicated the question of costs was a factor in the decision to withdraw the charges, if relevant, was a factor which told in his favour, rather than the contrary. 
     
      
    24 The claimant further complained he had been denied procedural fairness because despite the DPP informing the primary judge on 7 June 2006 that it would send the claimant copies of transcripts and other material it intended to rely upon, he had not been notified of the “instructions” the DPP asserted it was given by the complainant when the AVO breach charges were withdrawn. As to this, I would merely note that the claimant made no complaint before the primary judge about being caught by surprise by Ms Baht’s statement, and made no application to cross-examine the complainant in relation to the matters attributed to her. This complaint does not, therefore, go to a matter which the Court could entertain on the claimant’s application. 
     
      
    25 Next, and in a somewhat related submission, the claimant complained about the primary judge’s statement (in para [20]) that Ms Baht’s statement could stand together with the letter forwarded to the claimant by his solicitor, most of which was set out in his Honour’s judgment at para [18]. The claimant’s written submissions elaborated on this proposition. He argued that the complainant could not have given the DPP the “instructions” to which Ms Baht referred, because there was no break between the time when the primary judge dismissed the assault appeal and when the DPP withdrew the AVO breach charges. This submission appears to be a complaint that the primary judge misdirected himself on the facts. In my view, this complaint misunderstood the time sequence apparent Mr Conditsis’ letter. Assuming, for present purposes, that Ms Baht’s statement could be taken into account, it is apparent that after Freeman DCJ adjourned to consider the assault appeal, the DPP and Mr Conditsis agreed to the proposals set out in Mr Conditsis’ letter (primary judgment at [18]). All I understand the primary judge to have been saying in para [20] is that the explanation Ms Baht gave as to the circumstances in which the AVO breach charges did not proceed was not inconsistent with the sequence of events described in Mr Conditsis’ letter. 
     
      
    26 The claimant next complained that he had been denied natural justice because the primary judge had said (at [23]) that “if the appeal had been fully heard the appellant would have lost.” This complaint was made in a section of his written submissions headed “aside”, however I understand it to have been a substantive complaint subsumed under paragraph 7 of the Amended Summons. It relied again on the claimant’s belief concerning the circumstances in which the AVO breach charges did not proceed. 
     
      
    27 The claimant also complained that the primary judge erred in taking into account the three year delay in making the application. He points out that the DPP did not rely on this factor. He seeks to explain the three year delay by saying he had been traumatised by the fact he had been arrested as well as the court proceedings. He also submitted that the DPP had not been prejudiced by the delay. 
     
      
    28 The claimant refers to a number of other matters in his written submissions which are not relevant to the application before this Court. Those matters include his complaint that on the day the assault appeal was heard, he understood the AVO breach matters were only listed for mention, details about the family law dispute which, according to the claimant led to the unfortunate sequence of events which culminated in the assault and the AVO breach charges. The claimant also went into some detail to seek to contradict Ms Baht’s statement to the primary judge concerning the withdrawal of the AVO breach charges by reference to information he attributed to the complainant in a Victims Compensation Tribunal claim.  29 Finally, I should refer to the claimant’s submission that a s 2 certificate should have been granted because the “spirit” of the CCC Act is that if all charges are withdrawn the costs of the person charged should be paid. i.e. a s 2 certificate should be granted. As the principles I set out below demonstrate this is not the proper interpretation of the CCC Act. Indeed the grant of a s 2 certificate is only the gateway to the Director-General of the Attorney General’s Department considering whether the making of a payment to the applicant is justified: s 4. 
     
      
    30 The opponent submits that the claimant has not identified any error which would attract relief. He argues that the primary judge specifically addressed both the facts and the reasonableness issues and, having done so, was not satisfied that it would not have been reasonable for the prosecution to have instituted the proceedings had it been in possession of “all relevant facts” before the proceedings were commenced. 
     
      
    31 The opponent submits that on a proper analysis of the primary judgment, the prosecutor’s statement from the bar table was not treated as evidence. He contends that when the passages in his Honour’s judgment in which reference was made to the prosecutor’s statement are taken into account, as well as the primary judge’s consideration of Mr Conditsis’ letter, his Honour had properly concluded that the AVO breach charges had been withdrawn because of a commonsense approach taken by the Crown after taking into account the confirmation of the claimant’s assault conviction. The opponent also argues that having regard to his experience, the primary judge was entitled to conclude that the decision to withdraw the AVO breach charges was a pragmatic, and not uncommon, occurrence in criminal proceedings. He contended that nothing in the manner in which the primary judge had dealt with the matter would have given rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. 
     
      
    32 Next, the opponent submits that the primary judge’s observations about the question of costs not having been raised when the AVO breach charges were withdrawn was a reasonable inference his Honour was entitled to draw from the evidence taking into account his experience as a judge, a former advocate in criminal proceedings and his knowledge of the day-to-day conduct of criminal litigation. 
     
      
    33 The opponent submitted that the primary judge was entitled to take the three year delay in making the application into account as another, and important, factor weighing against the grant of a certificate.  
     
      
    34 Finally, the opponent submitted that the primary judge’s reasons were adequate when regard was had to the substance of what his Honour said and did: Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472 (at 479) per Kirby P. 
     
      
       
      Principles 
      
    35 The grant of a certificate under s 2 of the CCC Act satisfies “a necessary precondition for the exercise by a State officer of the discretions conferred by s 4, the favourable exercise of which may result in the making of a payment from the Consolidated Fund of the State”: Solomons v District Court of New South Wales [2002] HCA 47; (2002) 211 CLR 119 (at [14], [42]) per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ, (at [51]) per McHugh J. Sections 2 and 3 confer both jurisdiction and power on the Court to which an application for a s 2 certificate is made: Solomons (at [42] – [43]) per McHugh J. 
     
      
    36 The following principles can be extracted from the authorities dealing with applications for a s 2 certificate: 
     
      
       
      (a) The CCC Act is reforming legislation with a beneficial purpose designed to confer valuable privileges upon persons who succeed in criminal prosecutions; its provisions should not be narrowly construed so as to defeat the achievement of its general purposes:  
      Nadilo v Director of Public Prosecutions  
      (1995) 35 NSWLR 738 at 743 per Kirby P; see also  
      Allerton v Director of Public Prosecutions 
       (1991) 24 NSWLR 550 (at 559-560) per Kirby P, Meagher JA, Handley JA; 
       
       
      (b) The judicial officer dealing with an application for a certificate need not be the trial judge:  
      R v Manley 
       [2000] NSWCCA 196; (2000) 49 NSWLR 203 (at [61]) per Simpson J (Wood CJ at CL agreeing);  
      Solomons v District Court of New South Wales 
       per McHugh J (at [47], footnote 42); however it is “always preferable for such an application to be made to the judicial officer determining the original proceedings on its merits, or to the Court of Criminal Appeal that hears and allows an appeal”:  
      Manley 
      , per Wood CJ at CL (at [4]), per Sully J (at [49]); 
       
       
      (c) The “institution of proceedings” in s 3 refers to the time of arrest or charge not to some later stage such as committal for trial or the finding of a bill: 
       Allerton  
      (at 558); 
       
       
      (d) The applicant for a s 2 certificate bears the onus of showing it was not reasonable to institute the proceedings; it is not for the Crown to establish, nor for the Court to conclude, that the institution of the proceedings, was, or would have been in the relevant circumstances, reasonable:  
      Manley 
       (at [15]) per Wood CJ at CL;  
      R v Johnston  
      [2000] NSWCCA 197 (heard concurrently with  
      Manley 
      ) (at [17], [29]) per Simpson J (Wood CJ at CL agreeing); 
       
       
      (e) The task of the court dealing with an application under the CCC Act is to ask the hypothetical question, whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings:  
      Allerton 
       (at 559 – 560); the judicial officer considering an application must find what, within the Act, were “all the relevant facts” and assume the prosecution to have been “in possession of evidence of” all of them and must then determine whether, if the prosecution had been in possession of those facts before the proceedings were instituted, “it would not have been reasonable to institute [them]; an applicant for a certificate must succeed on both the “facts issue” and the “reasonableness issue”:  
      Treasurer in & for the State of New South Wales v Wade & Dukes 
       (Court of Appeal, 16 June 1994, unreported, BC9402561) per Mahoney JA (with whom Handley and Powell JJA agreed);  
      Ramskogler  
      (at 134 – 135) per Kirby P;  
       
       
      (f) The hypothetical question is addressed to evidence of all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial; during the trial; or afterwards admitted under s 3A of the CCC Act; all of the relevant facts proved, whenever they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial, must then be considered by the decision-maker:  
      Allerton 
       (at 559 – 560);  
      Manley 
       per Wood CJ at CL (at [9]); the relevant facts include those relevant to the offences charged and the threshold question posed by s 3(1)(a); other facts will also be relevant and admissible going, amongst other things, to the question posed by s 3(1)(b) and to the ultimate question whether, assuming that the court is of the opinion required to be specified, it should exercise its discretion under s 2:  
      Gwozdecky v Director of Public Prosecutions  
      (1992) 65 A Crim R 160 (at 164 – 165) per Sheller J (with whom Mahoney JA and Hope AJA agreed); 
       
       
      (g) Courts should not attempt to prescribe an exhaustive test of what constitutes unreasonableness for the institution of the proceedings within the meaning of s 3(1)(a):  
      Fejsa v R  
      (1995) 82 A Crim R 253 at 255;  
      Manley 
       per Wood CJ at CL (at [13] – [14], however the factors set out in (h) – (n) have been identified as germane;  
       
       
      (h) The reasonableness of a decision to institute proceedings is not based upon the test that prosecution agencies throughout Australia use as the discretionary test for continuing to prosecute, namely whether there is any reasonable prospect of conviction, nor is it governed by the test in s 41(6) of the  
      Justices Act 
       1902 [prior to its repeal] applied by magistrates, namely whether no reasonable jury would be likely to convict; the test cannot be a test of reasonable suspicion which might justify an arrest and it cannot be the test which determines whether the prosecution is malicious:  
      R v McFarlane  
      (Blanch J, 12 August 1994, unreported); app.  
      Manley  
      per Wood CJ at CL (at [12]), per Sully J (at [42]);  
      Regina v Hatfield 
       [2001] NSWSC 334; (2001) 126 A Crim R 169 per Simpson J; and adopted by Blanch AJ (with whom Spigelman CJ and Simpson J agreed) in  
      Regina v Ahmad  
      [2002] NSWCCA 282; 
       
       
      (i) The fact a prosecution may be launched where there is evidence to establish a prima facie case does not mean it is reasonable to launch a prosecution; there may be cases where there is contradictory evidence and where it is reasonable to expect a prosecutor to make some evaluation of that evidence: 
       McFarlane 
      ; app.  
      Manley  
      per Wood CJ at CL (at [12]);  
       
       
      (k) The fact that a court concluded the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction is not necessarily indicative of unreasonableness:  
      R v Williams; ex parte Williams 
       [1970] 1 NSWR 81 (at 83) per Sugarman P (with whom O’Brien J agreed; cf Manning JA (at 85)); 
       
       
      (l) The fact that a court enters a judgment of acquittal in favour of an accused does not mean that it was not reasonable to have prosecuted; sometimes that course is followed rather than to order a new trial if (for example) the accused has already served most of the sentence imposed upon him or her:  
      Fejsa 
       (at 255); cited with approval in  
      Hatfield 
       (at [9]) per Simpson J; 
       
       
      (m) Section 3 calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence, and particularly the extent to which there is any contradiction of expert evidence concerning central facts necessary to establish guilt, or inherent weakness in the prosecution case; matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact finder, whether it be Judge or Jury:  
      Manley 
       per Wood CJ at CL (at [14]);  
      Johnston 
       (at [26] [29]) per Simpson J (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Sully J agreed); it is not sufficient to establish the issue of unreasonableness in favour of an applicant for a certificate that, in the end, the question for the jury depended upon word against word; in a majority of such cases, it would be quite reasonable for the prosecution to allow those matters to be decided by the jury; it would be different where the word upon which the Crown case depended had been demonstrated to be one which was very substantially lacking in credit:  
      R v Dunne 
       (Hunt J, 17 May 1990, unreported); 
       
       
      (n) The mere fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal allows an appeal and enters a verdict of acquittal upon the “unsafe and unsatisfactory” ground, is not necessarily a touchstone for an exercise of the discretion in favour of the applicant:  
      Manley 
       per Wood CJ at CL (at [15]); 
       
       
      (o) In considering an application for a certificate it is relevant to have regard both to the information in the possession of the prosecuting authorities, and the conduct of the defendant, bearing in mind the essentially adversarial nature of a criminal prosecution and the tactical decisions that are legitimately a part of the process:  
      Manley 
       per Simpson J (at [76]) (Wood CJ at CL agreeing); 
       
       
      (p) Section 3(1)(b) recognises that tactical considerations and decisions are legitimate in the defence of criminal charges, and the potential value to an accused person of retaining the element of surprise in the confrontation of prosecution witnesses, or the presentation of the defence case; it will primarily be directed to omissions, for example cases in which defence material has been, for tactical or strategic or other reasons, withheld from the prosecution; it is also wide enough to encompass positive acts such as the (probably more unusual) case where the defence has deliberately in some way misled the prosecution; it is not in every case where defence evidence has been deliberately withheld from the prosecution that a court will consider that the omission to supply the material to the prosecution was not reasonable in the circumstances:  
      Johnston 
       (at [18]); see also  
      Hatfield 
       (at [12]). 
       
       
      (q) Delay in foreshadowing and making the application may be relevant to the exercise of the discretion whether to grant a certificate:  
      Manley 
      , 
        
      per Wood CJ at CL (at [6]), Sully J (at [49]), Simpson J (at [80]);  
      Johnston,  
      [2000] per Sully J (at [10]); 
       
       
      (r) Before a certificate is granted, the judge must have formed an opinion specifying the matters in s 3(1)(a) and (b), and must also exercise the residual discretion, contemplated by s 2, to grant a certificate:  
      Ramskogler 
       (at 140) per Handley JA; (at 142) per Sheller JA; cf  
      Solomons v District Court of New South Wales 
       (at [50]) per McHugh J. 
       
      
    37 In Manley (at [43]) Sully J referred with approval to Sugarman P’s statement in Williams (at 83) that “relevant facts” did not mean “ ‘all’ the relevant facts in any literal or absolute sense” and that “omniscience is not to be attributed to the prosecution in the hypothetical inquiry” and: 
     
      
       
        
        “ ‘All the relevant facts’ means, in my opinion, all the relevant facts as they finally emerge at the trial; the facts in the prosecution’s case but, as well, the facts in the accused’s case as these emerged from cross-examination of the prosecution’s witnesses or from evidence called by the accused. That seems to me the nature of the hypothetical inquiry which is called for by s 3(1)(a).” 
         
        
       
      
    38 It appears to have been Sugarman P’s statement in Williams which prompted the insertion of s 3A into the CCC Act by the Costs in Criminal Cases (Amendment) Act 1971: Second Reading Speech, New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 4 May 1971 at 508; see also Allerton (at 559). It is important not to lose sight of the opportunity given by s 3A to both the defence and the prosecution to adduce evidence additional to that led in the proceedings. It has not been suggested that s 3A imposes a standard akin to “omniscience” on the Crown. The standard is one of reasonableness in commencing the proceedings (s 3(1)(a)) and reasonableness on the part of the defendant to the extent that any act or omission of that person contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings (s 3(1)(b)). 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    39 The claimant seeks relief in the nature of certiorari to remove the proceedings before the primary judge into this Court and to quash his orders. He also seeks a writ of mandamus to compel the primary judge to perform his duty to consider the claimant’s application according to law. The nature of the proceedings before his Honour was clearly such as might attract relief in the nature of certiorari; they affected his legal rights: Hot Holdings Pty Ltd v Creasy [1995] HCA 60;(1996) 185 CLR 149.  
     
      
    40 This is not a merits review. To establish a prima facie entitlement to certiorari the claimant must demonstrate error of law on the face of the record and persuade the Court that the error is such as would warrant the grant of relief, bearing in mind that certiorari is a discretionary remedy: Ramskogler (at 141) per Handley JA. 
     
      
    41 In order to obtain mandamus the claimant had to establish that the primary judge did not perform the duty imposed on him by the CCC Act, or that he was actuated by extraneous considerations, or that in some other respect he proceeded so his determination is “nugatory and void”. It is not for this Court to examine the correctness of his Honour’s decision, or the sufficiency of the evidence supporting it, or of the weight of the evidence against it or of the regularity or irregularity of the manner in which his Honour proceeded: R v War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal; Ex parte Bott [1933] HCA 30; (1933) 50 CLR 228 at (242–243), per Rich, Dixon and McTiernan JJ, (at 245) per Starke J. The fact that the Court cannot review the merits of the application for the s 2 certificate underlines the fact that the claim for a declaration was misconceived. If error attracting prerogative relief is demonstrated, this Court cannot determine whether or not the claimant was entitled to a s 2 certificate. That is a matter for the primary judge: Ramskogler (at 138) per Kirby P. 
     
      
    42 I turn first to the claimant’s complaint that the primary judge was biased bearing in mind the principle that an intermediate appellant court dealing with allegations of apprehended bias, coupled with other discrete grounds of appeal, must deal with the issue of bias first: Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design & Developments Pty Ltd; [2006] HCA 55; (2006) 81 ALJR 352 (at [117]) per Kirby and Crennan JJ (with whom Gummow J agreed on this issue). The claimant asserted the primary judge was disqualified by reason of apprehended, not actual bias. In order to make good that complaint it was necessary that he establish that a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the primary judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question he was required to decide: Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48; (2000) 201 CLR 488 (at [11]) per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; (2000) 205 CLR 337. 
     
      
    43 The complaint that the primary judge displayed bias because he did not take into account that the claimant had succeeded on appeal is without foundation. The s 2 application proceeded on the premise that the claimant’s convictions had been quashed. It was unnecessary for his Honour to refer to this fact. His failure to do so was appropriate, not indicative of bias. The claimant also complains that the primary judge’s bias was revealed in the manner in which he dealt with Ms Baht’s statements from the bar table. It is appropriate, therefore, to consider the complaint of bias (grounds 3 and 4) in the context of the substantive complaint of error in the primary judge’s consideration of the circumstances in which the AVO breach charges were withdrawn (ground 6).  
     
      
    44 The gravamen of this aspect of the complaint about bias was the fact his Honour expressed the view that Ms Baht’s statement from the bar table seemed to be “commonsense”. In my view the fair-minded lay observer would not apprehend that this (in my view) mild comment demonstrated a lack of impartiality. It was a practical observation made by an experienced trial judge well versed in criminal practice and procedure which was supported by the contents of Mr Conditsis’ letter. I would reject the complaint of apprehended bias on the basis of this comment.  
     
      
    45 Further, in my opinion the primary judge did not err in the conclusion he reached concerning the circumstances in which the AVO breach charges were withdrawn. Those circumstances were set out in Mr Conditsis’ letter which makes clear the pragmatic decision made by the Crown Prosecutor on the day. If, as occurred, the claimant failed in the assault appeal the effect was that the AVO remained in place. It was reasonable for the primary judge to infer that in circumstances where the AVO appeal was not listed for hearing on the same day as the assault appeal, the complainant may have been reluctant to return to Court to give evidence. 
     
      
    46 The claimant asserts he believed the Crown did not proceed with the AVO breach charges because of deficiencies in the evidence. There is no support for that in the objective evidence that was before the primary judge. Mr Conditisis’ letter indicates the pragmatic circumstances in which the charges were withdrawn. I am also not satisfied that the primary judge took Ms Baht’s statement into consideration in an impermissible fashion. In an ex tempore judgment his Honour was reciting the material which had been placed before him. He directed himself that he could not take Ms Baht’s evidence into account as it did not constitute evidence. I cannot accept that his Honour having properly directed himself in this respect, immediately contradicted himself by taking it into account. 
     
      
    47 The claimant did not suggest that the circumstances in which the AVO breach charges were withdrawn were an irrelevant consideration. It is appropriate, however, to consider briefly the relevance of the circumstances in which criminal proceedings are terminated to the s 3 exercise. In my view those circumstances can bear on the question of reasonableness to institute the prosecution. Thus in Fejsa (at 257) the Court rejected a submission by the applicant for a certificate that where the Court of Criminal Appeal had held that a jury’s verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory, it must necessarily have been unreasonable to institute the proceedings, while accepting that that “raise[d] fairly and squarely the issue as to whether a certificate … should be issued”. 48 Similarly if on appeal the conviction of a defendant was quashed because a trial judge had failed to direct the jury properly, but a new trial was not ordered because the accused had already served most of his or her sentence (Fejsa, at 255), it would not be open to a Court to find for that reason that it was not reasonable to institute the proceedings.  
     
      
    49 As I have earlier indicated the primary judge was particularly concerned to ascertain whether the AVO breach charges had been withdrawn because new facts had come to light. This was an appropriate concern. In this case, it was relevant, in my view, for the primary judge to ascertain the circumstances in which the Crown had not proceeded with the AVO breach charges to determine the extent to which, if at all, that cast light upon the reasonableness issue. 
     
      
    50 I turn then to the principal complaint, that the primary judge failed to perform his statutory duty. 
     
      
    51 In my opinion it is apparent from the primary judge’s judgment that he was alert to the necessity to consider both the facts and the reasonableness issues although he turned to consider that issue after he had devoted considerable attention to the question of why the Crown had not proceeded with the Apprehended Violence Order breach charges. 
     
      
    52 His Honour’s attention to the latter issue can be understood when regard is had to the somewhat unusual circumstances in which the s 2 application arose, namely the withdrawal of charges on an appeal to the District Court by way of rehearing on the transcripts of the evidence before the Magistrate pursuant to s 132 of the Justices Act as in force in 2003.  
     
      
    53 In such an appeal the Crown bore the onus of proving that the claimant had breached the interim Apprehended Violence Orders; the District Court judge had to determine the matter by reference to the evidence tendered in the Local Court, and any further evidence admitted on appeal: Gianoutsos v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137; (2006) 65 NSWLR 539 (at [42]) per McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Sully and Hislop JJ agreed). If the appeal had proceeded, it fell to be determined in accordance with the principles governing appeals from judges sitting without a jury. The appellate judge had to form his or her own judgment of the facts, while recognising the advantage enjoyed by the Magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court and observing the natural limitations stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record. While the Magistrate’s reasons were not part of the transcript of evidence, recourse could be had to them, on appeal, as otherwise the appellate function could not properly take place: Charara v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244; (2006) 164 A Crim R 39 at [17] – [24] per Mason P (with whom Kirby and Hoeben JJ agreed). 
     
      
    54 The primary judge dealt with the facts and reasonableness issues in paragraphs [4] – [7] and [21] – [22]. His Honour correctly directed himself about the test he had to apply under s 3. The case the claimant sought to advance before the primary judge turned on the proposition that there were witnesses whose evidence constituted “relevant facts” who were not interviewed by the Police prior to him being charged and whose evidence contradicted the evidence the Crown led before the Magistrate. It was for this reason he contended the institution of the proceedings was not reasonable. In my view it is a fair summary of the claimant’s argument before the primary judge that there were contradictory accounts of the events which had led to his conviction, that the police failed to investigate those contradictory accounts and, had they done so, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings. The contradictory accounts were the claimant’s denial that he had breached the interim AVOs and the dispute over whether he or the owner had possession of the silver (brown) car at the relevant time. 
     
      
    55 The primary judge referred to conflicts of evidence when he summarised the evidence led in relation to the second, third and fourth charges and in paragraph [22] of his judgment, noting that while there were conflicting accounts of the evidence in relation to the charges, including the fact that the claimant denied the various breaches, it was not incumbent upon the prosecution to accept his version. His Honour was satisfied, having regard to the evidence before the Magistrate, and the matters upon which the claimant sought to rely, that the Magistrate’s decision had turned on matters of judgment concerning credibility which it was reasonable (had the prosecution been aware of the relevant facts prior to the institution of the proceedings), to submit for determination by the tribunal of fact. This conclusion was open to his Honour. It was a simple proposition which was susceptible to brief disposition.  
     
      
    56 I note that his Honour did not expressly refer to the evidence of the owner of the silver (brown) vehicle. The claimant had sought to resist the first charge by establishing, both through his own evidence, and that of the owner, that he did not have possession of the silver (brown) car at the relevant time. In my view his Honour sufficiently disposed of that issue by referring to the fact the claimant denied the charges and that the police were not required to accept his version over the competing accounts. 
     
      
    57 In this Court, as I have said, the claimant undertook a far more detailed analysis of the proceedings before the Magistrate to seek to demonstrate error by the primary judge. In my view it is not appropriate for the Court to approach the matter on a different basis to the case presented to the primary judge. In essence the “relevant facts” to which the claimant drew attention at first instance was the contradictory evidence to which I have referred. This Court should not embark on a broader inquiry. 
     
      
    58 This conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. However I will deal briefly with the claimant’s other complaints. 
     
      
    59 As to delay, this has been held to be a relevant factor, as the claimant accepted, although views differ as to whether delay per se would militate against the grant of a s 2 certificate or whether there would have to be some prejudice flowing from the delay: see Manley (at [6]) per Wood CJ at CL; cf (at [80]) per Simpson J; see also (at [49]) per Sully J. 
     
      
    60 It was also appropriate, in my view, for the primary judge to consider what would have been the outcome of the AVO appeal had it been fully heard and to express the view that, had the appeal proceeded, the claimant would have been convicted. This was a matter his Honour was entitled to consider on the transcript, material which would have been before him had he been hearing the appeal by way of rehearing. The occasion for having regard to that possible outcome arose from the circumstances in which the AVO breach charges were withdrawn. That having been a pragmatic decision, it was appropriate for the primary judge to consider on the reasonableness issue the probable outcome had that appeal proceeded. It was as relevant to the reasonableness issue (although plainly not determinative) as were the circumstances of the acquittal in Fejsa.  
     
      
    61 It should be emphasised that the last two issues were not determinative of the primary judge’s exercise of his discretion. His Honour had already determined (properly in my view) that the s 3 threshold requirement had not been satisfied, but proceeded to make some additional comments. 
     
      
    62 The fact that the primary judge referred to the fact that the claimant had not foreshadowed a s 2 application when the AVO breach charges were withdrawn appears to me to have been a passing observation, again related to his Honour’s experience. Considerations of costs usually play a significant role in the settlement of civil disputes. In my view the primary judge was entitled to form the opinion that the Crown’s attitude to the withdrawal of the AVO breach charges may have been different if it had understood the claimant would rely upon their withdrawal to make an application under the CCC Act. Equally, it should be said, that was a matter to which the Crown should have been alert. The claimant is correct to say that, there being no evidence either way as to the issue of costs, an inference in his favour was equally available. In the circumstances I would accept that this was an irrelevant consideration, but one which was not determinative in the primary judge’s reasons. Having regard to the conclusion I have reached that the primary judge otherwise performed his duty under the CCC Act I would not, therefore, regard this minor matter as attracting discretionary relief.63 I would also reject the claimant’s complaint about the primary judge’s reasons. In my view he has not demonstrated that the reasons were deficient. Once it is appreciated that the relevant facts the primary judge was required to take into account demonstrated competing accounts of the conduct complained of which turned on the credibility of the witnesses, it was appropriate for his Honour not to undertake a detailed analysis of each of those witness’s evidence to seek to determine whether one, or more, of the witnesses called in the claimant’s case had been clearly more credible than another. It was sufficient that having identified this as the “battle-ground” that he concluded that had the prosecution had all the relevant facts before the proceedings were instituted, it would have been reasonable for the prosecution to submit the conflicting accounts to the tribunal of fact for decision. It is plain that the primary judge had read the evidence and assessed the relative strengths and weaknesses of the witnesses’ accounts of the incidents to reach his view that there were competing versions of the facts said to constitute the AVO breaches. This was the critical issue on which the success of the claimant’s application for a s 2 certificate turned. While the primary judge’s reasons were not lengthy, his Honour in my view discharged the burden of giving adequate reasons having regard to the issues with which he was required to deal. 
     
      
    64 Finally I return to the claimant’s complaint that the “spirit” of the CCC Act is that a s 2 certificate should be granted if all charges are withdrawn. It will be apparent from the principles I have extracted from the authorities that the success of such an application does not turn upon such a simplistic proposition. Rather, the purpose of the CCC Act is to ensure an objective review of the criminal prosecution upon which a person was ultimately acquitted, discharged or had his or her conviction quashed in order to determine whether, in all those circumstances, it was not reasonable that that person should have been exposed to the proceedings in the first place. 
     
      
       
      Law Reform 
       
      
    65 I recommend that the CCA Act be amended to set a time limit for a s 2 application and to require the application to be made to the Court before which the defendant was acquitted or discharged, or which entertained the appeal which led to the defendant’s conviction being quashed. 
     
      
      Order 
      
    66 I would dismiss the Amended Summons with costs.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 IPP JA: The applicant seeks leave to appeal under s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against a decision of Johnson J. By that decision, his Honour dismissed the applicant’s notice of motion for an order staying proceedings against him until the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions paid the reasonable costs that he had incurred in relation to a trial that commenced on 26 March 2006 which aborted when, by order of the majority of this Court on 16 May 2007, the jury was required to be discharged on the ground that one of the jurors was disqualified. I shall refer to this trial as the second trial. 
     
      
    2 The applicant's notice of appeal casts no light on the grounds on which he seeks appellate relief. It merely asserts error on behalf of the trial judge and does not explain what that error is. 
     
      
    3 In written submissions filed on the applicant’s behalf, it was stated that Johnson J wrongly held that the applicant needed to establish fault on the part of the prosecution before an order as sought could be granted. Alternatively, according to the written submissions, if fault is a necessary requirement, it had been established.  
     
      
    4 In oral submissions, Mr Sutherland SC, who, together with Mr Walsh, appeared for the applicant, said that the only ground of appeal was that unfairness had been caused to the accused in the circumstances of the discharge of the jury on the second trial; accordingly, the costs and expenses of the second trial ought to be paid by the Crown before it is allowed to commence the third trial.  
     
      
    5 Mr Sutherland submitted that the relevant unfairness was the fact that the applicant had wasted the costs of the second trial, and this had to be seen against the background circumstances. The background circumstances are these.  
     
      
    6 The applicant was charged with offences alleged to have occurred in 1997 and 1998 whilst he was employed with the Australian Taxation Office. The committal proceedings lasted some 36 days. After he was committed for trial, he challenged the decision so committing him. Although the applicant was initially successful in that challenge before Simpson J with respect to one count, her Honour’s decision was overturned on appeal. The applicant then obtained an order from Sully J for a permanent stay in respect to the first count. This order was again overturned by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The trial proceeded but the jury was discharged as it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. That was the first trial. 
     
      
    7 The second trial commenced before Johnson J on 26 March 2007 and continued, as I have said, until 7 May 2007. On that date, a juror failed to attend court. It was discovered that he had been arrested on a driving offence, that he was disqualified from driving and that he had so been disqualified when the jury was empanelled. Under the Jury Act 1977 (NSW), he was, accordingly, disqualified from being a juror. As I have explained, this led to the second trial being aborted. 
     
      
    8 Another matter that the applicant says is part of the background concerns an amount of some $785,000 that the applicant expected to receive from a litigation funder to finance the third trial. In a complex series of transactions, including transfers of funds that were made in error, the funds the applicant expected to receive were not transferred to him but ended up in the hands of another party. This led to litigation, the result of which was that the party who, according to the applicant, would have transferred the $785,000 to him, was held entitled to the money. 
     
      
    9 On 14 May 2007, however, before the funds could be transferred to the applicant, the Australian Taxation Office issued a notice under the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth), in effect, freezing the money. This, for the time being, prevents the applicant from having access to these funds and, effectively, prevents him having access to them before the commencement of the third trial which is scheduled to take place in some two weeks’ time. 
     
      
    10 The nub of the applicant’s submission is that the combined effect of having to pay his lawyers for the eight weeks for which the second trial endured, and the loss of the funds caused by the Australian Taxation Office’s freezing notice, is that he has been placed “in an invidious situation to be able to continue funding for the commencement of a new trial expected to last some four months.” He contends that what has occurred has resulted in serious unfairness to him in the trial proceedings. 
     
      
    11 Johnson J’s decision to refuse to grant the temporary stay was a discretionary one. The ground of appeal given orally by Mr Sutherland does not assert that his Honour committed any error of law. The principles governing a discretionary appeal were stated by Kitto J in Australian Coal and Shale Employees’ Federation and Anor v The Commonwealth (1953) 94 CLR 621 (at 627) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I shall not repeat the references made in  
        Lovell v Lovell 
         [(1950) 81 CLR 513 at 532 to 534] to cases of the highest authority which appear to me to establish that the true principle limiting the matter in which the appellate jurisdiction is exercised in respect of decisions involving discretionary judgment is that there is a strong presumption in favour of the correctness of the decision appealed from, and that that decision should therefore be affirmed unless the court of appeal is satisfied that it is clearly wrong. A degree of satisfaction sufficient to overcome the strength of the presumption may exist where there has been an error which consists of acting upon a wrong principle, or giving way to extraneous or irrelevant matters, or failing to give weight or sufficient weight to relevant considerations, or making a mistake as to the facts. Again, the nature of the error may not be discoverable, but even so it is sufficient that the result is so unreasonable or plainly unjust that the appellate court may infer that there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance:  
        House v The King 
         (1936) 55 CLR 499 [at 504 to 505].” 
        
       
      
    12 According to the oral ground, no error of in principle is asserted. Thus, that ground can only succeed if the result of his Honour’s decision is so unreasonable or plainly unjust that this court might infer that there was a failure properly to exercise the discretion conferred on the judge. On the other hand, if one is to approach the matter on the basis that the arguments contained in the written submissions remain alive, then it is arguable that there was an error of principle on the part of his Honour. 
     
      
    13 I shall deal with the latter question first (that is, whether there has been an error in principle as argued in the written submissions). This question is whether the test for granting the relief sought required the applicant to prove that the unfairness he alleged was caused by fault on the part of the prosecution.  
     
      
    14 Johnson J applied the test enunciated by Fullerton J in R v Selim [2007] NSWSC 154 where her Honour said (at [57]): 
     
      
       
        
        “I am content to proceed on the basis that there needs to be demonstrated an identifiable injustice for which it can be sensibly said that prosecuting authorities should be held responsible before a temporary stay is ordered, given that the effect of ordering a stay is to impose on them the costs of previous proceedings before they may be permitted to prosecute again.” 
        
       
      
    15 I shall assume that Johnson J understood Fullerton J’s reference to an identifiable injustice to incorporate fault on the part of the prosecution.  
     
      
    16 It is well settled that the Court possesses powers to stay criminal proceedings in order to prevent injustice (which I understand to include unfairness) to the accused.  
     
      
    17 In determining whether a stay should be granted in the exercise of this power, the focus will be on the misuse of the court’s process by those responsible for law enforcement. As a general proposition, default or impropriety on the part of the prosecution can, depending on the circumstances, be so prejudicial to an accused that the trial is made an unfair one. The touchstone in every case is fairness. The power is to be exercised only in the most exceptional circumstances. These propositions are taken from Jago v The District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23, in particular, the judgment of Mason CJ at 25 and following, Brennan J at 45 to 47, Deane J at 56 to 58, Toohey J at 71 to 72 and Gaudron J at 74 and 77. 
     
      
    18 In R v Mosely (1992) 28 NSWLR 735, Gleeson CJ, with whom Kirby P and Mahoney JA agreed, dealt with a case where, on the morning of the hearing without prior notice to the respondent or his legal representatives, the Crown prosecutor applied for an adjournment because two police officers who were material witnesses and who were to give evidence on that day had unexpectedly been diverted to other duties. 
     
      
    19 The trial judge formed the view that the Crown should have the adjournment that it sought, but only on terms that it paid the respondent’s wasted legal costs. His Honour decided that to grant an adjournment, in circumstances where the respondent would have to bear such costs, would be unfair and oppressive to the respondent. His Honour took the view that, provided this unfairness could be remedied, the interests of justice required that the adjournment be granted. He believed that he had the power to remedy the unfairness in this way. 
     
      
    20 On appeal to this Court, Gleeson CJ held that the trial judge had had no power to make the order for costs in question. That order was, therefore, set aside. Nevertheless, Gleeson CJ accepted that the trial judge had the power to protect the respondent from unfairness by granting the adjournment subject to an appropriate order for costs. His Honour said (at 740 to 741): 
     
      
       
        
        “The adjournment which the Crown asked for and obtained would, in the particular circumstances, have caused unfair prejudice to the respondent unless the respondent could by some means be given protection in respect of costs.” 
        
       
       
      As I have indicated, the “particular circumstances” included fault on the part of the prosecution in failing to ensure the presence of material police witnesses. 
       
      
    21 Accordingly, the Court ordered that the proceedings be stayed until the costs thrown away as a result of the adjournment were paid to the respondent. 
     
      
    22 In R v Fisher (2003) 56 NSWLR 625, Santow JA said (at 626): 
     
      
       
        
        “The important factor common to both  
        R v Mosely 
          
        and the present case is fundamental unfairness in permitting the Crown to proceed to trial, in the present case moreover a third trial, where it is the Crown’s fault, of a relatively serious kind, that the defence has earlier been put to wasted costs which the Crown does not agree (or undertake) to pay.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour agreed with the order proposed by Simpson J that the trial be stayed until the prosecution paid the reasonable costs incurred by the applicant in relation to the trial. The basic reason for his Honour’s decision was that the Crown was seriously at fault in causing the defence to incur wasted costs. I do not understand Santow JA to have said anything different to the general approach expressed in  
      Jago 
        
      in regard to the circumstances under which the Court would act in granting a stay of proceedings. His Honour, in his reasons, was indeed focusing on the misuse of the court process by the prosecution. I do not understand the reasons of Simpson J in the same case to be based on any different approach: see, in particular, 634 [47]. 
       
      
    23 The authorities to which I have referred establish that the power of the court to grant a stay, permanently or temporarily, stems from the court’s power to prevent injustice or unfairness in the trial in a case where a temporary stay is sought, subject to the prosecution paying costs. In my opinion, practically speaking, unfairness cannot be established without proof of fault on the part of the prosecution.  
     
      
    24 In the circumstances that I have outlined, and on my understanding of the law as I have explained it, Johnson J did not commit any error of principle. 
     
      
    25 The conclusion that unfairness cannot be established without proof of fault on the part of the prosecution disposes of the applicant’s main argument. I shall, nevertheless, deal with the other points raised.  
     
      
    26 His Honour expressed the view that the circumstances under which the jury came to be discharged in the second trial disclosed no fault on the part of the prosecution. Although the applicant apparently seeks to challenge this finding, Mr Sutherland – when pressed – did not submit that there was negligence on the part of the prosecution resulting in the termination of the second trial and did not submit that there was any impropriety on the part of the Australian Taxation Office in freezing the funds. I, therefore, conclude that Johnson J did not err in finding that there was no fault on the part of the prosecution. 
     
      
    27 In submitting orally that fairness demanded that the application be granted, even without fault on the part of the prosecution, Mr Sutherland argued that the second trial aborted by reason of a fault in the machinery of the administration of justice leading to the commencement of a criminal trial. He distinguished between a fault in the machinery, in this context, and fault on the part of the prosecution. 
     
      
    28 The machinery whereby jurors are selected involves a self-selection process in the appointment of a panel of jurors. Mr Sutherland accepted that a questionnaire relating to the qualification of jurors was sent out at some stage prior to the disqualified juror being appointed to the panel. There is no evidence as to the particular stage at which this occurred. There is also no evidence as to whether the Sheriff conducted any investigation, as to the qualification of the jurors, prior to the empanelment of the jury. 
     
      
    29 For this reason, in my opinion, the unfairness asserted, if it exists, has to be regarded as an unfortunate occurrence in the ordinary routine of litigation. It arose by reason of the juror’s failure to disclose that he was disqualified. No other person was shown to have done anything wrong in this respect. In my opinion, what occurred is not so extraordinary as to justify the exceptional remedy sought. 
     
      
    30 As regards the freezing of the funds, Johnson J held that the evidence did not demonstrate that the action of the Australian Taxation Office in freezing the funds was related to the trial and the conduct of the Crown in the trial. His Honour said that the taking of such action by the Australian Taxation Office followed investigatory steps taken in, and after, November 2006. I have noted that the applicant does not contend that such action by the Australian Taxation Office was, in some way, improper. 
     
      
    31 I would add that the evidence before this court does not establish that the applicant is unable to fund the costs of the third trial.  
     
      
    32 Mr Sutherland drew attention to evidence from a solicitor, acting for the applicant, who stated that, as at 21 May 2007, he had no funds available in his trust account to meet the defence costs of what was expected to be a four-month trial. Mr Sutherland also referred to an affidavit by an officer of the litigation funder which is financing the trial at the instance of the applicant. This person indicated that the question whether funding would be available was uncertain, but, were it to become available, the arrangements necessary for that to occur would take some two months. 
     
      
    33 None of this evidence bears on the applicant’s personal financial position and he has said nothing about that to this Court. 
     
      
    34 In the circumstances, having found that his Honour made no errors of principle or fact, I come to the inevitable conclusion that the applicant has not met the requirements for a successful appeal of this kind. Not only was the decision his Honour made well open to him, it was correct. I would refuse the application for leave to appeal. 
     
      
    35 LATHAM J: I agree and I agree with the reasons given by Ipp JA. 
     
      
    36 FULLERTON J: I also agree. 
     
      
    37 IPP JA: That will be the order of the Court.

    JUDGMENT1. The young offender has pleaded guilty to three very serious offences. One is assault with intent to rob armed with an offensive weapon with wounding. That is an offence contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum of twenty-five years imprisonment. The other two are both armed robberies with an offensive weapon contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act and each of them carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. In respect of the s 98 armed robbery with wounding, that crime carries a standard non-parole period of seven years.2. I refer to the young person or the young offender because he is entitled to the protection of the law which requires that his identity not be disclosed. The young person was born on 31 August 1988 so that he has turned eighteen now. He was committed for sentence on 24 July 2006 from Campbelltown Children’s Court having been arrested on 22 November 2005 and he has been in custody continuously from that date in respect of the matters for which I am sentencing him.3. At the time of the offences for which I am sentencing him, the young person was subject to two good behaviour bonds imposed by the Campbelltown Children’s Court on 16 May 2005. There is also a document entitled Form 1, a list of additional charges, issued pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 containing four offences which I propose to take into account when I sentence the young person in respect of the assault with intent to rob armed with an offensive weapon with wounding. 4. I first turn to a brief consideration of the facts of each offence. For completeness I commence with the offences which are the subject of the Form 1. Each of those four offences was committed on 20 September 2005. Three of the offences are robbery in company and the fourth is attempted robbery in company. Briefly, on that day the young person was at school with some friends. One of the friends thought that his, the friend’s, girlfriend had a mobile phone which had been stolen. She was attending another school. The young person joined his friend and others to go and look for the person who, they had thought, had stolen the girlfriend’s phone. They got to an area called Glen Alpine and were driving past the Glen Alpine golf course when they saw some young men on the golf links looking for golf balls. One of the co-offenders assaulted by slapping and punching one of the young men whilst the other co-offenders stood around. A bumbag was stolen from one of the young men.5. The young person’s role in the robbery was to keep a lookout and provide physical presence. Another young victim had his mobile phone stolen and a third one had his mobile phone stolen. The young person accepts that his participation in the offences was being present at the time of their commission with the knowledge that they were being committed and he intentionally assisted the co-offenders by acting as a lookout and by his physical presence. He received no property from the offences and made no demands of any of the victims and did not physically assault any of the victims. They were the circumstances of the Form 1 offences. I note that there is a victim impact statement provided by a young person who was one of the victims. He said that since the robbery he has become more wary during the day, always watching behind himself. He never used to worry about things such as this because he did not think that they could happen in Australia. He used to feel safe.6. I turn now to the facts of one of the armed robberies, which occurred at an establishment called Bernie’s Take Away at Leumeah. It occurred on 9 November 2005. The young person and two co-offenders were driving around looking for a suitable business to rob. They identified Bernie’s Take Away. The young person and the co-offender got out of the car and went to Bernie’s, which contained a number of customers and some employees. Amongst the customers were girls aged eleven, twelve, fourteen, seventeen and eighteen. As the young person and the co-offender were entering the store the co-offender was yelling out to the customers at the front of the store, “Get the fuck inside”. The young person and the co-offender entered the store brandishing machete style knives described by witnesses as being around thirty to forty centimetres in length and one and a half to three inches wide. They demanded the money.7. The young person attempted to jump over the counter but the counter broke. The customers were told, “Don’t look at us, don’t look at us, look down”, as well as, “Shut your fuckin’ eyes, get down, just stay there”. The young person and the co-offender obtained almost $2,000 from the till. None of the victims suffered any injuries as a result of the incident. The young person had his face covered and was carrying a machete. Needless to say, the circumstances of that armed robbery must have been terrifying for everyone involved. It would be almost a nightmarish experience.8. The second armed robbery was similar. It occurred the next day, on 10 November 2005. This time the target was a Domino’s Pizza shop. They had jumpers to disguise themselves and socks on their hands. The young person was accompanied by a co-offender. Once again the young person was carrying a machete, this time on the inside of his pants beside his leg. They crossed the road and went towards the Domino’s Pizza. The co-offender kept guard. The young person entered the store, jumped the counter and produced the thirty centimetre long machete. He was wearing a blue hooded jumper. He held the knife at two victims, one of them was a sixteen year old. He demanded money. The employee gave him money from the register. Then he demanded money from the safe. He jumped back over the front counter and left through the front door. This time they secured about $500 in cash. Once again it must have been a nightmarish experience for those who were involved.9. The most serious offence, the armed robbery with wounding, occurred at a place called Woodbine on 21 November 2005. Once again the young person was with a co-offender. They discussed doing a robbery. They drove around Campbelltown looking for a suitable store. They found one which was called the Woodbine Neighbourhood Store. It was between 8.00 and 8.15 at night. Once again the young person walked towards the store carrying a machete on the inside, this time, of his jumper. A Mr Pham and his mother were the only employees working at the store and there were two young girls aged seventeen and twenty who were customers looking for lollies to buy.10. The young person entered the store with his machete, jumped onto the counter and said repeatedly, “Where’s the money?” He jumped off the counter, approached Mr Pham holding the machete while the girls left the store fearing, understandably, for their safety. They hid next door. Mr Pham grabbed hold of the blade of the machete that was being carried by the young person. They struggled and the young person kept holding the machete although he did not pull on it during the struggle. Mr Pham received a deep laceration to his right hand which severed his fingers. On this occasion no property was taken.11. It is appropriate to note here that I have two medical reports from Associate Professor Graham Gumley, hand, wrist and microsurgery, who treated Mr Pham. One of the reports records that Mr Pham was admitted to Liverpool Hospital on 21 November 2005 with severe injuries to his right hand. He had machete lacerations producing deep lacerations on the flexor aspect of his right index, middle and ring fingers with division of nerves, arteries and the multiple tendons to these digits. He required extensive surgery. The doctor said that it was indeed a severe injury to the right hand and despite the surgery it will leave him with a degree of permanent impairment. In a more recent report, 16 February this year, Dr Gumley noted that Mr Pham exhibited substantial impairment of the nerve function of his right index, middle and ring fingers. He was going to assess him again but if there was no improvement on the next time then the doctor concluded that Mr Pham would indeed have substantial hand impairment based on those injuries, since loss of sensation at this level would render fine motor tasks, and many of the hand functions, either unsafe or not possible. This is a very serious consequence of the offence committed by the young person in this particular case.12. The young person had a criminal record. On 16 May 2005 he had been dealt with at the Campbelltown Children’s Court in respect of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray. He had in respect of each offence received bonds of twelve months to date from 16 May 2005. Hence the bonds expired on 16 May 2006 and he was subject to the bonds at the time that he committed the offences with which I am dealing.13. I turn now to a brief review of the evidence which was called before me. The young person went into the witness box and told me that he is presently in the Baxter Detention Centre. He likes sport and he is presently studying his HSC, doing English, visual art, sports, lifestyle and recreation, biology and music. His mother had died in 1997 in a car crash and he did not know very much about her but knew that he was loved by her. After his mother died he stayed with his grandmother because his father was not around. He stayed with his grandmother up until he went into custody. He said that it was a different lifestyle with his grandmother, it was strict in a good way. He meant that the lifestyle involved church, chores, cleaning, everything. He repeated it was strict in a good way.14. He told me about a particularly traumatic event when a friend of his called Jeremiah died on 23 October 2005 as a result of a stabbing. The young person described Jeremiah as more than a friend, he was like a big brother to him. He heard the news about the stabbing and went to the scene and was there at the scene when his friend Jeremiah apparently died from his stab wounds. The next day he met up with his friends at school and they all went down to the spot where Jeremiah had died and had a drink. This re-occurred over the following days, he met with his friends and they kept drinking. They were drinking, said the young person, because they were stressed and depressed about the death of Jeremiah. He then continued to drink every day, more than twenty cans of mixed bourbon and cola. He was still drinking up to the time of the offence and claimed that before the offence at Woodbine he had had more than thirty cans.15. Asked how he felt he said he felt very sorry and very hurt, very sorry for each victim and he would like to apologise to them personally if they were here. He understood the extent of the injuries caused to Mr Pham and indeed I recommended that he read the medical reports and this he did. Once again he repeated his regret for the injuries and damage which were caused by his behaviour. Asked what the reason was for his robberies, he said it was for money for alcohol. 16. The young person preferred being at Baxter. He had previously been at Cobham. He preferred Baxter because there were lots of opportunities, TAFE courses, sporting events and school. His goals are to achieve the HSC and to get a good job when he gets out and to play sport. He says that he has grown up a lot whilst he has been in custody. He feels he is more mature about his attitude and is able to make more mature decisions and right choices. He said on his release he wants to go back and return to living with his grandmother and to look after her. He has been engaged in counselling whilst he has been in custody. He acknowledged that he had been involved in the planning of the various offences and that he had had the idea of doing the robbery at the Woodbine Neighbourhood Store. He agreed that he had instigated that whole offence including finding a suitable target and arranging for his co-offender to drive to the store. He acknowledged that he was on a good behaviour bond at the time of the offences. 17. There is a particular person involved in the young person’s rehabilitation whilst in custody called Mr Strachan. He has been seeing him from May through to October for weekly sessions. In other words, he had been seeing Mr Strachan as a result of the conditional bond which had been imposed upon him at the Campbelltown Children’s Court in May. Cross-examined by Mr Kotsis the young person acknowledged that instead of committing the offences when he became distressed about the death of his friend Jeremiah he could have gone to Mr Strachan but that he was not thinking straight. He could have gone to his teachers as well. He said that he has now learned from his mistakes. He acknowledged a fairly telling question asked by Mr Kotsis about the fact that he had previously given a court at Campbelltown an undertaking that he would not commit offences again. He acknowledged the hurt which he had caused to his family. 18. Mr Strachan was called by Mr Gunning who appeared for the young person. He is a juvenile justice officer attached to the Campbelltown District Office of the Department of Juvenile Justice. He has been involved with the young person since the bond was imposed in May 2005. He said that up until these offences he could not fault the young person in any way during his period of supervision. In fact he thought very highly of him. He was very commendable about his efforts at keeping appointments. He has spoken with a lot of members of the department and counsellors who have worked with the young person. He noted that everywhere that the young person has gone in the system whilst he has been in custody his behaviour has been what he described as uniformly excellent. He has not been faulted on one occasion. He said that in itself is pretty amazing. Considering the type of young person that would normally come into the juvenile justice system as a result of these offences they are usually apt to be violent or resistant. That has not been demonstrated one bit by this young person. In fact Mr Strachan said it has been compliance all the way. The young person has acted as a leader, a role model for younger prisoners. He did that at Cobham and is doing it again at Baxter. By past performance Mr Strachan thought that he had grown up a lot. He has been thinking about what he has done and certainly talked at great length to Mr Strachan realising how much he has harmed his victims and he is very, very ashamed.19. The counselling he has engaged in gave Mr Strachan a certain amount of hope that the young person will be able to work through the issues that he needs to work through. It is very important that he continues to focus on counselling in the juvenile justice setup. He says it is extremely important for the very reason that he is now eighteen years of age. If he gets released to the community he knows that if he goes down this path again he is looking at lengthy periods of incarceration. So, as Mr Strachan said, we make it our utmost priority to work on these issues in custody to make sure that he does not relapse into re-offending. The counselling will start intensively as soon as the sentence is imposed. Such counselling is vitally important. If his issues are not addressed, further offending could eventuate. As Mr Strachan said, they will continue to assist him whilst he is in their custody.20. Asked of his assessment of his rehabilitation prospects if he remains within as a juvenile offender, Mr Strachan said he thought the young person’s prospects will be very good. He said that because he is performing excellently already, when he is going to be released they would like to see a parole order. He did not offer a guarantee that the young person would be completely rehabilitated but was very hopeful with good reason that this would occur. I should add here that I was very impressed by the evidence of Mr Strachan, by his commitment to his work and in particular by his commitment to this young person’s welfare.21. Mr Strachan returned to give evidence to me on 25 May 2007 and noted that the young person had had a lot more time to reflect in custody regarding the choices in his life and that he had a firmer realisation of the consequences of his wrong behaviour. He said that the programs in custody are much more intensive than community based programs and that he is unlikely to re-offend if he takes on board what he has been taught in custody. Evidently the young person has told Mr Strachan that he thinks his best chances of future employment are in the building trade and there are facilities in Baxter for trade training which he can undertake once he has been sentenced. 22. I also heard evidence from the young person’s sister who indicated that the young person wishes to go home to his grandmother’s place.23. Turning briefly to the exhibits, I note exhibits B and C, which are references, are provided before the young person’s offending behaviour on this occasion. They were provided in support of his sentence in Campbelltown in May of this year and record that he is very sorry for what he has done and demonstrates genuine remorse. As Mr Kotsis has invited me to do, I take those into account in assessing the genuineness of the young person’s remorse. I do, however, find that he is genuine this time in his remorse. His behaviour has been much more extreme and the consequences have been much more severe. This time he has been incarcerated for some considerable period of time and confronted by a good deal of treatment in the form of counselling. I expect that this has brought about a more realistic realisation of what he has done and the consequences.24. I note that I have read the contents of exhibit D and I have taken the contents of exhibit D into account and I direct that exhibit D not be opened - I have resealed it - except by order of a judge of this court or a superior court. 25. I have read the juvenile justice report prepared by Mr Strachan and a co-officer. They note the history of his friend Jeremiah being stabbed to death and record that the young person became deeply traumatised, distressed and depressed by this event so that he lost all hope for the future, hence he started drinking and got drunk every day. He expressed to the officers his remorse for the pain and trauma caused to the victims and his desire to apologise to the victims face to face, as well as acknowledging that some of the victims would give them cause to dislike or be suspicious of people of Pacific Islander origin. He also acknowledged that he had hurt his family.26. It is recorded that the young person’s mother died aged thirty-four in a car accident in 1996 and he has a number of siblings, brothers and sisters. He attended Sarah Redfern High School as a year eleven student in 2005. It also noted that the young person’s father has established contact with the young person at Baxter in the last few weeks, or at least in the last few weeks before 8 March 2007, and has visited him. Discussions with teaching staff at Cobham and Baxter confirm that the young person is one of the best behaved students at the school. He works well in class, he is rarely distracted and is currently studying for his HSC. His academic progress has been attributed by his teachers to the provision of appropriate structures and supports in custody as well as his inability to access alcohol and other drugs.27. He had been actively involved in sport whilst he was at school and attended the Minto Youth Centre where he provided some guidance and acted in the role of a peacemaker when there was friction. When he was previously under supervision he regularly attended his appointments. Once again those officers involved in his detention describe his behaviour as being exceptional and a role model for other detainees. Looking at areas requiring attention, it noted that the young person has suffered significant personal grief and abandonment issues as well as dislocations. Supervision by this, or an age appropriate supervising service, should seek to address these issues.28. There was a report from the South West Sydney Psychological Services under the hand of Terry Smith, clinical psychologist. He said that the emotional collapse suffered by the young person has precipitated his offending behaviour. The young person impressed the psychologist as a man whose personality is positive but whose identity is poorly formed. He discussed counselling and the young person felt it would be of benefit for issues such as substance abuse, vocational guidance and grief. The psychologist was of the opinion that the young person would be immeasurably assisted if he could gain an apprenticeship such as plumbing, concreting or carpentry and be mentored through an organisation such as the PCYC or someone whom he respects. The prognosis for the young person was considered by Mr Smith to be positive. His prospects of rehabilitation are considered excellent given his positive value system, his aspirations and the incessant psychological momentum to make something of his life. Evidently the current offences have caused a profound awakening for him and he has taken the opportunity to engage in counselling and to progress his education. 29. Mission Australia is prepared to work intensively with the young person post release to assist him in achieving his goals and to help him reintegrate back into mainstream society.  30. I have read exhibit 3, which is a letter from the young person to the judge who would be presiding over his sentencing. I also read the impressive collection of certificates of achievement which the young person has attained during the period of his custody.31. I turn now to the submissions. Mr Gunning addressed the Glen Alpine Form 1 matters first and pointed out that it should be acknowledged that the young person was not directly involved in the sense that he was not assaulting or demanding belongings from the victims and that his actions were limited to being a lookout. Nor did he receive any property and he had just turned seventeen at the time of the offence. He also made full admissions to the police. I accept those submissions. There are clearly objective aspects of the Glen Alpine offences which render the offending behaviour less serious compared to the offending behaviour of those colleagues who were with him.32. Turning to the two armed robberies, Bernie’s Take Away and Domino’s Pizza, Mr Gunning first addressed the guideline judgment in Regina v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. He highlighted the criteria by reference to which that guideline judgment might operate and submitted that the guideline judgment is not indicative of the range of appropriate sentences for various reasons, one being that the young offender was a child at the time of these offences. I note in this regard that the guideline judgment is, as the authorities suggest, just that, a guideline. It is not appropriate to approach it as one would construe a statute as to whether it is applicable to a particular circumstance or not. It is relevant to take into account so far as under age offenders are concerned, or children I should say, but clearly its impact will also be affected by the various other factors which must be taken into account when sentencing a young person. One of those that was drawn to my attention by both Mr Gunning and Mr Kotsis is of course s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 which I take into account.33. Mr Gunning submitted that the starting point for any sentences of imprisonment in respect of the armed robbery should be significantly less than the guideline of four to five years full term. Mr Kotsis also reviewed the criteria referred to in Henry and pointed out their applicability to this particular offence and highlighted, for example, that there was a degree of organisation or planning which exceeded that which might be expected to be associated with the kind of offence to which the guideline would normally apply. Nevertheless, I accept because of the impact of s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act that the starting point of sentences would be below those which would normally be the case with the guideline.34. In looking at the sentencing options in respect of Bernie’s Take Away and Domino’s Pizza, Mr Gunning pointed out that they could be dealt with under Div 4 Pt 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act because they were not serious children’s indictable offences and he pointed to the factors which the court might consider relevant. Mr Kotsis also dealt with those issues and highlighted the seriousness of the offences in this particular case, the nature of the offences including the fact that they were carrying large machete knives, or at least the young person was, they were in company and what he described as the brazen, objective criminality. Also he was seventeen years and three months old for two of the offences and was the subject of good behaviour bonds. I accept the submissions of Mr Kotsis in this regard and I propose to deal with the two armed robbery offences according to law. 35. In the case of the Woodbine offence under s 98, that is an offence which I must deal with according to law because it is a serious children’s indictable offence.36. Mr Gunning addressed the non-parole period and special circumstances in respect of the two armed robberies and said that greater significance should be placed upon the young person’s rehabilitation when fixing the minimum term given that his prospects are assessed as excellent. He said the special circumstances for adjusting the relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of the term are the young person’s age and his prospects of rehabilitation and the importance of a case plan being able to be developed successfully for him. He pointed to s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act on the question whether the court should direct that the young person serve the whole or part of his sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender. His submission was that it would be appropriate to do so. He pointed out that the effect of s 19(2) of that Act is if the court sets a non-parole period that ends no later than six months after the young person turns twenty-one, then he will continue to be eligible to serve imprisonment as a juvenile offender.37. Turning to the Woodbine matter, the most serious offence, Mr Gunning commenced by acknowledging the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period of seven years. Mr Kotsis submitted that the objective seriousness of the Woodbine offence is above the middle range of objective seriousness. In my opinion the offence is within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I form this opinion because of the nature of the offence, the weapon involved and the shocking circumstances in which it occurred. I do not regard it as above the middle of the range of objective seriousness only because the wounding occurred as a result of the victim grabbing the machete rather than the machete being used to strike the victim. But nevertheless I do find that it was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.38. Nevertheless I do not propose to impose the standard non-parole period in respect of this particular offence and for reasons referred to in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The particular provisions in that section to which I have reference and which I have taken into account in determining not to impose the standard non-parole period are s 21A(3)(k) which is the plea of guilty which in this case was recorded at the earliest opportunity, (m) which speaks for itself, (j) the offender’s age and whether he was not fully aware of the consequences of his action (in that regard I do not take into account the degree of intoxication) and (h) that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. For those reasons, in my opinion, it is not appropriate to impose the standard non-parole period in this case.39. Special circumstances, argues Mr Gunning, apply to this offence as well and I accept that submission. He also argues that any term of imprisonment in respect of this offence should be served as a juvenile offender. In making that submission he refers me to s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act and to its requirement that given that the offence is a serious children’s indictable offence the young person is only eligible to serve any sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender if there are special circumstances justifying detention at his age. Mr Gunning submits that there are appropriate services and programs available within the juvenile justice system and that the impact of adult incarceration based on his psychological wellbeing and his rehabilitation would be negative and that he has developed a good relationship with his juvenile justice officer. In my opinion all of those submissions are correct and I propose to direct that he serve his term of imprisonment in a juvenile justice detention centre.40. I have taken into account the co-offenders and how they were dealt with and the far more significant offending behaviour of this particular young person. Mr Gunning points out that his client will turn twenty-one on 31 August 2009. His submission is that a sentence would meet the community’s expectation of an appropriate punishment and the young person’s interests in being rehabilitated, if the term was served as a juvenile offender and he was not forced to go into an adult facility. Mr Kotsis pointed to the aggravating nature of the offences because they were committed on conditional liberty and I accept that submission. I have not taken into account the matters very appropriately pointed out by Mr Kotsis as being elements of the substantive offences and hence not separate aggravating features. I note the vulnerability of all of the victims being shopkeepers and I give him credit for his plea of guilty.41. The submission of Mr Kotsis is that parity is not a significant factor in this case because there is no obligation to follow the principle of parity where differences between the two offenders justify the different result. In my opinion that is the case here. The role played by the young person in each of the offences was the most active and the most aggressive. He was the one who jumped onto the counter bearing the machete. I accept that intoxication is not a mitigating factor in this offence and I take into account and accept the submission of both parties that it is open for me to reduce the sentence because of s 23(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.42. I have taken into account the oral submissions made by both legal representatives. Mr Kotsis made no submission on the length of the sentence, in particular so far as the proposition that the non-parole period should expire at or just after the young person turns twenty-one, but drew my attention to the importance of not double counting some of the factors and of the objective seriousness in particular of the Woodbine offence. So I take into account in respect of all these matters the various objective features which I have listed and the subjective circumstances of the young person which I have referred to and which have been the subject of submissions and evidence before me. 43. Before applying any discount I would consider that an overall sentence for the complete criminality involved in these very serious offences would be something in the region of thirteen years. However, I have taken into account the plea of guilty, the real remorse and the contents of exhibit D and I propose to discount the sentence by some thirty-five per cent. In addition I take into account, to a limited extent, certain subjective features and I have determined that the head sentence should be in the region of eight years.Stand up, Mr [young person]. Now, gentlemen, I know you’re paying attention but just listen to the sums. My associate and I have worked these out but tell me if I’m wrong.44. Mr [young person], in respect of the armed robbery of Domino’s Pizza, I sentence you to two years imprisonment. That is to date from 22 November 2005 and to expire on 21 November 2007 and I decline to set a non-parole period because that sentence will be taken up by one of the other sentences, be subsumed as they say. In respect of the armed robbery of Bernie’s Take Away, I also sentence you to two years imprisonment to date from 22 May 2006 and to expire on 21 May 2008. Once again for the same reasons I do not set a non-parole period. In respect of the armed robbery with wounding at Woodbine, I set a non-parole period of three years, three months and seven days to date from 22 November 2006 and to expire on 28 February 2010. I set the balance of the term of the sentence as three years, eight months and twenty-four days commencing on 1 March 2010 and expiring on 22 November 2013. In sentencing you in respect of the Woodbine matter I have taken into account the Glen Alpine offences, which were on the Form 1 as we say.45. In adjusting the period between the non-parole period and the balance of the term I have found special circumstances. They are these: that your rehabilitation is well under way and that if the additional term were the normal term you would be likely to go into an adult facility and in my opinion that would be a significant setback for your rehabilitation and negate much of the progress which you have already demonstrated. The emphasis in sentencing a young person is on rehabilitation and that is why I have adjusted the balance. Just have a seat again, [young person].HIS HONOUR: Do you want me to run through those again, gentlemen? So we have got two years fixed, so to speak, for Domino’s, 22 November 2005 to 21 November 2007, two years fixed for Bernie’s, 22 May 2006 to 21 May 2008, seven years overall in respect of Woodbine, 22/11/06 to 21/11/13, with a non-parole period of three years, three months and seven days, which should expire on 28 February 2010, which is six months after the young person’s twenty-first birthday. And a balance of three years, eight months and twenty-four days, which should be a total of seven years. How does that sound, Mr Gunning? I don’t mean for an assessment, I mean the sums.GUNNING: The sums sound right to me, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I’ll just wait, Mr Kotsis. When you’re ready.KOTSIS: I think the only difficulty, your Honour, is the balance of term for the Woodbine offence. I think it should be three years, eight months and twenty-two days. Did your Honour expire that term on 22 November?HIS HONOUR: I did, yes. What did you think it should be?KOTSIS: I think it should be twenty-two days. I think your Honour might have said twenty-four unless I’ve written that down wrong.HIS HONOUR: No, I said twenty-four. I said three years, eight months and twenty-four days.KOTSIS: I think it’s three years, eight months and twenty-two days.HIS HONOUR: My associate has some sort of special calculator that she uses for these things. We think that the non-parole period plus that balance would equal seven years exactly.KOTSIS: Your Honour, that’s from 22 November 06 to 21 November 2013.HIS HONOUR: I’m sorry, I should have said the balance of term expires on 21 November 2013.KOTSIS: That would mean that it would be twenty-one days.HIS HONOUR: Yes, that’s so.KOTSIS: There’s definitely some difficulty there because I agree that 22 November 06 through to 21 November 13 would be seven years. That was your Honour’s intent I understand.HIS HONOUR: That’s the intent.KOTSIS: And I agree with the non-parole period of three years, three months and seven days as from 22 November through to 28 February.HIS HONOUR: Good, 2010.KOTSIS: The balance will commence on - is it a leap year? Which would mean that that balance of term should commence on the 29th. It’s not a leap year.HIS HONOUR: 2010 is not, no.KOTSIS: No, of course it’s not, that’s right.HIS HONOUR: So the balance commences on 1 March 2010. So three years would be 1 March 2013 and eight months--KOTSIS: Is 1 November. From the 1st to the 21st is twenty-one days not twenty-four.HIS HONOUR: No, eight months would be to 31 October and then--KOTSIS: Yes, you’re right, sorry, your Honour. That would be twenty-two days.HIS HONOUR: Then we’d need twenty-two days to get to 21 November, wouldn’t we?KOTSIS: Yes, I think that’s right.HIS HONOUR: I think it should be twenty-two days.GUNNING: Is that right? The eight months expires on--HIS HONOUR: Expires on 31 October 2013.GUNNING: Isn’t that another twenty-one days.KOTSIS: No, because you’ve got to count the thirty-one.HIS HONOUR: The three years is from 1 March 2010 to, I suppose, 28 February 2013 and the eight months would be from 1 March 2013 to 31 October, I think, 2013 and then in order to get to 21 November we need to add twenty-two days.KOTSIS: Yes, I think that’s right. I think that’s what I will say.HIS HONOUR: The balance of the term is three years, eight months and twenty-two days and it expires on 21 November 2013.GUNNING: Your Honour, do you only add twenty-one days? Once you get to 31 October that’s when the eight months expires.HIS HONOUR: No, I was adding twenty-two days. So that would end us up on 21 November 2013 just when I want to finish it.GUNNING: I suppose the question for me is whether the eight months includes 31 October because if it does then you only add twenty-one days to get to 21 November.HIS HONOUR: Yes, I see your point.GUNNING: It’s getting late in the day so--HIS HONOUR: It is. I see your point. Let’s say the eight months expires at midnight on 31 October 2013.46. So I will fix the balance of the term as three years, eight months and twenty-one days, which expires on 21 November 2013. So the balance is three years, eight months and twenty-one days and expires on 21 November 2013.KOTSIS: I agree with that, your Honour. The total sentence your Honour imposes is seven years.HIS HONOUR: Correct.KOTSIS: That’s from 22 November 05 through to 21 November 13.HIS HONOUR: Correct.KOTSIS: And the non-parole period commences on 22 November 05 and expires on 28 February 2010.HIS HONOUR: Correct.KOTSIS: I haven’t worked out what that non-parole period term is.HIS HONOUR: I think it is three years, three months and seven days.KOTSIS: It couldn’t be, it would have to be four years, three months and seven days for the total non-parole period.HIS HONOUR: You’re quite right. The total of the non-parole period would be four years, three months and seven days.KOTSIS: Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: But it’s not actually a non-parole period because the first year of the sentence is two fixed terms and the only sentence which has a non-parole period is the last one which commences on 22 November 06. So technically the non-parole period commences then.KOTSIS: But the sum effect of the sentence your Honour has imposed is an eight year head sentence.HIS HONOUR: No, seven years. No, you’re right, I’m sorry. You’re right, Mr Kotsis. Eight year head sentence, yes.KOTSIS: Yes, with a total non-parole period of four years, three months and seven days.HIS HONOUR: Correct. That is correct. Do you understand that, Mr Gunning?GUNNING: That’s right.HIS HONOUR: Eight year sentence from 22 November 05 to 21 November 13 and a total period in custody of four years, three months and seven days.GUNNING: Just to clarify that even further, in relation to the Woodbine matter the head sentence is eight years starting from--HIS HONOUR: No, seven years.GUNNING: Right, starting from--HIS HONOUR: Because I’ve staggered them. I’ve whatever you call them.GUNNING: And that’s starting from 22 November 06 to 21 November 13.HIS HONOUR: Correct.GUNNING: Thank you, your Honour.KOTSIS: Your Honour, I think that at one or more points in your Honour’s outline of the facts and/or your Honour’s judgment, I think your Honour referred to the Woodbine offence as a robbery with wounding offence. In other areas of your Honour’s remarks you indicated it was an assault with intent to rob. I’ll just confirm your Honour has taken it into account as an assault with intent to rob with wounding as opposed to a robbery with wounding.HIS HONOUR: You’re quite right. It was because there wasn’t a robbery, he didn’t get any money.KOTSIS: That’s right and that’s clearly in the facts, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: You’re quite right. It is serious and I think it’s a breach of the same section as an armed robbery with wounding but because there was no actual robbery or theft it’s an assault with intent to rob with wounding. Yes, I have taken it into account or I do and my judgment doesn’t vary, my sentence doesn’t vary.KOTSIS: Thank you, your Honour. There’s only one other thing that I’d ask to clarify. In your Honour’s remarks your Honour outlined the facts. Your Honour obviously paraphrased much of the facts and some of the items that were in the agreed statement of facts your Honour didn’t indicate in your Honour’s outline of those facts. I’d ask whether your Honour accepts all of the facts as in the agreed statement of facts as having been found?HIS HONOUR: If there are agreed, yes and I think they are, Mr Gunning?KOTSIS: Yes, they were agreed facts, your Honour. But I understand that your Honour gave an outline of those facts and I think your Honour said that it was an outline. I just ask your Honour to confirm whether or not your Honour has found as a matter of fact finding all of those facts that were agreed.HIS HONOUR: Yes, I do. They have been admitted without objection and I have found them all as facts and I, however, didn’t find it necessary to outline them all in my judgment because they are part of exhibit A and that’s why I outlined them in summary form.KOTSIS: Thank you, your Honour.GUNNING: If it assists, your Honour, I believe that they were an agreed statement of facts and were signed by the young person on 24 July 2006.HIS HONOUR: Thanks, Mr Gunning. I’ll return exhibits B, C, E, F.KOTSIS: I don’t ask for any exhibits to be returned, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Should they stay with the papers?KOTSIS: My view is they should all remain with the papers.HIS HONOUR: All right. And in particular exhibit D will stay with the papers because it’s subject to that order. You probably want exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 4 back, Mr Gunning, do you? It’s up to you as to whether they stay with the papers or go back.GUNNING: I’m happy for them to stay with the papers, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I’ll place all of the exhibits with the papers as well as the Form 1, which I’ll place with the papers. My associate has correctly pointed out, exhibit 4 comprises your client’s certificates. Do you want those back?GUNNING: I probably should ask for them to be returned.HIS HONOUR: I’ll return to you exhibit 4 because of what they are.47. Mr [young person], you understand that I have kept you in a juvenile detention centre until six months after you turn twenty-one. That means that you are to stay in the juvenile detention centre and not to go to an adult facility because I think it is best for your rehabilitation that you stay where you are. You have committed some very serious crimes which is why the sentence is as long as it is and why the non-parole period is as long as it is, because they were very serious crimes. On the other hand I was very impressed by the evidence of your rehabilitation. You have had a lot to deal with and it seems to me that you have been dealing with all that sort of stuff and I want you to continue doing that and to give yourself the best chance on your release. Do you understand that? Good luck.Before I go there’s court staff here, there’s a court officer, there’s a monitor and corrective services staff and I want to publicly thank them. I warned them that I might be sitting on. It’s now 5.15, well beyond the time that they would normally be expected to perform these duties. It’s been partly caused by the hold up with the young person not being available this morning and it’s been important to sentence him today and Mr Lane and I’m very grateful to the staff for facilitating the course of justice, as well as my associate staying on as well.KOTSIS: Your Honour, can I order an urgent transcript of the remarks on sentence of this matter for the co-offenders’ proceedings?HIS HONOUR: I direct that an urgent transcript of the remarks on sentence be taken out.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Wayne Geoffrey Hughes had consumed ten stubbies of VB beer taken between 4pm and 7.30pm. He had walked home from where the Holden Rodeo he was driving was parked. He had tools in that vehicle. At home he drank some scotch. He became concerned about the tradesman tools he had stored in the truck. He decided to leave home and drive the Rodeo to his home, a journey he says of about a kilometre.2 Police were conducting a mobile road breathalyser test on 18 November, last year in the Wingham area. As part of the operation Drink Drive 2, the appellant was pulled over. He was unsteady on his feet, police noticed, when he emerged from his vehicle. He knew immediately that he was “gone”, he was “over the limit” and that he had consumed “heaps”.3 The reading taken by police a short time after his arrest was 0.195 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. 4 This appellant’s driving record is poor. Since 1980 there have been five PCA offences, this may be the sixth and two driving whilst disqualified. There are further drive whilst unlicensed. Not surprisingly, the Local Court magistrate sentenced him to six months imprisonment. He appeals against the severity of the sentence imposed by the magistrate.5 He is a hard worker, employed in the building trade. He has been a foreman for some years. Builders make a significant contribution to our nation. The appellant has participated in this contribution for many years now. He has an apprentice, that is, he appears to be assisting in the training of upcoming tradesmen. The community benefits from that activity. 6 He and his partner have been together for twenty years. He has raised two children within that relationship as his own. That too is an important contribution to family life and the structure of the community.7 Unfortunately, though, his driving record, and in particular his drink driving record, is an area where he is in breach of the law continually and is prepared to endanger other users of the road. In all other areas he appears responsible. Inso far as his driving is concerned his record suggests an absence of responsibility of a high order. 8 There has been some suggestion that his past and in particular the unlawful and abhorrent sexual abuse of him as a child is contributing to his unlawful conduct. I accept it may well have done so in the past when he says he abused drugs. But it did not contribute to this offence. He was celebrating. He knew he had drunk too much in the course of the celebrating. Even so, he was prepared to take a personal risk to protect or retrieve his tools.9 That, to me, does not sound anything like his past impacting upon his present behaviour, at least in so far as this driving is concerned. 10 I accept that he is still troubled by his past life experiences. I accept that he is seeking to confront the demons relating to this offending. I accept that course is important, that is, his rehabilitation or confronting his demons is important for his future wellbeing.11 As part of his response to his mental health issues, including depression and unresolved anger/guilt/grief or whatever over the sexual abuse and also in response to the drink driving, he has abstained from alcohol for three months, sought counselling from Dr Larkin and Dr Jezzudison. 12 I have determined that the appropriate course in this case is to give him twelve months to establish that he is capable of rehabilitating so far as his driving is concerned. What I propose to do is to stand this matter over part heard before me for a period of twelve months and to call upon him to present himself to the Court to demonstrate rehabilitation progress on the two occasions before I come to finalise the matter.13 The conditions of the bail, the section 11 bail, will be that he accept supervision of Probation and Parole; that he undertake all courses and treatment programs that his case manager with Probation and Parole requires of him.14 I require reports from the Probation and Parole officers on the progress report occasions. 15 He is to continue with treatment and/or counselling as recommended by his doctors who currently are Dr Larkin and Dr Jezzudison. 16 He will appear before me on 26 October 2007 at the Newcastle District Court to update me on what progress has been made. He will appear before me on 22 February 2008 at a court to be advised, again for the purposes of demonstrating progress and I will finalise this matter on 6 June or thereabouts 2008, again at a court to be advised.17 Is there anybody in doubt what is required here?MULLEY: No, your Honour.DONNE: No.HIS HONOUR: I order pre-sentence reports from Probation and Parole for 26 October next, 22 February next and 6 June next year. Bail can be entered before the registry.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by Price J, and generally with his Honour’s reasons. I find it unnecessary to determine whether it was open to the sentencing judge to find that the victims were vulnerable, within the meaning of s 21A(2)(I) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: Colin Brian Stevens seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him by Andrew ADCJ in the District Court at Dubbo on 29 November 2006. 
     
      
    4 The applicant had pleaded guilty on 27 November 2006 to an indictment which contained a single count alleging that [he] on 3 September 2005 at Warren used unlawful violence towards John Herring and Melinda Herring by conduct that would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for their safety. The offence being one of affray contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act 1900 then carried a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for eighteen months with a non-parole period of twelve months. The applicant is eligible for parole on 27 November 2007. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    5 Tendered on sentence without objection was a bundle of documents (exhibit A) which included an outline of facts and the Crown brief. What follows is drawn from the outline of facts. The applicant, with Michael Davis and Ben Madden, travelled to the property of John and Melinda Herring near Warren in an attempt to obtain possession of an unregistered vehicle YKS – 166. The owner of the vehicle had nominated Mr and Mrs Herring as being in possession of it. Upon arriving at the property, the applicant spoke to John Herring who at that time was only wearing a towel. Mr Herring, after entering his home to dress, returned to the applicant who was standing in the driveway immediately adjacent to the gate at the front yard. I now quote from the outline of facts:  
     
      
       
        
        “Upon his approach to Stevens, [Mr Herring] states that Stevens struck him to his face with his fist. The victim bears wounds to the interior of his mouth and exterior of his lip consistent with such an allegation. It is further alleged Stevens used a black baton that he had in his possession and struck Mr Herring a number of times to his head and torso. 
        
       
       
        
        Mrs Melinda Herring was similarly present at the location, having followed her husband from the home. She intervened in an attempt to assist her husband and was secured by the offender, Davis. It is alleged the offender, Davis, was in possession of a silver chrome tyre lever which he used a number of times to strike Mrs Herring to the head. As a result of these strikes Mrs Herring received four large wounds to her head that bled profusely. These wounds are consistent (sic) provided by Mrs Herring and her husband. She similarly corroborated the version of her husband relating to the assaults upon him. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Herring states that during his struggle with Stevens he fell to the ground, on his knees and bears consistent grazing and cuts to his knees and feet in support of the same. He states he overpowered Stevens and took possession of the black baton. He alleges that he used the black baton to strike the accused Davis who was striking Mrs Herring to the head with the previously stated tyre lever. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Herring indicated that he managed to free his wife from the hold of Davis and assist her through the front gate of their premises. During his retreat he sustained a number of injuries, a result of being struck with rocks allegedly thrown by offenders, Davis and Stevens. He further alleged that one of these rocks struck the front window of their premises causing it to smash. 
        
       
       
        
        At a point during the described assaults Madden, who accompanied the offenders, left the motor vehicle and joined Davis and Stevens. It is alleged he said ‘You’re going to get it you fat cunt’ accompanied by other offers of violence toward Mr Herring.” 
        
       
      
    6 Mrs Herring rang the police who arrived shortly thereafter. Davis and the applicant were taken to Warren Hospital. The applicant was admitted and treated for a number of broken ribs and Davis for head wounds which required stitches.  
     
      
    7 Upon admission to the hospital Mrs Herring received a number of stitches to her head to treat four wounds between five to fifteen centimetres in length. All wounds bled profusely. Mr Herring’s injuries which were described as serious in nature included abrasions and cuts to his feet, knees, torso, lip and mouth. He had a number of large marks on his back consistent with impact of “the stated weapons”.  
     
      
    8 Included in exhibit A was the applicant’s electronically recorded interview with police which provided a version of events inconsistent with the outline of facts. The solicitor for the applicant informed the Judge that, although there were conflicting versions in the tendered material, it was not necessary for him to determine “who or really how the violence erupted” and he added “on an objective basis, the offence of affray was constituted by our conduct and the conduct of others with us”. (POS at p2). The Crown agreed with that submission. The parties, however, did little to clarify for the Judge the facts upon which the applicant was to be sentenced. 
     
      
    9 This Court continues to emphasise that it is incumbent upon the parties in sentencing proceedings to identify with particularity which matters are in issue and to ensure that the agreed statement of facts does not contain material which aggravates the offence: see R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381. 
     
      
    10 In any event his Honour did find that the applicant and Davis were the aggressors. The applicant concedes that this finding was open to the Judge. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    11 The applicant did not give evidence before the Judge nor were any reports tendered. However, the solicitor for the applicant informed his Honour of the applicant’s subjective circumstances in submissions on sentence. 
     
      
    12 In his remarks on sentence (ROS at p6), the Judge summarised the subjective circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
        “As stated, the offender is now aged forty six. The information as to his background is sparse. His early record of troubles in the Children’s Court, in my view is indicative of an unsettled upbringing. He was employed as a shearer but suffered an injury some years ago and as a result, is now a pensioner. He lives near Lismore with his son, following separation or divorce from his wife. He is currently awaiting a knee replacement operation.” 
        
       
      
    13 It appears from the applicant’s criminal record that he was born on 8 February 1962 and at the time of sentence was aged 44 years and not 46 years as mentioned by the Judge. This apparent mistake was not of significance in the sentence imposed.  
     
      
    14 The Judge referred to the applicant’s unattractive criminal history. Having noted that the applicant’s first offence of violence was in 1981 when he was convicted of aggravated assault on a child, the Judge remarked (ROS at p5)  
     
      
       
        
        “…..of more seriousness, is that in 2000 he received a sentence of three years and two years parole period upon a conviction for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent with a similar offence taken into account. He was then sentenced to four years with two years non-parole period for the offence of assault with intent to rob in company causing wounding. That sentence was cumulative upon the previous sentence so that he was released to parole on 31 May 2003 and was on parole until 31 May 2005. This offence was therefore committed within months of the expiration of that sentence.” 
        
       
      
    15 The Notice of Appeal identifies four grounds, namely: 
     
      
    Ground 1  
     
      
       
      The sentencing Judge erred in taking into account materials that would constitute a more serious offence.  
       
      
    Ground 2 
     
      
       
      The applicant was denied procedural fairness in that the sentencing Judge failed to warn those appearing for him that he proposed to take into account matters upon which the applicant was not given an opportunity to be heard. 
       
       
      
    16 Ground 3  
     
      
       
      The sentencing Judge erred by finding that the offence was not dissimilar to a home invasion. 
       
      
    17 Ground 4  
     
      
       
      The sentencing Judge erred by taking into account as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in company. 
       
      
    18 Grounds 1 and 3 may be conveniently dealt with together as they are based on the following remarks on sentence made by the Judge. His Honour, said (ROS at 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view this case is not dissimilar to a home invasion. They attacked both victims with extreme violence, so much so that the victim, Mrs Herring, was bashed on the head with a tyre lever obtained from their vehicle causing serious injury and hospitilisation. As such that is a particularly cowardly attack.  
        
       
       
        
        I take into account that this was carried out by the co-accused, Davis, but nevertheless, both of these persons were clearly acting in concert throughout this affair.  
        
       
       
      Mr Herring also required medical treatment……”  
       
      
    19 The applicant contends that the passages I have quoted support the view that the Judge took into account factors that would constitute, at least, the more serious offences of which he had been previously charged, namely, assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company and malicious wounding in company. He was being sentenced, the applicant argues, at least in part, for wounds to the head of Mrs Herring which were inflicted by the co-offender Davis. He should not have been sentenced on facts which included a wounding or aspect of actual bodily harm in company to either Mr or Mrs Herring. 
     
      
    20 A further contention for the applicant is that the Judge erred in equating the offence of affray with a “home invasion” in much the same way as it would be to take into account materials that would constitute a more serious offence or mistake the maximum penalty for an offence as being higher than it actually was.  
     
      
    21 Charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company and malicious wounding in company, offences contrary to sections 59(2) and 35(2) of the Crimes Act, had initially been laid against the applicant. The maximum penalty for these offences is respectively imprisonment for seven and ten years. They were more serious offences than the offence of affray. The applicant’s plea of guilty for the offence of affray was accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. 
     
      
    22 An offence contrary to s 112 of the Crimes Act is commonly referred to as a “home invasion” and carries a maximum penalty depending upon the existence of circumstances of aggravation of between 14 and 25 years. It is a more serious offence than the offence of affray. 
     
      
    23 The Judge in imposing sentence was not entitled to take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence nor was the applicant to be sentenced for some other more serious offence of which he had not been charged: The Queen v De Simoni (1987) 147 CLR 383  
     
      
    24 Section 93C of the Crimes Act relevantly provided:  
     
      
       
        
       
      “ 
      Affray  
       
        
        93 C 
         (1) A person who uses or threatens unlawful violence  
         
          
          towards another and whose conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety is guilty of affray and liable to imprisonment for 5 years.  
           
          (2) If 2 or more person use or threaten unlawful violence, it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purposes of subsection (1).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    25 In determining an appropriate sentence for an offence of affray contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act an offender’s conduct is to be considered in the context of the conduct of a co-offender. The level of violence used and the scale of the affray are relevant. An offender, however, may only be sentenced for that part of his conduct and the conduct of the co-offender which gave rise to the offence of affray and not that conduct which resulted in some other offence being committed by him or by the co-offender: see R v Huynh [2000] NSWCCA 18, R v Eleter  [2003] NSWCCA 130 and R v Fajka [2004] NSWCCA 166. 
     
      
    26 His Honour found as I have mentioned that the applicant and Davis were the aggressors. Furthermore, it was open to the Judge to find that they had attacked both victims with extreme violence. The attack by Davis upon Mrs Herring with the tyre lever was part of the co-offender’s conduct which gave rise to the offence of affray. In my view, the nature and extent of the physical violence was an objective factor relevant to the seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    27 The analogy drawn by the Judge to a “home invasion” and the references to Mrs Herring’s injury, it seems to me, were no more than indications by his Honour of the level of violence that was used in the affray. The injuries caused to Mr and Mrs Herring, although substantial, were not identified by the Judge as being aggravating factors pursuant to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Crimes (SP) Act). The Judge was clearly mindful that the applicant had faced more serious charges when he remarked (ROS at 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “He was previously facing more serious charges but pleaded guilty to this offence at the first opportunity when that became available.” 
        
       
      
    28 The length of the sentence that was imposed upon the applicant indicates that the remarks by the Judge of which the applicant complains had no material impact upon the sentence. His Honour’s consideration of the circumstances of the offence did not extend, in my view, so as to punish the applicant as if he had committed a more serious offence. I am unable to discern error on the part of the Judge and these grounds of appeal fail. 29 As to ground 2 of the appeal, the applicant submits that it was incumbent upon the Judge to warn the parties of his intention to find as aggravating factors pursuant to s 21A of the Crimes  (SP) Act: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Gratuitous cruelty (to the dogs); and  
        
       
      
     (b) Vulnerability  
     
      
       
      It was procedurally unfair, the applicant contends, to find those matters when they were not referred to at all in the outline of facts.  
       
      
    30 The Judge said (ROS at 5-6): 
     
      
       
        
        “…..An aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A is that.….there was gratuitous cruelty involved in relation to the attack on the victims’ animals and I would consider the victims to have been vulnerable in that they were living in a rural and isolated place without ready recourse to assistance.” 
        
       
      
    31 The Judge found a factor of aggravation to be “gratuitous cruelty involved in relation to the victims’ animals.” His Honour was referring to s 21A(2)(f) of the Crimes (SP) Act.  
     
      
    32 The outline of facts presented to the Judge did not refer to attacks upon the Herrings’ animals whereas Mr Herring in his record of interview did. Whilst the Judge was entitled to have regard to that material, he was not entitled to rely upon it in deciding upon the appropriate sentence. The applicant was not charged with an offence involving cruelty to animals but was charged with an offence of affray of which animal cruelty formed no part. With respect, his Honour was in error and to this extent ground 2 of the appeal is made out.  
     
      
    33 The vulnerability of Mr and Mrs Herring “in that they were living in a rural and isolated place without ready recourse to assistance” was identified by the Judge as being an aggravating factor. His Honour was referring to s 21A(2)(l) which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(l) the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim’s occupation (such as a taxi driver, bus driver or other public transport worker, bank teller or service station attendant.” 
        
       
      
    34 From the outline of the facts, it was open to the Judge to find that the victims of the applicant’s criminality were vulnerable because of where they lived. His Honour neither went outside the outline of facts nor did he sentence the applicant on a basis that differed in substance to the agreed facts: see Regina v H [2005] NSWCCA 282 [at 59]. The solicitor for the applicant had the opportunity of addressing the Judge on the material placed before his Honour. The Judge was not obliged to warn those appearing before him that he intended to make a finding of vulnerability. Procedural fairness was not denied to the applicant.  
     
      
    35 The Crown concedes that his Honour erred when he found as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in company. The Judge was referring to s 21A(2)(e) of the Crimes (SP) Act. The offence of which the applicant was charged necessarily involved two persons and in these circumstances his Honour infringed the concluding words of s 21A(2) which provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court is not to have additional regard to any such factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    36 Although I have concluded errors arose in the application of s 21A, those errors did not significantly impact upon the sentence determined by his Honour. A high level of violence was used in the offence and there is little in the way of mitigation for it. His criminal antecedents did not entitle him to leniency. The applicant’s prior record of violent offending discloses that more weight is to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community than would otherwise be the case: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242, R v M.A.K, R v M.S.K [2006] NSWCCA 381. An apparent concession by the Crown that a suspended sentence fell within an appropriate range [of sentence] was generous. 
     
      
    37 The Court should not form, in my view, as required by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 an opinion that “some other sentence is……… warranted in law and should have been passed”. 
     
      
    38 I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Kaine Hubbard is a twenty-four year old indigenous man. It is likely that he is an undiagnosed alcoholic. He certainly has a drinking problem. When released from gaol in August of 2005 he spent eight days drinking heavily. He had by this time served several, perhaps as many as four discrete stretches of prison for offences of violence, either against persons or property, that he had committed whilst affected by alcohol.2 Against this background then his conduct eight days out of prison in August of 2005 is incomprehensible. Having spent these eight days drinking in company with a juvenile on 13 August 2005, he assaulted a fifteen year old boy. This assault was an act of savage violence against one victim, that victim aged only fifteen. 3 Perhaps it was the savagery of the assault, perhaps it was a realisation that his parole would certainly be revoked, perhaps it was a recognition that he was to be separated again from his partner and two girls, perhaps it was the realisation that his conduct put him in a revolving door that opened repeatedly only to the gaol cell. Whatever it was, he determined he would reform. He self addressed it would seem, his alcohol and drug abuse. He linked up with a personal support programme offered by one of the Commonwealth employment agencies and he tried to turn his life around. He was succeeding at least to some extent for seventeen months. Two days into the New Year this year police attended his premises. He was arrested for that assault in August of 2005. So ended one of the longest periods of stability in his adult life. Since his arrest he has been bail refused.4 Today he is before the Court to be held accountable for his cowardly assault upon that fifteen year old boy. The Court’s task is to resolve a number of competing tensions as it strives to determine an appropriate sentencing outcome for this offender, committing this offence, in this community, against this particular young victim. Before any appropriate outcome can be determined, there are a number of issues that will need to be looked at. The facts of this offence and in particular the objective criminality will have to be looked at. The subjective matters relating to the offender and his particular circumstances will also need to be looked at. The question of parity of sentence with his co-offender will need to be determined and ultimately the appropriate sentencing disposition, which it seems to me must be one of imprisonment, will have to be looked at, particularly to see if that sentence can be suspended.FACTS5 For the purposes of the present exercise it is enough if I repeat what would appear to me to be agreed facts, or if not agreed at least facts that cannot be otherwise disputed. 6 At about 8.20pm on Saturday 13 August a young person, JB, was at home, made a call on his mobile phone to a school friend. During that call the young person identified himself as being in one of the streets in Tuncurry. As he was walking he noticed two males standing in the front yard of a house on the corner of Brent and Peel Streets. At this time the young person was in Peel Street. They were talking to someone on a front verandah. That someone was likely to be the offender’s partner. As his path took him closer to the two males, they came out onto the footpath and approached him. 7 This offender said to the young person, “Can I use your phone to ring my mum urgently?”. The young person said, “Can you wait for me to finish my conversation?”. No doubt in response to the interchange that was taking place between him and this offender, the young person stopped walking. This offender and his co-offender put their arms around the young person’s shoulder, there was nothing threatening about their behaviour. Indeed, he describes it as being in a friendly manner. 8 The young person moved the phone from his right ear and was holding it in front of his body. The co-offender snatched the phone from him and grabbed his wallet. The young person’s wallet however was attached to a chain and the co-offender did not succeed in obtaining it. This offender, while all that was happening, tightened his grip on the young person causing that fellow difficulty to resist the activity of the shorter man, the co-offender. 9 Not surprisingly, the young person then began to walk backwards towards the corner of Bent and Peel Streets, with the two males walking towards him. There does not appear to be any reason why it should be so, but the offender punched the young person, the fifteen year old, with his right hand striking the young person’s left eye. The co-offender began to punch the young person in the face. The young person was saying, “I don’t want to fight you, I’m only small compared to you”. He might also have added he was outnumbered. He started, or tried to block their punches and he ran back to the other side of Peel Street, where apparently a church is located. It must be that the two offenders followed him. This offender punched the young person a second time to the face. The young person fell, not as a consequence of the blow, but rather as a decision to protect himself and curled in a ball. 10 That did not end up in his protection at all, because each of the offenders then started kicking him, he says, to the face and he tried as best he could to protect his face. He was kicked some five times. One of the offenders, very likely to be this offender, said words to this effect, “Don’t bother my family again or we’ll come and get you”. The young person did not understand why that was said. This offender thinks it may have been him because he had reports from his partner who lived there, that she was being hassled by persons. It may be that in the condition he then was, this offender thought, incorrectly I would imagine, that the young person had been troubling his partner. 11 While he was on the ground the chain holding the wallet was ripped from his clothing, the wallet was thrown at him, there was no money in the wallet prior to it being taken. 12 Having disposed, if that is the right word, of the young person with the taking of the wallet and ascertaining there was no money in it, the men left. The young person ran towards the TAFE College and to his home. He called police. They noticed he had a bruised and swollen left eye, a swollen nose, a blood blister under his left eye and blood on a jumper. The young person gave descriptions of the two men and so far as this offender is concerned the description appears to be relatively accurate.13 I have seen photographs which have been tendered that demonstrate clearly actual bodily harm occasioned to the victim and in particular serious bruising around his left eye, swelling below the eye in the area of the zygoma and bruising or at least the collection of blood within the eye itself, on what we would normally describe as the white of the eye, approaching the iris, substantial bruising. 14 The evidence of the offender, which I am prepared to accept, is that he had been drinking for a considerable period that day. As I say it seems to me he had been seriously abusing alcohol for the eight days he had been released. I am satisfied he was well intoxicated by alcohol at the time of this offence. I raised with him in his evidence whether he had ever turned his mind to that point in time of the nexus or the link between his alcohol abuse and his periods in custody. He claims he had not. It seems to me bizarre, but it would seem that as a consequence of his acts, he certainly turned his mind to it afterwards.OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS15 This offence is a serious assault upon the young person. Serious for a number of reasons, the method by which it was conducted, the circumstances in which it was conducted, that is that the victim was alone and vulnerable, the outnumbering of him and the apparent pointlessness of the violence at least so far as the plea that is before me is concerned, are all disturbing matters. 16 The method was one of punching him to the face and then kicking him to the face. One of the most frequent sources of injury that young males face is traumatic head injury. Flowing from that quite often is, traumatic brain injury. Those injuries percentage wise when they do occur, occur as a result of assaults such as the one I am dealing with. The potential for lifelong damage to a victim in an assault such as this, particularly with feet, is monumental. It is probable, although I have no evidence, that this young person would have psychological scars, or some sense of post traumatic stress, as a consequence of what has happened. In the normal course of events that stress usually resolves within a twelve month period. But the point I make is that there would have been lingering sequelae to this assault for this young man for some time. That outcome I suppose can only be described as better than some sort of permanent brain damage, which was clearly open on the cards. It is not very far from the eye to the brain and if the eye was bruised, there was every potential for the brain to be damaged. 17 The objective circumstances of the offence make it clear that a sentence of imprisonment is called for. This offender has spent now six months or so in custody. The issue for me is whether I ought to extend that custody or I ought to give him a chance to prove himself in the community. 18 Ironically, because it was contrary to his requirement of parole, he chose to absent himself from further reporting to the Probation and Parole Service. He managed to get himself into some sort of order, for a period it would seem of some seventeen months. He went to Newcastle either on the night of, or very shortly after this altercation. He stayed with friends in Newcastle for some twelve months and then he moved into a Department of Housing home in Raymond Terrace. He moved there with his partner and their two children. 19 It would seem that Raymond Terrace rather than Newcastle marks the start of some attempt to really reform. He signed up there for a personal support programme, the children began school, he and his partner addressed their drug and alcohol issues. Then, as he said, “I don’t see anybody”, and he began to change his life around. I understand what he means by that is that he has abandoned those people in his past with whom he would drink and with whom he would get into trouble. His domestic setup, that is his partnership has been ongoing now for three years. He has known his partner he says, fourteen, she says nine years. I think she is probably more likely to be accurate. He has support from his mother, and he has support from others in the community, including Sister McCabe who gave evidence.20 I am satisfied he is sincerely contrite. I am satisfied he has now insight into the link between his alcohol consumption and his drug consumption and his past criminal behaviour. 21 I am also satisfied that significant changes have occurred. His letter to me was in these terms (it was in fact to the magistrate because he thought he was going to be dealt with in the Local Court) that he has committed no crimes since this offence, that he no longer consumes alcohol, only on special occasions; that he has been a good role model for his children and he has been a supporting partner to his wife; that he had made drastic changes to his life for the first time; that he signed up to a job network and joined a personal support programme through Centrelink. He signed on for an education in OHS course while he was in custody, although has not been able to get to it. He says he no longer associates with his old associates and he no longer lives in the area where the crime was committed.  22 He told the magistrate, which has come to me, that he has created a good stable home for his family. That evidence has been supported by his mother, by Sister McCabe, both in her evidence and in a reference, where she writes,  
     
      
       
      “While I can see that there has been some failure in this time, there has also been success. For about eighteen months removed from occasions of conflict, Kaine has led a quiet life supporting Kristy and her children. He has been responsible and dependable, interested in caring for the general appearance of their home, acquired gardening skills growing vegetables and taking some pride in his newly acquired ability”.  
      
    23 It was Sister Catherine’s opinion that he had a potential to contribute to society in a worthwhile way. The Smiths wrote (they are from Fairfield) that he had attended good schools and had a good education. They said for the past eighteen months he has been trying hard with his partner and the two daughters to establish a good and stable home as a family unit for the four of them.  
     
      
       
      “I do believe they have been successful in doing so. They moved away from Forster by themselves and wanted to make a new start. They have enrolled the eldest girl at a local Catholic school to start kindergarten”.  
      
    24 My understanding, interpolating here, is that the younger one is at pre-school. Mrs Smith continues,  
     
      
      “Kaine spent a lot of time at home and his upkeep of the yard and garden shows. I was very proud to see the effort put into his home to make it a stable and happy home for the four of them. Kaine also established himself a very good vegetable garden which he has spent a lot of time looking after”.  
      
    25 The offender tells me that he would like to get into landscape gardening and it would seem that he may have begun to develop some skills appropriate for that.26 His letter asked that I consider a suspended sentence or periodic detention. A suspended sentence would be appropriate outcome if he were able to rehabilitate. My concerns are that he has already shown an inclination not to co-operate with Probation and Parole, particularly around the time of this offending, that he may repeat the pattern of his past releases and look to alcohol. His mother was concerned that perhaps on one of those occasions he had been in prison, not this occasion but the last one, something may have happened. Prison is for many young men a very scary place. Custodial officers cannot keep their eye on all prisoners all the time. There are a number of standover men who operate in prison and there are a number of sexual predators who operate in prison and from time to time things happen. 27 It may be that something happened to this offender during his earlier period in custody, but if that is going to be his excuse for continuing his behaviour, he will continue to expose himself to such a threat. If that is his excuse for getting his life together so that he does not have to go back there, then he would be using that experience in a sensible way. There are many people who have had bad experiences in life who have used it to inspire them. There are also many who have sat there feeling sorry for themselves. It is a matter for this young man, if there is such an experience, how he treats himself in regard to it. 28 Any experience that is bad ought to be the subject of counselling. The Probation and Parole Service, the personal support programme, the links with the Catholic Church are all avenues, which can lead to counselling. Counselling would help if there be such an occasion, for him to come to grips with it. Sometimes there are occasions when people self medicate, using alcohol and drugs in un-prescribed ways. Again, those causes ought to be looked at through counselling.29 What I propose to do, because I am uncertain as to what the future holds for this young man, is to give him an opportunity to demonstrate that he can rehabilitate. That is one of the sentencing options open to this Court. It is called a section 11 [Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999] bail. The purpose of the bail is to give the opportunity to demonstrate to the Court that rehabilitation can take place. If it cannot, then I know the answer to my question as to whether I need to suspend the sentence or to make it a fulltime custodial sentence. If he can and is successful, then I also know the answer to my question, because I can then suspend it with some confidence. 30 Giving a suspended sentence is not always the best option, even from a prisoner’s point of view because it sees the prisoner out and about. Then in the event of re-offending, the Court’s options are very limited, the sentence must be activated and the cruelness of it, if that be the right word, is that he has to go back into custody. 31 It becomes important then when I consider whether this is an appropriate course to take. I am fortified by the evidence of the efforts in the past. It is only because of the past efforts and the support I have been told about that have determined me on the course I am going to take. 32 He will need to be supervised by Probation and Parole. Probation and Parole will see among the conditions that I set that any breach of his conditions will require them to notify me within forty-eight hours of a breach. Failure to report would be a breach. Failure to do the other options that I will have on this bail, such as drink or not enrol in another personal support programme or refuse work when it comes along, will be reported to me as breaches of this bail. They amount to breaches because they are indicative of a failure to rehabilitate. 33 Remember always the purpose of the bail is to assess the capacity to rehabilitate. If when I review this case at the end of October, I do not see signs of progress being made, if all that is happening is you are sitting on the front verandah of your house, sipping alcohol, you will go back into custody. 34 Pursuant to section 11 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, bail is granted for the purpose of the offender demonstrating that he can rehabilitate. That bail is conditioned as follows. 
     
     That he will accept supervision of Probation and Parole. 
     That he will report to the Probation and Parole office at Taree 
     He will accept full supervision by Probation and Parole and obey all reasonable directions of his case manager with Probation and Prole.  
     He will accept all treatment, programmes and counselling Probation and Parole direct him to be engaged in. Specifically, alcohol, drug abuse and anger management.  
     By Friday the fifteenth, he will have contacted a personal support programme and enrolled in it.  
     During this adjournment, he is not to consume on any account whatsoever alcohol or un-prescribed drugs. 
     He is to do all he can to obtain and maintain employment in an area that he feels he can commit to long term.  
     He is to submit to random urine analysis four times monthly during the adjournment period. Any failure to submit when so requested or any dirty urine is deemed a breach of this bond, the bail. If required so to do, he is to submit to a random alcohol test also. I need not tell you that any alcohol is a breach of the bail.  
    35 The matter is adjourned to 2 November 2007.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: The applicant, Donna Clare Tarrant, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on her by Latham J following her conviction of murder. She had been tried before her Honour and a jury with two co-offenders, Shiree Anne Smit and Steven Charles Smit. All three were found guilty.  
     
      
    2 It was a retrial. The three had previously been convicted after a trial before Hulme J and a jury. His Honour had sentenced each of Mr and Mrs Smit to imprisonment for seventeen years with a non-parole period of thirteen years, and the applicant to fourteen years with a non-parole period of eleven years. For reasons which need not concern us, those convictions were set aside and a new trial was ordered. 
     
      
    3 Following that new trial, Latham J sentenced each of the three offenders to imprisonment for sixteen years with a non-parole period of twelve years. The sentences were imposed under the regime prior to the 2002 amendments to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It will be seen that Mr and Mrs Smit were sentenced to lesser terms than those which had been imposed by Hulme J, whereas the applicant’s sentence was greater than that which his Honour had passed. It is that development which gives rise to the present application. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 The applicant and her co-offenders were dealt with for the murder of Craig Patrick Collins at his home in Katoomba on 28 August 2001. The deceased’s body was found three days later in the kitchen of his home. His body was naked and had been wrapped in blankets, together with some articles of clothing and a cricket bat. There were abrasions to both sides of his neck, consistent with forceful blows from the edge of the cricket bat. There were also stab wounds to the back of the head, to the front of the chest and to other parts of the torso, as well as extensive bruising and abrasions on the front and back of the chest and on the limbs. The principal cause of death was found to be blunt trauma to the neck, resulting in a fracture of the voice-box and leading to suffocation.  
     
      
    5 It appeared that the body had been dragged to the kitchen from the lounge room. A large amount of blood found in that room was consistent with what her Honour described as “a sustained and vicious assault” upon the victim. Three bloodstained knives were found in the lounge room, and it appeared from the evidence that one or more of those knives had been used to inflict the stab wounds. 
     
      
    6 Her Honour had left the case to the jury as one of joint criminal enterprise to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. For the purpose of sentence, she found herself unable to determine beyond reasonable doubt which of the offenders struck the fatal blow to the deceased’s neck. Nor could she attribute any greater role in the attack to any one of the offenders. However, she was satisfied that all three inflicted some measure of injury upon him.  
     
      
    7 Her Honour was not able to find that any of the offenders had intended to kill the deceased, and she characterised the attack as “sudden, unplanned and unpremeditated”. She could not determine with any certainty what had led to the attack. Mr Smit had told police that he believed that the deceased was about to rape the applicant and that he went to her assistance. This account, as will be seen, found some support in the evidence of Mrs Smit at the trial. Her Honour found what Mr Smit said to the police to be implausible in a number of respects, and she did not accept that there was any basis for a belief that the applicant was to be raped. Nevertheless, for the purpose of sentence she accepted that he entertained such a belief, and that it was this which triggered an attack upon the deceased by all three offenders which, as her Honour put it, “was out of all proportion to the circumstances, culminating in Mr Collins’ death”.  
     
      
    8 Put shortly, Mr Smit described to police an encounter with the deceased in which he did not admit having inflicted any significant injury. He claimed that he went to the applicant’s defence and that he had punched the deceased, but that it was the deceased who had the cricket bat, with which he tried to hit Mr Smit, and the knife, with which he tried to stab the applicant. Her Honour found this account to be “substantially lacking in credibility” and, in the light of the whole of the evidence, expressed herself not to be surprised that the jury had rejected his denial of having inflicted any serious injury upon the deceased. At the trial he had acknowledged some responsibility for the death, but had advanced a case that that responsibility amounted to no more than manslaughter because of the effects of alcohol and drugs at the time.  
     
      
    9 The evidence against Mrs Smit consisted of a fingerprint impression proved to be hers on one of the bloodstained knives, together with evidence of an admission to an acquaintance to the effect that she and her husband, but mainly her husband, had killed the deceased with a cricket bat. In evidence at the trial, she denied that conversation and sought to provide an innocent explanation for her fingerprint being on the knife. Her evidence put the applicant at the scene prior to the attack and also asserted that the deceased had behaved in some inappropriate way towards the applicant, but she said that neither she nor the applicant took part in any attack upon the deceased. She said that they left the premises and returned some hours later, finding the body of the deceased lying on the kitchen floor.  
     
      
    10 The applicant did not give evidence at the trial, but she had told police in a recorded interview that she was not present when the attack occurred, and she denied any involvement in it or, indeed, any knowledge of it. However, a partial bloodstained palm print which was proved to be hers was found on the cricket bat, and her Honour had directed the jury that they could use that evidence against her if they were satisfied that the print was deposited onto the bat at the time the deceased was attacked. Given the verdict, her Honour concluded that the jury had rejected the applicant’s account to the police (and Mrs Smit’s evidence) about her role in the events. She was satisfied to the requisite standard that the applicant had inflicted some injury upon the deceased, although she could not determine to what degree.  
     
      
       
      The Application 
       
      
    11 To understand the argument on the application, it is necessary to examine the reasoning of Hulme J in arriving at the disparate sentences which he passed. The case as it was presented before his Honour differed in two respects from the retrial. Firstly, Mr Smit had not conceded responsibility for the death of the deceased, as he had before Latham J. Secondly, and more importantly, Hulme J had left the case to the jury as one of joint criminal enterprise and also as one of aiding and abetting, that is, one offender being present, intentionally encouraging or assisting a principal offender.  
     
      
    12 Like Latham J, his Honour was unable to determine for the purpose of sentence which of the offenders had inflicted the fatal wound or wounds. However, in the light of the admissions to police by Mr Smit and to the acquaintance by Mrs Smit, he concluded that each of them had “some active involvement going appreciably beyond mere presence and a minimum level of encouragement or assistance”. As to the applicant, on the other hand, he noted that the Crown prosecutor had disclaimed any suggestion that her palm print on the bat showed that she was the principal offender, and he found “nothing else to show that her role was more than at the lowest level of participation”.  
     
      
    13 Latham J, of course, was aware of the sentences passed by Hulme J and his Honour’s reasons for them. As we have said, her Honour found herself unable to distinguish the role of any of the offenders from that of the others. In examining Hulme J’s finding about the applicant’s level of participation, she noted that in that earlier trial liability as an aider and abettor had been left to the jury. She considered that it was, therefore, “at least theoretically available” to Hulme J to find that the applicant was not a principal offender but, rather, that she was “present and intentionally encouraging or assisting someone else”. However, at the retrial liability as an aider and abettor had not been left to the jury. The Crown case had been presented only as one of joint criminal enterprise.  
     
      
    14 Her Honour found that all three offenders had made out more favourable subjective cases than they had before Hulme J. It is for that reason that she passed lesser sentences upon Mr and Mrs Smit than his Honour had done. She passed the same sentence upon the applicant as she had upon the Smits, although that was greater than the sentence passed by Hulme J, because she could not distinguish the applicant’s role from theirs. She concluded that she was not constrained to sentence the applicant to a term identical to that imposed by Hulme J after considering a line of authority commencing with R v Gilmore (1979) 1 A Crim R 416. It is necessary to examine those decisions.  
     
      
    15 In Gilmore, Street CJ enunciated the principle that where an offender is convicted of an offence a second time after a retrial, he or she should ordinarily not receive a longer sentence than that passed at the first trial. (Different considerations might apply to the non-parole period, but that is not relevant for present purposes.) The Chief Justice noted that the power to order a new trial is statutory and was unknown to the common law, and referred to a provision of the English Criminal Appeal Act in which the principle is given statutory force. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        The policy consideration underlying the specification of the upper limit on sentence is twofold. In the first place, a person whose conviction is tainted in that the first trial was defective to an extent not capable of being saved by the proviso, should not, in fairness, be required to run any risk of suffering a heavier sentence on a new trial as a consequence of exposing on appeal the defective nature of the first trial. It is in the public interest in ensuring orderly and proper administration of the criminal law that defects in trials should be challenged and laid bare on appeal. As a corollary to this, it is wrong that any person should suffer ill-founded criminal judgment in consequence of a defective trial, and feel constrained to avoid exposing that defect lest on a new trial a heavier sentence be passed. 
        
       
       
        
        In the second place, the passing of a heavier sentence on a new trial could be seen by the convicted person, as well, perhaps, by others in the community at large, as possibly importing some element of retribution by the machinery of criminal justice in consequence of the conviction on the first trial having been successfully overthrown. Any such impression would, of course, be groundless. But, at the same time, it is highly desirable to avoid any possible basis for permitting the operation of the system to be exposed to criticism of such a nature. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    16 The Court revisted the issue in R v Bedford (1986) 5 NSWLR 711. In that case the appellant had been found guilty at a first trial of a number of sexual offences committed against two victims. He had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment in respect of the first victim, upon which sentences in respect of the second victim had been accumulated. Those convictions were set aside by this Court, and he was put on trial again for the offences relating to the first victim.  
     
      
    17 He was again found guilty of those charges and was sentenced to the same aggregate term of imprisonment that had been passed in respect of them in the first trial. However, it was argued that the judge at the second trial should have taken into account a period of custody following the first trial which was exclusively referable to the sentencing order made at the conclusion of that trial. For that proposition the principle in Gilmore was relied upon. That argument was rejected. Street CJ, delivering the leading judgment, noted (at 714) that at the first trial the aggregate sentence for the offences against the first victim must have been moderated to some degree because the sentences in relation to the second victim were to be accumulated upon them, in recognition of the principle of totality. 
     
      
    18 The Chief Justice emphasised that the principle in Gilmore is that a person should not “ordinarily” receive a heavier sentence at a retrial than that passed at the first trial. His Honour continued (at 713-4): 
     
      
       
        
        The word “ordinarily” must be given full room to operate. It might perhaps have been preferable to have expressed this view as a prima facie approach rather than elevating it to a principle. 
         
        
       
       
        
        Where the judge at the new trial considers that the circumstances of the case do call for a longer sentence he will not be absolutely fettered by the approach prima facie to be adopted. He is both at liberty, and indeed obliged, to give effect to his own assessment. It could be expected, however, that, if he did take the view that a longer sentence were called for than that passed at the first trial, then there would be a specific indication of the reasons leading him to this view. 
        
       
      
    19 The Chief Justice went on to observe that there could be “a multiplicity of factors persuading the second judge that he should depart from the prima facie approach”. For example, it might appear that the offender was dealt with unduly leniently at the first trial, or the second trial might disclose criminality of a higher order or a less favourable subjective case.  
     
      
    20 The High Court had occasion to consider the matter in R H McL v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 452. The case is not strictly on point, as it was concerned with the re-adjustment of sentences on a number of counts in an indictment after the convictions on some other counts had been quashed, and the observations of the members of the High Court are strictly obiter. In a joint judgment, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Callinan JJ cited Gilmore with approval and added at [23]: 
     
      
       
        
        In brief, in the absence of countervailing considerations, the sentences imposed following the first trial should be regarded as the upper limit of the sentence to be imposed following the second trial, otherwise an offender will be seen to have been worse off as a result of having brought a successful appeal against a conviction. The weight to be given to that consideration depends, of course, upon the circumstances of the individual case. 
        
       
      
    21 McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ, also in a joint judgment, said at [72]: 
     
      
       
        
        Ordinarily but not invariably, a successful appellant should not receive a longer sentence after conviction on a re-trial than he or she received at the original trial. If the sentencing judge at the re-trial thinks that the original sentence was manifestly inadequate, it is open to that judge in the exercise of the sentencing discretion to give a sentence higher than that imposed on the first occasion. But an exercise of discretion by a sentencing judge that increases the original sentence given to the accused is necessarily rare. That is because such an increase may be perceived, by the public and the accused, as containing a retributive element imposed because the accused had successfully appealed against his or her earlier conviction or sentence. If the raising of a sentence after a successful appeal became common, it might discourage appeals. Such a result would be contrary to the public interest, for an organised society has a vital interest in the proper administration of its criminal justice system. Rights of appeal are an important means of preventing the perpetuation of error in criminal trials. 
        
       
      
    22 Kirby J examined the issue at some length, referring to New South Wales and interstate authority, at [133] ff. His Honour noted at [137] that Gilmore was endorsed by the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia in Williams v The Queen (No 2) [1982] WAR 281. He referred at [139] to the decision of the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal in, in which that Court saw Bedford as something of a retreat from the view expressed in Gilmore. Nevertheless, their Honours had agreed with the manner in which the West Australian court had used the Gilmore reasoning in Williams. 
     
      
    23 Kirby J concluded that the rule, although not rigid, is one of restraint, having “its foundation… in the elementary attributes of a manifestly just system of criminal appeals that Street CJ explained in Gilmore”: [140]. His Honour went on to adopt a passage from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Queensland in R v Petersen [1999] 2 Qd R 85 at 87: 
     
      
       
        
        … 
        where an offender is to be re-sentenced following a successful appeal and re-trial, the second sentencing Judge should start with the proposition that the offender ought, in general, not receive a harsher sentence than that imposed after the first trial. If minded to depart from that approach, he or she should consider the powerful policy considerations outlined above. Only if the second sentencing judge concludes that the earlier sentence was outside the appropriate range, or the facts as they appear at the time of the re-sentence are significantly different from those upon which the first sentence was based, should he or she impose a heavier sentence. 
        
       
      
    24 R v Merritt (No 2) [2000] NSWCCA 365 was a Crown appeal against a sentence passed after a retrial. Following the first trial, the offender had appealed against conviction and the Crown had cross-appealed against sentence. This Court allowed the appeal against conviction and ordered a retrial, but expressed the view that the sentence which had been passed was unduly lenient. 
     
      
    25 The offender was found guilty at the retrial and, in the light of the decisions in Gilmore and Bedford, the judge presiding over that trial felt constrained to pass the same sentence as had been passed at the first trial. The Crown appeal against that sentence was successful. Delivering the leading judgment, O’Keefe J held that the trial judge was not so constrained because the sentence was manifestly inadequate. (The matter had been argued before the High Court handed down its decision in McL.)  
     
      
    26 McL was considered in R v MM (2000) 135 A Crim R 216, in which the authorities were reviewed in the leading judgment of Levine J. In that case, the appellant at a retrial had been sentenced in respect of a series of sexual offences to the same aggregate sentence he had received at the first trial, even though he had been acquitted of some of the charges of which he had been convicted at the first trial. The Court rejected an argument, based upon the Gilmore line of authority, that there should have been some reduction of the aggregate sentence, noting the measure of concurrence in the structure of the sentences passed at the first trial. The issue was somewhat akin to that dealt with in Bedford and, albeit in a different context, in McL.  
     
      
    27 Following his review of the authorities, Levine J said at [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        The series of decisions referred to above provides for the application, in a principled way, of a convention in sentencing. It may be to some extent described as cognate with ""double jeopardy"". Certainly, in my view, it cannot be said that those cases establish a ""rule"". Irrespective of whether the view could be formed that the first set of sentences was manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive, it has to be recognised that the second sentencing judge is not ""resentencing"" but exercising an independent sentencing discretion with respect to the offences of which the particular offender has been convicted. Of course it will be the case that if sentence ""x"" is imposed in relation to fourteen offences and the same sentence ""x"" is imposed in relation to eleven of those fourteen offences, it can be perceived that the sentence has been ""increased"". The explanation for the ""increase"" or the ""good reason"" therefor, should be identifiable by the exposed application of principle to that (second) independent sentencing exercise. 
        
       
      
    28 In R v Hannes [2002] NSWSC 1182, James J sentenced an offender who had been found guilty of a series of offences at a retrial. The first trial had been conducted in the District Court before Backhouse DCJ . Her Honour had imposed sentences which were wholly concurrent, together with fines. James J passed the same sentences but directed that some be served cumulatively upon the others (although he did not impose fines in respect of those offences). His Honour concluded that to permit the sentences for those offences to be served concurrently with the other sentences would have the effect of rendering the punishment for them manifestly inadequate: [174]. 
     
      
    29 His Honour reviewed the principles relating to sentencing after a re-trial, with reference to the major authorities, at [65] ff. At [70] he also expressed the view that in Bedford “Street CJ retreated from what he had said in Gilmore”.  At [84] he expressed his conclusion about the approach he should take in the sentencing exercise before him as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Because of the division of judicial opinion and because the remarks by justices of the High Court in  
        McL 
          
        were, strictly speaking, dicta, it is not entirely clear what principles I should apply in the re-sentencing of Mr Hannes. I consider that it would clearly be open to me to impose a heavier sentence than Judge Backhouse did, if I consider that a sentence imposed by her was so manifestly inadequate that it would be set aside on a Crown appeal on the ground of its manifest inadequacy. I also consider that it would be open to me to impose a heavier sentence than Judge Backhouse did, if I consider that there are new, significantly different facts before me which were not before Judge Backhouse. I also consider that it would be open to me to impose a heavier sentence than Judge Backhouse did, if I consider that Judge Backhouse made a significant specific error in sentencing Mr Hannes. It is not clear whether there are any other circumstances in which I would be justified in imposing a heavier sentence than Judge Backhouse did. If I consider that a sentence imposed by Judge Backhouse is within the permissible range of sentences and, hence, is not manifestly inadequate, it is at least doubtful whether I should impose any heavier sentence, merely because, if I had been sentencing Mr Hannes for the first time, I would have imposed a somewhat heavier sentence.  
        
       
      
    30 There is force in the view that what Street CJ had to say in Bedford represents a watering down of his statement of principle, founded upon considerations of public policy, in Gilmore. The observations of the members of the High Court in McL appear to have restored Gilmore to prominence as an expression of the rationale of this approach to sentencing. That said, the result in Bedford was unremarkable. The sentence passed at the second trial was nominally the same as that passed at the first but its practical effect was somewhat different. However, for the reasons which Street CJ identified, the Court found that the appellant had suffered no real disadvantage. The same is true of MM, and the passage from the judgment of Levine J quoted above must be understood in its context. 
     
      
    31 What does emerge clearly from the authorities is that a judge at a second trial need not perpetuate a sentence which is manifestly inadequate. That was the approach of this Court in Merritt (No 2) and of James J in Hannes. In the present case, that is not suggested of the sentence which Hulme J passed upon the applicant at the first trial. However, what also emerges is that the judge at a second trial might pass a heavier sentence if he or she makes findings of fact bearing upon the offender’s criminality significantly different from those made by the judge at the first trial. It is this which lies at the heart of the application.  
     
      
    32 Counsel for the applicant, Mr Dhanji, submitted that it was not open to her Honour to find that the applicant had inflicted some injury upon the deceased. Allied to that was an argument that the principle of ‘restraint’ in re-sentence at a second trial, to adopt the expression of Kirby J in McL, extends to the drawing of inferences from primary facts. Accordingly, it was said, an offender standing for sentence after a re-trial should ordinarily be no worse off if the same primary facts are established at the second trial, so that the judge at the second trial should be slow to draw inferences from those primary facts more adverse than those drawn by the judge at the first trial. Mr Dhanji further argued that, in any event, her Honour’s finding about the applicant’s role was not of sufficient significance to warrant a departure from the sentence passed by Hulme J. 
     
      
    33 In supplementary submissions, we were supplied with extracts from her Honour’s summing-up and a part of her written directions to the jury in which she dealt with joint criminal enterprise. Those directions, written and oral, contain the conventional direction that, if the agreed crime is committed by one or other of the parties to a joint criminal enterprise, then all parties are guilty of that crime regardless of the part they played in its commission. Mr Dhanji pointed out that at no stage did her Honour direct the jury that it was a requirement for participation in the joint criminal enterprise charged that the particular accused had personally inflicted injury upon the deceased. Participation as an aider and abettor, as Hulme J found of the applicant, would have been sufficient. 
     
      
    34 We have referred earlier to her Honour’s direction that the jury could not use evidence of the applicant’s palm print on the cricket bat in proof of her guilt unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was deposited on the bat at the time the deceased was attacked. Again, as Mr Dhanji pointed out, her Honour did not direct the jury that they had to be satisfied that the palm print was deposited upon the bat as a result of the applicant herself assaulting the deceased. The direction must be understood in the context of the conduct of the trial, at which the central issue was whether the applicant was present at the time of the attack.  
     
      
    35 As we have said, the applicant told police that she was not present when the deceased was attacked. The Crown prosecutor at the trial had submitted to the jury that a number of her answers during that interview were lies demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. There was also evidence that she had asked an acquaintance (the same man to whom Mrs Smit was alleged to have made admissions) to say that she had been living in his premises, rather than those of the deceased, at the relevant time. Her Honour gave the jury the conventional direction about statements said to convey a consciousness of guilt but added that those statements, standing alone, could not establish the applicant’s guilt. It was in that context, Mr Dhanji pointed out, that she emphasised the importance of a finding that the palm print was placed on the bat at the relevant time.  
     
      
    36 The approach of this Court to the findings of fact of a sentencing judge is well established. As Greg James J put it in R v Olenik [2002] NSWCCA 90 at [36], “On an application for leave to appeal against sentence, this court is bound by the findings of fact made by the trial judge, unless it is not open to the trial judge on the evidence before him to make those findings.” His Honour had earlier examined the issue, with reference to authority, in R v Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505 at [30] ff.  
     
      
    37 As recited above, the deceased had sustained a number of stab wounds to various parts of his body and three bloodstained knives were found in the lounge room, where the attack had taken place. Her Honour had occasion to examine the evidence against the applicant in the course of an interlocutory judgment during the trial. She noted that the applicant’s bloodied palm print on the bat was “consistent with the print being made by the transference of blood from the hand to the bat”. She concluded that the whole of the evidence permitted the jury to infer that more than one person assaulted the deceased “by the use of knives and implements”, that the applicant’s hand came into contact with the deceased’s blood at the time he was assaulted with knives, that those assaults took place in the lounge room where the knives were found, and that the applicant handled or touched the bat at or shortly after the time that the deceased was stabbed and before it was wrapped with his body in the kitchen. 
     
      
    38 Viewing the evidence in that way, as her Honour was clearly entitled to do, it cannot be said that it was not open to her to find that all three offenders, including the applicant, inflicted some injury upon the deceased. This was an important departure from the finding of Hulme J at the first trial, but it is apparent from her Honour’s remarks that she did so only after careful consideration. 
     
      
    39 We cannot accept Mr Dhanji’s submission that the principle of restraint governing sentence at a second trial extends to the drawing of inferences from primary facts. As observed above, the authorities acknowledge that a second trial judge might make findings of fact different from, and more culpable than, those made at the first trial. The reference in the cases to findings of fact must encompass the drawing of inferences. No doubt, a second trial judge would not lightly depart from a finding at the first trial which was favourable to the offender. Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon the second trial judge to make his or her own findings of fact. If those findings, conscientiously made, lead to an assessment of the offender’s culpability greater than that of the first trial judge, a sentence heavier than that passed at the first trial is warranted. 
     
      
    40 Thus it was in the present case. Her Honour’s finding about the applicant’s involvement was significantly different from that made by Hulme J and called for a heavier sentence. Moreover, it left her Honour with no proper basis upon which to deal with the applicant more leniently than the other two offenders.  
     
      
    41 Mr Dhanji’s final argument was that the applicant had been denied procedural fairness in the sentencing process. This was said to arise from the fact that the Crown prosecutor at the trial (who did not appear in this Court) did not ask her Honour to make findings of fact different from those of Hulme J and conceded that none of the offenders should receive a sentence longer than that passed at the first trial. Mr Dhanji also did not appear at the trial. However, from the transcript of the proceedings on sentence he mounted an argument that, in the light of the Crown concession, senior counsel then appearing for the applicant had not addressed the possibility of a heavier sentence and her Honour had not foreshadowed that that might be the outcome. He relied upon Fairbairn v Regina (2006) 165 A Crim R 434, in which a similar issue was addressed in the light of relevant authority: see the judgments of Basten JA at [2] and Bell J at [36-37].  
     
      
    42 Of course, her Honour was not bound by the Crown prosecutor’s approach. Mr Dhanji did not suggest that she was. On the question of procedural fairness, however, it appears clearly enough from the transcript that her Honour did raise this issue. In the course of submissions for the applicant, her Honour said that she wished to raise a matter “generally for the benefit of all counsel …”. She went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        The problem I’m having is that I just don’t have any evidence beyond the circumstantial evidence the Crown relied upon to indicate to me on any satisfactory evidentiary basis how I am going to distinguish the roles of these three offenders. That’s the problem I’m having. There are circumstances in relation to each of them which point to their participation in the offence but beyond that I don’t know whether one was more active than another, I just don’t have a basis for saying that.  
        
       
      
    43 When senior counsel for Mr Smit rose to address, he referred to her Honour’s “at least tentative view” about the roles of the three offenders, saying that “it seems impossible to determine exactly what happened”. Her Honour referred to the principles relating to re-sentencing at a retrial, observing that the lower sentence which Hulme J had passed upon the applicant “imposes its own difficulty as it were”. Senior counsel said that it was “cause for some momentum actually”, whereupon her Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        I know what you are going to say Mr Boulton, what it means is that the head sentences of your client and his former wife should come down in order to – but the difficulty with that is that that head sentence arose out of a specific sentence (sic) by Hulme J that Ms Tarrant played a lesser role.  
        
       
       
      The Crown prosecutor addressed last, maintaining the stance he had adopted in his written submissions. 
       
      
    44 It is apparent from what her Honour said that she was having difficulty distinguishing the role of the applicant from those of the other offenders, the very distinction which had led Hulme J to impose a lesser sentence upon her. That being so, it cannot be said that her Honour did not raise with counsel the possibility of a heavier sentence. There was no denial of procedural fairness. 
     
      
    45 Leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal must be dismissed.

   SENTENCE1 In June of 2004 George Fernando was twenty-three years old. He was staying in Kempsey with an uncle, Rob Fernando, at the Green Hills mission. He had completed a two month term of imprisonment on 16 April that year, less than two months prior to the date of the offences bringing him before this Court. If one includes control orders imposed by the Children's Court, he has been in and out of fulltime custody seven times, on my count, between 1998 and 2004. 2 During these six years the Court of Criminal Appeal has published more than 2,800 judgments, many of which have stressed the importance of general and personal deterrence in courts dealing with offenders responsible for crimes of violence such as robbery in company when considering appeals against sentences of imprisonment, or the leniency of sentences imposed by this and/or other courts. 3 The offences now before the court suggest, at least so far as George Fernando is concerned, that he either did not hear or did not heed the Court of Criminal Appeal’s views as to the importance of general and personal deterrence. 4 On 6 June 2004 George Fernando left his Kempsey digs to join three other co-offenders in a motor vehicle, stolen and driven from Sydney, it seems solely for the purpose of conducting a series of brazen robberies between Sydney and Coffs Harbour. 5 In respect of a series of offences conducted by these four hoodlums in the early hours of June the 6th, George Fernando has pleaded guilty in the Local Court at Moree on 20 March 2007 to an offence of robbery in company, and an assault with intent to rob in company. Each of these offences is by far and away the most serious offence George Fernando has committed thus far. Today he is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct in June of 2004.6 He asks, when I sentence him for the robbery in company, that I take into account eighteen additional charges pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, two of which also occurred on 6 June 2004. 7 I had indicated, before I commence these remarks, that items or charges 8, 9 and 11 are matters upon which it appears he has been convicted in the Local Court and, therefore, cannot be included as matters that I can take into account pursuant to s 32, but otherwise I intend to do so; that is, intend to take the other fifteen matters into account.8 As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing contentions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these offences before this Court committed by this offender, harming the victims that he harmed in the community of Coffs Harbour. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, called subjective matters. The starting point for such assessment requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offences and to the offender. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly. 9 Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, as earlier mentioned, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, totality, and finally, of course, the ultimate term of imprisonment or other penalty that is to be imposed. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined. (see Cuthbert (1967) 86 WN (NSW) Pt 1 272, Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 & Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740)10 The evidence before the court is uncontested. The offender’s account was that upon his release from gaol in April of 2004 he resided initially with his brother in Leichhardt. There he stayed for six to eight weeks, resumed his abuse of drugs and moved to live with an uncle in Kempsey to get away from the drugs. The other co-offenders lived in Sydney and were trying to persuade him to become involved in criminal activity there. After he had been in Kempsey for a couple of weeks the three co-offenders, he said, turned up “out of the blue” in the stolen motor vehicle some time between 10 and 11pm on 5 June. At this time he was pretty drunk. He was asked if he wanted to get some money. He agreed. George Fernando’s evidence is that if he was sober he would not have agreed. He claims he did not know he was to be involved in robbery in company when he entered the car. He took nothing to disguise himself. Once in the car, he was armed with a wheel brace by one of his co-offenders and it would seem there was a balaclava for him in the vehicle. 11 His account, both in his sworn evidence and in his ERISP, is one that seeks to minimise his role in these offences. Whilst that is quite understandable, it puts the onus squarely upon the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt matters adverse to him. In the hearing before me none of his evidence was really challenged.  12 The solicitor-in-charge has prepared a statement of facts, which was not contested at the hearing. It appears to reflect fairly the admissions concerning the events made by Fernando to police as best he could remember two years later. Those admissions, coincidentally, were made on 6 June 2006, two years to the day exactly later. 13 The facts, as prepared by Mr Fraser, solicitor of the DPP, are in these terms:  
     
      
      At 3.27am on Sunday 6 June 2007 the offender and three male co-offenders arrived at the Sawtell newsagency situated in First Avenue, Sawtell in a motor vehicle stolen in Sydney the previous day. At that time Terry Powick, a twenty-four year old security officer, was placing the morning newspapers inside the premises. The four offenders approached Mr Powick, wearing clothing over their heads and holding wheel braces in their hands.  
      
     
     
      
      Mr Powick ran to his car, which was parked a short distance away, and two of the offenders ran after him, one of whom struck him on the back of the head with a wheel brace. Another offender said, “Come on, leave him alone. Let him go.” The first offender continued to assault Mr Powick with the wheel brace, hitting him on the shoulder and torso, saying, “He is a witness. I need him gone.” Mr Powick pushed this assailant away and entered his vehicle. He started it, and then his assailant smashed the driver’s side window, seeking to grab the keys from the ignition. Powick said, “Mate, you can have the fucking shop. I’m out of here.” The assailant said, “Just give me the keys and you can go.” No doubt bearing in mind the last remark of the assailant, Mr Powick said, “Be fucked, that will not happen. I’m out of here.”  
      
     
     
      
      The assailant then reached in, turned the motor vehicle off, and tried to take the keys. Mr Powick punched the assailant, causing him to release the keys. The assailant then attempted again to hit Mr Powick with the wheel brace. Mr Powick started the vehicle and drove off. The assailant and one of the other offenders hit the side of the vehicle with the wheel braces as Powick left. The assailant chased after the vehicle for some distance. While that was going on, two of the offenders had gone into the newsagency. In so doing, one had set off the alarm, or probably both. One of those who had gone into the newsagency was this offender. Powick contacted his base, who in turn contacted police. Seconds later, Powick saw the offenders’ vehicle turn south into Toormina Road. The offenders had decided to leave, as I say, because the alarm had been set off.  
      
     
     
      
      At 3.30am on Sunday 6 June, that is some six minutes later, the offender and his co-offenders drove the stolen motor car to the Bogas service station in Toormina Road. At that time Corey King, a twenty-one year old employee of the service station, was in the storeroom of the premises sorting out stock. He heard the petrol pump alarm sound and went to the counter area. There he saw a male person behind the service desk. As he walked into the room, he was confronted by another male person who had a long adjustable wrench, wearing a hat with a bandana wrapped around his face. He said to Mr King, “Where’s the fucking money? Open the fucking till,” whilst pushing him in the back. He said, “Hurry up. Hurry up. Open the fucking till. Where’s the money?”  
       
       
      Mr King saw that the person behind the counter also had his face covered and had a wheel brace, but said nothing. He noted that both persons were of Aboriginal appearance. Mr King said that the person with the wrench kept yelling for money and held the item above his head in a threatening manner. Mr King opened the cash registered and handed the cash drawer containing $600 in cash to the robber with the wrench. The robber’s response was, “Is that all the fucking money?” The other robber took Mr King’s personal laptop computer and his MP3 player valued at $3,100 from the bench on the service desk and ran from the premises. All men drove away in the stolen vehicle. 
      
    14 Mr King, not surprisingly, suffered shock and fear as a result of the offence. 15 The cash drawer taken from the service station was recovered beside the roadway in Toormina. Police also found blood on a filing cabinet drawer in the service station. That blood had a DNA profile consistent with being the offender’s DNA. 16 On 6 June 2006 George Fernando agreed to participate in an electronically recorded interview. He told police he had been picked up from his uncle’s home in Kempsey in the stolen vehicle by his co-offenders and then travelled to Coffs Harbour. 17 He admitted committing the break and enter offence at Computerland, to which I will come shortly, at 3.19. 18 He admitted that about ten minutes later he committed the offence at Sawtell newsagency, the first offence to which I have referred. He said he went there to take cigarettes and had run into the shop, but the alarm went off and he left. He nominated by name a person as responsible for smashing the window of the security officer’s car. 19 He admitted that some six or seven minutes later he committed the robbery at the service station. He agreed that he had taken the laptop computer and MP3 player from the counter. It must be that he was one of the offenders in the shop. He nominated a person who he says was responsible for also confronting the service station operative armed with a wrench. 20 He said eventually he had been driven back to his uncle’s home in Kempsey and the others had returned to Sydney. He accepted that he had received “a bit of money” from the robbery but the laptop computer and the MP3 player had been taken to Sydney by his co-offenders. 21 It was conceded by the crown that this offender had pleaded guilty to the indictment at the earliest opportunity. 22 Eight minutes or so before the first of the offences was committed on the security officer, the vehicle containing the four offenders pulled up in front of Computerland, Park Avenue, Coffs Harbour. One of the men was apparently armed with a shortened firearm. This weapon was left behind at the scene. The front window of the premises was smashed. A computer, money box, digital camcorder were taken. This offender was responsible for grabbing the computer. The four offenders then fled in their stolen vehicle, making their way to the newsagency. This is one of the fifteen offences I am to take into account on the form 1. 23 I have also been asked to take into account the fact that this offender allowed himself to be conveyed from Kempsey to Coffs Harbour in the stolen vehicle. That trip was a trip undertaken for the illegal purposes that I am dealing with. OBJECTIVE CRIMINALITY24 From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess what is called the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of this offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant offences with the criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. Not surprisingly, the objective criminality has a very important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome.25 Gleeson J, when Chief Justice of New South Wales, encapsulated the essence of the legal wrong done by robbers and the reason why substantial punishment is required in The Queen v Rause NSW CCA 8/8/92. What his Honour said there is not only relevant to the service station offence, but also has relevance to the assault upon Mr Powick. The Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
      “One of the primary purposes of the system of criminal justice is to keep the peace. In this connection, the idea of peace embraces the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk the streets, to go about their daily affairs [including work] without fear of physical violence. It also embraces respect for the property of others. Offences of the kind committed by the present [offender] are not trivial instances of disrespect of private property. They are serious breaches of the peace. They are direct attacks upon the security of person and property which the law exists to protect.  
      
     
     
      
      It is quite likely that this young man does not understand and he may never understand the seriousness of his anti-social behaviour. But the courts understand it. Crimes of this kind, especially when committed by an offender with a long criminal history, deserve severe punishment.” 
      
    26 Each of the two offences that I am dealing with was an offence of serious personal violence towards another human being. Robbery, and indeed an intent to rob when accompanied by an assault, constitutes a crime against the person and robbery against the person’s property rights. In this case, the person having custody was not the owner of the property. In that sense, the victim’s employer would also have been a victim. 27 The crime against the person is constituted by putting the person in fear through threat of violence to such a point that he would surrender against his will property to the robber. There is no doubt in the account that Mr Powick gives through his comments that he was terrified, and there is no doubt he had every reason to be terrified, particularly given the remarks of one of this offender’s co-offenders.28 In this case, the offender secured his advantage through his violence by presenting wheel braces and numbers to his victims. In doing so, he demonstrated his ruthlessness and his willingness to be part of a ruthless gang by menacing the service station attendant, and by menacing and assault Mr Powick. Each of these offences involves the administration of serious violence to innocent third parties. The use of numbers by the offenders ensured they outnumbered each of their victims. Each victim was put at risk of serious injury. 29 Indeed, the assault upon the twenty-four year old security officer saw him struck on the back of the head with the wheel brace. That action exposed Mr Powick to a risk of traumatic head injury and there must have been a potential for brain damage. While this offender was not personally present at that assault, he had taken the opportunity to run into the shop and in that sense shares liability for the offence. He was a principal in the second degree, in that while the assault was commenced upon Mr Powick, two offenders including this offender, took advantage of Powick’s predicament to enter or try to enter the shop knowing their companions were assaulting the security guard who was responsible for the safety or welfare of the shop and its goods.30 The offender’s role in the service station robbery was to support his co-offender who was armed with the wrench. He also seized and transported to the car the service station attendant’s personal laptop computer and MP3 player. These items represented five times the value of the money stolen. 31 The law has long regarded as vulnerable, persons who work one out in their business. The service station attendant was working one out. His vulnerability was heightened by the presence of more than one offender. The offenders being armed with wheel braces capable of inflicting injury to a victim when wielded by an offender or if thrown at the victim aggravate the criminality of these two offences. 32 This is not a matter in which De Simone has a role to play because, as I read it, these are not prohibited or dangerous weapons but simply wheel braces being used to inflict or capable of inflicting injury to a victim when wielded by one of the offenders or if thrown at the victim. 33 The criminality exhibited by these offenders is of a high level. No complaint of injury has been made, but the level of violence is very substantial. The fact that there are three serious offences committed within such a short time-span is indicative of an attitude of wanton unlawfulness. The value of the goods taken is not high, and no doubt was disappointing to the offenders, but is considerable nonetheless. 34 The commission of the offences on three targeted premises, their being committed well away from the bases where the offenders were residing, each offence being committed within a short time-span of the other, each offence being committed in the early hours of the morning when security and awareness would be minimal, the use of a stolen vehicle, the presence of several wheel braces and a firearm, and the collection of four willing offenders bespeaks a level of serious planning. Such planning reflects an increased criminality by comparison with an offence committed impulsively or opportunistically. 35 In evidence the offender said the stolen vehicle and three co-offenders turned up out of the blue. At the time, he said, he was pretty drunk. He was asked if he wanted to get some money, and he agreed. He says, had he been sober he would not have gone on with them. When he entered the vehicle he did not know it was to be with an armed robbery. He knew the various co-offenders. He was given the wheel brace by someone in the vehicle.36 There was no cross-examination of that evidence. However, it must have been apparent, not only from the conversation but the presence of the wheel braces, balaclava and firearm, that robberies were planned and that the vehicle was on its way to a destination where these plans would be executed. This offender had plenty of time to consider his position and withdraw if he so desired. Once he knew the offence was to be at Coffs Harbour, it must have occurred to him if he were to be caught he would, by virtue of his name, embarrass the one brother that seems to have been doing well in his own life. 37 I am satisfied the offender was not the leader or instigator of the decision to form the group and target the three sites. Nor did he at any time drive the stolen motor vehicle. He was, however, an active participant. His role was to enter each of the premises armed with a wheel brace. There is no evidence to suggest he possessed a wheel brace before he entered the vehicle, and I accept he was supplied with one by another of the offenders. His role though was a front man, entering the premises, searching for and capturing items. That places him as an important member of the group formed for these unlawful purposes. His criminality is of a serious order. Clearly the objective criminality requires a very substantial period of incarceration.SUBJECTIVE MATTERS38 I now turn to the subjective factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but I am also sentencing this offender for them. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender, or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate. FAMILY BACKGROUND AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS39 This offender is a twenty-six year old indigenous male. Since November of 2004 he has been in a relationship with Lisa Duncan. She gave evidence in Court at Moree. I was impressed by her. The offender says during the six month period that he was with her he kerbed his drinking and committed no offences. 40 The offender has two sons, his six year old living in Kempsey and two year old living with Lisa Duncan. He also has an eight year old daughter living in Grafton. The daughter and the six year old son are from other relationships. He has seen neither of these children for some time. I gather the last time he saw the boy in Kempsey, was in 2004 when he was there. The two year old, as I say, is Lisa Duncan’s child. To his credit, he was providing child support for both the older children until his arrest.  41 Fernando himself has two brothers and five sisters. One of his siblings is a stepsister. George Fernando is the fourth eldest of the eight, if I have done my maths correctly. The siblings range from thirty-one years to nineteen. After his release from gaol in April 2004 he resided with a brother in Leichhardt for six to eight weeks. 42 The younger brother William, aged twenty-three, lives, I understand, a crime-free life in Coffs Harbour. The offender describes him as a Christian who plays sport, does not drink, and does not take drugs. It is clear to me this offender looks up to that brother, even though he is younger. The offender’s post release plans include moving from Moree to Coffs Harbour and linking up with this brother, trying out for football himself, and relying upon the brother for support. Lisa Duncan supports this plan. I have no evidence of the brother’s willingness to be involved with George Fernando. 43 The offender’s family life was marred by an alcohol-abusing, violent father. The offender claims he and each of his siblings did all they could to leave home as soon as possible because of the physical assaults received from the father. The parents’ de facto relationship ended two years ago, after forty years together. The offender has limited contact with his father and, from what I understand, it is not warm. 44 His mother, on the other hand, is one of the most important persons in his life. He recognises her as protecting him and his siblings from the father. Consequently, she was frequently the focus of his violence. From some of the insights I have had into the indigenous community, that role she assumed is not an isolated role but a role forced on many of the women in the Aboriginal community because of the existence of alcoholism and domestic violence. 45 There were two years when the offender was away from his family as he grew up. Kelly Reilly, a consultant psychologist, was told that he was at a boys’ home for six months. The balance of the time, it would seem, he spent living with an uncle in Kempsey. What impact that time away from the family had upon him has not been disclosed in the evidence, but he must have been only reaching puberty at that time and it must have been significant for him. EDUCATION, SKILLS AND EMPLOYMENT46 The offender attended preschool and primary school at Moree. Years 7 and 8 were done at Kempsey living with his uncle. He left school in Year 8. Why is unclear. He has not advanced his academic studies since leaving school. The decision to leave is strange because he claims he coped reasonably well and was not in trouble at school. It would have been a place where I would have thought he could have found some security and perhaps some intellectual stimulation. 47 His employment history is limited to CDEP work as a gardener for a couple of months over 1995 to 1996. His income stream has otherwise been unemployment benefits.48 He claims good sporting skills. He is interested in pursuing football in Coffs Harbour when released. He certainly presents as a very fit young man who, if equipped, as other Aborigines are, with wonderful eye/hand coordination, could probably do well in sport. HEALTH49 Mr Fernando presents as a fit man of nuggety build, aged twenty-six. As far as one can tell, he enjoys good general health. He told Kelly Reilly, and the sadness of this is that it is a comment I often hear from indigenous prisoners, that he is the fittest he has ever been. Why it takes prison to make Aboriginal men fit is well beyond my comprehension. He exercises daily. ALCOHOL AND DRUG ISSUES50 When not in custody, George Fernando abuses alcohol, drinking ten to fifteen standard drinks daily. He was reaching a level of drunkenness nightly, he says. 51 He would also abuse marijuana, smoking 5 grams daily. Smoking at that level will ultimately cause, if he is vulnerable, brain damage. He has been abusing marijuana since the age of sixteen. 52 His evidence was that whilst in custody he has been attending AA meetings weekly. He claims to have been clean of drugs and alcohol whilst at the Tamworth Correctional Centre.MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES53 There are residual symptoms relating to his abusive alcohol-fused environment during his childhood. These include anxiety, drug and alcohol addiction. Kelly Ritchie diagnosed generalised anxiety disorder and substance abuse disorder. The substance abuse disorder appears to be in remission whilst he is in custody. The real issue is whether he will resume addictive practices upon his return to the community. 54 Lisa Duncan, fortunately, does not abuse drugs or alcohol. That fact, coupled with the fact that he has been attending AA, offers some hope that he may remain drug and alcohol free. Particularly may this be so if he links up with his brother in Coffs Harbour. CRIMINAL HISTORY55 This offender first came before the courts in 1993 as a twelve year old for attempting to steal a motor vehicle. He received his first custodial sentence in 1995, a control order, when aged thirteen. There was another control order made against him in 1997, when he was aged sixteen, for a raft of offences. 56 His first offence as an adult occurred in 2000 when he was aged eighteen. He was gaoled for three months. In 2001 he was gaoled for six months. In July of 2003 he was gaoled for nine months. In 2004 he was gaoled for two months. The offences I am dealing with occurred within two months of his release in 2004.57 All of his offending to date has been dealt with in the summary jurisdiction. Many relate to illegal use of motor vehicles, driving offences, common assault, intimidation. These offences, regrettably, are by far and away the most serious he has committed to date. ATTITUDE TO OFFENCES58 The offender acknowledged these offences constitute his most serious offending to date. He claims his motivation was to obtain money to further his drinking and drug abuse. I do not regard the drinking and marijuana abuse to have any causative link with his offending. 59 He was invited into the group of offenders. His evidence is he would not have committed the offence but for the invitation. 60 He received some money, which I have no doubt he spent unwisely on alcohol and/or probably marijuana. 61 Since being in custody he has sought to deal with his alcohol issues through AA. I am satisfied there is insight by him into his offending behaviour. I am satisfied his plea of guilty is made as acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct. I accept his efforts at rehabilitation whilst in custody demonstrate a real desire to change because of his serious criminal offending. 62 He says his motivation to reform is driven by his desire to connect with his younger son and to resume a lawful life with his partner Lisa Duncan.PLEA OF GUILTY63 The plea was entered at the earliest available opportunity.COOPERATION WITH POLICE64 This offender was arrested for these matters two years after they occurred. He agreed to be interviewed by police. While there is evidence he sought to minimise his involvement, once confronted with evidence or apparent knowledge by the police of the facts, the offender assisted in their inquiries. In so doing, he strengthened the crown case.65 Further, he nominated in the course of the interview others by name of his co-offenders. What value, if any, that was to the police has not been disclosed in the evidence.66 The offender himself has come to light because of what is called a cold hit DNA profile match. Police intelligence has, at very least, become more informed as a result of his cooperation with them. 67 There is no evidence of any further arrests, however. Nor has there been any approach to this offender by investigation or prosecutorial authorities. Nonetheless, I do propose to increase the utilitarian discount I would give for the early plea from 25 to 30 per cent, taking into account the nature of his cooperation with police and his apparent contrite response to his offending.REHABILITATION PROSPECTS68 This offender’s rehabilitation prospects are closely linked to his capacity to remain drug and alcohol free upon his release or, at very least, to contain his drug and alcohol use within modest parameters. 69 I have pointed to two positive factors; his partner does not abuse drugs or alcohol, and he has maintained weekly contact with AA. 70 There are other positive factors pointing to rehabilitation. His partner is supportive of him. He has not heard from his mother since being at Tamworth. I understand she is an important person to him, and efforts should be made to reconnect this offender with the mother so that he can get support from her. He has good physical health. There do not appear to be any anti-social drivers in his psychological profile. He still is relatively youthful. He has begun to think about his post release plans, recognising he may be vulnerable to re-offending if he remains in Moree and, therefore, plans to move to Coffs Harbour. He has accepted responsibility for his acts and has sought to advance his rehabilitation since then. There was a six month crime-free period when he first commenced with Lisa Duncan. That appears to have been interrupted by his arrest. 71 On the negative side, he has not approached, I am told, the D and A counsellor at gaol. Whether that is because of shyness, some personal conflict or an unwillingness to face the alcohol issues is unclear. In the past when offered D and A counselling he has demonstrated unreliability. He has failed to take part in the past in any community-based opportunities assisting him to reform. GENERAL DETERRENCE72 The law requires that I factor into the ultimate sentencing disposition for these offences consideration of general and personal deterrence. In modern Australian society there is a very extensive raft of criminal laws passed by the State and Federal Parliaments. The chief purpose of the criminal law put in place by Parliaments is to deter those tempted to breach the provisions of that law. Parliament does that by prescribing maximum penalties for those who engage in conduct prohibited by the criminal law. I will come in a moment to what the maximum penalties are for these offences.73 Consequently, when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law, such as George Fernando is today, he is exposed to the possible maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires the sentencing judge to keep in mind those general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large by keeping in mind the maximum available sentence and the deterrent purpose of those sentences. There is also a specific deterrence aimed at individuals likeminded to the offender, such as the three other men in the motor vehicle who, but for such deterrence, would be willing to commit crimes similar to those for which this offender is to be punished. Finally, there is a component of deterrence personal to the offender with a view to deterring him from re-offending.74 The maximum penalty for each of these offences that I must keep in mind is twenty years imprisonment. 75 Taking the Form 1 matters into account, there are fifteen now discrete matters on the Form 1. Two of these fifteen were offences committed in conjunction with these two offences. I have already referred to them. Of the remaining offences, twelve occur in Moree between 13 May 2005 and 6 June 2006. Of that group I am satisfied, upon conviction, gaol terms would have been imposed in respect of one, and possibly two. A further charge relating to attempted larceny of a motor vehicle in Tamworth may also have attracted a gaol term. 76 The proper approach to Form 1 matters was set out by the Chief Justice in a guideline judgment of the Attorney-General’s reference number 1 of 1999. The Chief Justice speaking for the court made clear that there was an approach to be taken which would result in an increase in penalty. In speaking about that approach spegielma said: 
     
      
      “The court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always materially in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to exact retribution for serious offences which...are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence.” 
      
    CONCURRENT SENTENCES77 I am imposing concurrent sentences for the two offences. However, so that the total criminality of the two offences is properly reflected, the sentence for the first offence will be driven upward further, that is, on top of the initial upward movement caused by the Form 1 matters. These offences should be concurrent. They represent the one episode of intense criminal conduct by the four occupants of the stolen vehicle.PARITY78 No issues of parity arise. As far as I am aware, no other offender has been arrested, charged or sentenced for these offences. CUSTODIAL HISTORY79 This offender was arrested for these matters on the second anniversary of the offences, namely, 6 June 2006. At that time he was in custody on some other matter, it would seem. 80 On the material before me, however, his custody on his matter is said to backdate to 15 April 2006. Consequently, his sentences will each commence from that date. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES81 This is a case in which the principles enunciated by Wood J in the case of Stanley Fernando (1992) 72 ACrimR 58 at 62-63 have some application. The subjective features, as reviewed by me, satisfy me that George Fernando comes from an Aboriginal community in which alcohol abuse and violence were ingrained, impacted upon his upbringing, the values that he now possesses, the chances he had of advancing himself, and the substantial social difficulties he has encountered. 82 While I recognise that he has been incarcerated before and is currently incarcerated at Tamworth among other indigenous prisoners, principle G has some resonance in this case. While I note it cannot be said George Fernando is an Aboriginal with little experience of European way, he qualifies for principle G by reason of his deprived background and also by reason of his being disadvantaged by reason of social and economic factors arising from his Aboriginality. 83 I note principle A requires application of the sentencing principles, regardless of an offender’s membership of ethnic or other grouping.84 I note also the relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period imposed by Wood J on Stanley Fernando. In today’s sentencing language such a result would only be achieved by a finding of special circumstances. Another feature to be noted is that the sentenced expressed, as it was in 1992, required a decision of the Parole Board as to the timing of the release of Stanley Fernando. In other words, his release was not automatic. 85 Likewise, I intend that the sentence I set shall require oversighting by the Parole Board as to the fitness of this offender for ultimate release. This approach seems to me an appropriate means to give effect to principles A, B, E, F, G and H of the reported Fernando case. 86 Other reasons for finding special circumstances include the relative youth of this offender. This will be the longest sentence this offender has served. His post release plans incorporate a move to a new community. He and his partner clearly will need substantial time and resources to settle into that community. His rehabilitation has better chances of being accomplished within the community than is likely to be so whilst he is in custody. 87 It is an effective means of complying with s 3A(d) and s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act without derogating from other obligations imposed by those sections. So far as the term of imprisonment is concerned in s 5(1), bearing in mind that the section speaks of imprisonment being a sentence of last resort, I have taken it to mean the serving of a term of imprisonment as distinct from imprisonment as encapsulated by s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. APPLYING THE UTILITARIAN AND OTHER DISCOUNT88 For the early plea and other matters referred to, I indicated I would give a discount of 30 per cent. I also indicated that the demands of totality and the taking into account of the Form 1 matters will drive the sentence upwards. But for the plea of guilty, I would have set a term of imprisonment for the first offence of nine years; that is, for the robbery in company. That sentence will be discounted by 30 per cent, giving an overall sentence of six years, three months and fifteen days. HIS HONOUR: Would you stand, please, Mr Fernando. 89 George James Fernando, I convict you of the offence that you on 6 June 2004 at Toormina robbed Corey King at the Bogas service station in Coffs Harbour of certain property, namely $600 in cash, a laptop, and MP 3 computer player, which was the property of Corey King and Bogas service station, while you were in the company of other offenders. I set a non-parole period for that offence of three years, three months and fifteen days to expire on 29 July 2008 and a balance of term of three years to expire on 29 July 2011. The earliest eligible release date you have is 29 July 2008.90 For the other offence that you on 6 June 2004 at Sawtell in the State of New South Wales did assault Terry Powick with intent to rob him of certain property, to wit motor vehicle and cigarettes, whilst being in the company of two other offenders, you are convicted. For that offence I sentence you to a fixed term of three years imprisonment, and that is a figure that is arrived at taking into account a discount, to date from 15 April 2006 and to expire on 14 April 2009. Your first eligible date for release is 29 July 2009.91 Whether you are released on that occasion or not will be a matter for the Parole Board, not for me. I have made that clear in the judgment. For you to be released at that time, you will need to impress the Parole Board with your conduct from now till then. They will look at what you have done in prison to reform yourself and how you have managed to, if you do, how you have managed to stay out of trouble. 92 I should note that I have taken into account, in setting that first sentence, the matters on the Form 1 and totality.93 The offender can be returned to his custody.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Jade M. came before me at the Moree District Court, appealing from the severity of sentences imposed upon him by the Children’s Court there. He had, with some other young fellows, got himself into a fair bit of trouble and was before the Children’s Court for break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, taking and driving a conveyance, and being carried in a conveyance without consent of the owner.2 There were other times when he had come to the attention of the Juvenile Justice authorities or the police and he was also up for a breach of a bond. Those other times when he had been in trouble, he was not necessarily charged, but he certainly was spoken to.3 I looked at his record last night. Between 2003 and 2005 he had been before the courts some 15 or 20 times.4 For the offences with which I am dealing. I put him on what is called a Griffith remand. It is an option open, pursuant to s 33, 1(C) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. I required him to live in Coffs Harbour region with his uncle, who must be quite a man from what I have read, and his uncle’s family, out of the Boggabilla area for 12 months. Under his uncle’s supervision, but still coming back into contact with his adopted parents, he has maintained himself well for 12 months. He tells me and I accept, that he has been in no trouble during that 12 month period.5 The story is actually better than that, because apart from not even being in trouble, he has actually made positive gains. He has undertaken some study. He is accepting alcohol and other drug counselling. He hopes to get his learners drivers permit. He is doing a literacy and numeracy course. I am told today he has secured a job as a groundsman at the main rugby ground in Coffs Harbour. He is playing football with the Sawtell Panthers in the under 18's side and is making some social contacts, which in my view is important, particularly if they are fellows who are not using drugs and are not drinking to excess.6 It would appear to me that there is an element of stability in his life. In those circumstances I am hopeful that he will stay there and accept the mentoring offered by his uncle and family.7 The formal orders that I make are these, that the severity appeals are upheld. The appeals against sentences imposed by the learned magistrate in respect of the break and enter, the take and drive conveyance, and being carried in a conveyance without consent are upheld. In lieu of the sentences imposed, and bearing in mind the 9 months that he has been on a s 33(1)(C) bail, I will release him on condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of a further six months. Once that six months is up, it is all over. That will mean for more than a year you have been behaving yourself.8 In respect of the breach of the bond, I intend to take no action, bearing in mind what he has already done, both in terms of serving time in custody and in terms of the s 33(1)(c) requirements that have been imposed upon him as part of the oversight action that I would be taking into account when dealing with him for the breach.9 I think that is all the orders I need to make madam Crown, is that right?

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Benjamin Aurisch appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to an offence of robbery. This was the type of robbery which is conveniently described by the expression, a “bag snatch”. The victim left her home one morning, carrying her handbag. The offender was across the road. He moved quickly towards her, grabbed her handbag, which was over her left shoulder, and pulled it away from her. The victim attempted to prevent the offender taking her handbag, but the strap broke and she fell to the ground. As she did so, an Ipod fell out of the bag. The offender initially took off, but noticed that the Ipod was on the ground and so he took it as well and ran away.2 Police came very shortly afterwards. They soon discovered the offender walking nearby. He was arrested and property taken from the victim was found in his possession. He made immediate admissions to police. The victim had been able to find the handbag, noticed that it had been torn at one end and that her mobile phone and Ipod were missing. Police handed back to the victim her mobile and Ipod, which they had taken from the offender. The offender went to the police station, where full admissions were made.3 The offender is now twenty-four years of age. He completed his Higher School Certificate and commenced an apprenticeship as a carpenter. He however lost that job when he lost his driver’s licence. He has only seven months to go before he completes his apprenticeship. Having lost his job he seems to have fallen into an unsatisfactory lifestyle, consuming alcohol to excess and taking drugs regularly. He commenced taking drugs at about twenty years of age, but it seems that his drug use significantly escalated once he lost work. The offender said that he is not happy with himself and not happy with his lifestyle and for that reason he turned to drugs and alcohol. 4 The offender has a criminal history. Somewhat remarkably, although there are sixteen or seventeen offences on it, he has never served any period of custody up until he was refused bail on the present matter. He has been dealt with leniently on many, many occasions. He has been given s 9 bonds and s 12 bonds and on occasions fined. The offender has failed to take advantage of the leniency that was offered to him. At one stage he was on a s 11 remand and he barely completed that remand period satisfactorily, because he continued to take drugs. He has breached his s 12 remand and is due to be sentenced in the Local Court for that in a short period of time. Indeed he was on a s 9 bond and on bail at the time he committed these offences. I refer to these matters in particular, because they indicate in my view the substantial need to impose a sentence upon the offender which will personally deter him from committing similar offences in the future. The time to get tough with Mr Aurisch arrived some time ago. He has been done no favours by being dealt with leniently, giving him, no doubt, the impression that he could continue to offend, in various ways, without ever being punished. It needs to be made clear to the offender in no uncertain terms that his conduct is serious. His conduct is indeed disgraceful and punishment is required to deter him from committing similar offences in the future.5 Offences of this kind are serious. The authorities that the crown reminded me of, speak about not only the effect on the victims, but also on the concept that these offences represent a significant breach of the peace. Citizens should be free to walk on the streets and go about their daily affairs without fear of physical violence. The victim in this case was entitled to go about her business without fear of being attacked and robbed. She no doubt has suffered as a result of this offence being committed upon her. And the community in general suffers, people walk along the street apprehensively, clutching their handbags close to them because of offences of this nature. 6 In this case there is no evidence as to the harm that was occasioned to the victim. But I am satisfied that there does not need to be specific evidence to justify the conclusion that she will have been significantly affected by the offence committed upon her. I have got no doubt that she is now more apprehensive when she walks along the road with her handbag; that she is apprehensive when she sees strangers; and that these feelings of apprehension have had a significant impact upon her daily life. 7 A significant sentence is needed in this case because of general deterrence as well. No one should have the feeling that they can commit offences such as this and receive a slap on the wrist. The maximum penalty for offences of this kind is fourteen years imprisonment, which is a good indication of the seriousness with which such offences should be viewed. 8 A submission was put to me that this offence was low in the range of objective seriousness, but when pressed the only matter that could really be identified was that there was no significant financial loss to the victim. That is a matter I will take into account, but I doubt very much that the victim is terribly concerned with her financial loss and indeed I find that she will be much more concerned about the violation of her personal safety that this offence represents. 9 There is no evidence that this offence was planned, but on the other hand, there is no evidence that it was not. The crown can not prove to me beyond reasonable doubt the aggravating factor, but the offender can not prove to me on the balance of probabilities, that the mitigating factor is present either.10 The offender has been in custody since 5 January 2007, which is the day he was arrested for this offence. The sentence that I will impose will of course therefore start from that day. 11 The offender has shown his remorse, he made full admissions to police and indicated to me that he felt ashamed of what he had done. I will bear that in mind in formulating the appropriate sentence. 12 I am unable to find that there are good prospects of rehabilitation. Certainly there are prospects and the offender does indicate a desire to rehabilitate himself, but whether he is able to do so or not, remains to be seen. In view of the criminal history and his failure to take advantage of leniency offered to him, the offender should not think that it is going to be an easy road for him. I will discount the sentence that I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty.13 Both the crown and Mr Morris for the offender relied on sentencing statistics and decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, not only as to the principles which bind me, but also as to the appropriate tariff. I have considered those matters and they are helpful in guiding me to the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case.14 I will make a finding of special circumstances. This is the first time that the offender has spent any time in custody. He is only twenty-four and there is a clear need for the offender to be supervised and assisted upon his release from custody. 15 At one stage during the course of submissions, I raised for consideration the possibility that I would make a larger than usual adjustment in the ratio between non-parole period and head sentence, but make it a condition of his release on parole that he only be released to parole when the offender enters a residential drug rehabilitation programme. What I had in mind was a shorter period of custody, followed by a period of quasi custody. I still think that is perhaps the best thing that could happen to the offender and thus the community. But even with the assistance of Mr Morris and the crown, it was proved impossible to formulate an appropriate order which took account of the possibility that through no fault of his own the offender would be denied entry into a drug rehabilitation programme. To take an obvious example, such programmes may well be full at the time the offender completes his non-parole period and it would of course be unjust that he remain in custody because he is unable to enter a drug residential rehabilitation programme in those circumstances. 16 For that reason I have decide to proceed more traditionally. It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that the objective gravity of an offence must be reflected in the sentence for it. A related rule is that the non-parole period cannot be reduced to the extent that it to fails to reflect the objective gravity in the offender’s conduct.17 I regard the offender’s conduct as extremely serious indeed. For those reasons, the appropriate sentence is this: The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to commence on 5 January 2007, it will expire on 4 July 2008, on which the day offender is to be released to parole. I set a head sentence of two and a half years. It is a condition of the offender’s release to parole that he be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service and that during that period of supervision, he attend any drug rehabilitation programmes or alcohol rehabilitation programmes recommended by the Probation and Parole Service.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgments of Santow JA and Ipp JA. 
     
      
    2 I perceive that the only difference in substance between the two judgments, with which I agree, relates to whether it should be inferred that the police searched the bathroom before matters erupted in the kitchen. On this point I agree with Ipp JA. 
     
      
    3 Regrettably, this is the third occasion in which appellate review of a case involving allegations of police trespass and assault has been hampered by reason of poor pleading practice on the part of the State. The two earlier decisions are referred to by Ipp JA and they contain clear admonitions to those representing the police in this State as to the way to formulate the issues. Correct pleading ensures that matters are not overlooked and also guides the court and litigants as regards the onus of proof on particular matters. 
     
      
    4 I therefore agree with the orders proposed save that the State should, in my view, bear its own costs of the appeal.

      INTRODUCTION  
       
      This appeal concerns the police powers under statute and common law to enter premises. The police entry in this case was by reason of a radio call designated “ 
      violent domestic 
      ” whereby the police had an apprehension that domestic violence had occurred and could be continuing. That call was from a neighbour who reported hearing screaming and raised voices, from the occupier Murat Kuru (plaintiff below and respondent in this appeal) and his girlfriend, now wife, Janette Kuru. That there was much yelling and screaming in the course of an argument between them is not in issue; there was however no physical violence in fact. But this could only be ascertained  
      after 
       police entry on to the premises. 
       
      
    6 The police entry when first effected was without the express consent or invitation of the occupier, Mr Kuru, though it was through an open door. However, shortly after Mr Kuru emerged from the bathroom, he permitted the police to inspect the premises. The police, having inspected the sitting room and bedrooms and finding no-one injured had, I infer, still to inspect the bathroom. The inspection was therefore not complete at that point. Nor was the police investigation such that the police could yet be reliably satisfied that no violence had occurred even if they had inspected the bathroom. Mr Kuru at that point became increasingly aggressive and sought to withdraw his earlier invitation. There followed an altercation with Mr Kuru involving some physical aggression on his part, its degree only being a matter of dispute. That led to his arrest and subsequent detention overnight. Soon after leaving the premises, the police were able to verify, by speaking to Mr Kuru’s girlfriend nearby, that in fact no violence had occurred.  
     
      
    7 After the police arrested the respondent, they charged him in the Local Court for assault against a police officer and resisting arrest. The respondent successfully contended at trial that the police were not legally permitted to enter or remain on the premises and were liable to him for very substantial damages as follows: (i) for trespass to property $85,000, (ii) for trespass to person, general damages $150,000 plus out of pocket expenses $8,265, (iii) for false imprisonment $20,000, (iv) for aggravated damages $35,000, and (v) for exemplary damages $120,000. The foregoing adds up to $418,265, there being no award of damages for negligence. The police, as the State of New South Wales, challenges both those findings of liability and damage.  
     
      
    8 Specifically, the issues arising in this appeal from the police entry and the respondent’s subsequent arrest and imprisonment overnight can be summarised as follows:  
     
      
      (a) in the events that happened, whether police entry and the continued presence of the police were permitted by s357F of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 (NSW) (“the Act”) and, to the extent applicable, s357H of the Act, or by the common law, or by a combination of these, so as to obviate any trespass to person or property or false imprisonment, and  
      (b) whether, if liability for trespass were made out, the damages awarded were excessive; such challenge extends to the award of aggravated and exemplary damages. SALIENT FACTS  
      
    9 Many of the salient facts are not in dispute. I discuss the disputed facts in more detail under “Disposition” below.  
     
      
    10 As at 15 June 2001, the respondent and his girlfriend Janette (now his wife) were living at 7/30 Britten Crescent, Hillsdale (“the premises”).  
     
      
    11 On the evening of 15 June 2001, the respondent and Janette attended a housewarming barbeque at the respondent’s sister’s home, approximately 4-5 minutes’ walk from the premises. The respondent consumed approximately six beers during the course of the evening.  
     
      
    12 Upon arriving home from the barbeque around midnight, an argument developed between the respondent and Janette, involving much yelling and screaming, but not involving any physical violence.  
     
      
    13 As a result of the yelling and screaming, a neighbour called the police. The police radio alert, to which a number of units responded, was designated as a “violent domestic” as opposed to a “normal domestic”.  
     
      
    14 In the meantime:  
     
      
      (a) The respondent and Janette had concluded their argument and settled down;  
      (b) The respondent’s sister, and Mr Mustafa Yavuz and Mr Yasser Guler (father-figure to and friend of the respondent respectively) had arrived at the premises;  
      (c) Janette had left the premises with the respondent’s sister;  
      (d) Mr Yavuz and Mr Guler had gone into the premises and spoken with the respondent, who had explained that he and Janette had argued;  
      (e) The respondent had gone to have a shower, with Mr Yavuz and Mr Guler remaining in the premises;  
      (f) The front door of the premises had been left open.  
      
    15 Early in the morning on 16 June 2001, six police officers (as listed under dramatis personae below) entered the premises.  
     
      
    16 The primary judge Murray ADCJ relates in some detail the events surrounding the police officers’ entry into the premises. The respondent, Messrs Yavuz and Guler, and the six police officers who attended the alert gave various versions of events.  
     
      
    17 Basic facts common to each of the various versions of events are as follows:  
     
      
      (a) The six police officers entered the premises while the respondent was in the shower;  
      (b) Mr Yavuz and Mr Guler were in the living room with the police officers when the respondent emerged from the bathroom;  
      (c) Verbal exchanges took place between the respondent, the police officers and Messrs Yavuz and Guler, in relation to:  
       
        
        (i) The argument between the respondent and Janette;  
        (ii) The whereabouts of Janette, including the address of the respondent’s sister’s home, where the housewarming had been taking place;  
        (iii) Repeated requests by the respondent to have the police leave the premises, made with some emphasis;  
        
       
      (d) When the police did not leave, the respondent jumped onto the bench in the kitchen of the premises, and then jumped off that bench (according to the police by jumping over a splash-board into the lounge, but according to the respondent by jumping down into the kitchen, the latter being accepted by the primary judge but challenged on appeal);  
      (e) The respondent, after making further angry demands that the police leave, “took a few steps forward with his arms still in the air, and he made contact with one of the police officers and at that moment he said he received a punch to the left side of his face” (Judgment, [22]);  
      (f) The respondent was thereupon arrested;  
      (g) The respondent was then punched by one of the plain clothes police officers; while the extent of that punching of the respondent is unclear (Judgment [23], [26]) there was evidence of some injury both physical and psychological.  
      
    18 As a result of the events at the premises, police commenced proceedings against the respondent in the Local Court for assault against a police officer and resisting arrest.

      First Instance Judgment 
      
    20 The primary judge formed the impression that both Mr Yavuz and Mr Guler had attempted to give their evidence in as reliable a fashion as possible. He found that both men had given answers that were “cryptic” to some degree, but that Mr Yavuz “was genuinely trying to assist the court in recounting the events as he saw them” and Mr Guler was “fundamentally accurate” in his evidence.  
     
      
    21 The primary judge preferred the respondent’s evidence that he had written his sister’s telephone number on a piece of paper in an endeavour to satisfy the police officers’ enquiry concerning Janette.  
     
      
    22 The primary judge made generally adverse findings as to the credibility of the police witnesses  
     
      
    23 It was clear to the primary judge that the police had “put their heads together” in the compilation of the statements they gave in the Local Court proceedings (those statements coming before the primary judge as exhibits during the District Court proceedings). The primary judge cited the remarks of Sheller JA in Day v Perisher Blue [2005] NSWCA 110 regarding what the primary judge referred to as the impropriety of such conduct.  
     
      
    24 The primary judge formed a poor impression of the credit of Detective Sergeant Lindley on a number of grounds:  
     
      
      (a) Lindley obfuscated during cross-examination in the District Court proceedings (Judgment [32]);  
      (b) Lindley provided inconsistent accounts in relation to whether the plaintiff had attempted to provide the address and phone number of Janette’s sister so that the police could contact Janette and make sure she was alright. His eventual evidence in cross-examination was that the plaintiff had been writing something down, whereas no mention of this was made in his or any other police statements, which had instead characterised the plaintiff as emerging from the bathroom and immediately commencing to yell and scream, lunging towards Moore and then Lindley (Judgment [33] – [34]);  
      (c) Lindley and Hughes “coloured” their evidence in their statements by omitting to mention, when describing there being a hammer on the floor of the premises upon their first arriving, that renovation works were taking place at the premises (Judgment [35]-[36]);  
      (d) The primary judge found that the omission by Lindley and the other officers to mention the respondent’s having written at least the phone number of his sister down, was necessarily to be considered in the context of their descriptions of:  
       
        
        (i) The respondent’s allegedly having emerged from the bathroom and immediately started to yell and scream; and  
        (ii) The respondent’s allegedly having threatened to stab one of the police officers with a pen.  
        
       
      
    25 The primary judge found that the accounts of the police officers as to the respondent’s having launched himself at them from atop the kitchen bench were absurd (Judgment [39]-[41]).  
     
      
    26 The primary judge made various findings of law. First he found that s357F(2) of the Crimes Act did not authorise the police officers to enter the premises because they were never invited by the respondent, the occupier, to come in. Rather the respondent had been in the shower at the time of entry. The primary judge concluded that Messrs Yavuz and Guler had no authority to invite the police onto the premises on behalf of the respondent, nor were they occupiers able to do so in their own right (Judgment [55]).  
     
      
    27 The primary judge likewise concluded that “the plaintiff by his words and actions expressly refused the officers permission to enter or remain on the premises”. This was subject to two matters:  
     
      
      (a) whether an invitation from the respondent subsequent to entry could be said to invoke the provisions of s357H of the Act after the entry had taken place so as to authorise the continued presence of the police; and  
      (b) whether such entry and continuance on the premises was authorised by the common law.  
      
    28 As to (a) above, the primary judge rejected s357H as a source of authority, on the basis that s357H applied on its terms only “[W]here a member of the police force enters a dwelling house in pursuance of an invitation (as referred to in s357F) …”. There not having been an invitation to enter, the primary judge concluded that s357H on its terms could not apply. The primary judge noted that the police did not purport to enter in pursuance of a warrant, the other basis which invokes s357H.  
     
      
    29 As to (b) above the primary judge concluded that no authority to enter was to be derived from the common law, citing Plenty v Dillon (1990-1991) 171 CLR 635 and in particular the joint judgment of Gaudron and McHugh JJ at 647. The passage which the primary judge quoted is as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “The policy of the law is to protect the possession of property and the privacy and security of its occupier …""  
         
         
        ""A person who enters the property of another must justify that entry by showing that he or she either entered with the consent of the occupier or otherwise had lawful authority to enter the premises ...""  
         
         
        ""Except in cases provided for by the common law and by statute, constables of police and those acting under the Crown have no special rights to enter land ... ""  
         
         
        ""Consent to an entry is implied if the person enters for a lawful purpose ... However, the licence may be withdrawn by giving notice of its withdrawal. A person who enters or remains on property after the withdrawal of the licence is a trespasser.”  
        
       
      
    30 The primary judge then referred to a number of exceptions cited in the joint judgment, concluding none applied to this case. His Honour concluded with these observations:  
     
      
       
        
        63. The Judges go on to state "" 
        but no public official, police constable or citizen, has any right at common law to enter a dwelling house merely - because he or she suspects that something is wrong 
        ."" In my opinion these principles apply in this case. 
         
         
        64. The constables in this case merely suspected that something was wrong. They entered the premises without first obtaining the Plaintiff occupier's permission. There is some faint evidence that one of the officers may have announced at the time of entry that they were police, and explained to Mr. Yavuz and Mr. Guler why they were there, but neither Mr. Yavuz nor Mr. Guler was in a position where they could give the officers permission to enter the premises.  
         
         
        65. Furthermore whilst it may be implied that the Plaintiff, albeit reluctantly, allowed the officers, they having entered the premises, to look around, certainly he withdrew any permission that may have been implied by that-for them to remain on the premises. He expressed his withdrawal of permission vehemently, and repeated it at least six or more times.  
         
         
        66. In my opinion the police officers acted in a highhanded manner. They were responding to a supposed ""violent domestic."" They ought to have borne in mind that the instigator of the call may have been acting maliciously. Prudence demanded that they approach the premises with some caution. By all accounts, when they did arrive, the situation, whatever it had been previously, was quiet. The door of the premises was open, and the living room was occupied by the mature gentlemen Mr. Yavuz and Mr. Guler. There was no sign of the domestic violence as they arrived. Prudence demanded that they make enquiry of the original complainant, if known, and approach the scene with some caution. I have no doubt that the Plaintiff, when confronted with the police in his living room, quickly-became agitated when they refused to leave. However, he was entitled to do so, especially after he had given the police a reasonable opportunity to inspect the premises. In evidence, the police maintained that they had not inspected the bathroom, but they made no effort to do so, either before or after they arrested the Plaintiff. In my opinion it was the attitude of the police, particularly Lindley, which led to an escalation of the situation were the Plaintiff was entitled to defend the integrity of his property, whereupon he became the victim of the assault by the officers concerned.”  
        
       
      
    31 In dealing with the allegation that the respondent had resisted the police officers in their entry on to his premises, the primary judge did not accept that the respondent shoulder-charged the police as alleged.  
     
      
    32 The trial judge concluded that the observations in the joint judgment in Plenty v Dillon at 655 applied equally here:  
     
      
       
        
        ""Although the First and Second Respondents were acting honestly 'in the supposed execution of their duty, their entry was attended by circumstances of aggravation. They entered as police officers with all the power of the State behind them, knowing that their entry was against the wish of the Appellant and in circumstances likely to cause him distress. It is not to the point that the Appellant was uncooperative or even unreasonable. The First and Second Respondents had no right to enter his land. The Appellant was entitled to resist their entry.”  
        
       
      
    33 The primary judge, having given verdicts for the respondent on the count of trespass to land, assault, false imprisonment and negligence, though in the latter case awarding no damages, then outlined his assessment of damages, summarised as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        (i) Trespass to property: $85,000.00 
        (ii) Trespass to person (assault): 
        
       
      
    · general damages $150,000.00· out-of-pocket expenses $8,265.00 
     
      
       
        
        (iii) False imprisonment: $20,000.00

      DISPOSITION  
      
    35 The appellant challenges the primary judge’s finding of trespass. This challenge extends to trespass on initial entry, to whether the police were invited to remain inside the premises once they had entered, and generally as to the finding of trespass to the respondent’s person and property. There is likewise a challenge to the finding of false imprisonment. There is no challenge pressed to the primary judge’s finding of negligence, as no damages were awarded for it.  
     
      
    36 The damages awarded were challenged on the ground that the amounts allowed in respect of trespass to the property and to the respondent’s person were said to be excessive. There is also a challenge to the award of aggravated damages and exemplary damages. In the alternative a new trial is sought.  
     
      
       
      Trespass to respondent’s property  
      
    37 I turn first to the question of the trespass to the respondent’s property.  
     
      
    38 There were clearly some contested matters but what occurred at the inception was not in issue. The first step in the sequence of events was the police alert signalled by “two beeps”. As Senior Constable Moore explained, the gradation of three levels of messages meant that the two beeps here was for “anything that’s serious, like … violent domestics”, as compared to “all other jobs, like verbal arguments, domestics, would just get broadcast without a beep” (Black, 338F).  
     
      
    39 Senior Constable Moore continued his evidence, again not in dispute, that, “This job came over with two beeps. It said, “Male and female fighting. Female heard screaming” and then it said – there were three messages, I can’t recall them all word for word, but the final message was, “The female had been screaming. Now it’s all quiet.” (Black, 338G).  
     
      
    40 I consider that there was significance in the fact that the squad cars called to intervene had clearly had cause for concern that the female in question, Janette Kuru, was at risk of physical violence. When it transpired that the female had been screaming but all had gone quiet, the police were clearly faced with the potential of a very serious act of violence which they were duty bound to investigate. They could not be certain that violence had occurred. But the police had every reason to investigate to find out the true position and to do so with urgency. I respectfully consider that the primary judge was applying hindsight, and was not being entirely fair, when observing:  
     
      
       
        
        “66. In my opinion the police officers acted in a highhanded manner. They were responding to a supposed ""violent domestic."" They ought to have borne in mind that the instigator of the call may have been acting maliciously. Prudence demanded that they approach the premises with some caution. By all accounts, when they did arrive, the situation, whatever it had been previously, was quiet. The door of the premises was open, and the living room was occupied by the mature gentlemen Mr. Yavuz and Mr. Guler. There was no sign of the domestic violence as they arrived. Prudence demanded that they make enquiry of the original complainant, if known, and approach the scene with some caution. … “ 
        
       
      
    41 That there was “no sign of the domestic violence” in no way dispels the legitimate cause for police concern from the earlier circumstances. For all the police knew, the woman concerned could have been lying battered and unconscious or at risk of further violence. The police had acted in the precautionary way the community would expect where violence was apprehended. “Prudence” and “caution” cut both ways. In my view prudence and caution called for the police to act urgently to see if someone was indeed seriously injured and possibly at risk of further injury following the female screams and what was described as “fighting” between a man and a woman. That there were those screams, and in a fight between the respondent and Janette, is not in dispute.  
     
      
    42 Nor in fact did the police burst in. They simply entered, later to encounter a clearly agitated occupier who behaved with some aggression. From his viewpoint he may well have been affronted by the police presence. But even if he knew he was in fact innocent of violence, he also knew he had been in a fight that elicited screams from his girlfriend so that the police presence should not have been an unexpected outcome. From the police viewpoint they were at risk of failing to intervene when someone lay injured. Mr Kuru’s verbal aggression towards them later that evening made it more not less credible that there had been a physical incident involving violence. It was not for the police to assume innocence without first investigating in a manner proportionate to the apprehended danger.  
     
      
    43 Reverting to the events of entry, the “violent domestic” call serves to explain why the police, at 1 am, rushed to the scene in three police cars travelling from different locations and comprised six police officers in all. They did not seek a warrant and one can again understand why that was so, given the circumstances.  
     
      
    44 They “ran straight up to the unit” (Black, 120X) found the door to the unit wide open, and after Constable Moore called out a couple of times and received no answer, he and several other police officers, probably four of them in total, entered the unit whilst the two female officers remained for the time being outside at the door. That so far was acting with appropriate caution and not high-handedly.  
     
      
    45 I pause here to deal with the respondent’s account. The respondent and Janette Kuru gave evidence that they resided at the premises. Janette was then his girlfriend or fiancée and is now his wife. On 15 June 2001, they had attended the respondent’s sister’s house-warming party, about four or five minutes’ walk from their house and attended by some six or seven families. The respondent and Janette left the party at about midnight. After arriving home it is common ground that an argument developed between them (concerning the perceived selfishness of each of them). The respondent had wanted to stay at the party while Janette had wanted to go home because she was tired. By the time the police arrived, the respondent and Janette had settled down. Janette had telephoned the respondent’s sister at the party. As a result the respondent’s father-figure (so described) Mr Yavuz and the respondent’s friend Mr Guler and, it appears, the respondent’s sister attended the flat. Janette however went back to the party (presumably with the respondent’s sister) while Mr Yavuz and Mr Guler went upstairs to see the respondent. After a short discussion, the respondent had a shower.  
     
      
    46 It was whilst the respondent was in the shower and Mr Guler and Mr Yavuz were in the lounge-room of the unit that the six police walked into the unit. This was through the open door, as Detective Sergeant Lindley explained and was not disputed (Black, 154E). Detective Sergeant Lindley readily conceded that when he walked in he was not invited (Black, 154G). But nor was he asked to leave.  
     
      
    47 He then describes how the two gentlemen (Messrs Guler and Yavuz) came out to speak to the now six officers in the premises. Detective Sergeant Lindley stated that from memory he was told “they were not the lawful occupants of the premises”.  
     
      
    48 It is then Detective Sergeant Lindley’s evidence that they proceeded to search the bedrooms, identified by a rough sketch, having earlier walked into the lounge-room. They did not see a lady there or any blood or any things knocked over. He answered in the affirmative when asked, “Would it also be fair to say you were probably not going to leave until you got some answers?” (Black, 154P-155K).  
     
      
    49 Then, according to Detective Sergeant Lindley’s evidence, not disputed, they were told by Messrs Yavuz and Guler that, “there was another person in the bathroom”, being the respondent (Black, 155O).  
     
      
    50 When Detective Sergeant Lindley was pressed about whether he would enter premises unannounced without a warrant, his response was “when I have been informed there is a violent domestic taking place and the front door is wide open, yes” (Black, 156R).  
     
      
    51 A fair summation of the evidence of what followed thereafter was that the respondent emerged from the bathroom, queried the presence of the police officers as to why they were there, was informed as to the reason for their presence, and, again undisputed, agreed to the police having a look around the flat, which they did by looking into each of the two bedrooms of the flat but not, I infer, the bathroom, for reasons I explain below.  
     
      
    52 As Mr Temby, QC for the appellant acknowledged, there is some doubt as to the exact order of events. That is to say, there may have been an inspection only before, or both before and after the respondent emerged from the bathroom. But whatever the case, I would infer that the search was only of the bedrooms and not the bathroom, there being no evidence or submission to the contrary from either side. The reason the police did not inspect the bathroom before the respondent emerged is that he was showering there. The reason the police did not inspect the bathroom after the respondent emerged I deal with below.  
     
      
    53 What is clear, from the respondent’s own evidence, is that he did give consent to an inspection of the flat to see whether there was a female on the premises, in the following passage of evidence.  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I know it’s difficult, do you remember – was there one particular male speaking mostly, or--  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. --did they all speak?  
         
        A. It was – as far as I remember, I think it was Lindley. It was the officer with no uniform.  
         
         
        Q. No uniform on, and after he said, “We’re investigating a domestic violence dispute” or something of that nature, what did you say?  
         
        A. I said, “Well, there’s no female here.”  
         
         
        Q. What did he say after that?  
         
        A. He said, “Can we take a look around?”  
         
         
        Q. What did you say?  
         
        A. I said, “Sure”  
        
       
      
    54 The respondent then explained that what then happened was that two of the male officers went through both the bedrooms, came back to the kitchen and asked the respondent where Janette was, to which he said he replied “She’s at my sister’s house around the corner” and then asked “can you now go” (Black, 16N-R).  
     
      
    55 The respondent then stated that the police wanted the address of his sister’s house. This he did not know fully (he did not know the door number as they had only moved in some two weeks before) leaving him to attempt to explain where the house was (Black, 16V-17J).  
     
      
    56 His evidence then indicated a rising level of verbal aggression on his part, as in the following passage, culminating in the respondent writing down the phone number and the address in “Rhodes Street” but without the street number:  
     
      
       
        
        “A. Okay. They said, after I was trying to explain when I was – they asked me for the phone number and the address, I then said, “When the fuck are youse going to get out of my house? What’s it—“  
         
         
        Q. No. 
         
         
        STERNBERG: Don’t cut him off.  
         
         
        SNEDDON: Q. Sorry, no. Finish what you were saying.  
         
        A. And this was as I was going to the bedroom to get a pen and paper to write down the phone number and the address. Then I came back to the kitchen, and I put the piece of paper down on the bench, and I started writing. I wrote the phone number. I wrote “Rhodes Street”, and then I slammed it down. I slammed the piece of paper down on the bench and said, “Right, can youse go now? I want everyone to get the fuck out of my house.”  
         
        …… 
         
         
        A. Okay. They said to Yasar. “Where’s Jeanette? Where’s his sister’s house?” It was at this stage, I jumped onto the kitchen bench, and I yelled. I said, “I want everyone to leave my house. I want everyone to get the fuck out.” Then I jumped back off the bench, onto the kitchen side, and I walked-- (Black, 17N18C) 
        
       
      
    57 Then followed the respondent’s evidence as to how he claims he was assaulted:  
     
      
       
        
        “A. Then I said, “Right. I’ve had enough,” and I walked straight up to my main entrance of my home, straight up to the main door, and I slammed the door open, then I walked back into the kitchen, and I raised my arms to the side of me, and I said, “Right, that’s it.” I said, “I want everybody out.” Then I took a few steps forward, with my arms still in the air,  
        and I made contact with my left arm to one of the police officers, and then I was punched 
        .  
         
         
        Q. Where were you punched?  
         
        A. On the left side of my face.  
         
         
        Q. When you said you “made contact” to one of the police officers, would you please just show his Honour where your arms were.  
         
        A. I said, “Right. I want everybody out,” and I stood there for a second or two, and then I stepped forward. I started walking forward, because between my main entry door to the lounge room and the kitchen was all the officers. When I went back to the kitchen, I lifted my hands. I said, “Right. Out,” and I just proceeded to walk forward.  
         
         
        Q. Where were the officers? How far away, firstly, from where you were standing to the front door of your house? About how many metres, do you think? Even somewhere on the bar table – can you-- 
         
        A. Yes, say you were standing at my front door, this could be the kitchen bench.  
         
         
        Q. Where were the officers, male and female?  
         
        A. The two female officers were standing closer to the door, and there was two male officers to the left side of the hall, and two male officers to the right-hand side.  
         
         
        Q. So six in total?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. When you walked towards them with your arms out,  
        how hard did you touch one of the officers 
        ?  
         
        A.  
        It would have been at walking pace, because when I did make contact, my hands didn’t go forward. They just stayed adjacent to my side 
        .  
         
         
        Q. You say you were struck by one of the officers. Were you struck before, immediately upon contact or after?  
         
        A. Just on contact. I heard, “Right. That’s it. You’re under arrest,” and I was hit at the same time as hearing those words.  
         
         
        Q. Do you know which officer hit you?  
         
        A. I think it was Lindley.  
         
         
        Q. Was it one of the – one with uniform police-- 
         
        A. Not in uniform.  
         
         
        Q. Not in uniform. When you were hit, what happened then?  
         
        A. I fell back and I hit our fridge, then fell onto the kitchen floor. Again, it was the non-uniformed officer and another officer that were on top of me on the kitchen floor, and I was being punched.” (Black, 18O-19P) [emphasis added]  
        
       
      
    58 The police account is that the respondent shoulder-charged them; I shall return to that shortly. But it is certainly common ground that the respondent made body contact with one of the officers, whether it was mere angry contact or a more violent collision. It follows that the respondent’s aggression escalated from the verbal to the physical, though the degree of the latter is disputed.  
     
      
    59 According to the respondent’s time estimate of these events, from the time he first said “get out of my house” to the point of time where he walked towards the police to usher them out was “perhaps” some five to eight minutes (Black, 19S). It appears undisputed that he asked the police to leave the flat on at least six occasions.  
     
      
    60 As to the events that followed immediately thereafter, the respondent was lying on the ground with his legs pulled up, held down by the police on his stomach, whereupon the respondent bit one of the officers, whose hands were across the respondent’s face, on the finger and was then sprayed with capsicum spray (Black, 20W-21D). He was still wearing his boxer shorts at that time from when he had emerged from the bathroom. Subsequent to this event he was picked up off the kitchen floor, handcuffed, told he was under arrest, and was walked out the front door with his hands handcuffed. He said that he was punched in the face some 20 to 25 times as well as being hit a few times on the back of his head, then led down the stairs, in pain from the capsicum spray (Black, 23-25P). At one point while going down the stairs he fell and hit his head on the glass wall, still yelling and screaming at the police and very angry (Black, 25R-26G). He fell twice, not claiming that he was pushed but rather that he let go, his hands still handcuffed behind his back and still with his eyes partly shut from the capsicum spray (Black, 26-27). He was then put into the police paddy-wagon.  
     
      
    61 He was put into a police cell still wearing his boxer shorts (Black, 27M-T), spending the night there before being released at about 7 am (Black, 28F-M).  
     
      
    62 The foregoing evidence is taken from the respondent’s account. There is some dispute about several items of evidence. First, there was a dispute as to whether he had ever handed over the piece of writing, though I do not consider anything hangs on that.  
     
      
    63 Second, there is a dispute as to whether he had jumped off the bench on the kitchen side, or instead over the splash-back into the lounge, the latter with a pen in his hand in what the police contended was a clearly aggressive act. While it is disputed as to whether he immediately or at all shoulder-charged Detective Sergeant Lindley, it is not disputed that he did come into contact with him.  
     
      
    64 The primary judge had this to say about the jump from the bench:  
     
      
       
        
        “40. Exhibit C shows the kitchen bench in question. It will be observed (photographs 4 and 5 on page 3) that the bench itself is relatively narrow, but has a splashboard of about 12 to 15 inches in height, facing towards the lounge/ dining room. The photographs show furniture in the lounge/ during room. It was suggested by police that after the Plaintiff jumped on to the bench, which he admitted doing, he then launched himself at them in some manner, they standing in the lounge/ dining room. In my opinion it would be a physical impossibility to do so. Drummond and Patterson in their statements say that when he jumped on to the bench he hit his head onto the ceiling. If he was to launch himself over the 12 to 15 inch splashboard without hitting his head again on the ceiling he would have to perform a swallow dive of Olympic proportions. I don't think he did this.”  
        
       
      
    65 The appellant claims, in my respectful view with some justification, that the primary judge was unduly dogmatic in his finding that the respondent could not have jumped into the lounge/dining room by reason of the 12 to 15 inch splashboard. It is fair to say that, as Mr Temby QC put in argument, a man in his twenties who is clearly in fine physical shape and who had the physical capacity to jump onto the bench, necessarily had the physical capacity to jump from it into the lounge area, crouching if necessary and jumping over the splashback.  
     
      
    66 Significantly, Mr Guler when cross-examined supported the police account of the respondent jumping onto the kitchen bench and jumping in the direction of where the police were standing. That led to what I consider a fair complaint that the primary judge simply ignored Mr Guler’s evidence on that matter (see Black, 103B “He jumped in the direction of where the police were standing, didn’t he? A. Yes he did”). That supports the police account of an aggressive movement towards them if not the shoulder-charge.  
     
      
    67 I should add that Mr Guler affirmed that the respondent had asked the police to leave several times and he recalls the respondent saying “You got the phone number, and that is it. I want youse to go out” (Black, 92N).  
     
      
    68 Of some significance is the question whether the police, having been invited to inspect the house, stayed longer than they need have done to complete their inspection, in circumstances where it appears the police never did look into the bathroom. Detective Constable Lindley’s account is that “I wanted to have a look in the bathroom to make sure that woman wasn’t in there bleeding or bruised, or dead, for all I know” (Black, 122D).  
     
      
    69 The explanation for not checking the bathroom, which Mr Temby QC pressed, I would accept. It is a matter of inference from uncontested evidence. The primary judge did not make any contrary inference. Essentially it was that after the bedrooms were inspected there was an eruption of violence starting with the respondent becoming agitated and leaping on the bench followed by his arrest and then his being taken downstairs. Downstairs the police were told by Mr Yavuz or Mr Guler that the police could be taken to the place where the woman was. The police evidently accepted that offer, went to that place, met Janette Kuru and ascertained that she was alright, she being then back at her sister-in-law’s place four minute’s away from the respondent’s flat. We do not know whether the police used the phone number from Mr Kuru and first ascertained she was there, though that is not unlikely.  
     
      
    70 This account is borne out by Janette Kuru’s evidence that she was in fact visited by two police officers at around 1 o’clock (Black, 109V). I accept that this explains why the police did not feel the need to persevere with a search of the flat. They had no need to once they had spoken to Janette Kuru, who, if she was where Mr Kuru said she was, was known to be nearby.  
     
      
    71 The primary judge formed an adverse view of the credit of the police, probably all of them, but certainly Detective Sergeant Lindley and Detective Senior Constable Hughes. The basis for that adverse view was based on several matters:  
     
      
      (a) the supposed physical impossibility of the respondent jumping from the kitchen bench into the lounge-room area, a basis which Mr Guler’s evidence and common sense indicates that, with respect, the primary judge should not have given any weight;  
      (b) the fact that the statements prepared by the police in August 2001, some two months after the events, made mention of there being a hammer lying on the lounge-room floor but made no mention of the presence of building materials as a perfectly valid explanation for the presence of a hammer (Red, 29U). As against that it was never suggested to Detective Sergeant Lindley nor put to any police officer that he had referred to the hammer in order to colour his evidence in any way, beyond the assertion in cross-examination that the reference to the hammer was “a means to bolstering the police case” (Black, 226W);  
      (c) failure by the police officers to “have borne in mind that the instigator of the call [which caused them to attend] may have been acting maliciously” (Judgment [66]). Again, that proposition was never put to any of the police officers and is to my mind outweighed by the real threat of domestic violence from the reported screaming of the woman, and what might well have been a sinister silence thereafter; and  
      (d) the similarities between the police officers’ statements, leading to what the primary judge concluded was a “putting of heads together” (Judgment [28]), in circumstances where the trial judge sought to characterise the police evidence as a “single unified version of a police officer’s” evidence as against that of the respondent (Judgment [49]).  
      
    72 As to the last matter, Mr Temby QC demonstrated a degree of divergence between the various written statements by the police, though an examination of the statements also showed some degree of verbal similarity. I refer by way of example to use of the expression “lunged” when referring to the respondent jumping from the kitchen bench.  
     
      
    73 Detective Sergeant Lindley did concede that he had read Constable Moore’s statement in preparing his own.  
     
      
    74 However, Detective Sergeant Lindley emphasised that while he had use Constable Moore’s statement as an aid he had not cut and pasted verbatim, asserting that there was no legal bar to using someone else’s statement to create his own (Black, 143R).  
     
      
    75 The appellant relied upon the principle that a witness may refresh memory from not only his or her own note but from notes made by another which the witness has read and found to accord with his or her recollection. See “Cross on Evidence”, 5th edition by J D Heydon at [17200] and the authorities there cited including R v Bass [1953] 1 QB 681 to the effect that “there is no objection to police officers refreshing their memory from … statements prepared by them in collaboration”.  
     
      
    76 To this the respondent contends that these statements go no further than saying that the practice is not unlawful and that this matter goes to admissibility rather than weight, so as to leave unqualified Sheller JA’s observations in Day v Perisher Blue Pty Limited (2005) 62 NSWLR 731 at 746 [30], quoted below:  
     
      
       
        
        “[30] It has long been regarded as proper practice for legal practitioners to take proofs of evidence from lay witnesses separately and to encourage such witnesses not to discuss their evidence with others and particularly not with other potential witnesses. For various reasons, witnesses do not always abide by those instructions and their credibility suffers accordingly. In the present case, it is hard to see that the intention of the teleconference with witnesses discussing amongst themselves the evidence that they would give was for any reason other than to ensure, so far as possible, that in giving evidence the defendant's witnesses would all speak with one voice about the events that occurred. Thus, the evidence of one about a particular matter which was in fact true might be overborne by what that witness heard several others say which, as it happened, was not true. This seriously undermines the process by which evidence is taken. What was done was improper. The process adopted was more concerned with ensuring that all the witnesses gave evidence which would best serve their employer's case. …”  
        
       
      
    77 I would accept the primary judge was entitled to draw the conclusion that Detective Sergeant Lindley’s evidence and that of the other officers did suffer accordingly. But I do not consider that the evidence had to be rejected on that account, given the differences that existed and the fact that full opportunity was taken to test that evidence in cross-examination.  
     
      
    78 I have dealt with the facts in some detail as they substantiate the following propositions:  
     
      
      (a) when the police entered the flat they had a reasonable apprehension that a woman may have been injured in domestic violence;  
      (b) though the door to the flat was open, it could not be said that the members of the police force who entered were invited to do so by “a person who apparently resides in the dwelling house” within the meaning of s357F(2) of the Act, by reason only that:  
       
        
        (i) the door was open; or  
        (ii) Messrs Yavuz and Guler who were present did not object, but did not profess to be residing in the dwelling house, rather making it clear rather that the occupier was the respondent;  
        
       
      (c) when the respondent emerged from the bathroom, he invited the police officers to remain in the dwelling house for the purpose of inspecting it to see whether there was a woman in the dwelling house who had suffered domestic violence;  
      (d) the respondent sought to withdraw that invitation after the police had inspected the two bedrooms, and earlier the lounge and kitchen but had not (I infer) inspected the bathroom; and  
      (e) their investigation was therefore incomplete at that point but it was reasonably open to the police to continue that investigation on or off the premises.  
      
    79 There are two questions which arise in that factual setting. The first is whether, either by statute or common law, the police were entitled to remain any longer on the premises once they had inspected the bedrooms (and earlier the kitchen and living room) but had yet to inspect the bathroom. This was when:  
     
      
      (a) they were not satisfied as to their inquiries of the whereabouts of the woman in circumstances;  
      (b) there was a reasonable apprehension that she may have suffered domestic violence, though in the events that happened it was later learned that she had not; and  
      (c) the duration of their further stay after being first told to “get out of my house” was some five to eight minutes, not a very long time.  
      
    80 It was not established finally whether the respondent shoulder-charged the police or simply jumped off the bench on the lounge side and walked aggressively towards them, culminating in less violent body contact. It is undisputed that the respondent raised his arms in the air as he did so, so there was some appearance of aggression if not threat. I accept the explanation that the reason the police did not thereafter inspect the bathroom was twofold. First, the police were then engaged with the repercussions of that collision or body contact. Second, they had by then been given sufficient information as to the whereabouts of the woman either from the piece of paper that was signed or else were told where to go when downstairs. Either way, the police were soon able to ascertain that Janette Kuru was not injured or the subject of domestic violence. This was shortly after, at around 1 am, when they found her at the respondent’s sister’s house. I turn now to the application of the law, statute and general, to these facts.  
     
      
    81 As Ipp JA points out in his judgment, which I have had the advantage of reading, it has long been established at common law that any unjustified entry on land or premises in the possession of another constitutes a trespass: Entick v Carrington (1765) 95 ER 807 at 817 per Lord Camden CJ; Morris v Beardmore [1981] AC 446 at 464 per Lord Scarman; Halliday v Nevill (1984) 155 CLR 1 at 10 per Brennan J; Plenty v Dillon (1991) 171 CLR 635 at 647 per Gaudron and McHugh JJ. The question here is whether that entry was unjustified, to which I shall return after dealing first with statute.  
     
      
    82 The primary judge declined to construe s357H of the Act as providing a statutory basis for entry in the present circumstances. This was because that provision refers only to the case of a member of the police force who “enters” a dwelling house “in pursuance of an invitation”. That interpretation, while according with the literal words, produces an incongruous result. That result would mean that the statutory license to enter with its associated statutory constraints would only apply to invitations made at the point of entry and not to invitations subsequently made to remain. This carries the consequence that those constraints upon what can be done when on the premises in s357H(1)(a) to (b) would only be applicable when invited to enter, and not when merely invited to remain. Those constraints on the police require that no more be done than “is reasonably necessary”. They limit what can be done as to:  
     
      
      (a) investigation of whether an offence has been committed;  
      (b) rendering any aid to a person who appears to be injured;  
      (c) exercising the lawful power to arrest a person; and  
      (d) preventing the commission or further commission of such an offence.  
      There seems no sensible reason for such an arbitrary distinction.  
      
    83 Here indubitably the police were investigating whether an offence had been committed. They were concerned also to ensure that no further offence was committed should the domestic violence be still in train. It could be expected that they would wish to render aid were an injured woman found on the premises.  
     
      
    84 It is clear that by contrast to s357H, s357F does distinguish in its terms between an invitation to enter a dwelling house and an invitation to remain in the dwelling house. Section 357H(1) uses language that refers only to “enters a dwelling house in pursuance of an invitation”. It is arguable that an invitation at the first opportunity after uncontested entry implies permission not only to remain but to have entered in the first place. Such an interpretation furthers the evident purpose of s357H, namely to impose those statutory constraints and thereby qualify the license to enter. It avoids the anomalous distinction, to which I have earlier referred, between those who enter by invitation and those who merely remain by invitation. Thus I would, though with some hesitation, construe the later invitation to investigate as necessarily implying in the circumstances retroactive permission to have entered where, as here, there is:  
     
      
      (a) no suggestion of violent or opposed entry; nor  
      (b) any appreciable gap in time between the original unopposed entry and the subsequent invitation by the occupier permitting the police to be on the premises, once he was aware of them.  
      
    85 However, the inquiry does not end there, as there is the common law as an alternative basis of authority. Section 357H(2) expressly provides that “nothing in subs (1) or in s357F or 357G limits any other power which a member of the police force may have under this ... Act or at common law to enter or remain in or on premises”.  
     
      
    86 I do not consider that Plenty v Dillon stands in the way of an interpretation of the common law that would permit a member of the police to enter upon premises in circumstances like these, though without an invitation to do so, and certainly when there has been as here an invitation to search the premises. Gaudron and McHugh JJ referred to the common law as having a number of exceptions (at 647). The general rule is explained. It is that a person is a trespasser unless that person “enters” premises with the consent, express or implied, of the occupier.  
     
      
    87 I would conclude that the occupier here did give implied consent to enter by inviting the police at the first opportunity to inspect the property to see if there was an injured woman on the premises. That invitation would have necessarily included what was entailed in completing an inspection of the premises in fulfilment of that investigative purpose. Here sudden violence erupted while the police were still engaged upon that investigation, interrupting it when the respondent aggressively came into body contact with one of the police.  
     
      
    88 One of the stated exceptions in Plenty v Dillon is that “a constable … can also enter premises to prevent the commission of a felony”. I agree generally with what is said by Ipp JA in his judgment under the heading “The right of the police, at common law, to enter the apartment”. I elaborate my own reasons below.  
     
      
    89 Here, the police did not need to break into the premises, their entry being uncontested. The door was wide open and the two men present conveyed no objection on behalf of the occupier to either their entry or their remaining there. The actual occupier Mr Kuru permitted them to be on the premises as soon as he first saw them, soon after their entry. The police were there to investigate whether, based on the strong indications they had received, there had been violence, to deal with its consequences and to prevent any further violence. In those circumstances I would conclude that the common law permitted entry without a warrant for these purposes.  
     
      
    90 The subsequent invitation from Mr Kuru permitted the police to carry out their investigative purpose to completion, including attending to any matters pursuant thereto. I am satisfied this remained so, notwithstanding withdrawal of that invitation when that process of investigation was not yet complete. This could however be only for such reasonable period as was needed to complete police investigation in fulfilment of that purpose, in accordance with the occupier’s earlier permission. I am satisfied those conditions were fulfilled. The police were entitled to complete their task either by further inspection on the premises or (as occurred) by making contact with Janette Kuru outside the premises. At common law the police were thus authorised to stay to complete their task and there was no trespass. When Mr Kuru’s aggressive behaviour interrupted them in carrying out that purpose and he withdrew his consent, they were still entitled to take all reasonable steps to complete the investigative task they had been earlier invited to carry out.  
     
      
    91 Moreover, even if the stated exception presupposed more than mere suspicion before a constable could enter premises to prevent the commission of a felony, here there was more than mere suspicion. One could distinguish Plenty v Dillon on the basis that the entry was not to serve a process but I prefer to treat it as an authoritative statement of principle, consistent with the view of the common law I would adopt. I should however emphasise that, had the police remained for reasons unrelated to that purpose, I agree with Ipp JA that they would not have been entitled lawfully to remain on the premises. I do not consider that any such finding would be warranted here. The most that could be said was that Mr Kuru interrupted the police in their permitted investigative task.  
     
      
    92 I do not consider that the common law entitles an occupier to withdraw an invitation when the invitation was originally to do that which the police were still in the course of doing, namely to investigate whether there was a victim of a violent domestic assault on the premises or nearby. It must not be forgotten that Lord Denning MR in Southam v Smout (1964) 1 QB 308 at 320 concluded his peroration against even the King of England entering a poor man’s cottage with this important qualification: “unless he has justification by law”. Here the police did have that justification, at common law at least. I would here apply, as does Ipp JA in his judgment, what is cited from McGowan v Chief Constable of Kingston upon Hull [1968] Crim LR 34 (also reported at (1967) 117 NLJ 1138), Kay v Hibbert [1977] Crim LR 226 at 227 (also reported at (1977) 141 JPJo 157) and Ledger v Director of Public Prosecutions [1991] Crim LR 439 at 440 applying Kay v Hibbert.  
     
      
    93 Regrettably, domestic violence has become an every day event in our society. The police, acting reasonably and proportionately, should not be prevented at common law from entering premises in an emergency, where every minute may count, there being justified fear of domestic violence and its consequences. This is not altered by the possibility that the violence reasonably feared may not have in fact occurred, so long as the apprehension of it by the police was reasonable in the circumstances. So it was here.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion  
      
    94 I conclude that the police were entitled at common law, if not by a purposive reading of s357H of the Act, to remain on the premises after the invitation had been withdrawn. This was in order to complete that which the invitation permitted, namely to ascertain whether there was an injured person on the premises, the victim of domestic violence, or otherwise to ascertain the whereabouts of the person concerned.  
     
      
       
      DAMAGES  
      
    95 Given my conclusion that the police were not trespassers on the premises, and given that the reaction of the police to the respondent’s aggressive and ultimately violent behaviour was not pursuant to any trespass, the only question that remains is whether the police did exceed what was appropriate in the circumstances to restrain the respondent. I am not satisfied that there was such conduct as would amount to a trespass on the person when the police acted as they did to restrain the respondent and take him to the cells overnight.  
     
      
    96 It is therefore not necessary for me to consider whether the damages in question were excessive since I conclude that no damages lay in the circumstances. In saying this, I would not wish to be understood as endorsing the very large quantum of damages awarded, were my conclusion otherwise as to liability.  
     
      
       
      OVERALL CONCLUSION  
      
    97 I consider that the appeal should be allowed.  
     
      
    98 Ordinarily costs should follow the event. Here, though, there was a genuine issue based upon the proper interpretation of both the applicable provisions of the Crimes Act and the common law which was novel and in the public interest to resolve. Nor did the Crown assist matters by the way its case was pleaded, as Mason P points out. The Crown have had the benefit of a judgment which has clarified police powers for the future. I thus agree that the State should pay its own costs of the appeal, and agree in the orders proposed by Ipp JA.  
     
      
    99 IPP JA:  
     
      
      The principal issues in the appeal 
      
    100 There are two principal issues raised by this appeal. The first concerns the right of police to enter private property when they believe on reasonable grounds that a domestic violence offence has been committed on the property. The second concerns the right of police to remain on private property, despite being ordered to leave by the occupier, so that they can investigate whether a domestic violence offence has been committed.  
     
      
    101 These issues arose in proceedings before Murray ADCJ. The action before his Honour was brought by the respondent (Mr Kuru) against the State of New South Wales (the appellant) for damages for trespass to property, trespass to person, false imprisonment and negligence.  
     
      
    102 Mr Kuru’s action concerned an incident that occurred after midnight one evening when six police officers entered his apartment. Earlier, Mr Kuru had had an argument with his then fiancée (now his wife – Mrs Janette Kuru). This led to some unknown person calling the police. By the time the police entered the apartment, Mr Kuru’s fiancée had left and Mr Kuru was having a shower. When he came out of the shower, he discovered the police presence. He thereupon agreed to the police looking around the apartment. Thereafter, however, he withdrew his permission. The police did not leave and a fracas ensued. The police arrested Mr Kuru and took him to the Maroubra police station where he was detained until after 7.00 AM. 
     
      
    103 Later, Mr Kuru was charged with counts of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty, assault upon a police officer in the execution of his duty and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. These charges were heard in the local court and dismissed. 
     
      
    104 Murray ADCJ held that the police were trespassers in Mr Kuru’s apartment and had no lawful justification for being there. He held that they had wrongfully arrested him, assaulted him, and falsely imprisoned him. He made no findings in respect of the negligence claim. 
     
      
    105 The judge awarded Mr Kuru damages of $85,000.00 for trespass to property; agreed out of pocket expenses of $8,265.00; general damages for trespass to person of $150,000.00; $20,000.00 for false imprisonment; $25,000.00 for aggravated damages (which his Honour said were called for by reason of “the circumstances of the incident”); and $120,000.00 as exemplary damages. These awards totalled $418,265.00 and his Honour ordered judgment for Mr Kuru in that amount.  
     
      
    106 The State appeals against his Honour’s decision on grounds of both law and fact. 
     
      
    107 During the course of argument, Mason P put to Mr Einfeld QC (who together with Mr Sneddon appeared for Mr Kuru) the following propositions, to which Mr Einfeld, properly and correctly, acceded. First, were the appeal to fail in regard to the claim for trespass to property, the appeal on the assault cause of action would also, inevitably, fail. This consequence follows because the police would then not have been entitled to be in the apartment, Mr Kuru would have been entitled to use reasonable force to evict them, and the police would not have been entitled to arrest him and to use force in trying to do so. Secondly, were the appeal in regard to the trespass claim to succeed, the appeal against the findings in respect of the assault, also, would have to succeed. That is because, in the scenario postulated, the police would have been lawfully on the property, Mr Kuru would not have been entitled to evict them forcibly as - even on his own version - he attempted to do, the police would have been entitled to arrest him and use reasonable force in doing so, and Mr Kuru’s case at trial was not run (in Mr Einfeld’s words) as a “discrete excessive zeal case”. 
     
      
       
      The determination of the facts relevant to the appeal  
       
      
    108 There are material factual disputes between Mr Kuru and his witnesses, on the one hand, and the police, on the other.  
     
      
    109 The witnesses of Mr Kuru, to whom I refer, are two friends of his, Mr Mustafa Yavuz and Mr Yasser Guler. They were both in Mr Kuru’s apartment when the police arrived. Murray ADCJ accepted that both Mr Yavuz and Mr Guler attempted to give their evidence in as reliable a fashion as possible. Mr Yavuz gave evidence through an interpreter and the judge described his answers as “cryptic and, in many cases, lacking in detail”. Mr Guler gave evidence without the assistance of an interpreter and, according to his Honour, his mode of expression was even more cryptic but “fundamentally accurate”. 
     
      
    110 There was evidence that some of the police witnesses had seen statements made by other police witnesses before preparing their own. Murray ADCJ observed that there was a “remarkable similarity” in the police statements compiled for the police brief in the local court. His Honour described the cumulative effect of the six police witnesses as being, in these circumstances, “a single unified version”. He remarked, “[i]t is clear to me that the police ‘put their heads together’ in the compilation of their statements for the local court proceedings”. His Honour referred to Day v Perisher Blue (2005) 62 NSWLR 731 and said that the methods by which the police statements were given “greatly impugned” the credibility of their evidence. His Honour’s approach to the police evidence has been challenged by the State and the State also challenges other factual findings made by his Honour.  
     
      
    111 In the light of the judge’s factual findings (including those concerning the credibility of the State witnesses), and the challenges to some of them, I shall proceed to set out the relevant facts by drawing largely on the evidence of Mr Kuru himself, that of Mr Guler and Mr Yavuz, and police evidence that is not challenged. I shall draw attention, expressly, to any evidence to which I refer which does not fall into any of the categories I have mentioned. 
     
      
       
      The events leading to Mr Kuru’s arrest  
       
      
    112 The relevant events occurred after Mr Kuru and his fiancée had attended a house warming party at his sister’s home. Mr Kuru and his fiancée left the party at about midnight. He had had about six beers during the course of the evening. After they had returned to Mr Kuru’s apartment, an argument developed between them. The judge found that “there was much yelling and screaming”. This led to some unknown person telephoning the police.  
     
      
    113 As a result, the police radio transmitted a “violent domestic alert” to police patrol cars. Two “beeps” on the police radio denoted a “violent domestic”, as opposed to one beep, which denoted a “normal domestic”. Police protocol required that, when a violent domestic alert was broadcast, all units in the vicinity were to respond “under lights and sirens and get to the location as quickly and safely as possible”. According to the evidence of Senior Constable Moore: 
     
      
       
        
         “Two beeps is anything that’s serious, like armed robberies, violent domestics … This job came over with two beeps. It said, ‘Male and female fighting. Female heard screaming’. And then it said – there was three messages, I can’t recall them all word for word, but the final message was ‘the female had been screaming. Now it’s all gone quiet’.” 
        
       
      
    114 Three police vehicles responded to the violent domestic alert. Two police officers were in each vehicle. This meant that six police officers arrived at Mr Kuru’s apartment. His apartment was on the second level of a block of units. The apartment consisted of a lounge room, two bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen.  
     
      
    115 Before the police arrived, Mr Kuru’s fiancée had telephoned Mr Kuru’s sister. This telephone call led to Messrs Yavuz and Guler arriving at the apartment, together with Mr Kuru’s sister. Mr Kuru’s fiancée then returned to the party with his sister. Mr Kuru went into the bathroom to have a shower. It was at this stage that the police arrived.  
     
      
    116 The judge found that when the police arrived the front door of the apartment had been left open. According to the evidence of Senior Constable Moore, as he approached the open door he “yelled out” and walked through the door. This evidence was not challenged. 
     
      
    117 When the police came in through the open door, Mr Kuru was still in the shower. According to Mr Guler, an officer asked him whether he lived in the apartment. Mr Guler replied in the negative. The officer explained that they had received a phone call about arguments in the apartment and that was why they were there.  
     
      
    118 According to Mr Yavuz, when the police came in, an officer asked him who had been fighting. Mr Yavuz went to the shower and asked Mr Kuru to come out.  
     
      
    119 Mr Kuru said that when he walked out of the bathroom door he saw four male police officers and two female police officers in his living room. He asked them what they were doing there. Detective Senior Constable Lindley replied that they were investigating a domestic violence complaint that had been made by one of Mr Kuru’s neighbours. Mr. Kuru said, “[w]ell there’s no female here”.  
     
      
    120 What occurred next, according to Mr Kuru, appears from the following exchange in the course of Mr Kuru’s evidence in chief: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What did he say after that? 
         
         A. He said ,’can we take a look around?’ 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you say? 
         
        A. I said, ‘sure’.” 
        
       
      
    121 According to Mr Kuru, two officers inspected both bedrooms and had a look around the apartment. Mr Kuru testified that it took the police about a minute to a minute-and-a-half to look through the various rooms. An officer then asked, “[w]here is the female that was here? Where is she now?” Mr Kuru replied that she was at his sister’s house “around the corner” and then asked the police to leave.  
     
      
    122 According to Mr Kuru, after he requested the police to leave, they asked him for the address and phone number of his sister’s house where, according to him, the woman with whom he had been fighting had gone. He told them the name of the street where his sister lived, but could not remember the street number of the house. He tried to explain where the house was. In the course of this conversation he said: “[w]hen the fuck are youse going to get out of my house?” 
     
      
    123 Mr Kuru went to his bedroom to get a pen and paper to write down the phone number and the address. He came back to the kitchen and wrote his sister’s phone number on the piece of paper, as well as the name of the street where she lived. He slammed the piece of paper down on the bench and said, “[r]ight, can youse go now? I want everyone to get the fuck out of my house”.  
     
      
    124 The police then asked Mr Guler, “[w]here’s Janette? Where’s his sister’s house?” At this point, Mr Kuru jumped onto the kitchen bench and yelled. He shouted, “I want everyone to leave my house. I want everyone to get the fuck out”. 
     
      
    125 He then jumped back off the bench, according to him, onto the kitchen side. The police were standing on the lounge room side of the bench. The police testimony was to the effect that Mr Kuru jumped off on their side of the bench in an aggressive and threatening way. Murray ADCJ found that it would have been a physical impossibility for Mr Kuru to have jumped from the bench into the lounge room as the police alleged. He said that to do this Mr Kuru would have had to perform a swallow dive “of Olympic proportions”. It is sufficient to say, in my view, that the evidence did not justify this finding. It would have been relatively easy for Mr Kuru to jump off the counter on to the lounge room side. Mr Guler testified that this, indeed, is what occurred. The judge made no reference to this evidence of Mr Guler although he accepted him as an accurate witness. In the light of my conclusion as to the result of the appeal, however, it is not necessary for me to say more about this factual dispute.  
     
      
    126 Mr Kuru said that he jumped onto the kitchen bench to get everyone’s attention. He felt that he was not being heard. After he had jumped off the kitchen bench, Mr Kuru said (obviously loudly) that he had had enough. He said: “[r]ight, that’s it”. This was followed by: “I want everybody out”.  
     
      
    127 Mr Kuru said, “[t]hen I took a few steps forward, with my arms still in the air, and I made contact with my left arm to one of the police officers, and then I was punched”. He said that he made contact with the police officer while he was moving at walking pace. 
     
      
    128 According to Mr Kuru, a period of about five to eight minutes elapsed from the time he first asked the police to get out of the house to the time he made contact with the officers.  
     
      
    129 After Mr Kuru had made physical contact with the officer, the police arrested him. I make no comment at this stage as to whether that arrest was lawful or not. According to the police, Mr Kuru shoulder-charged them. The judge did not accept this (in a finding that is challenged). In the course of arresting Mr Kuru, the police punched him (on his evidence, several times). The police testified, in effect, that they used physical force to subdue Mr Kuru, who attempted to fight them off. What precisely occurred was in issue. In view of the conclusion to which I have come as regards the disposal of the appeal, it is unnecessary to resolve it.  
     
      
       
      The lawfulness of the police entry and s 357F of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 (NSW) 
       
      
    130 It has long been established that any unjustified entry on land or premises in the possession of another constitutes a trespass: Entick v Carrington (1765) 95 ER 807 at 817 per Lord Camden CJ; Morris v Beardmore [1981] AC 446 at 464 per Lord Scarman; Halliday v Nevill (1984) 155 CLR 1 at 10 per Brennan J; Plenty v Dillon (1991) 171 CLR 635 at 647 per Gaudron and McHugh JJ. 
     
      
    131 Mr Temby QC who, together with Mr Sternberg, appeared for the State, submitted that the police were justified by s 357F of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in entering Mr Kuru’s apartment. That section relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ (1) In this section, ‘ 
        occupier 
        ’, in relation to a dwelling-house, means a person immediately entitled to possession of the dwelling-house. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A member of the police force who believes on reasonable grounds that an offence has recently been or is being committed, or is imminent, or is likely to be committed, in any dwelling-house and that the offence is a domestic violence offence may, subject to subsection (3): 
        
       
       
        
        (a) enter the dwelling-house, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) remain in the dwelling-house, 
        
       
       
        
        for the purpose of investigating whether such an offence has been committed or, as the case may be, for the purpose of taking action to prevent the commission or further commission of such an offence, if invited to do so by a person who apparently resides in the dwelling-house, whether or not the person is an adult. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Except as provided in subsection (4), a member of the police force may not enter or remain in a dwelling-house by reason only of an invitation given as referred to in subsection (2) if authority to so enter or remain is expressly refused by an occupier of the dwelling-house and the member of the police force is not otherwise authorised (whether under this or any other Act or at common law) to so enter or remain. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) …”. 
        
       
      
    132 It was not (and could not, reasonably, have been) disputed on Mr Kuru’s behalf that the police, when entering the apartment, believed on reasonable grounds that a domestic violence offence had recently been committed there. The information that had been relayed to the police about a male and female fighting, the female having been heard screaming, and that everything had “gone quiet”, amounted to ample grounds for suspecting or believing that a domestic violence offence had been committed. It followed that, by s 357F, if the police were invited by Mr Kuru to enter the apartment for the purpose of investigating whether such an offence had been committed, they were lawfully entitled to do so.  
     
      
    133 Murray ADCJ found that there had been no invitation as required by the section. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that s 357F(2) does not authorise the police officers in this case to enter the premises because they were never invited by [Mr Kuru] the occupier, to come in. He was in the shower”. 
        
       
      
    134 Mr Temby submitted that his Honour had erred and that Mr Kuru had invited the police into the apartment and, therefore, s 357F applied. This argument depends, to a degree, on the meaning of the word “invited” in the section. 
     
      
    135 Mr Temby first submitted that the open door was itself an invitation. I do not accept, however, that the mere fact that the door was open constituted an invitation to enter: cf Great Central Railway Company v Bates [1921] 3 KB 578 at 581 per Lord Sterndale MR (with whom Atkin LJ agreed).  
     
      
    136 Mr Temby then drew attention to the fact that, immediately upon seeing Mr Kuru, the police officers asked him whether they could “take a look around” his apartment, and he agreed. Mr Temby submitted that this conduct on the part of Mr Kuru, within two or three minutes of the police entering the apartment, constituted the requisite invitation.  
     
      
    137 I do not accept that an invitation to enter premises (within the meaning of s 357H) can only be made when a police officer is outside the premises. It is not unusual, where the door to a house, or a room, or any kind of premises, is open, for persons to walk through the door, make their presence known, and, while already inside, inquire of the occupant whether they may be permitted to enter. An affirmative response from the occupant would constitute, in every day parlance, an invitation to enter. The proposition advanced on Mr Kuru’s behalf is that an indication by an occupier to a person that he or she may enter premises, to which the door is open, is an invitation to enter if given when that person has not crossed the threshold, but is not an invitation if given when that person has taken a step or more into the premises through the open door. In my opinion, that proposition is contrary to ordinary usage and custom and bears no relationship to the reality of common human behaviour.  
     
      
    138 Section 357F (as well as ss 357G and 357H) was introduced into the Crimes Act by the Crimes (Domestic Violence) Amendment Act 1982 (NSW). In the Second Reading Speech, Mr Wran, the then Premier, stated:  
     
      
       
        
        “The purpose of the  
        Crimes (Domestic Violence) Amendment Bill 
         is to further the government’s determination to eliminate the scourge of domestic violence in New South Wales”. 
        
       
       
      He stated that one of the objects of the bill was “to confirm the right of police to enter private premises to investigate a domestic violence complaint when invited …”. 
       
      
    139 It is apparent from the legislation itself that a purpose of s 357F was to facilitate police investigation of domestic violence offences and to protect persons who might be at risk because of domestic violence. It would be contrary to the objects and purpose of s 357F to give the phrase, “if invited to do so”, a technical and limited meaning. If the police could only be invited (for the purposes of s 357F) to enter premises when they were outside the premises, their ability to protect victims or potential victims of domestic violence and to investigate domestic violence offences would be hampered seriously. Such a construction could not have been intended by the legislature. 
     
      
    140 In my opinion, Mr Kuru, by agreeing (when he first saw the police) that they could look around his apartment, invited the police to enter and remain in the apartment within the meaning of the word “invited” in s 357F(2). 
     
      
    141 Even if the police officers’ entry through the open door technically constituted a trespass, such trespass was cured by Mr Kuru’s later invitation to them to enter. 
     
      
    142 It must have been obvious to Mr Kuru, when he agreed to the police looking around his apartment, that they were there to investigate a possible domestic violence offence. He must have known that people in the vicinity would have heard the screaming that had occurred, were likely to have thought that violence was being done to some person, and might have called the police. In any event, Mr Guler must have told Mr Kuru why the police were there when he went into the bathroom to call Mr Kuru. These matters explain why Mr Kuru, when emerging from the bathroom and agreeing to the police looking around, did not bother to ask the police why they were there.  
     
      
    143 Thus, in my view, Mr Kuru, in effect, invited the police to look around the apartment for the purpose of investigating whether a domestic violence offence had been committed. It follows, in my view, that the police were authorised by s 357F(2) to enter the apartment. 
     
      
       
      The right of the police, at common law, to enter the apartment 
       
      
    144 Mr Temby submitted that, irrespective of s 357F(2), the police were entitled, at common law, to enter the apartment.  
     
      
    145 Mr Einfeld submitted that ss 357F, 357G (which governs entry into premises by warrant and which section is not presently relevant) and 357H constituted a code and the common law relating to the power of police officers to enter premises no longer applied.  
     
      
    146 I do not accept Mr Einfeld’s submission. It is inconsistent with the Second Reading Speech, according to which one of the objects of the legislation was “to confirm” the right of police to enter private premises to investigate a domestic violence complaint when invited. Further, it is inconsistent with s 357F(3), which expressly contemplates that the common law may authorise a member of the police force to enter or remain in a dwelling house even if authority to enter or remain is expressly refused by an occupier of the dwelling house. Importantly, s 357H(2) provides expressly that nothing in ss 357H(1), 357F or 357G limits any power which a member of the police force may have at common law to enter, or remain in, or on, premises. 
     
      
    147 There is much authority that, at common law, any person, including a police officer, is entitled to enter private premises to prevent a breach of the peace from occurring. A clear statement of the law appears in Thomas v Sawkins [1935] 2 KB 249 where Lord Hewart CJ said at 254: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think that there is quite sufficient ground for the proposition that it is part of the preventive power, and, therefore, part of the preventive duty, of the police, in cases where there are such reasonable grounds of apprehension [of a misdemeanour or breach of the peace], to enter and remain on private premises. It goes without saying that the powers and duties of the police are directed, not to the interests of the police, but to the protection and welfare of the public”. 
        
       
       
      Avory J, in the same case, said at 256: 
       
       
        
        “In my opinion, no express statutory authority is necessary [to break open or to force an entrance into private premises] where the police have reasonable grounds to apprehend a breach of the peace…” 
        
       
       
      Lawrence J agreed. 
       
      
    148 See also Dowling v Higgins [1944] Tas SR 32 at 34 per Morris CJ; McGowan v Chief Constable of Kingston upon Hull [1968] Crim LR 34; Todd v O’Sullivan (1985) 122 LSJS 403 at 409 per Legoe J; Panos v Hayes (1987) 44 SASR 148 at 154 to 155 per Legoe J; Nicholson v Avon [1991] 1 VR 212 at 222 per Marks J; McLeod v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1994] 4 All ER 553 at 560 per Neill LJ (with whom Hoffman and Waite LJJ agreed); Foulkes v Chief Constable of Merseyside Police [1998] 3 All ER 705 at 711 per Beldam LJ (with whom Schiemann and Thorpe LJJ agreed); Friswell v Chief Constable of Essex Police [2004] EWHC 3009; Addison v Chief Constable of The West Midlands Police [2004] 1 WLR 29 at 32 per Ward LJ (with whom Saville and McCowan LJJ agreed). 
     
      
    149 A breach of the peace occurs when an act “either actually harms a person, or in his presence, his property, or is likely to cause such harm, which puts someone in fear of such harm being done”: R v Howell (Errol) [1982] QB 416 at 427 per Watkins LJ, in delivering the judgment of the English Court of Appeal. This statement of the law was followed by the English Court of Appeal in Addison v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police [2004] 1 WLR 29 at 30 to 31. See also Nicholson v Avon [1991] 1 VR 212 at 222. 
     
      
    150 Mr Einfeld submitted that Plenty v Dillon (1990-1991) 171 CLR 635 was authority for the proposition that the police did not have authority at common law to enter Mr Kuru’s premises. He relied, in particular, on the following remarks of Gaudron and McHugh JJ at 647 to 648:  
     
      
       
        
        “A person who enters the property of another must justify that entry by showing that he or she either entered with the consent of the occupier or otherwise had lawful authority to enter the premises:  
        Entick v Carrington  
        (1765) 95 ER 807 at 817;  
        Morris v Beardmore  
        [1981] AC 446 at 464;  
        Southam v Smout  
        [1964] 1 QB 308 at 320;  
        Halliday v Nevill  
        (1984) 155 CLR 1 at 10. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The common law has a number of exceptions to the general rule that a person is a trespasser unless that person enters premises without the consent, express or implied, of the occupier. Thus, a constable or citizen can enter premises for the purpose of making an arrest if a felony has been committed and the felon has been followed to the premises. A constable or citizen can also enter premises to prevent the commission of a felony, and a constable can enter premises to arrest an offender running away from an affray. Moreover, a constable or citizen can enter premises to prevent a murder occurring. In these cases there is power not only to enter premises but, where necessary, to break into the premises…But no public official, police constable or citizen has any right at common law to enter a dwelling-house merely because he or she suspects that something is wrong:  
        Great Central Railway Co v Bates 
         [1921] 3 KB 578 at 581-582.” 
        
       
      
    151 Plenty v Dillon concerned access to premises for the purposes of the service of a summons. The case did not concern the power of a police officer to enter the property of another to enter and remain on private premises to prevent a breach of the peace from occurring. Thus, the observations of Gaudron and McHugh JJ at 647 to 648 are not binding on this court, although, of course, they must be accorded great respect. 
     
      
    152 In the passage quoted, Gaudron and McHugh JJ made no mention of the right to enter premises to prevent a breach of the peace. As I have attempted to demonstrate, that right has been accepted by many courts for many years. Particularly in the light of the fact that their Honours made no reference at all to circumstances of that kind (either by way of exclusion or inclusion), and as their remarks were made obiter, I do not think that they were intending to give an exhaustive list of exceptions to the general rule that a person is a trespasser unless he or she enters the premises with the consent of the occupier.  
     
      
    153 Mr Einfeld sought to obtain some support from their Honours’ observation that a police constable does not have any right at common law “to enter a dwelling house merely because he or she suspects that something is wrong: Great Central Railway Company v Bates [1921] 3 KB 578 at 581 to 582”.  
     
      
    154 In Great Central Railway Company v Bates, a police constable, seeing the door of a warehouse open after dark, entered the warehouse in order to see whether everything was in order. It was held that he had no legal right to so enter. Gaudron and McHugh JJ, in making the observation in question, were not referring to the situation where a police officer has reasonable grounds for apprehending that a breach of the peace has, or will be, committed. That situation is very different from a mere suspicion that something might not be as it should be. 
     
      
    155 In my opinion, the submission that the police were entitled, at common law, to enter Mr Kuru’s apartment, is correct.  
     
      
      Mr Kuru’s revocation of his invitation and the application of s 357H 
       
      
    156 Shortly after Mr Kuru agreed that the police could remain and look around in the apartment, he revoked that consent. He ordered the police to leave. Section 357F(3) thereby became operative. That is, the invitation that Mr Kuru had previously given to the police no longer, on its own, authorised them to remain in the apartment. Section 357F(4) had no application and, therefore, the authority of the police to remain in the apartment, if it existed, had to be found – as stated in s 357F(3) – “under this or any other Act or at common law”. 
     
      
    157 Mr Temby submitted, firstly, that s 357H of the Crimes Act had the effect of authorising the police to remain in the apartment. This section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        357H Provisions relating to powers of entry under sections 357F and 357G 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Where a member of the police force enters a dwelling-house in pursuance of an invitation (as referred to in section 357F), or in pursuance of a warrant granted under section 357G, for the purpose, in either case, of investigating whether an offence which the member of the police force suspects or believes to be a domestic violence offence has been committed or, as the case may be, for the purpose of taking action to prevent the commission or further commission of such an offence, the member of the police force: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) is to take only such action in the dwelling-house as is reasonably necessary: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) to investigate whether such an offence has been committed, 
          
         
        
       
      
    (ii) to render aid to any person who appears to be injured, 
     
      
    (iii) to exercise any lawful power to arrest a person, and 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (iv) to prevent the commission or further commission of such an offence, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (a1) must enquire as to the presence of any firearms in the dwelling house and if informed that there is a firearm or firearms, must take all such action as is reasonably practicable to search for and to seize the firearm or firearms, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) is to remain in the dwelling-house only as long as is reasonably necessary to take that action. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Nothing in subsection (1) or in section 357F or 357G limits any other power which a member of the police force may have under this or any other Act or at common law to enter or remain in or on premises.” 
        
       
      
    158 Mr Einfeld submitted that the State’s reliance on s 357H was misplaced.  
     
      
    159 He submitted, first, that the section was not engaged as Mr Kuru had not invited the police to enter the apartment. I have held against Mr Kuru on this issue. 
     
      
    160 Mr Einfeld then submitted that on the facts of the case there was nothing that the police could have wanted to investigate. They had searched the house and had either looked at the bathroom or did not think it worthwhile looking at the bathroom. They had completed the searches they wished to make and therefore it was no longer reasonably necessary for them to remain in the apartment. The corollary to this argument is that, after Mr Kuru told the police to leave, they stayed in the apartment for some reason having nothing to do with the investigation. 
     
      
    161 I do not accept that, after Mr Kuru told the police to leave, there was nothing to investigate. The fact that no person was found in the bathroom, or elsewhere in the apartment, did not put an end to an investigation whether an offence had been committed. There may well have been other signs present that might have suggested that an assault had been committed. Moreover, the police might have thought it desirable to interview the woman who had been heard screaming, but who was no longer present. Her testimony was an important element in establishing whether an offence had been committed. The questions the police asked of Mr Kuru and Mr Guler as to the woman’s whereabouts (and which had not been answered to their satisfaction) were part of their investigations. Moreover, the police had not had the opportunity of verifying the telephone number Mr Kuru had given them.  
     
      
    162 Mr Einfeld drew attention to the fact that the police did not attempt to comply with s 357H(1)(a1) as they did not inquire as to the presence of any firearms in the apartment. In my view, however, this omission on the part of the police does not mean that they remained in the apartment with a purpose other than to investigate whether an offence had been committed (as required by s 357H(1)(a)(i)). 
     
      
    163 In the course of the cross-examination of Senior Constable Lindley, the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q It is fair to say you wanted to know though what happened with the lady or where she was? 
         
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And would it … also be fair to say you were probably not going to leave until you got some answers? 
         
        A Yes.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The conduct of the police, generally, throughout the incident, was in accord with Senior Constable Lindley’s reply.  
       
      
    164 I have previously noted that it was not, and could not, reasonably, have been disputed that the police, when entering the apartment, believed on reasonable grounds that a domestic violence offence had recently been committed there. The police entered the apartment for the purpose of investigating whether an offence, which they suspected or believed to be a domestic violence offence, had been committed. It follows that the elements of the chapeau of s 357H(1) that trigger the operation of s 357H(1)(a) were established. Accordingly, the police were required to take action of the kind set out in s 357H(1)(a) (subject to the limitation in s 357H(1)(b)). 
     
      
    165 Section 357H(1)(a) requires the member of the police force concerned “to take only such action in the dwelling house as is reasonably necessary” to perform the matters listed in s 357H(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). Section 357H(1)(b) provides that the police are to remain in the dwelling-house only as long as is reasonably necessary to take that action. 
     
      
    166 Only a matter of a few minutes elapsed from the time that Mr Kuru asked the police to leave until he was arrested. In those few minutes the police asked Mr Guler whether he knew the address of Mr Kuru’s sister and had not received a reply from him. They had had no opportunity of calling the telephone number that Mr Kuru had told them was the telephone number of his sister. Before they could complete their inquiries, Mr Kuru jumped off the counter, came into contact with, or struck, one of the police officers, and the police commenced taking steps to subdue and arrest him.  
     
      
    167 In my view, the conduct of the police in the crucial few minutes in question was reasonably necessary to investigate whether a domestic violence offence had been committed. In other words, in my view, the police remained in the apartment for a period reasonably necessary to take action of the kind they were required by s 357H(1)(a) to take. Thus, in my view, s 357H(1) authorised the police to remain in the apartment notwithstanding Mr Kuru’s revocation of his consent to their remaining.  
     
      
    168 At one point, Mr Einfeld referred to the fact that the State did not plead that the actions of the police were justified by s 357H and submitted that it should be precluded from doing so. This submission was subsidiary to his main arguments.  
     
      
    169 At trial, the State relied on s 357H, seemingly without objection. The argument the State so raised led his Honour to set out the terms of the section in the course of his reasons. The judge dealt with, and rejected, the State’s reliance on s 357H on the basis that the section did not apply “as there was neither an invitation given to the police, nor did they purport to enter in pursuance of a warrant”. There was no suggestion in his Honour’s reasons that Mr Kuru had objected to the State’s argument based on s 357H on the ground that it had not been pleaded. 
     
      
    170 This court has frequently stressed the importance of pleading matters that may take the opposite party by surprise or matters that make any claim or defence not maintainable. This has been said particularly in the context of claims against police officers for trespass: Pringle v Everingham [2006] NSWCA 195; Thompson v Vincent (2005) 153 A Crim R 577. Having regard to the way in which the case was run at trial, however, I consider it to be open to the State to raise its s 357H argument on appeal. 
     
      
       
      The authority of the police, at common law, to remain in the apartment  
       
      
    171 I have referred above to the statement by Lord Hewart CJ in Thomas v Sawkins at 255 that, at common law, where there are reasonable grounds of apprehension of a misdemeanour or breach of the peace, the police are entitled to enter and remain on private premises. The rule, as Lord Hewart CJ noted, is derived from the preventive powers and duties of the police and is directed not to the interests of the police, but to the protection and welfare of the public. The rule has been applied in several cases.  
     
      
    172 In McGowan v Chief Constable of Kingston upon Hull [1968] Crim LR 34, the police entered a private house because they suspected a danger of a breach of the peace. The Divisional Court of the Queen’s Bench (Lord Parker CJ, Widgery and O’Connor JJ) held (at 35) that the police “were justified in remaining [on the premises] because of their fear of a breach of the peace”.  
     
      
    173 McGowan v Chief Constable of Kingston upon Hull is also reported at (1967) 117 NLJ 1138. In that report, the following is stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he circumstances were such that the police officers were justified in entering the appellant’s house to prevent a breach of the peace, whether invited to do so or not … Although the police conceded that when they arrived the appellant was calm, the situation rapidly became such that they were entitled to take the view that it was necessary for them to remain to prevent disorder or injury to the child”. 
        
       
      
    174 In Kay v Hibbert [1977] Crim LR 226, the Divisional Court of the Queen’s Bench (Lord Widgery CJ, Michael Davies and Robert Goff JJ) was concerned with a case where police officers went to a shop to investigate the sounding of a burglar alarm. The proprietor of the shop entered the premises while the police officers were present. He commenced to abuse the police officers verbally and told them to get out of the shop. As a police officer started to walk out, the proprietor struck him. The proprietor contended that, as he had told the police officers to leave the premises, they were trespassers at the time the assault took place and were therefore not acting in the execution of their duty. The Court held (at 227) that:  
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he activation of the alarm in the police headquarters gave an implied authority to the police officers to enter the premises to investigate the matter, and their having thus entered as licensees, a reasonable time must be allowed to them to investigate before the licence was revoked. As the officers in the present case were given no time to satisfy themselves as to the identity of the defendant their investigations were incomplete and their licence unrevoked at the time of the assault”.  
        
       
      
    175 In a commentary in the report to the case (at 227), the following is stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would seem … that a constable summoned to a building by a burglar alarm would be failing in his duty if he accepted without question the word of a person he found there (who might, after all, have been the burglar) that he was the owner. Even though told to go by the person who was in fact the owner, the constable, it seems, would be entitled to stay until he had taken reasonable steps to satisfy himself that it really was the owner who was instructing him to leave”. 
        
       
      
    176 Kay v Hibbert is also reported at (1977) 141 JP Jo 157. In that report, it is stated (at 157), as part of the holding of the Court, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[W]hen the respondent was assaulted his investigation was not complete because he was not satisfied as to the identity of the appellant; the appellant did not give the respondent reasonable opportunity to leave and the respondent was clearly still in the execution of his duty when the appellant struck him”. 
        
       
      
    177 In Ledger v Director of Public Prosecutions [1991] Crim LR 439, the police went to the appellant’s house to investigate a serious incident. The appellant refused to let the officer in and told him to leave. The appellant refused to give his correct name to the police. He was cautioned and arrested for obstructing the police. On appeal, the Divisional Court of the Queen’s Bench (Watkins LJ and Otton J) held that the police had an implied licence to enter the property to speak to the appellant. Although the appellant had purported to withdraw any permission given to the police to be on the premises, that withdrawal did not automatically terminate the licence of the police to remain on the premises. The Court cited Kay v Hibbert. Their Lordships stated at 440: 
     
      
       
        
        “Here, as the officers were given no time to satisfy themselves as to [the appellant’s] identity, the investigations were incomplete and their licence unrevoked at the time of the arrest”. 
        
       
      
    178 Similarly, in the present case, even though the police were told to leave by Mr Kuru, they were, in my opinion, entitled, at common law, to stay until they had taken reasonable steps to satisfy themselves that no offence had been committed in the apartment (whether by making a closer inspection of the premises or by telephoning Mr Kuru’s fiancée or his sister and speaking to one, or other, of them). 
     
      
    179 In determining whether or not it was reasonable for the police officers to remain on Mr Kuru’s premises after the invitation was revoked, the purpose of the police officers in remaining is crucial. If they remained for reasons unrelated to their investigations, for example, on account of an enjoyment of the exercise of power, they would not be entitled lawfully to remain there. Murray ADCJ made no factual finding as to the police officers’ state of mind.  
     
      
    180 The State case was that at all times the police were on the premises for the purpose of investigating whether a domestic violence offence had been committed. The evidence of the police officers was to this effect. It is plain, on the undisputed evidence, that, at least until Mr Kuru told the police to leave, they were there for that purpose. I have noted that, in the few minutes that elapsed from that moment until the arrest, the police asked Mr Guler whether he knew the address of Mr Kuru’s sister and were awaiting a reply from him. It was not unreasonable for them to want to verify what Mr Kuru had told them. They had not had the time to ascertain whether the telephone number Mr Kuru had given them was the number of his sister. These matters are confirmatory of the State case that the police remained on the premises to complete their investigations. Counsel for Mr Kuru, at the trial, seemed, implicitly, to accept this as appears from the terms of the questions he put to Senior Constable Lindley in the exchange to which I have referred (see [65] above). The replies counsel received were consistent with the State case on this issue. Importantly, it was never put to the police officers at trial that they remained in Mr Kuru’s apartment for purposes unrelated to their investigations. I would, therefore, hold that the police remained on Mr Kuru’s premises so as to ascertain whether a domestic violence offence had been committed. 
     
      
    181 The police officers reasonably apprehended that a breach of the peace and a domestic violence offence had been committed. They were therefore entitled to enter Mr Kuru’s apartment and to investigate what had occurred. Although Mr Kuru revoked the permission he had given the police to enter, at the time he did so a reasonable time for completing their investigations had not elapsed. Thus, when Mr Kuru’s arm came into contact with one of the police officers, the police were not trespassers.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    182 As I have concluded that under ss 357F and 357H of the Crimes Act, and at common law, the police were entitled to enter Mr Kuru’s apartment and were entitled to be there at the time he made physical contact with one of the police officers, they were entitled to arrest him. In my opinion, the trial judge erred in finding to the contrary. 
     
      
    183 I agree with Mason P’s remarks (at [3]) as regards the way in which the State pleaded its case and accept that the consequence of that pleading is that the State should pay its own costs of the appeal. 
     
      
    184 I therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. The appeal is upheld.  
       
       
      2. The orders made by the trial judge are set aside.  
       
       
      3. There should be judgment and a verdict for the State. 
       
       
      4. Mr Kuru should pay the State’s costs of the trial. 
       
       
      5. Each party should pay their own costs of the appeal. 
       
       
      6. Mr Kuru should have a certificate under the  
      Suitors’ Fund Act  
      1951 (NSW) for the costs of the appeal, incurred by him, if otherwise entitled.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Howie J, for the reasons he gives. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court for four offences in breach of Federal Laws. The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed for sentence. For a reason that is neither apparent nor relevant he was arraigned on an indictment for the four offences and pleaded guilty to each. The offences comprised three counts of making a false statement contrary to s 29(4)(b) of the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 (Cth) (the “money laundering offences”) and one count of possession of property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime contrary to s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) (“the goods in custody offence”). The money laundering offences relevantly carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years and the goods in custody offence a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 2 years. 
     
      
    4 The applicant also asked the sentencing judge, Acting Judge Boulton (the Judge) to take into account under the provisions of s 16BA of the Crimes Act (Cth) 19 further offences of money laundering. There was also before the Judge a schedule of “related offences” in accordance with s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) to which the applicant also pleaded guilty. These were a mixture of Federal and State offences related to the use of false identification or false statements made by the applicant in order to perpetrate the money laundering offences. 
     
      
    5 On 27 September 2006 the Judge sentenced the applicant. He intended that there would be an overall sentence of imprisonment for 3 years and ordered the applicant to be released on a recognizance release order after serving 1 year 11 months and 23 days. The Judge actually sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 2 years on the first count, 3 years on counts 2 and 3, those sentences all to be concurrent, and a sentence of 9 months imprisonment for count 4 cumulative to the sentences on the first three counts. For all the related offences he sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 6 months except for two matters in respect of which the applicant was sentenced to 2 months on one and 9 months on the other. Those sentences were all concurrent between themselves and with the sentences for the first three counts on the indictment. The result was an overall sentence of 3 years and 9 months. 
     
      
    6 Having imposed those sentences, the Judge then purported to discount them by 20 per cent for the pleas of guilty resulting in an overall term of 3 years. The Judge never in fact calculated the sentences for the particular offences after applying the discount nor did he vacate the sentences he had imposed before discounting them. Therefore, at least technically, the sentences being served by the applicant are those that were actually imposed upon him prior to the purported discount. The Court has a copy of the sentencing orders signed by the Judge. They are in the same terms as he pronounced them. Therefore there is at least an inconsistency in the orders and on its face the applicant’s total sentence is 3 years and 9 months and the Judge had no power to fix a recognizance release order. 
     
      
    7 It is obvious that a sentence should be imposed after the appropriate discounts are applied and not before. In the present case it impossible to know with certainty what sentence the applicant is actually serving for any offence. For example, what is the Judge’s calculation of 20 per cent of 9 months for the fourth count? In the absence of any determination by the Judge of the discounted sentence, whose function is it to decide what the term of that sentence is to be? Presumably the warrants issued show the sentences as imposed by the Judge but they are not the sentences he intended to impose. The Crown brought this problem to the attention of the Judge sometime after sentence but at the time of the hearing in this Court no action had been taken to have the sentences corrected. Whatever be the result of the grounds of appeal relied upon, this Court will have to resentence the applicant. 
     
      
    8 A further difficulty with the sentences is that it appears that the Judge took into account the matters on the form prescribed pursuant to s 16BA when sentencing for all offences. The Judge does not say that he did so but neither does he indicate on which of the offences he took the matters into account. This is perhaps not surprising because the form signed by the prosecutor and the applicant referred to each of the four charges and is in terms requesting the Judge to take into account the matters on the form when sentencing for all offences for which the applicant was before the court. 
     
      
    9 Although the terms of s 16BA might suggest that matters can be taken into account when sentencing for more than one Federal offence, it cannot have been the intention of the legislature that more than one sentence could be increased by taking into account the same offences. Obviously that would result in double counting the matters being taken into account. This might not be of practical significance when the sentences are being served concurrently. But it would clearly be unfair to do so when some or all of the sentences are being served cumulatively as was the case here. Senior Counsel for the Crown accepted that, despite the terms of the section, the form pursuant to s 16BA should refer to only one offence, being that to which the matters taken into account should apply. The parties asked this Court to take the matters into account on the most serious offence being the second count. 
     
      
    10 Neither of the above errors in the sentencing of the applicant was relied upon as grounds of appeal. Nor were they referred to in the written submissions of either party. Although the Crown accepted that these errors had occurred, it submitted that no lesser sentence was warranted. The applicant argued that, even without these errors, the sentences were excessive because the Judge over-estimated the criminality of the applicant and refused to give him a discount for proffered assistance. It was submitted that the applicant should receive the benefit of an order that the sentences imposed be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    11 It should be noted that the representative of the Commonwealth Crown before the Judge submitted that a sentence for a Federal offence could not be backdated where the offender was not in custody. There is nothing in the provisions of the Crimes Act (Cth) to justify that submission. The normal and preferred practice in sentencing for State matters, where an offender has been in custody for some time before being released to bail, is to backdate the sentence for a period equal to the period served in custody notwithstanding that the offender may have been on bail for the period up until sentence is pronounced: see R v Newman & Simpson (2004) 145 A Crim R 361. This practice should be adopted pursuant to s 16E(1) of the Crimes Act (Cth) that provides that the law of this State relating to the commencement of sentences applies to a person sentenced for a Federal offence. 
     
      
    12 The facts reveal that the applicant was involved in a significant way in the laundering of money so that it could be sent overseas. There were two distinct sets of transactions involved. The first occurred in November and December 2004. The second occurred in May 2005. Police arrested the applicant at a bank intending to transfer $200,000. The amount then in his possession and money in one of the accounts he operated, totalling $290,020, formed the goods in custody offence. As a result of his activities $9,550 was transferred to Indonesia on 25 November 2004. This comprised the first count on the indictment. On 19 May 2005 two sums, $149,970 and $125,975, were transferred to Lebanon. These amounts gave rise to the second and third counts of money laundering. 
     
      
    13 In order to carry out this activity the applicant used two false identities in which he purchased two companies. He opened five bank accounts, one in the name of one of his false identities and two in the name of each of the companies. In total the applicant transferred $465,942 to banks in Lebanon and Indonesia and the applicant had intended to transfer a further $200,000 to a bank account in Lebanon. The sums transferred were generally in the amount of $9,500 to avoid the compulsory notification limit under s 15 of the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 (Cth). 
     
      
    14 The subjective matters relevant to the applicant were to be found in a pre-sentence report and a report from a psychiatrist. These revealed that the applicant was aged 29 years with no prior criminal record. He comes from Lebanon where he married before migrating to this country with his wife and daughter. The applicant had difficulty obtaining work or support and apparently this was the reason why he became involved in these offences. From the proceeds of these offences he supported his family and three orphans in Lebanon. Apparently he told the probation officer that, as well as enabling him to commit these offences, the principal provided him with false identification by which he purchased goods for the family including furniture. The applicant had been working at some time as a truck driver. There was little in the psychiatric report of relevance apart from the fact that the applicant had been suffering from an adjustment disorder since his motor vehicle was fired upon, an incident to which reference is made below. There were a number of character references before the Judge. 
     
      
    15 It was accepted at the sentencing hearing that the applicant did not own the money he transferred. The police officer giving evidence before the Judge conceded that a person named Frank from Melbourne owned the money and that the applicant was acting on his behalf. The applicant told police that he had received the documents relating to his false identities from the person who provided the funds. He said that whenever he attended the bank, Frank was with him waiting in a parked motor vehicle. The applicant complains that the Judge did not take into account sufficiently, or at all, the applicant’s subsidiary role and sentenced him as if he were a principal. This, it is submitted, was why the sentence imposed was so close to the maximum penalty for the offence notwithstanding a discount of 20 per cent for the pleas. 
     
      
    16 There is little in the remarks on sentence that identifies either directly or indirectly the position of the applicant in the criminal organisation behind the scheme to transfer the money from Australia. But as the Crown submitted before this Court, the Judge sentenced the applicant on the basis of what he did rather than identifying his role or position as against the other person or persons involved; see R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. Yet it is relevant to identify whether the applicant is the principal in the course of criminal conduct in which he engaged. Clearly if the owner, or owners, of the money were before the Court it would generally be expected that they would face a heavier sentence because the offences were being committed at their behest and for their advantage. 
     
      
    17 At the hearing before this Court some reference was made by analogy to drug importation offences. On that analogy the applicant would be more than a courier but less than a principal. Yet his involvement was substantial in both setting up the scheme and carrying it out even if he were working under directions of someone above him. Further the enterprises were not accomplished by a single act of criminality, such as might be the case of a person couriering drugs. This is demonstrated by the number of offences that were before the court, either being taken into account or as related matters. A substantial sentence of full-time imprisonment was required to mark the applicant’s criminal activity over a number of months notwithstanding his previous good character and the other subjective matters that might mitigate the sentence. 
     
      
    18 The manner in which the applicant was sentenced did not, with respect, represent the criminality involved in the various counts or a proper application of the principle of totality. I have difficulty in understanding how the Judge could justify making the sentences for the first three counts concurrent and then cumulate the fourth count. The second, third and fourth counts were all part of the same course of criminality and could have been met by concurrent sentences, particularly if the second count reflected the s 16BA matters. The first count represented a completely separate, although related, course of criminal activity. I do not see how the second and third counts could reflect the additional criminality in the first count even though there was more money actually transferred in the second course of criminal activity. 
     
      
    19 In any event it seems to me that the total criminality involved would be represented by an undiscounted sentence of three years however it is structured. I have taken into account other cases to which the sentencing judge and this Court were referred but they can be distinguished on their facts. Although in some cases the amount of money involved is higher than in the present case, the applicant’s activity and period of criminality was greater. 
     
      
    20 The Judge was somewhat scornful of the applicant’s assistance to police and refused any discount. It was submitted before this Court that the Judge’s findings were erroneous and some discount for assistance ought to have been given. The applicant’s proffered assistance came late and was of little practical benefit to police. As soon it was apparent to the applicant that the police were at the bank shortly before his arrest in May 2005 he deleted the phone number of the person Frank from his mobile telephone. When about a year after his arrest and at the behest of his legal advisor he sought to gain an advantage by attempting to assist police, there was little useful information he could provide by way of identifying his principal. 
     
      
    21 In November 2005 when he understood he was going to meet with Frank he attempted to contact police but the officer was absent from the station. In any event Frank did not show for the meeting. Shortly thereafter shots were fired at the applicant’s motor vehicle, apparently because he had been unable to return the money that was in his possession at the time of his arrest. This frightened him so that he made no further contact with police until April 2006. While it might be understandable that the applicant was in fear of making further approaches to police until persuaded to do so by his lawyer, the simple fact is that he did not again seek to speak to police until a time when he could give little assistance and the police could do little to further their investigations. 
     
      
    22 Although the applicant might in April 2006 have given police all the information that he could, the simple fact is that it was vague and of little weight. While the police officer giving evidence at the hearing conceded that he had some idea who Frank was and had a surname, he stated that police were not in a position to confirm what the applicant told them. There was also evidence that a solicitor had sought to make a claim on money confiscated by police from the applicant on behalf of a client but the police had not been in a position to advance their inquiries further. The police also attempted to make inquiries in Lebanon on the basis of what the applicant had told them in his interview in April but had been frustrated by the civil unrest there. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion it was open to the Judge to make the findings he did and to determine not to give the applicant any discount by way of assistance. Although the attempt made to assist the police is one of the matters to be considered, so is the effectiveness of the assistance and its benefit to the authorities: R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 at [73]. The effectiveness here was minimal and this was a result principally of the delay by the applicant in proffering it or because he had intentionally destroyed evidence that might have helped. There was no suggestion made to police that they had been negligent in following up leads provided to them by the applicant or otherwise. While another judge might have awarded the applicant with a small discount, such as about 10 per cent, it was in my view within the Judge’s discretion to withhold a discount. 
     
      
    24 In determining the sentence that should be imposed by this Court when re-sentencing the applicant I have taken into account material placed before the Court for this purpose. This was an affidavit by the applicant annexing various certificates gained by him from courses, carried out while he has been in custody, to advance his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    25 By reason of the fact that the applicant had no prior convictions and was generally of good character with good prospects of rehabilitation it seems to me that the appropriate ratio between the minimum period of custody and the overall term should be 60 per cent. 
     
      
    26 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The application for leave is granted and the appeal allowed. 
         
         
        2. The sentences imposed in the District Court are quashed and in lieu the applicant is sentenced as follows: 
         
          
           
          Count 1: Imprisonment for 14 months from 19 September 2006 and to expire on 18 November 2007. 
           
           
          Count 2: (taking into account the matters under s 16BA) Imprisonment for 2 years from 19 February 2007 and to expire on 18 February 2009. 
           
           
          Count 3: Imprisonment for 19 months from 19 February 2007 and to expire on 18 September 2008. 
           
           
          Count 4: Imprisonment for 6 months from 19 February 2007 and to expire on 18 August 2007. 
           
           
          The sentences for the related matters are confirmed but are to date from 19 September 2007. 
           
           
          The applicant is to serve a period of 1 year 5 months from 19 September 2006 and to expire on 18 February 2008 and is to be released to recognizance on 19 February 2008.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    2 The respondent Kevin Witchard pleaded guilty to two charges being: 
     
      
       
      1. Robbery in company contrary s 97(1) of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 for which the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment. 
       
       
      2. Assault with intent to rob with wounding contrary s 98 of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 for which the maximum penalty is 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 
       
      
    3 The respondent was also sentenced in relation to three matters on a s 166 certificate being common assault (s 61); assault officer in the execution of his duty (s 58) and resist officer in the execution of his duty (s 58). 
     
      
    4 The respondent was arrested on 21 January 2006 and was refused bail. He appeared at the Penrith Local Court on 20 October 2006 when he pleaded guilty to both the s 97(1) and s 98 matters. He was sentenced on 14 December 2006 as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) Robbery in company. A non-parole period of 18 months to date from 31 May 2006 and to expire on 30 November 2007. A further parole period of 2 years to commence on 1 December 2007 and expire on 30 November 2009. 
       
       
      (b) Assault with intent to rob – the same sentence as for the offence of robbery in company. 
       
       
      (c) In relation to the matters on the certificate the respondent was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment on each matter commencing on 31 May 2006. 
       
      
    5 Accordingly, the respondent was sentenced to a total non-parole period of 18 months with a further term of 2 years. 
     
      
    6 The Crown submitted that apart from a number of patent errors made by his Honour the sentences which were imposed were manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    7 At the time of the offences the respondent was on bail for an assault of his girlfriend for which he was charged on 10 January 2006. He was subsequently sentenced for this assault to a term of seven months imprisonment with a total non-parole period of four months. For this reason his sentences for the matters the subject of this appeal did not commence until 31 May 2006. 
     
      
    8 Before he was sentenced for the current matters he was sentenced for the assault on his girlfriend. That sentence comprised a non-parole period of 4 months with an overall term of 7 months and was backdated to 21 January 2006. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    9 The sentencing judge recited a summary of the facts in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “About 4.40 am on 21 January 2006, Mr Delaney, Mr Kemp and Mr McDonald were waiting on platform 1 of Kingswood railway station for an eastbound train. At the same time, the offender Witchard and co-offender Roberts and a friend Yeoman were standing on the opposite platform. Witchard crossed the railway tracks and climbed up onto platform 1 near the victim McDonald, who was standing at the western end of the platform. Witchard asked Mr McDonald if he had any money. Mr McDonald told Witchard that he did not have any money. Witchard asked an unknown commuter if he had any money. When the commuter failed to give Witchard any money, he returned to where the victim McDonald was standing and started to punch him to the face. As a result of being assaulted, Mr McDonald walked to the eastern end of the platform and began to cry. As Mr McDonald was walking away, Witchard was teasing him for crying and continued to punch him. 
        
       
       
        
        At some stage during the assault of Mr McDonald, Roberts crossed the tracks and climbed onto platform 1 and approached Mr Kemp who was sitting on a seat near the entrance to the platform. At about the same time, Witchard walked over and stood next to the third victim Mr Delaney. Witchard punched Mr Delaney to the head area and said ‘Give your money.’ Roberts also made a demand for money from the victim, Mr Delaney, and punched him. Mr Delaney told Witchard that he did not have any money. Witchard continued to punch Mr Delaney. Witchard stopped punching Mr Delaney and retrieved a glass bottle of drink from the railway tracks. Witchard hit Mr Delaney over the head with it a number of times. This has caused two wounds to Mr Delaney’s head. The wounds bled heavily. Witchard and Roberts attempted to forcibly take a bag that Delaney had with him. Mr Kemp was seated beside Mr Delaney and was watching the assault upon him. After his assault on Mr Delaney, Roberts turned and punched Mr Kemp and demanded money from him. When Mr Kemp told Roberts that he did not have any money, Roberts demanded cigarettes. Mr Kemp handed Roberts a packet of Winfield Gold containing one cigarette. At this stage, Mr Delaney walked towards the western end of the platform and activated the emergency help point. Witchard and Roberts left Kingswood railway station and attended a bakery located in a strip of shops on the opposite side of the Great Western Highway. 
        
       
       
        
        Police attended the station and approached Witchard to place him under arrest. Witchard attempted to assault police and was tackled to the ground. Whilst on the ground, Witchard was twisting his body and throwing his arms around. He was restrained and arrested. Roberts was arrested a short distance away without incident. Roberts and Witchard were conveyed to Mt Druitt police station where they were charged. They were afforded the opportunity to participate in an electronic record of interview.” 
        
       
      
    10 The co-offender, Roberts, was charged with robbery in company of Mr Kemp and assault with intent to rob Mr Delaney whilst in company. Roberts was not on bail at the time, and did not use a weapon and neither of Roberts’ charges carried a standard non-parole period. Roberts received the same sentence as the respondent. The Court was informed that because the circumstances of the respondent and Roberts are accordingly distinguishable in consideration of the principles of double jeopardy the Crown has not appealed Roberts’ sentences. 
     
      
       
      Subjective features of the respondent 
       
      
    11 The respondent is an Aboriginal man who was aged 18 at the time of the offences and 19 at the time of sentence. He is the fourth of six children. His parents separated when he was about 4 and he remained with his mother.  
     
      
    12 The respondent was educated to Year 8 and left school at the age of 15. He has been employed in a variety of labouring positions. 
     
      
    13 He has two children by two separate relationships. His daughter was born to the partner he assaulted 11 days prior to these offences. His children have visited him while he has been in custody. 
     
      
    14 The respondent has had considerable problems with drugs and alcohol. He commenced drinking at about age 13 and has mixed alcohol with drugs, including cannabis, amphetamines and ecstasy. He has not sought formal treatment for these problems. He has failed a urine test since being in custody where he has used cannabis. 
     
      
       
      The remarks on sentence 
       
      
    15 Having considered the circumstances of the offence the sentencing judge turned to consider the particular circumstances of both offenders. Of the respondent he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I will now turn to the matter of Mr Witchard. As I said, he was only 18 years old at the time. He said that he had a relationship with Sarah Markham and who was pregnant with their child when he – when she told him that the relationship was over. He became angry and he struck her and that was the assault charge for which he received three months imprisonment and of course, she was 34 weeks pregnant at the time and thus, since he has been in custody for this matter and that sentence, he missed out on the arrival of his child. He said that in regard to the offences, he is disgusted with his actions and he expressed his remorse and he had no memory of the night at all. He had had – been drinking bourbon and had imbibed ‘Ecstasy’ and marijuana. This is the first time he has been in gaol. He had one offence of possessing implements and then that matter of assault. Of course, as Miss Bryan pointed out, he was on bail for that assault, which is an aggravating feature under s 21A. 
        
       
       
        
        His childhood was also beset with an atmosphere of alcoholism. His father was a heavy drinker and Mr Witchard himself began drinking at an early age and he began drinking with his father from the age of fourteen. He witnessed a lot of violence in the domestic situation. He started on cannabis when he was twelve and then graduated to ‘speed’ and ‘ecstasy’ at fifteen. He said he has realised, since he has been in custody, that he does not need it any more and he has ambitions of, when he is released, of getting a job and working and renewing his relationship with his children. He has another child by another lady. In fact, Sarah Markham herself gave evidence, confirmed the relationship broke up in January brought about by his heavy drinking and drugs. She said she has seen him in gaol and she is satisfied that he is sincere in the fact that he wants to be part of his children’s life and that she is also confident that he will do anything in his power to change his behaviour. 
        
       
       
        
        There is a pre-sentence report in respect of this gentleman. The probation officer refers to his upbringing and his education. It says that on 24 October, he was convicted of an internal charge of failing a urine test and received a penalty of 42 days off contact visits. A drug screening test conducted on the 8th revealed cannabis. In response to that, Mr Witchard said that he was going through a period of feeling depressed while he was in gaol and when he was offered the chance to use some cannabis, he did so, but he claims that he has abstained from it every since. In the summary and community based sentencing options, the officer says: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Although co-operative with the service, the offender impressed as a rather glib young man who acknowledges that his substance abuse prior to entering custody was significant, but nevertheless appears to reject the notion that he will require assistance in the future to avoid relapse. This may be because he considers that he presently is drug-free, but he will need to develop a much stronger resolve to address drug and alcohol issues if he is to avoid further conflict with the law.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        She goes on to say that he would, when released, be suitable for a medium to low level of intervention by the service. The individualised case plan would include strategies to address the following identified areas of crimino-genic need; substance abuse, violence issues and relationship issues. Of course, in Mr Witchard’s case, there is the standard non-parole period to be considered, but as I said at the beginning, this case, it seems to me, does not fall within the parameters of cases to which that should apply. In addition to that, he has pleaded guilty at an early opportunity, so I do not think it is appropriate to consider the standard non-parole period for this offence in all the circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    16 His Honour then said that because the whole incident occupied a short time and were “all one series of assaults” accumulation of the sentences was unnecessary. His Honour noted that the respondent did not have a significant record, the offences were not planned and the respondent had good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      Were there errors? 
       
      
    17 Although the respondent does not concede that the sentence was manifestly inadequate his counsel accepted that the proceedings were significantly flawed by the following patent errors made by the sentencing judge: 
     
      
       
      (i) A failure to properly consider or apply principles appropriate to sentencing for multiple offences, as expressed by the High Court in  
      Pearce v The Queen  
      (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
       
       
      (ii) Failure to follow the statutory framework or principles enunciated in relation to standard non-parole periods, as promulgated by this Court in  
      R v Way  
      (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. 
       
       
      (iii) Failure to identify and specify any allowance that might appropriately reflect the utility in the guilty plea. 
       
       
      (iv) In addition to the above errors which the respondent accepted were incontestable the respondent also accepted that there may be errors in relation to his Honour’s assessment of the matter, specifically in relation to his failure to consider the guideline judgment in  
      R v Henry  
      (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 as having any relevance and possibly in the finding by his Honour of special circumstances.  
       
      
    18 The respondent accepts that the sentencing process was so infected by error that “it is arguable that the respondent was not properly sentenced at law.” 
     
      
    19 In these circumstances the respondent urged this Court to remit the matter to the District Court for resentencing. In my view this is unnecessary and would only result in further delay and heightened anxiety for the respondent. I am satisfied this Court has available to it all of the evidence necessary to resentence. 
     
      
       
      Principles in relation to Crown appeals 
       
      
    20 This Court has, on many occasions, taken care to emphasise the principles governing appeals by the Crown. They were clearly defined by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
        House v The King  
        (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion as to the appropriate sentence, for that of a sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen  
        (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error or latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait  
        (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388;  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen  
        (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen  
        (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere;  
        R v Baker  
        [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle “for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons” per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen  
        (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 321, at para 61 and 62, and  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen  
        at para 109. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass  
        (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
        R v Papazis  
        (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen  
        at para 110. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder & Johnston  
        (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        para 62” (at [70]). 
        
       
      
    21 Wood CJ at CL referred to R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 where Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The authorities make it clear that Crown appeals should be rare. It may be that the present practice does not reflect that restriction, nevertheless, successful Crown appeals should be rare. This is particularly so with respect to that category of appeals in which no particular error can be identified and the sentencing process and the Crown must rely on an assertion of manifest inadequacy as a basis for a conclusion that some error of principle must have occurred” (at [19]). 
        
       
      
    22 In Dinsdale Gaudron and Gummow JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the circumstances of the present case, the question for the Court of Criminal Appeal was whether the result reached by the trial judge had been ""upon the facts ... unreasonable or plainly unjust [so that] the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance."" Was the sentence ""manifestly wrong""? (at [22]) 
        
       
       
      The submissions of the respondent on sentence 
       
      
    23 The respondent submitted that if this Court moved to resentence careful regard should be paid to the fact that the respondent was aged 18 years and 3 months at the time of the offence. The presentence report of Mr Ross Aitkin records factors of considerable disadvantage in the respondent’s upbringing which it is submitted warranted consideration of the respondent having regard to the principles in R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28. The respondent emphasised that he commenced drinking at the age of 13 or 14 and had become a “bender drinker who mixed alcohol and drugs.” It was submitted that a history of drug and alcohol use with a background of childhood neglect and early exposure to substance abuse deserved consideration, being a circumstance of considerable disadvantage to a young person. It was submitted that although the respondent’s drunken and aggressive state at the time of the offence did not excuse his conduct, nevertheless it was clear that the respondent’s capacity to make rational judgments was compromised and accordingly deserved some consideration when sentencing. The respondent’s background was further complicated by the fact that he had been diagnosed with an ADHD condition and had difficulty in sustaining long term relationships. 
     
      
    24 Counsel for the respondent stressed that this Court should accept the sentencing judge’s finding that the offences were properly characterised as an opportunistic outbreak of drunken violence rather than typical robbery offences. The respondent accepted that even if the guideline in Henry was not applicable it could not be argued that the s 98 offence, in particular, was other than inherently serious. The respondent also accepted that although total accumulation was not appropriate, a degree of concurrence was and that accordingly, it was necessary in resentencing to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence and determine the extent to which they should be made concurrent. 
     
      
    25 It was submitted that given the age and circumstances of the respondent, the nature and close relationship between the offences, the total sentence imposed was either within the available range, albeit at the lenient end of such a range, or sufficiently close to that point as to argue against intervention. 
     
      
    26 The respondent tendered evidence which indicates that he is making progress towards his rehabilitation. He has participated in a number of educational programs and is regularly employed within the prison system. The reports of his progress are encouraging.  
     
      
       
      The Crown submissions 
       
      
    27 The Crown submitted that apart from the errors acknowledged by the respondent his Honour also fell into error by placing too much weight on the respondent’s subjective features. It was submitted that the respondent’s reliance on Fernando in this appeal is misplaced. The respondent was not from an isolated Aboriginal community but has been raised in an urban environment with access to schooling and conventional social contact. Although his offending occurred when he was seriously affected by alcohol and drugs it was submitted that the fact that he is of Aboriginal origin was of little relevance. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    28 In my opinion not only were the errors identified by the Crown and accepted by the respondent present in the sentencing process there were other problems. His Honour failed to have regard to the fact that the respondent was on conditional liberty at the time of the offences. This was a seriously aggravating feature: see R v Vranic (NSWCCA, 7 May 1991, unreported); R v Jerrard (1991) 56 A Crim R 297. 
     
      
    29 I am satisfied that the sentencing judge should have carefully considered the Henry guideline. His reason for not doing so was said to be the objective circumstances of the offence. His Honour found that there was no planning but the offence was the result of a spontaneous act of hostility. However, the factual circumstances postulated by the Chief Justice in Henry at 380 included a “limited degree of planning”. The complete list reads: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Young offender with no or little criminal history. 
         
        2. Weapon, like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. 
         
        3. Limited degree of planning. 
         
        4. Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof. 
         
        5. Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver. 
         
        6. Small amount taken. 
         
        7. Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. 
        
       
      
    30 For a case with these features a range of between 4 and 5 years imprisonment for the full term was said to be appropriate. 
     
      
    31 In my opinion the present offences were worse than those contemplated in Henry. The respondent committed the offences in company and used actual violence towards Mr McDonald and Mr Delaney. He had a criminal history for assault and was on conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the offence. He used a weapon, namely a bottle, with which he struck Mr Delaney over the head several times. Although the respondent pleaded guilty the Crown case was strong, the respondent having been arrested shortly after the incident, following the activation of the panic button at the railway station. To my mind an appropriate discount for the plea was 15 percent. The sentencing judge described the offences as spontaneous acts of hostility with the consequence that they were committed with a limited degree of planning as was contemplated in the Henry guidelines. 
     
      
    32 The sentencing judge determined that the standard non-parole was an irrelevant consideration because of the respondent’s plea of guilty. This finding is inconsistent with the approach which the decision of this Court in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 requires in relation to offences with a standard non-parole period. Notwithstanding the plea of guilty the standard non-parole period serves as a benchmark or guide post and his Honour should have considered whether the circumstances present in this case place the relevant offence in the middle range of objective seriousness and if not, how they relate to the middle range. 
     
      
    33 Although a successful Crown appeal against sentence should be rare, when significant errors have occurred in the sentencing process resulting in a sentence which is manifestly inadequate this Court should intervene. Consistency of sentencing is of fundamental importance to community confidence in the criminal justice system and provided that the resentencing process is tempered by considerations of the additional burdens provided by increasing a sentence which has already been imposed, a sentence which is entirely inappropriate for the offences which have been committed should generally not be allowed to go uncorrected. 
     
      
    34 In the present case I am satisfied that the sentences which were imposed and, it must follow, the overall sentences were entirely outside the appropriate range and this Court must intervene. (see Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299; Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at paras 61 and 62). However, this Court should be mindful of the fact that the respondent is relatively young and increasing his sentence will impose significant burdens upon him. He was entitled to expect that he may be released on parole on 30 November this year and a further term of imprisonment will be a significant blow to him. He has made progress towards rehabilitation since being incarcerated and if possible that progress should be encouraged. 
     
      
    35 However, in my opinion both the robbery in company and the assault with intent to rob were serious offences. The assault with intent to rob with wounding was effected by physical blows and the use of a glass bottle which had a propensity to occasion very serious injury to the victim. Both victims were waiting at a railway station in the early hours of the morning. They were entitled to a safe passage. Instead they were set upon by two youths and brutally assaulted. Although the assaults occurred as part of the one sequence of offending, there were two victims and an identifiable distinct sentence is required for each offence. 
     
      
    36 The respondent will need a period of supervision upon his release if he is ever to take responsibility for his actions and become a mature member of the community. Paying appropriate regard to the respondent’s youth, difficulties in his upbringing and the fact that he was intoxicated at the time, but mindful of the fact that he was on conditional liberty and had a previous conviction for an offence of violence and his plea of guilty, in my opinion, the appropriate sentence in relation to the robbery in company was a term of imprisonment of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3½ years.  
     
      
    37 In relation to the offence of assault with intent to rob with wounding I am satisfied that, but for the respondent’s plea of guilty, this was a mid range offence to which the standard non-parole period would have been appropriate. However, in all the circumstances, including the guilty plea the appropriate sentence would have been one of 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. 
     
      
    38 In my opinion the sentences should have been partially concurrent. Although the offences were committed at approximately the same time there were two separate victims both of whom were seriously assaulted and put in fear. The overall term should have been 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.  
     
      
    39 Because this is a Crown appeal the sentences must be ameliorated. I propose sentences in respect of each offence which are substantially less than would otherwise be appropriate. Once sentenced the respondent expected that he would be released to parole on 30 November this year. As I have already said the imposition of further terms of imprisonment will be a heavy blow. Terms greater than I propose would be likely to crush the respondent and make his continuing rehabilitation difficult. I propose a fixed term in relation to count 1 and will provide for the sentence for count 2 to commence during the sentence for count 1. An extended period of parole is appropriate to assist the respondent in establishing himself as a mature and responsible member of the community. 
     
      
    40 In relation to the matter in the s 166 certificate, although the sentences were light, it is not necessary for this Court to intervene. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    41 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Sentences in relation to counts 1 and 2 quashed. 
       
      3. In relation to count 1 the respondent is sentenced to a fixed term of 18 months to date from 31 May 2006. 
       
      4. In relation to count 2 the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 31 May 2007 and expiring on 30 May 2009 with a further term of 2 years expiring on 30 May 2011. 
       
      5. Otherwise the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to two counts of break, enter and steal from a dwelling. The first offence was committed on 17 December 2005 and the second on the following day. They were committed at a shed and house on adjoining blocks of land which were owned by the same victim.  
     
      
    2 The offences were committed contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment comprising a non-parole of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 27 March 2006 and expiring on 26 June 2008 with a further term of 9 months expiring on 26 March 2009. 
     
      
    3 The sentencing judge recorded the relevant facts as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The circumstances giving rise to the commission of these offences are that between midnight on Saturday 17 December 2005 and 7.30 am on Sunday 18 December, the offender entered the shed at the rear of 32 Little Street Forster through the front doors which were previously closed and latched. Whilst inside he ransacked the property. He then stole a red coloured men’s mountain bike, leather fishing tackle bag and a plastic fishing tackle box, all of which contained fishing tackle, six fishing rods with reels, one fishing rod had a black fish rod with side cast reel, another a deep sea rod with overhead reel and the other fur were light rods with eggbeater reels. He took that property to an unknown location, with the value of the property being some fifteen hundred dollars. 
        
       
       
        
        Within the same timeframe, he entered the premises 34 Little Street Forster, which was on the same block of land. All entry points to this location were previously closed. The front door was not locked. Whilst inside the offender ransacked through property, placed an ice-cream maker, a juicer, 20 DVDS in a pack, electrical cords, a video machine, six books, a snakeskin diary cover and power board into a black coloured Samonsite travel bag and left it at the location. 
        
       
       
        
        He put on a red cap and black coloured t-shirt with ‘Jubilee 2000’ written on it, took a hand painted six foot eight inch surfboard, left that at an unknown location. All of the mentioned property, including the clothing and bag, belonged to the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 8.30 am on 18 December, the offender returned to the house at 34 Little Street and took the black coloured Samsonite travel bag containing the property that has been referred to and a Scrabble board and walked outside. The victim, Mr Rinkin, stopped the offender. The offender dropped the black coloured Samsonite travel bag and Scrabble board and ran south along Little Street. Chase was given and ultimately when the offender decamped, the victim alerted police and the offender was located within the streets of Forster.” 
        
       
      
    4 The applicant has a significant criminal record. He was born on 30 May 1953 and was convicted for the first time in the Children’s Court on 16 February 1968 for illegally using a motor vehicle, being an unlicensed rider and negligent driving. At the same time he was convicted of stealing from a dwelling and receiving stolen property. A year later he was convicted of stealing and on 10 March 1970 he was committed to a boys’ home for assault and robbery. 
     
      
    5 In Brisbane in 1971 he was convicted of stealing with actual violence and placed on a two year bond. Thereafter, during the 1970s, he was convicted of stealing, offensive behaviour, various traffic matters, selling Indian hemp, resisting arrest, unseemly words and various assault convictions. He then experienced a period when he did not receive a conviction but in 1980 was sentenced to 12 months periodic detention for supplying Indian hemp. During the 1980s he received convictions for assault, high range PCA, resist arrest, offensive behaviour, goods in custody, stealing motor vehicle, traffic offences and larceny. 
     
      
    6 In October 1990 the applicant was convicted of a mid-range PCA offence and driving whilst disqualified. In 1991 he was convicted of assault and in 1993 of assault, malicious injury, stealing and two counts of break, enter and stealing. 
     
      
    7 In October 1993 he was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months for robbery and to 3 years for robbery when armed. In December 1998 he was again sentenced for assaulting a person, malicious damage to property, assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty and resisting an officer in the execution of his duty. He was also convicted in June 1998 for threatening to destroy property, injuring another, resisting an officer in the execution of his duty and refusing to submit to breath analysis. He received further convictions in 2000 for various traffic matters. In 2002 for larceny and various other offences. 
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge concluded that drugs and alcohol have been “a big issue” in the applicant’s life. At the sentencing hearing the applicant gave evidence of attempts he had made when on parole to receive treatment for his problems. The applicant told the sentencing judge that he admitted that his conduct ”was not good enough” and that he had “to get professional help” and “stop drinking now.” The applicant told the sentencing judge that he had sought assistance from the Drug and Alcohol Service at Forster. The applicant also gave evidence that shortly prior to the offence his motorised home had been destroyed and that he had been kicked in the head on the street. He said these events contributed to his offending. 
     
      
    9 His Honour was not impressed by the applicant as a witness. On the first day of hearing on 13 June 2006 his Honour made it apparent that he would not accept the applicant’s evidence unless it was corroborated. A request was also made for his Honour to grant the applicant bail so he could attend a centre for treatment. His Honour declined this application, making it plain that he did not accept the applicant’s evidence as being reliable. 
     
      
    10 Notwithstanding his Honour’s preliminary view he provided the applicant with an opportunity to bring further evidence to corroborate the evidence he had already given. He did this for the purpose of considering whether or not the applicant should have the benefit of a finding of special circumstances which may have shortened his non-parole period. 
     
      
    11 The matter was stood over to Thursday, 15 June 2006. On that occasion no evidence was tendered or adduced. His Honour repeated a reference to the applicant’s criminal history and said that he had difficulty in accepting his evidence except for the admission of drug and alcohol problems. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept that drugs and alcohol have been a big issue in the offender’s life. The offender has given evidence of progress being made on Probation and Parole and receiving treatment at the Taree hospital. I must say I find most of the offender’s evidence not credible and I am not prepared to accept it unless it is corroborated, except for the fact that he has had significant alcohol and drug issues in his life.” 
        
       
      
    12 Evidence has been tendered to this Court, without objection from the Crown, which confirms much of the detail of the matters related in evidence before the sentencing judge. It was submitted, as a result of this evidence that this Court should conclude that the sentencing proceedings miscarried. It was submitted that the evidence which is now available confirms the applicant’s mental health problems which should have resulted in his Honour placing less importance in matters of deterrence leading to a reduction in the head sentence. It was further submitted that the further evidence confirms that the applicant has now confronted his problems and recognised the need for assistance to remove his dependence on alcohol and drugs, which would justify the finding of special circumstances. It was submitted that the applicant’s position before the sentencing judge was seriously compromised by the lack of diligence of his representatives in bringing forward the evidence which his Honour sought which was available to corroborate the applicant (see R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677). 
     
      
    13 The evidence which is before this Court confirmed that the applicant attended the Drug and Alcohol Service at Forster for assessment on 4 November 2005. However, he did not attend a further appointment made for 11 November 2005. This would seem to have been due to the fact that he had been assessed after arriving at Manning Base Hospital on a schedule. He was seen by the Drug and Alcohol Service in Forster again on 28 November 2005 and on 7 December 2005 was seen in Taree by the Drug and Alcohol intake worker at Taree. The applicant later attended a further appointment on 14 December 2005. 
     
      
    14 A further appointment was made for the applicant on 5 January 2006. However, he could not keep this appointment because he had been taken into custody in relation to the present offences. 
     
      
    15 Evidence was also tendered to this Court which confirmed that the applicant had been taken to Manning Base Hospital on 10 November 2005 where the presenting problem was recorded as a possible psychotic episode. The principle diagnosis is recorded as being “antisocial personality disorder” with a secondary diagnosis of “alcohol abuse.” A medical report as to the applicant’s state was completed by a doctor who described the applicant as “mentally ill.” 
     
      
    16 There is other evidence which confirms the fact that the applicant suffered a psychotic episode in late November and continued to have relating health problems in December 2005. The applicant accepts that he was mentally ill, a homeless person with a significant alcohol problem when he committed these offences. 
     
      
    17 In R v Munro [2006] NSWCCA 350 this Court considered the circumstances of an applicant who had pleaded guilty to a count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. At the sentencing hearing the judge endeavoured to draw the applicant’s counsel’s attention to the need for proper evidence to ensure that a just sentence could be imposed. The decision of this Court indicates that counsel failed to appreciate the concerns of the sentencing judge and lacked an appreciation of the relevant principles. The court concluded that the proceedings had miscarried, quashed the sentence and returned the matter to the District Court for resentencing. 
     
      
    18 The applicant submitted that by reason of the failure to provide the sentencing judge with evidence which his Honour had sought and which was available, the applicant’s sentencing hearing miscarried. It was submitted that this Court should take the same course as that taken in Munro and remit the matter to the District Court. 
     
      
    19 I am satisfied that the sentencing hearing miscarried. It is plain that his Honour was concerned as to whether the applicant was entitled to a finding of special circumstances to enable an extended period of supervised release to assist in his rehabilitation. The evidence which his Honour sought by way of corroboration of the applicant’s account of the relevant events was available and would have confirmed that the applicant was telling the truth. It must be concluded that the failure to bring this evidence was a consequence of a lack of diligence by his representatives. In these circumstances I am satisfied this Court should intervene and quash the sentence which was imposed. 
     
      
    20 I have considered whether this Court should proceed to resentence or whether the matter should be remitted to the District Court. If it was remitted it would be likely that the rehearing would be delayed for a period of time. The applicant is presently due for release in June next year with the consequence that if the matter was remitted to the District Court the opportunity to reduce the applicant’s sentence would be confined. In these circumstances, in my view, this Court should proceed to resentence having regard to the evidence which is presently available. 
     
      
    21 The applicant has a lengthy criminal history which it may be assumed has been contributed to by his drug and alcohol problems. If he is ever to rehabilitate himself he will require a significant period of treatment and an opportunity for a period of supervised release into the community where facilities are available to allow him to establish a life free of drug and alcohol problems minimising the risk of him reoffending. He will also need treatment for his psychosis and an opportunity to access appropriate medical, counselling and other services. 
     
      
    22 The evidence now before this Court establishes that before committing the present offences the applicant had come at least to a limited recognition of his problems. He had voluntarily taken steps to obtain treatment, which was interrupted by a supervening psychotic event, followed by his offending. In these circumstances I am satisfied that if the evidence before this Court had been available to the sentencing court a finding of special circumstances would have been made and the applicant provided with an extended period of parole. However, the nature of his offences and his appalling history of reoffending would, in my opinion, have only resulted in a modest reduction in his non-parole period. The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal and uphold the appeal. 
       
      2. The sentence imposed on 15 June 2006 be quashed. The applicant resentenced as follows: 
       
        
        a. On the first count the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 27 March 2006 and to expire on 26 March 2008 and to a further term of twelve months to commence on 27 March 2008 and expire on 26 March 2009; 
        
       
       
        
        b. In relation to the second count the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 27 March 2006 and to expire on 26 March 2008 and to a further term of twelve months to commence on 27 March 2008 and expire on 26 March 2009.

    2 GROVE J: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    3 SIMPSON J: In April and May 2006 the applicant was tried in the District Court on an indictment containing a single count of supplying a prohibited drug, heroin. On 8 May 2006 the jury returned a verdict of guilty. On 15 September 2006 he was sentenced by Ainslie-Wallace DCJ to imprisonment for 5½ years, made up of a non-parole period of 3½ years and a balance of term of 2 years, commencing on 8 May 2006, the date of verdict. The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. He does not appeal against the conviction.  
     
      
    4 Although two grounds of the application are pleaded, they essentially raise a single issue: parity of sentencing. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    5 The offence was committed between 4 March and 14 May of 2004 around the south-eastern suburbs of Sydney. The applicant was part of an enterprise that involved two co-offenders, Macaliuaki Falemaka and Siobhan Langbien. Put shortly, the two male offenders (the applicant and Falemaka) supplied quantities of heroin to Langbien, who, in turn, supplied the drug to consumers, operating from her home address. She was required to, and did, account to the applicant and Falemaka for the proceeds of the sales.  
     
      
    6 Falemaka and Langbien each pleaded guilty to a similar offence. Langbien was sentenced on 6 October 2005 by Donovan DCJ to a total period of 12 months’ imprisonment, made up of a non-parole period of six months and a balance of term of six months to be served by way of periodic detention. No issue of parity in relation to this sentence has been raised by the applicant. Although she was well aware of the sentence, Ainslie-Wallace DCJ rejected it as one to which she should have regard in sentencing the applicant, stating that she considered that it inadequately reflected the objective gravity of Langbien’s crime. 
     
      
    7 Falemaka was also sentenced by Ainslie-Wallace DCJ, on the same day as the applicant. The sentence imposed on him was of a total term of imprisonment for 4 years and 5 months (53 months), made up of a non-parole period of 3 years (36 months), and a balance of term of 1 year and 5 months (17 months). (Stated in months, the sentence imposed on the applicant was of a total term of 66 months, with a non-parole period of 42 months and a balance of term of 24 months.) A reading of the Remarks on Sentence in each of the two cases reveals that there was little, if anything, to distinguish the two offenders in terms of subjective circumstances. The only basis for the discrepancy in sentence was Falemaka’s plea of guilty, by reason of which he was given a reduction, in accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, of 20 percent.  
     
      
    8 The sentence imposed on the applicant was, when regard is had to Falemaka’s plea of guilty (and the quantification of the discount therefor at 20 percent) comparable with that imposed on Falemaka. That said, the comparison is not precise. If the 20 percent discount is (mathematically precisely) factored back into Falemaka’s sentence, the starting point would have been: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Total term 
         66.25 months 
         
         
         Non-parole period 
         45 months 
         
         
         Balance of term 
         21.25 months 
         
        
       
       
      Quite obviously, what her Honour did was to start with a total term of 5½ years (66 months); apply a reduction of about (in fact a little over) 20 percent, yielding the 53 months’ total term; and divide that sentence into the non-parole period and balance of term. (It is implicit in the result that she found, pursuant to s 44(2) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      , special circumstances justifying departure form the ratio there stated.) 
       
      
    9 Had her Honour applied an exact mathematical formula to sentencing the applicant by reference to Falemaka’s sentence, she would have sentenced him to a non-parole period of 45 months, a balance of term of 21.25 months, and a total term of 66.25 months. Instead, she sentenced him to a non-parole period of 42 months (a variation slightly in his favour), a balance of term of 24 months (slightly longer than Falemaka’s starting point) and a total term of 66 months (almost precisely Falemaka’s starting point). The variations, such as they are, are to the applicant’s advantage. In my opinion, the sentences show that her Honour intended to, and did treat the two equally before giving appropriate recognition to Falemaka’s plea of guilty. 
     
      
    10 In sentencing Falemaka her Honour expressly held that his criminality was “roughly on a par with” that of the applicant; she added that the telephone calls involving Falemaka were more extensive and the amount of heroin supplied by him greater than that supplied by the applicant. She did not explicitly make a similar finding in the separate sentencing remarks in the applicant’s case; but since she sentenced the two on the same day, it is appropriate to read the two Remarks on Sentence together. 
     
      
    11 The evidence against the offenders was very largely derived from intercepts of voluminous telephone calls between the three offenders. The evidence established that Falemaka had actually supplied 96 grams of heroin; the evidence against the applicant established that he had actually supplied 25.6 grams.  
     
      
    12 Because of this, the first ground of the application pleads that her Honour was in error in finding that the criminality of the two was “roughly on par”. It followed that, in imposing sentences which, except for the reduction in Falemaka’s sentence by reason of his plea of guilty, were comparable, her Honour failed to apply well known principles concerning parity of sentencing. 
     
      
    13 There are two aspects to the attack made on the basis upon which her Honour adopted the course that she did. The first is what can be gleaned from the very extensive transcript of telephone intercepts, resulting in the observation in the remarks on sentencing of Falemaka, that the telephone calls involving him were more extensive; the second that, by reason of the relative quantities of heroin shown to have been actually supplied by the two offenders, the applicant was entitled to a lower sentence. It was contended that the finding of equality was not, on the evidence, reasonably open. 
     
      
    14 On the hearing of the application, counsel who appeared for the applicant pointed to some evidence given by Falemaka, in which he accepted that it was he who determined the commissions to be paid to Langbien and determined the payment arrangements. It was put to him by the Crown Prosecutor that “on scale of hierarchy” he held a higher position than the applicant. He replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would seem that way. The only reason I took responsibility for collecting the money was because I was the one getting it off from the other person.” 
        
       
      
    15 Later, in submissions, the Crown Prosecutor stated that the Crown agreed that the applicant was “on a lower level than Falemaka”. This, he said, was derived from the telephone intercepts. 
     
      
    16 In her Remarks on Sentence in Falemaka’s case her Honour held: 
     
      
       
        
        “I find that the offender’s role was akin to being a manager of the supply, and communicated with others higher up the supply chain than Langbien.” 
        
       
      
    17 There was no comparable finding (with respect to a managerial role) in the sentencing of the applicant. 
     
      
    18 I am not satisfied that the mere fact that the telephone records involving one offender are “more extensive” than another of itself establishes greater criminality. So far as can be ascertained, each participated in the management and organisation of the business, in supplying Langbien, and in ensuring that she accounted properly for the proceeds. Falemaka’s answer extracted above is insufficient to establish that the applicant played a lesser role in the overall enterprise than Falemaka. 
     
      
    19 That leaves the question whether the considerably greater quantity of heroin shown to have been supplied by Falemaka mandated a differential approach in sentencing. The difference in quantity is considerable; as her Honour observed, the 96 grams attributed to Falemaka is 32 times the trafficable quantity, which is 3 grams; the 25.6 grams attributed to the applicant is about 8 times the trafficable quantity. 
     
      
    20 That may be a relevant consideration in some circumstances, for example, where two offenders are engaged in independent enterprises and transactions. However, in the circumstances of this case it is of no moment. The fact is that Falemaka and the applicant were partners in the enterprise; it is of no consequence at all that the physical act of supplying was in one case greater than in the other. The truth is, given the way this enterprise operated, each is responsible for the supply of the entire amount.  
     
      
    21 Accordingly, no error is shown in the decision of the sentencing judge to treat the two comparably other than in recognising, appropriately, Falemaka’s plea of guilty. 
     
      
    22 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

     HEADNOTE 
     
     
      
    FactsHans Hoch, a 60 year old man, who resided in a public housing block, was discovered dead in his unit on 17 July 2002, having been severely battered, sustaining injuries to his face, head and the trunk of his body. The injuries of the deceased were suggestive of being kicked or stomped on, in addition to being attacked with pots and pans. On 21 October 2004, the appellant was convicted by a jury of murder and was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 18 years. 
     
      
    The Crown relied upon six specific circumstantial factors supporting the case that the appellant had murdered the deceased. First, there was the association between the appellant and the deceased. Next, there was no forced entry into the deceased’s unit and there was evidence of the appellant’s presence in the vicinity during the period in which the deceased was killed. In addition to that, the appellant’s bag was found in the unit. The Crown further relied upon the appellant’s obvious limp, as observed by a number of people on the afternoon of Tuesday 16 July and as observed by police and medical staff on 18 July, when he was first arrested. Finally, there was the deceased’s blood on the appellant’s clothing.  
     
      
    Following the appellant’s arrest, psychiatrists had seen him on multiple occasions at the Metropolitan Remand Centre whilst awaiting trial. The appellant had been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia and prescribed anti-psychotic medication, but had stopped taking the medication. On 20 March 2003, the appellant was assessed by a psychiatrist as being fit for trial. Evidence as to the appellant’s mental state and in particular that he did not understand the nature of his illness and thus may not have been able to make a proper defence to the charge was first adduced at the sentencing hearing. That evidence was confirmed by further evidence given on the appeal; there was also evidence that the appellant’s fitness for trial could have dramatically changed before the beginning of the trial. 
     
      
    The appellant appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence. On the appeal against conviction, the appellant raised two grounds. First, that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable, having regard to the evidence (Ground 1). Alternatively, that on the evidence presented at trial and the evidence currently available, there was a question raised as to whether the appellant was fit to stand trial (Ground 2). Held per Beazley JA (James and Hidden JJ agreeing):On the issue that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable (Ground 1)(1) In a case where the prosecution is relying on circumstantial evidence, the jury’s assessment of the evidence has to be considered in its totality and it is not permissible to consider the evidence piecemeal: [30]

    (2) There was a significant body of circumstantial evidence that pointed to the appellant as the assailant. Although alternative explanations were available in respect of some, at least, of the evidence, the jury was entitled to find that one piece of evidence resolved their doubts as to another. The appellant had not established that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and accordingly, Ground 1 should be rejected: [49]-[50]

    On the issue whether the appellant was fit to stand trial (Ground 2)(3) In determining the question of unfitness to be tried, the emphasis is on the capacity of the accused to understand the proceedings at trial so as to be able to make a proper defence: [65]

         [2007] NSWCCA 70 (followed) 
        
       
      
    (4) The medical evidence at sentence and on appeal raised a question of the appellant’s unfitness to be tried, in particular, in respect of his ability to make a proper defence to the charge. On the state of the evidence at the time of the appeal a question of unfitness to be tried arose: [80]

        Kirkwood v Regina  
        [2006] NSWCCA 181 (applied) 
        
       
      
    (5) It followed that the conviction must be quashed and a new trial ordered. It is irrelevant that the appellant may, on a retrial, be found to be fit, or even that a question of unfitness might, at that stage, not arise: [81]

     Leave to appeal against sentence 
      
     (6) Given the conclusion regarding the appellant’s unfitness to be tried, it is not necessary to deal with the application for leave to appeal against sentence: [82]

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 21 October 2004, the appellant was convicted by a jury of the murder of Hans Hoch at Surry Hills on 16 July 2002. Following conviction, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 18 years to date from 29 October 2002 and to expire on 28 October 2020. The trial judge, Studdert J, was not satisfied there were special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). His Honour imposed a minimum term of 14 years to date from 29 October 2002 and to expire on 28 October 2016. 
     
      
    2 The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence. On the appeal against conviction, the appellant raises two grounds. First, he contends that the verdict of the jury is unreasonable, having regard to the evidence (Ground 1). Alternatively, he contends that on the evidence presented at trial and the evidence currently available, there is a question raised as to whether the appellant was fit to stand trial (Ground 2). Ground 2 involves consideration of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (NSW) (the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act).  
     
      
       
      Background facts 
       
      
    3 The murder victim, Hans Hoch, was discovered dead in his rented unit in a block of flats (Northcott) under the administration of the Department of Housing. The deceased had been severely battered, having sustained injuries to his face, head and the trunk of his body. The most severe injuries were a fracture of the larynx, multiple rib fractures, a laceration or tear in the left lobe of the liver and bruising within the scalp, particularly in the right side of the head, with bruising in each muscle above the ears. The deceased was a 60 year old man of slight build, weighing about 52 kg and was 167cm tall. He lived alone in the unit, although it was frequented by other residents in the housing block, in circumstances where the deceased had set up a “consulting room” in one of the bedrooms of the unit and residents knew him as “Dr Hoch”. He did not, however, have any medical qualifications. 
     
      
    4 The deceased’s body was found at about 2.30pm on 17 July 2002, by a Department of Housing Officer, Jane Sun. Ms Sun attended the unit in company with another Department of Housing officer, after having been advised by Mark Skerry, another resident, that a door of the deceased’s unit was open and that he, Mr Skerry, had not seen the deceased for a couple of hours. Ms Sun gave evidence that she had been on her way to visit Mr Skerry in his unit when she came upon him doing his washing in the common area laundry. When they spoke, he informed her of the door of the deceased’s unit being open.  
     
      
    5 When Ms Sun and the other Departmental officer went to the deceased’s unit, the door was open. At this point, another resident came up to Ms Sun and told her that it had been “like this for a couple [sic] of days now”. Ms Sun knocked and called out and when there was no response, entered the unit. She observed a set of keys on the table, a walking stick on the floor and the television on in the first bedroom. She then observed the bruised and bloody head of a person lying on the floor of the second bedroom. She said that she could see this from the hallway about four metres away from where the deceased’s body lay. She said this was about a metre to two metres away from the doorway to the second bedroom.  
     
      
    6 Mr Skerry’s evidence as to when he first observed anything amiss varied throughout the course of his evidence and cross-examination. He first said that he had last seen the deceased between 12.30 and 1.00pm on Tuesday 16 July in the company of the appellant. They were drinking cask wine. In cross-examination, he said that he had gone to the unit between 10.30 and 11.45am. He again said that the deceased was there with the appellant and that they were drinking wine. He conceded that it was possible that the last time he saw the deceased may have been the previous Wednesday, 10 July. Mr Skerry was away from his unit between 5pm 16 July until dawn the following morning. 
     
      
    7 In his evidence-in-chief, Mr Skerry said that he went to the deceased’s unit between 11am and 12.30pm on Wednesday 17 July and walked around the unit through the lounge room to the first bedroom. He observed the deceased’s cane lying on the ground and broken glass lying nearby. He said he noticed a wine cask and backpack on the table and a mattress on the floor. He also observed a “scattering” of a wallet on the floor. This indicated to Mr Skerry that “something was seriously wrong”. He said he then “took off”.  
     
      
    8 Mr Skerry said that although he stopped just outside the bedroom door, he did not see the deceased’s body lying on the floor or the bloodstained wall. Later in his evidence, Mr Skerry said that he entered the unit twice on 17 July, the first being shortly after 6am when he returned to the apartment block and the second time between 11am and 12.30pm. On the second occasion that Mr Skerry entered the unit, he saw the contents of the wallet on the floor. Again, in his evidence, Mr Skerry said that he was mistaken when he said that he first entered the unit at 6am and said that he actually first entered the unit shortly after 10am. His evidence was also confused as to whether he entered the unit once or twice.  
     
      
    9 The police attended at the unit at about 3pm on 17 July. When they entered the unit, they observed the walking stick on the floor and broken glass in the kitchen and entry area. There was a large spatter of blood about 10-15cm in diameter on the western wall of the entry area about 6 inches from the ground. They observed the deceased’s body in the bedroom. There was a significant amount of blood on his head, face, mouth and chin.  
     
      
    10 The deceased’s body was subsequently examined by Dr Allan Cala, who considered that death had occurred sometime between 2pm on 16 July and 8am on 17 July 2002. In cross-examination, Dr Cala said that 2pm 16 July 2002 “was not the outside of his calculation”. He considered that death might have occurred even earlier than that. The reason for Dr Cala’s imprecision was due to an absence of knowledge of the room temperature in the unit from the time of actual death to the time he examined the body. He said that the core temperature of the deceased at the time of his examination at about 8pm on 17 July was 16 degrees and that the room temperature at that time was 16 degrees. He explained that the temperature of any deceased’s body will decrease to the lowest temperature available to it. He said that it was unknown how long the body had been at 16 degrees and how long the temperature in the unit had been at 16 degrees. He said that there was no evidence of heating in the unit.  
     
      
    11 The appellant was acquainted with the deceased and in fact had been staying at the deceased’s unit for a short period up until 15 July. There had been a disagreement between the deceased and the appellant on the evening of 15 July and the deceased had called the police, informing them that he wanted the appellant to leave. The police attended the unit and after some discussion with the appellant, he left, after collecting some of his belongings and placing them into a small black Targus bag, which he took with him.  
     
      
    12 Apart from occasionally staying with the deceased, the appellant shared a room with Tapiwa Shumba in rental premises in Cleveland Street, Surry Hills, about half an hour’s walk from the deceased’s unit. Mr Shumba said that the appellant returned to the room they shared between 12 noon and 1pm on 16 July. He said that the appellant had been away for two to three days prior to that, having told Mr Shumba that he was visiting a friend, “Hans”. When the appellant returned to the flat, Mr Shumba said that he was limping. The appellant explained this by saying that he had been “hit by a car on the way back home”. Mr Shumba also observed that the appellant did not have his black bag with him on this occasion. The appellant told him that he may have left it in a park, or at the Evening Star Hotel or, “probably” at the deceased’s unit.  
     
      
    13 The appellant also explained to Mr Shumba that he had had an argument with Hans and that the police had thrown him out of the apartment. The appellant asked Mr Shumba to help him find the bag and they went to the Northcott building. When they arrived, they observed several police paddy wagons in the parking area. This apparently caused the appellant some consternation and he told Mr Shumba that “Hans called the cops on” him. The appellant and Mr Shumba found an alternate entrance to the building and spoke to a friend of the appellant, Audrey. They then left the building via a fire exit and returned to their room in Cleveland Street, Surry Hills. They again left the room at around 6pm on 16 July and remained together until about 10.30pm, when they left the Evening Star Hotel together. Mr Shumba said he went home and that the appellant tagged along “just halfway” and that he did not know the appellant’s whereabouts after that. 
     
      
    14 Mr Shumba’s evidence varied as to what happened after that. In his evidence-in-chief, he gave the version to which I have just referred. However, he was cross-examined on a statement that he had made to police shortly after the appellant’s arrest. He confirmed that the contents of that statement, in which he said that after leaving the Evening Star Hotel, the appellant went back to the unit and he, Mr Shumba, went to Oxford Street to do a night job that he then had and that the next time he saw the appellant was at about 8.35am the following morning, that is, 17 July.  
     
      
       
      Sightings of the appellant on 16 and 17 July 2002 
       
      
    15 The accommodation in which the appellant was living with Mr Shumba in July, was a shared residence, including a single shared kitchen and bathroom facilities. One of the residents, Peter Brooks, saw the appellant at about 2pm on Tuesday 16 July in the kitchen. He was limping, and having asked the appellant what had happened, the appellant had told Mr Brooks that he thought his leg was “broken or fractured” and that something had happened “up the road or something”, when he had tried to intervene when he saw a young girl being bashed. The appellant said he had been pushed against a car and that two bouncers had also intervened, given him $20 to get a taxi and told him “they would handle the situation”. Mr Brooks also observed a small scratch on the appellant’s head. At the time, the appellant was wearing grey tracksuit pants, a t-shirt and sneakers, which was the clothing which Mr Brooks described as being what the appellant “always wore”. 
     
      
    16 Another resident, Rosemary McKenzie, said that she saw the appellant at about lunchtime after 12 noon, on 16 July in Bourke Street, Surry Hills. Ms McKenzie didn’t notice anything unusual in the manner in which the appellant was walking. Ms McKenzie also gave evidence of sighting the appellant on Wednesday 17 July. In her evidence-in-chief, she said that she saw the appellant between 4 and 5pm on that day, walking by himself at Northcott. She again said that she did not observe anything unusual about the way he was walking on this occasion. However, in cross-examination, she said that she was nowhere near Northcott on Wednesday 17 July and didn’t see the appellant. 
     
      
    17 Another resident of the Cleveland Street share house, Leslie McKenzie, saw the appellant on a Tuesday or Wednesday in July 2002 and observed him to be limping. Mr McKenzie enquired about that and the appellant said, “Don’t ask”.  
     
      
    18 There was no doubt that the appellant had sustained an injury to his leg and his head. Shortly after his arrest on 18 July, the police arranged for the appellant to have medical attention because he appeared to be suffering pain and seizures. The attending ambulance officer, Sally Quinn, said that when she first spoke with the appellant at the police station, he told her that he had left leg pain in the upper thigh and groin. He denied that he had sustained any trauma and said that he was “detoxing” and was suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting. Ms Quinn thought that the appellant may have had a slight limp and that he appeared to wince as he climbed into the ambulance.  
     
      
    19 The appellant was seen by Dr Christopher Gregory at Sydney Hospital Emergency Department. The appellant complained to Dr Gregory of a painful left thigh, but the triage notes recorded a complaint of abdominal pain. Dr Gregory took a history of “thigh pain for some days” and also noted a bruise to the left thigh. Dr Gregory recorded in his notes that the appellant was reticent or reluctant to tell him how he had bruised his thigh.  
     
      
       
      Forensic examination of the deceased’s unit 
       
      
    20 The police examination of the deceased’s unit revealed that there had been no sign of any forced entry into the unit. The appellant’s black Targus bag containing clothing, valium tablets and a set of keys, including one that fitted the front door of the unit, was located in the lounge room. The appellant’s wallet was located under a cushion of a lounge chair. A metal attachment for a cooking pot handle and two buttons were found in the hallway. There were two buttons missing from the deceased’s shirt and the buttons found in the hallway matched those remaining on the deceased’s shirt. There was no disturbance to the bathroom or the main bedroom, which was set up as an office. A metal cooking pot without a handle lay at the entrance to the second bedroom, together with a number of personal papers and cards in the deceased’s name. Another metal cooking pot, a frypan and other items were found on the bed in the second bedroom. In the corner of that room there was some bloodstained grey material and toilet paper and the carpet in the corner was very wet with what appeared to be water. A black plastic handle of a cooking pot and a metal screw were located on the bedroom floor. This handle appeared to have come from a cooking pot found at the entrance to the bedroom. Detective Sergeant David Neal, who undertook the forensic examination of the unit, considered that a struggle had taken place in this bedroom. 
     
      
    21 The deceased’s body itself was lying on its side, facing towards the bedroom door. There was a large amount of blood on the carpet around the deceased’s head and blood had run down the deceased’s face. His back was wet and the wetness had a strong smell of alcohol. Detective Neal formed the view that, having regard to the blood on the deceased’s face and the lividity which had settled on the deceased’s back and right side, the deceased had not been moved post death. Detective Neal was not able to say whether the extent of the bloodstain around the deceased’s head was due solely to having oozed from the wound, or whether it had been spread around, for example, by somebody’s feet as they walked in that area. Detective Neal observed that the carpet was very cheap, so that the blood would easily soak in. He did not find any pattern or any type of shoe print in that area.  
     
      
    22 There was blood smeared on the bedcover, which was consistent with transference, rather than a spatter. There was a spattering of blood on the walls in various parts of the unit. The first spatter was observed on the western wall of the lounge room, close to the ground. Detective Neal considered that that blood had been aspirated from either the mouth or nose of the victim lying on the floor facing that wall. There were also several drops of blood on the carpet in that area. There were smears of blood on each of the walls in the second bedroom. Although described as “smears” in his evidence-in-chief, Detective Neal said in cross-examination that the blood on the walls in the bedroom was more consistent with a “spatter” than a “smear”. He said that, from the spatter, it appeared that the deceased had been in different areas of the room when the blood was spattered onto the wall. 
     
      
    23 A fingerprint examination of the scene revealed fingerprints of the deceased and the appellant, as well as a number of unidentified prints. The appellant’s fingerprints were found inside the front door and outside a kitchen cupboard, as well as two prints on a glass with liquid in it found in the kitchen sink. The fingerprint identification was not able to establish how long the fingerprints had been laid down, although it was said that they appeared to be “strong”.  
     
      
    24 Forensic examination of the appellant’s clothing revealed that the deceased’s DNA was located on the appellant’s polo shirt and tracksuit pants. The stain on the appellant’s tracksuit pants was not visible to the naked eye. There were two areas on the polo shirt where blood stains were located. Two spots of blood were found on the left sleeve at the shoulder of the polo shirt. An initial test confirmed that that stain was human blood. A second area on the neckline of the polo shirt beside one of the button holes also tested positive for blood, although no test was conducted to determine whether it was human blood.  
     
      
    25 Of the two samples of blood found on the sleeve of the polo shirt, only one was submitted for DNA analysis and the other one was stored. The result of the DNA analysis of the spot on the tracksuit and the spot on the polo shirt revealed that the DNA recovered had the same profile as the deceased. The analyst who carried out the DNA analysis, Sharon Neville, said that she did not believe that the blood found on the polo shirt was likely to have survived a clothes wash.  
     
      
    26 The deceased’s DNA evidence was also found on the base and handle of the frypan, on the base of the cooking pot and on the base of the smaller saucepan.  
     
      
    27 The deceased’s blood analysis indicated a blood alcohol reading of 0.12 per 100ml of blood. 
     
      
       
      First ground of appeal: that the verdict of guilty is unreasonable 
       
      
    28 Before turning to the arguments raised by senior counsel for the appellant, by which he sought to establish that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable, it is convenient to consider the principles which govern a case based upon circumstantial evidence, as was the position here. These principles are not new. They were stated by Dixon J in Martin v Osborne (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 375; [1936] HCA 23 and again by his Honour as Chief Justice in Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 243; [1963] HCA 44.  
     
      
    29 The principle was summarised briefly in R v Hillier (2007) 81 ALJR 886; [2007] HCA 13 in the joint judgment of Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ, with which the Chief Justice agreed. At [46], their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The case against Mr Hillier was a circumstantial case. It has often been said that a jury cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on circumstantial evidence unless no other explanation than guilt is reasonably compatible with the circumstances: see, for example,  
        Martin v Osborne  
        (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 375;  
        Plomp v The Queen  
        (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 243 per Dixon CJ. It is of critical importance to recognise, however, that in considering a circumstantial case, all of the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence:  
        Shepherd v The Queen  
        (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 579 per Dawson J.” 
        
       
      
    30 Their Honours pointed out that the jury’s assessment of the evidence has to be considered in its totality and it is not permissible to consider the evidence piecemeal. In this regard, their Honours referred to the statement in Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] (1984) 153 CLR 521; [1984] HCA 7 where Gibbs CJ and Mason J said at 535: 
     
      
       
        
        “At the end of the trial the jury must consider all the evidence, and in doing so they may find that one piece of evidence resolves their doubts as to another. For example, the jury, considering the evidence of one witness by itself, may doubt whether it is truthful, but other evidence may provide corroboration, and when the jury considers the evidence as a whole they may decide that the witness should be believed. Again, the quality of evidence of identification may be poor, but other evidence may support its correctness; in such a case the jury should not be told to look at the evidence of each witness 'separately in, so to speak, a hermetically sealed compartment'; they should consider the accumulation of the evidence: cf  
        Weeder v The Queen  
        (1980) 71 Cr App R 228 at 231.  
         
         
        Similarly, in a case depending on circumstantial evidence, the jury should not reject one circumstance because, considered alone, no inference of guilt can be drawn from it. It is well established that the jury must consider 'the weight which is to be given to the united force of all the circumstances put together': per Lord Cairns, in  
        Belhaven and Stenton Peerage  
        (1875) 1 App Cas 278 at 279, cited in  
        Reg v Van Beelen  
        (1973) 4 SASR 353 at 373; and see  
        Thomas v The Queen  
        [1972] NZLR 34 at 37-38, 40 and cases there cited.""  
        
       
      
    31 In Plomp, Dixon CJ, in dealing with an argument that motives of the accused could not be taken into account until it was otherwise shown by evidence that in some physical way, the accused’s actions were responsible for the accused’s wife’s death, said that there was no legal doctrine to that effect. Rather, he said at 242: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        All 
         the circumstances of the case must be weighed in judging whether there is evidence upon which a jury may reasonably be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the commission of the crime charged. There may be many cases where it is extremely dangerous to rely heavily on the existence of a motive, where an unexplained death or disappearance of a person is not otherwise proved to be attributable to the accused; but all such considerations must be dealt with on the facts of the particular case.  
        I cannot think, however, that in a case where the prosecution is based on circumstantial evidence any part of the circumstances can be put on one side as relating to motive only and therefore not to be weighed as part of the proofs of what was done. 
        "" (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    32 In his closing address to the jury, the Crown relied on six specific circumstantial factors supporting the case that the appellant had murdered the deceased. First, there was the association between the appellant and the deceased. Next, there was no forced entry into the deceased’s unit and there was evidence of the appellant’s presence in the vicinity during the period in which the deceased was killed and, therefore, opportunity to commit the crime. In addition to that, the appellant’s bag was found in the unit. The Crown further relied upon the appellant’s obvious limp, as observed by a number of people on the afternoon of Tuesday 16 July and as observed by police and medical staff on 18 July, when he was first arrested. Finally, there was the deceased’s blood on the appellant’s clothing. The Crown acknowledged that there was no evidence of motive.  
     
      
    33 Senior counsel for the Crown told the jury that this collocation of evidence and circumstances proved that the appellant was at the Northcott building on the morning of 16 July. In this regard, he referred to the evidence of Ms McKenzie, who had seen the accused shortly after 12 noon on that day, walking past Edward Eager Lodge; and the evidence of Mr Skerry, who said that he last saw the deceased in the company of the appellant between 11am and 1pm on 16 July, on which occasion they were drinking together. In relation to this last aspect, it appears that the Crown relied on the totality of Mr Skerry’s evidence, which varied from saying that he had seen the appellant between 11am and 12.30pm and between 12.30 and 1pm. 
     
      
    34 In his argument on the appeal, senior counsel for the appellant contended that the matters upon which the Crown relied did not withstand reasonable analysis. Indeed, he submitted that the effect of the Crown case was that the appellant must have suffered his injury prior to the death of the accused. He relied upon the following ‘chronology’ to establish his point. First, he referred to the Crown case that death occurred between 2pm on 16 July and 8am the following morning, 17 July. According to Mr Shumba, the appellant was in his company from between 12 noon and 1pm, that is, prior to 2pm, when the appellant returned to the room they shared and stayed in his company until about 10.30pm that night. When he returned to his room, Mr Shumba observed the appellant limping. Mr Skerry, for his part, had said that he saw the appellant in the company of the deceased during a period which varied, but extended from 11am to 1pm on 16 July. Senior counsel for the appellant submitted, therefore, that the last opportunity the appellant had to commit the crime was no later than 1pm on 16 July. However, on the Crown’s case, the deceased died sometime between 2pm on 16 July and 8am on 17 July. 
     
      
    35 Two comments can be made about this submission. Although in the way the Crown formulated its case, the time of death was between 2pm on 16 July and 8am on 17 July, Dr Cala, in his evidence, did not confine the time of death of the deceased to 2pm on 16 July. Rather, he said that death could have occurred earlier. Secondly, this particular chronology gives an exactitude to the time frames of the relevant events of which the witnesses gave evidence, which could be questionable. However, the more relevant evidence is that of Dr Cala. If the jury accepted his evidence that the time of death could have been earlier than 2pm on 16 July, then the evidence of Mr Skerry and of Mr Shumba, upon which the appellant relies, does not establish that the Crown’s case could not be correct. Rather, the evidence to which I have just referred, including that of Dr Cala, was a matter for assessment by the jury. 
     
      
    36 The Crown’s reliance upon the appellant’s limp was as inferential evidence that the appellant had injured himself during the course of the attack on the deceased. The Crown acknowledged that there was no medical evidence as to whether the injuries sustained by the deceased and, in particular, injuries that were most likely to have been caused by jumping or kicking, would, in turn, have caused the injury sustained by the appellant to his leg. However, the Crown relied upon the different versions the appellant gave to various witnesses as to how he had sustained that injury to indicate that the appellant was seeking to “cover up” the cause of that injury. The Crown outlined each of the versions to which I have referred at [12]-[19] above. 
     
      
    37 Senior counsel for the appellant submitted, however, that the different versions upon which the Crown relied did not have the degree of inconsistency for which the Crown contends. He submitted, therefore, the relevance that the Crown sought to attach to those inconsistencies could not be sustained. Senior counsel referred first to the evidence of Mr Brooks, in which the appellant was heard to make reference to being pushed and falling back onto a car. Then, the appellant told Mr Shumba that “he got hit by a car on the way back home”. When Mr McKenzie asked him about his limp, the appellant said “Don’t ask”.  
     
      
    38 Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the version given to Mr Brooks and to Mr Shumba were not inconsistent. They both related to the injury having occurred as a result of contact with a car. When Mr McKenzie asked the appellant about his limp, the appellant deflected the enquiry by saying “Don’t ask”. Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that this last response does not have the adverse connotation sought to be drawn from it by the Crown. Rather, senior counsel submitted that it was consistent with the appellant simply having had enough of inquiries and brushing them off. The Crown also relied upon the fact that the appellant refused to give an explanation to Dr Gregory as to how he had injured his leg. However, as senior counsel for the appellant pointed out, Dr Gregory asked the appellant about bruising to his left side, rather than his limping. 
     
      
    39 In my opinion, these matters were appropriate matters to put to the jury for their consideration. The appellant does not argue that the trial judge failed to give an appropriate direction in respect of this material. Rather, he contends that the Crown case did not have the strength that the Crown contended. However, that was a matter for the jury as part of its assessment of the circumstantial Crown case. 
     
      
    40 The appellant next submitted that the emphasis placed upon the presence of the deceased’s blood on his clothing was misguided. The appellant pointed out that the total DNA found on his clothing was three specks (although the evidence seemed to be only two specks containing the deceased’s DNA), one of which was not visible to the naked eye. There was no blood on his shoes, nor was there any blood on the lower part of his tracksuit pants, which might have been expected, should the deceased’s injury have been caused by stomping or kicking.  
     
      
    41 This last submission was based upon the evidence of Professor Hilton, a consultant in forensic medicine with experience over a 30 to 40 year period. Professor Hilton agreed with Dr Cala’s evidence that the injuries to the trunk of the deceased and, in particular, the broken ribs, were highly suggestive of kicking or stomping or a combination of both. Professor Hilton was of the opinion that the injury to the deceased’s right cheek was more suggestive of the imprint of, for example, a “soft sort of a shoe”, rather than having been caused by an implement such as a saucepan or a frying pan.  
     
      
    42 Professor Hilton expressed the opinion that it was likely that if the deceased was stomped on or kicked in the head region, that blood would be projected or transferred onto the shoes of the attacker. Professor Hilton was also asked about the likelihood of discernable blood spatter patterns on the cuff or lower leg area of long pants, if an attacker had stomped on or kicked the body of the victim. He said that in that circumstance, blood in the mouth or in the upper respiratory passages could well have been projected out of the victim’s mouth and nose. He said that, in circumstances of someone standing close by, or indeed over the deceased, engaged in either kicking or stomping, it would be likely and more probable than not, although not necessarily the case, that blood would have been projected out of the victim’s mouth or respiratory passages, so as to spatter onto the lower part of a trouser leg.  
     
      
    43 Professor Hilton said it was likely, if the victim had been kicked in the area where there was bleeding around his head, that blood would have been projected onto the footwear or lower garment area of the attacker, but that it would be unlikely to reach up to the shoulder or collar. Professor Hilton also said that, having regard to the injuries which had been inflicted on the deceased, he would have expected a greater transfer of blood than was found, but it was not necessarily the case that there would be such transfer. However, as Professor Hilton agreed, the injuries to the trunk were all closed injuries, so that no blood would have spattered onto the assailant’s clothes from the injuries to the trunk. 
     
      
    44 However, in cross-examination, Professor Hilton accepted that in circumstances where the deceased’s blood had come in contact with the cooking implements found in the room, if those cooking implements were “being flailed around and used as weapons”, then blood could have spattered onto the walls in the bedroom and could also have been spattered onto the shirt and upper part of the trousers of the attacker.  
     
      
    45 In my opinion, the cross-examination of Professor Hilton significantly undermines the thrust of the appellant’s submission on this point. The appellant’s argument was that, having regard to the injuries sustained by the deceased, it was probable that there had been a spray of blood from the deceased’s nose or respiratory passages during the course of the attack, or from the external wounds on the face area. It was submitted that that spray would, probably, have spattered onto the lower parts of the attacker’s trousers and shoes. However, as no such spatter was found on the appellant’s clothes or shoes, it was submitted that it was unlikely that the appellant was the attacker. 
     
      
    46 However, it was not established that the injury to the face was an injury caused by being kicked and, the injuries to the torso did not involve any open wounds. If, during the course of infliction of those injuries, any blood was projected from the deceased’s mouth or nasal passages, it would not necessarily have spattered onto the attacker’s clothes. Whether it would have done so, would depend upon where the attacker was standing in relation to the victim’s head. It might also depend upon whether the injuries to the body were inflicted before or after the injuries to the head which caused the bleeding.  
     
      
    47 The appellant submitted that the blood on his clothing could have been deposited there during the course of the appellant assisting the deceased. The appellant’s case was that he had been staying at the premises, looking after the deceased for a few days, prior to the deceased’s death. Whilst that was an available explanation, there was no evidence that the deceased was at that time ill, except that he was on medication and that he was frail.  
     
      
    48 The appellant also referred to the unlikelihood that he would have returned to the premises, in the company of Mr Shumba, for the purposes of trying to find his bag, if he had murdered the deceased.  
     
      
    49 In my opinion, none of the matters upon which the appellant relied established that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable. There was a significant body of circumstantial evidence that pointed to the appellant as the assailant. The appellant knew the deceased, he had a means of access to the unit, either by having a key or, alternatively, by the deceased opening the door to him. The appellant left the unit on 15 July and he was observed to take his bag with him. He had clearly returned to the unit between 15 July, when he was ejected by the police and 2.30pm 17 July, when the deceased’s body was discovered, because his bag, which he had taken with him when he left on 15 July and his wallet, were found in the unit. Further, he was seen in the company of the deceased on 16 July at a time which was proximate to the time of death. The deceased’s DNA was found on the appellant’s clothing in circumstances where there was a rational explanation of how it could have got there, namely, by having been “thrown off” one of the cooking implements which had been used to batter the deceased.  
     
      
    50 Although alternative explanations were available in respect of some, at least, of the evidence to which I have referred, at the end of all the evidence, the comments of Gibbs CJ and Mason J in Chamberlain [No 2] to which I refer above, are particularly pertinent: “the jury may find that one piece of evidence resolves their doubts as to another”. In my opinion, the appellant has not established that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable. Accordingly, Ground 1 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: application under the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
        
       
      
    51 The appellant was sentenced by the trial judge on 22 April 2005. The appellant adduced psychological and psychiatric evidence in his sentence hearing. Anna Robilliard provided a psychological report dated 8 December 2004. She reported that the appellant’s performance on the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory – III indicated that he was a Schizoid individual with Depressive, Dependant elements. Ms Robilliard also noticed that his Alcohol Dependence was readily evident. Ms Robilliard reported that the appellant was “quite paranoid … and he perceives himself as potentially in danger”.  
     
      
    52 Dr Olav Nielssen, Psychiatrist, who had attended the appellant as a visiting psychiatrist at the Metropolitan Remand Centre, also reported on the appellant for the purposes of his sentencing hearing. Dr Nielssen reviewed the prison records and observed that he had seen the appellant on four occasions between 5 December 2002 and 20 March 2003. It appears that the consultation on 20 March 2003 was the last prior to the appellant’s trial in October 2004. On 20 March 2003, Dr Nielssen recorded that the appellant was fit for trial.  
     
      
    53 Dr Nielssen reviewed the appellant, together with the prison medical records, the police facts in relation to the charge, a transcript of the appellant’s criminal history, a report by Ms Robilliard dated 8 December 2004 and other medical records, which recorded numerous short periods of hospitalisation from the early 1990s onwards. Dr Nielssen diagnosed alcoholic dependence and abuse, brain damage secondary to trauma and alcohol abuse and schizophrenia. Dr Nielssen noted that the alternative diagnosis to schizophrenia was of alcoholic hallucinosis, resulting in enduring persecutory beliefs. However, Dr Nielssen considered that the appellant’s presentation was more consistent with a schizophrenic illness than with an alcohol-related psychotic illness. Dr Nielssen expressed the opinion that the appellant’s underlying psychiatric disorder was likely to have resulted in an abnormality of the mind at the time of the offence. He added: 
     
      
       
        
        “Moreover, [the appellant’s] refusal to raise his abnormal mental state in his defence casts doubt on his fitness for trial.”  
        
       
      
    54 The appellant informed Dr Nielssen that, although he remembered having been prescribed anti-psychotic medication when he was first remanded in prison, he stopped taking the medication a short time thereafter.  
     
      
    55 Dr Nielssen gave oral evidence at the sentence hearing. During the course of his cross-examination, he confirmed his opinion that he considered that the appellant’s “main problem” was an “underlying mental illness” rather than any psychosis related to severe alcohol withdrawal. He was then asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And in relation to any [ 
        Presser 
        ] test he seems to meet the minimum standards that would be required under that test to be fit to be tried? 
         
        A. In all respects except for the inability to raise one of the possible defences, the effect of his abnormal mental state, because he didn’t recognise that he has had an abnormal mental state. 
         
         
        Q. In terms of your conclusions, doctor, given the statement that you make, he did have a detailed knowledge of aspects of his case. Your conclusion seems to suggest that, perhaps, a question of fitness is based, I take it, on his failure to notify or inform his legal representatives of these difficulties he had in the past? 
         
        A. That’s right. Because I don’t think he recognises that he has been mentally ill, and hence it is not raised. I do think it’s relevant because the pattern of symptoms may have been a contributing factor.”  
        
       
      
    56 The reference to the “Presser” test is a reference to the test which is applied by the courts in determining whether a person is fit for trial. I deal with this further below. Immediately after the conclusion of Dr Nielssen’s evidence, counsel for the appellant addressed the trial judge. He stated that the purpose of calling evidence in relation to the appellant’s mental state was so as to support a submission in relation to general deterrence. At no point did counsel for the appellant raise any question in the sentence hearing as to the appellant’s fitness for trial. 
     
      
    57 Senior counsel for the appellant on the appeal indicated that that evidence, of itself, raised an issue as to the appellant’s fitness.  
     
      
    58 Dr Nielssen was also called to give evidence on the appeal and confirmed his view that the appellant’s refusal to raise his mental state at trial raised a doubt as to his fitness, as did his persecutory beliefs. Dr Nielssen explained that the appellant did not have any understanding that he was mentally ill – indeed, he told Dr Nielssen that he was not mentally ill. Dr Nielssen considered that although the appellant’s cognitive performance was unimpaired, as he did not have any insight as to his mental illness, he was not able to give any instructions to his legal representatives as to his mental state at the time of the murder, so as to enable any consideration to be given to a defence based upon his mental state. Dr Nielssen was cross-examined by the Crown as to how the appellant’s abnormal state affected his fitness for trial. He reiterated that the appellant did not recognise that he was ill and, further, he did not recognise how he was ill. Dr Nielssen said that this affected the appellant’s capacity to give detailed instructions on his mental state.  
     
      
    59 The Crown also called evidence on the appeal from Dr Rosalie Wilcox, Psychiatrist. Dr Wilcox agreed that the appellant now suffered from schizophrenia, although she said that it was unclear when the illness developed. She accepted that that had been the diagnosis since 2002 and as I understand her evidence, she did not seek to dispute that. The trial was in October 2004. Dr Wilcox observed that the appellant’s symptoms were reasonably controlled on a low dose of medication. She observed that Dr Nielssen had found the appellant fit for trial in 2002, but agreed in cross-examination that the appellant’s fitness for trial could have changed dramatically in a period of 19 months.  
     
      
       
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
       
      
    60 Part 2 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act specifies the procedure which is to be undertaken in circumstances where there is a question as to a person’s unfitness for trial.  
     
      
    61 There has been an amendment to the Act since the trial, although that amendment does not affect the fundamental question of what is meant by the phrase “unfitness to be tried”. The amendment relates, relevantly, to the procedure to be followed if a question of unfitness for trial arises. The term “unfitness to be tried” is itself not defined in the Act. There is a long line of authority to which I shall refer shortly to the effect that the phrase maintains its common law meaning.  
     
      
    62 The question of unfitness may be raised by any party to the proceedings, or by the Court itself: s 5. Pursuant to s 7, the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried is, so far as is practicable, to be raised before the person is arraigned, but “may be raised at any time during the course of the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence”. Sections 8 and 9 specify the procedure which must be followed when a question of unfitness is raised, depending upon whether it is raised before arraignment: s 8; or after arraignment: s 9. Section 9 is relevant here. It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is raised after the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, the Court must hear any submissions relating to the conducting of an inquiry in the absence of any jury which has been constituted for the purposes of the proceedings relating to the offence.” 
        
       
      
    63 Section 10 then governs the procedure if the Court determines that an inquiry should be conducted. Section 10(2) provides that the Court must not conduct an inquiry into the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried unless it appears to the Court that the question has been raised in good faith. It has not been suggested here that the question of unfitness has not been raised in good faith. Section 10(3) provides that before conducting an inquiry, the Court may do a number of things, including adjourning the proceedings and requesting the person to undergo a psychiatric or other examination. The question of a person’s unfitness to be tried is to be determined by the Judge alone: s 11. In the form the legislation was at the time of trial, the question of unfitness was to be determined by a jury constituted for that purpose. 
     
      
    64 As I have already stated, the meaning of “unfitness to be tried” has a long common law pedigree. I reviewed the authorities recently in Clarkson v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 70. The authorities indicate that the courts have continued to determine the question of unfitness to be tried on the basis of the approach of Smith J in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 (the “Presser” test). Smith J said at 48, in identifying that the question to be determined in ascertaining whether an accused was unfit for trial was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… whether the accused, because of mental defect, fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him. He needs … to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand … the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.” 
        
       
      
    65 The High Court has applied the “Presser” test in Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1; [1980] HCA 18; Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230; [1994] HCA 41; and Eastman v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 1; [2000] HCA 29. In each of those cases, the Court has emphasised the need for the capacity of the accused to understand the proceedings at trial so as to be “able to make a proper defence”: see Ngatayi v The Queen, Gibbs, Mason and Wilson JJ at 9.  
     
      
    66 Senior Counsel for the appellant submitted that the evidence of Dr Nielssen on the sentence hearing “raised a question of unfitness to be tried” and that as the matter was raised prior to the conclusion of the sentencing proceedings, the question had been raised “during the course of the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence” within the meaning of s 7. Senior counsel for the appellant further submitted that even if the matter was raised post-sentence, for example, on appeal, the Court was obliged, if a question did arise, to follow the procedures under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    67 A similar situation had arisen in Kirkwood v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 181. The appellant in Kirkwood suffered from Asperger’s Syndrome and had been diagnosed over a number of years as suffering from a range of psychiatric disorders. In that case, the appellant had pleaded guilty to two offences and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for each offence. He appealed against the conviction and contended that a question had arisen as to the propriety of the convictions, because he may have been unfit to be tried. Dr Nielssen had earlier examined Mr Kirkwood, in 2000 and 2001 and had formed the view then, in relation to other criminal proceedings, that he was unfit to be tried. Dr Nielssen also gave evidence at the hearing of the appeal in that matter.  
     
      
    68 Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreeing) considered that the conviction should be quashed. His Honour noted that the first time that any psychiatric evidence had been before the Court was when the matter was before the Court of Criminal Appeal that day. Dr Nielssen gave evidence to the Court of Criminal Appeal that, by reference to the Presser test, it was more probable than not that as at the date of the appellant’s conviction for the subject offences, he was unfit to be tried. Johnson J said at [13]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The test to be applied by the Court in these circumstances is clear. If there is material before the Court which raises a question about the propriety of a conviction on the basis that the Appellant may have been unfit to stand trial, the Court should quash the conviction unless it is satisfied that, had the question been raised before or during the trial which led to the conviction, the trial court, acting reasonably,  
        must 
         have found that the Appellant was fit to stand trial:  
        R v RTI 
         (2003) 58 NSWLR 438 at 449;  
        R v Rivkin 
         (2004) 59 NSWLR 284 at 296;  
        R v Henley 
         [2005] NSWCCA 126 at [4].” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    69 The Court quashed the conviction and a new trial was ordered. In ordering a new trial, Johnson J was cognisant that the question of any unfitness to be tried would be governed by the legislation in the form it took at the time of any such new trial: see R v Henley at [15]. 
     
      
    70 In R v RTI the question of the accused’s fitness for trial again arose post-conviction. Howie J (Tobias JA and Shaw J agreeing) said at [21]: 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown concedes that, based upon all the material available, the appellant was unfit at the time of the trials before Twigg DCJ. It is unnecessary for this Court to determine whether the appellant was unfit at that time. In order to enliven this Court's jurisdiction, it is sufficient if there is material before the Court raising a question as to the appellant's fitness to stand trial before Twigg DCJ. If such material exists, the Court has to determine whether there was the possibility of a miscarriage of justice arising. If the appellant was unfit at the time of the two trials before Twigg DCJ, each of those trials was a nullity and the convictions would have to be quashed.” 
        
       
      
    71 At [31], Howie J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… If there is material before this Court which raises a question about the propriety of the conviction because an appellant may have been unfit to stand trial, the court should quash the conviction unless it is satisfied that, had the question been raised before or during the trial which led to the conviction, the court acting reasonably must have found that the accused was fit to stand trial. It is only if the court can come to that finding that there will be no possibility of a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    72 In R v Rivkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284; [2004] NSWCCA 7 the Court (Mason P, Wood CJ at CL and Sully J) adopted the statement of Howie J as being a correct statement of the law.  
     
      
    73 In Rivkin, the question of unfitness arose in circumstances where Mr Rivkin was suffering a temporary condition which was amenable to treatment and which had been reversed by the time the matter was heard in the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Court observed at [296] that, as at the time it was hearing the appeal, no current question of fitness arose. That, however, was not the matter in issue. The central question in issue was whether, in circumstances where an accused person had a reduced capacity to understand and follow the proceedings in each of the aspects identified in Presser, but had some capacity to do so, that person was unfit to be tried.  
     
      
    74 The Court determined that question against Mr Rivkin. Their Honours pointed out that the test in Presser was directed to the “minimum requirements for a fair trial”. They said that, provided that an accused person could understand and follow the proceedings in each of its facets, give appropriate instructions and present a proper defence to the charge, then that person was to be regarded as fit to be tried. The Court said it was irrelevant to the question of fitness that the accused might have done so in a better way if suitable medical treatment or medication had been provided, or, for example, had the accused possessed greater intelligence or acuity of mind. Their Honours pointed out at [301] that the Presser test does not contemplate or assume that an accused person is able to perform at trial according to his or her maximum potential.  
     
      
    75 Their Honours observed in their judgment that the appellant had been able to give evidence and it was apparent from the transcript that he had a clear understanding of what was involved with the offence and was able to make the answer which he wished to make to it. The Court concluded that it should not intervene so as to quash the conviction, given the circumstance to which I have just referred and the absence of evidence from his legal advisors to suggest they had problems in relation to the taking of instructions or explaining the proceedings to him and in the absence of any evidence from the appellant to that effect. 
     
      
    76 Their Honours considered that this approach had support in the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Eastman v The Queen. In Eastman, Gleeson CJ, at [26], referred to the Canadian decision of R v Taylor (1992) 77 CCC (3d) 551 at 564-565 and set out four propositions relating to the question of unfitness to be tried, which were accepted as representing the state of the authorities in that province. Those propositions were: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The fact that an accused person suffers from a delusion does not, of itself, render him or her unfit to stand trial, even if that delusion relates to the subject-matter of the trial. 
         
        (b) The fact that a person suffers from a mental disorder which may cause him or her to conduct a defence in a manner which the court considers to be contrary to his or her best interests does not, of itself, lead to the conclusion that the person is unfit to stand trial. 
         
        (c) The fact that an accused person's mental disorder may produce behaviour which will disrupt the orderly flow of a trial does not render that person unfit to stand trial. 
         
        (d) The fact that a person's mental disorder prevents him or her from having an amicable, trusting relationship with counsel does not mean that the person is unfit to stand trial.” 
        
       
      
    77 Gleeson CJ, at [27], observed that, in Australia, the ultimate test to be applied was the statutory test, but said that each of the propositions stated in R v Taylor was sound and consistent with the statutory test.  
     
      
    78 In this case, neither the appellant, nor his legal advisors at trial gave evidence to the Court on the question of the appellant’s unfitness.  
     
      
    79 It was not suggested that the appellant had not been able to give appropriate instructions during the course of the trial. The transcript revealed cogent cross-examination of witnesses by the appellant’s counsel. It also appears that attention was given to the conduct of his defence, particularly in the calling of Professor Hilton. However, there has been psychiatric evidence both before the Court at first instance since the sentence hearing and before this Court, that there was a question as to the appellant’s unfitness to be tried due to his lack of insight into his mental illness.  
     
      
    80 In my opinion, the medical evidence at sentence and the evidence before this Court raises a question of the appellant’s unfitness to be tried, in particular, in respect of his ability to make a proper defence to the charge. Dr Nielssen’s evidence was that the appellant’s lack of insight into his medical condition meant that he was not able to give instructions to his lawyers at the time of his trial. Dr Wilcox’s evidence did not contradict that evidence. Dr Nielssen’s evidence was, in my opinion, persuasive. This Court does not have to determine that the appellant was unfit to be tried, although it will not intervene if it is satisfied that had the question been raised before or during the trial, the appellant would have been found fit: see Kirkwood at [13]. I am not satisfied on the evidence as it now stands that the appellant would have been found fit for trial had the matter been raised at his trial. 
     
      
    81 Therefore, in accordance with the principles stated in RTI and adopted by this Court in Rivkin, the conviction must be quashed. It is irrelevant that the appellant may, on a retrial, be found to be fit, or even that a question of unfitness might, at that stage, not arise. That is a possibility in this case, in circumstances where the medical evidence is that the appellant’s unfitness, if that is established, may have been due to a failure to take his medication. If the appellant remains on appropriate medication, the question of unfitness may not arise at a new trial. However, that is not a question for this Court. It follows that, in my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered. 
     
      
       
      Sentence  
       
      
    82 Having regard to the conclusion to which I have just come, it is not necessary to deal with the application for leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    83 The Orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Conviction quashed; 
       
       
      3. Order that there be a new trial; 
       
       
      4. Dismiss the application for leave to appeal against sentence.

           JUDGMENT 
           
          
         
        
       
      
     PROHIBITION : No material may be published which would tend to identify the two juveniles.1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Smart AJ2 HISLOP J: I agree with Smart AJ.3 SMART AJ: John Ersman seeks leave to appeal against a sentence of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 12 January 2006 and a balance of term of 3 years expiring on 11 January 2012 for the offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon (s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900).  The maximum penalty for that offence is 20 years imprisonment. The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court and adhered to his plea in the District Court. The offence took place on 24 August 2005. Three persons were involved and the judge proceeded on the basis of a common enterprise. Two co-offenders were dealt with in the Children’s Court for this offence. N, aged 14 was sentenced on 2 December 2005 to a control Order of 12 months with a non-parole period of 2 months. D, aged 17 years, was sentenced on 13 February 2006 to a suspended control Order of 7 months with a non-parole period of 3 months. The applicant was born on 18 June 1986 and was thus 19 at the time of the offence but importantly functions on a day-to-day basis as borderline disabled and is maladjusted.4 There was an agreed statement of facts but that does not identify the role played by each offender.5 About midnight on 24 August 2005 SD, a 44 year old lady who had completed her shift at an aged care facility, alighted from the train at Warwick Farm Railway Station. As she walked through the car park of the Railway Station, she sensed that she was being followed from behind. She was confronted by the three offenders who blocked her path. At this point one of the offenders said to her, “Have you got any money on you?” She replied “No”. She took out her mobile phone and gestured that she was calling “000” to raise the police. One of the offenders produced a knife, then passed it to a co-offender who held it out in front of him towards her. One of the offenders asked her, “What’s in your bag?” She did not reply but took her Walkman out of her pocket to indicate that was all she had. One of the offenders asked her to empty out her pockets.6 A vehicle approached their location. This appeared to frighten the offenders. However, the vehicle did a U-turn and drove away. Once the vehicle drove away, one of the offenders snatched the victim’s backpack off her shoulder. One of the offenders attempted to grab her mobile phone. The phone was broken in the process. One of the offenders again asked the victim for money. Upon seeing a train approach the Railway Station the offenders walked away, with N hitting SD in the back of her head, causing her immediate pain.7 SD’s back pack contained a “Sony” brand cassette Walkman, the victim’s wallet which contained her driver’s licence and three bank key cards, a Medicare card, about $5 and other personal papers.8 CCTV footage from the Railway Station depicts the offenders getting off the train and walking along the platform of Warwick Farm Railway Station.9 Other CCTV footage from the ANZ Bank at Cabramatta shows the offenders using the ATM attempting to withdraw money from the victim’s account and wearing the same clothing as that shown in the Railway Station footage and as described by the victim. The offenders attended the ATM shortly after the robbery.10 The applicant was arrested on 12 January 2006. In his recorded interview he told the police that he had played no part in the armed robbery on SD and was not aware of his co-offender’s intentions. His version of events was not consistent with SD’s account of the robbery or the Bank CCTV footage. The judge remarked that the applicant’s plea negates his denial. The judge recorded that in the Children’s Court the applicant had an extensive record of robbery and had other violence offences.11 The applicant was born on 18 July 1986. The judge edited the following from the Probation and Parole report of 26 May 2006. 
     
      
       
         
       “Born in Campbelltown in 1986 to a single mother, Mr Ersman described his upbringing as being raised in a household characterised by a chaotic lifestyle and his mother’s transient relationships. After living with his mother on and off throughout his childhood he said that at the age of eighteen, he and his girlfriend secured their own accommodation. He said however that they only stayed there for approximately three months before moving to Queensland where they lived for a short time with his aunty. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
        Although he has five siblings, Mr Ersman said that his only significant relationship is with his sister and her boyfriend with whom he was living at the time of his arrest. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        Mr Ersman said that he left school after completing Year 8 as he found the work difficult. He said that he and his friends were frequently subjected to disciplinary action. He said that whilst in a juvenile institution he completed Year 10 at TAFE. During the periods when he’s not been in custody, Mr Ersman said he has had various short term periods of employment generally labouring. He said that abuse of alcohol and drugs has made it difficult for him to remain employed.” 
       
      
    12 There is a poignant note in the report that the applicant does not receive visits from family and/or friends and that since coming into custody had received three visits, two from legal practitioners and one from a psychologist preparing a report for the Court.13 The judge went on to set out these further edited passages from the Probation and Parole report: 
     
      
       
        “In his Clinical Psychologist’s Report dated 18 July 2003 Mr Champion concluded in respect of Mr Ersman that: 
        
        
         ‘… young man with significant intellectual and academic limitations … family background appears from reports to have more than it’s share of dysfunction, and it would seem that this has impacted significantly on John’s behavioural and emotional development and his social adjustment.’ 
        
        … 
        
        
        The Offender stated that he started abusing alcohol at the age of fourteen and has continued to abuse alcohol on and off since that time until his arrest for the current offence. … He said also since the age of fourteen he’s abused crystalline methylamphetamine. 
        
        
        … 
        
        
        At the interview Mr Ersman agreed that he was present at the time of the offence and that he grabbed the victim’s backpack. He denied having possession of a knife at any time, denied hitting the victim and denied saying anything to her throughout the robbery. Asked how he became to be involved, he said, ‘I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.’ When asked who had been affected by the offence, Mr Ersman nominated himself and his co-offenders who he referred to throughout the interview as ‘the boys’. When asked who else he thought might have been affected he was unable to think of anyone. When asked how he thought the victim might have been affected he said, ‘She was probably frightened,’ but he appeared to have little insight into victim empathy. … Throughout the interview he appeared reluctant to take any responsibility for any part he played in the commission of the offence. 
        
        
        … 
        
        
        The Offender’s continued abuse of alcohol and cannabis renders him virtually unemployable, pre-disposes him to continued involvement with criminal associates and a transient lifestyle and removes any possibility of him establishing the positive supportive male relationships/role models which he may otherwise develop through stable long term employment or suitable accommodation.” 
        
       
      
    14 The Department of Juvenile Justice first sought a report from Mr Peter Champion, a Clinical Psychologist in 2002 after the applicant had been charged with robbery in company. On 9 April 2002 Mr Champion prepared a detailed report observing that the applicant appeared to come from a dysfunctional background and that he was a gauche, intellectually and academically limited young man whose manner was atypical. He had done poorly at school and had a history throughout High School of being in the special education stream. It was for those with mild developmental disabilities and/or major learning problems.15 In his later report of 18 July 2003 which was commissioned by the Department after the applicant was charged with demand property with menaces with intent to steal, Mr Champion adhered to his 2002 opinion that in functional terms the applicant on a day to day basis performs more in line with a person who would be classed as borderline disabled than a person who would be classified as low average. Mr Champion added: 
     
      
       
        “Certainly, in terms of his verbal reasoning capacity, the limitations in his expressive and receptive language, his judgment and planning, his skills are seriously below average and I believe in part explain his maladjustment and tendency to ill considered offending and his inability to coherently or consistently look at his own behaviour, the likely repercussions of it and its impact on others.” 
       
      
    16 Mr Champion was troubled in July 2003 why the applicant had re-offended so quickly. He wrote: 
     
      
       
        “[30] In relation to the issue of why he has re-offended again so quickly, it would appear that he became involved with a group of peers who engaged in drinking and this progressively impacted on his adjustment and compliance. I think that his offending can be attributed to a range of factors, namely his intellectual limitations (which impact on judgment and foresight); his exposure to and experiences of violence; his exposure to inappropriate behavioural models; his lack of solid consistent relationships; his substance abuse; his involvement with subcultural peers; his mood dysfunction. In essence John does not appear to have been equipped with adequate internal controls, does not appear to have developed appropriate attitudes/values or moral development, and lacks judgment. At this stage I think that his prognosis is poor.”” 
       
      
     There does not appear to have been much change between 2003 and 2006.17 The judge noted that on 25 May 2006 the applicant was assessed by Ms K Seidler, psychologist, and that in a lengthy report she concluded: 
     
      
       
        “For someone so young, Mr Ersman has had some considerable experience of custody and, without positive change, support and intervention, this is likely to continue. As stated, this is his first experience of an adult correctional centre, which will increase his exposure to adult antisociality and entrenched substance abuse. It is timely that he be offered a structured programme of support, such that he may have an opportunity for greater community stability, before he runs the risk of becoming further entrenched in an antisocial lifestyle and of institutionalisation.”  
       
      
    18 Ms Seidler described the appellant as having low cognitive ability and poor psychosocial functioning. She noted that he had a significant history of juvenile offending and incarcerations within Juvenile detention centres.19 The judge accepted that the applicant’s actions and those of his two co-offenders had had long term and adverse effects upon SD. This is to be expected.20 The judge took the guilty plea into account on sentence and noted his early plea entitled him, all other things being equal, to a sentence lower than the range set down in Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. However, the applicant had a criminal history of significance. The judge said: 
     
      
       
        “In general the case matches the Henry case except that the offender has a prior offence for robbery in company with an offensive weapon. 
        
        
        … In particular his record calls for consideration and deterrence.” 
        
       
      
    21 The judge found special circumstances as he thought that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation would be enhanced by an extended period of supervision. I agree.22 The judge stated that he was mindful of the principles of parity but both the co-offenders were juveniles and the orders made in their cases were no reflection of the sentence to be imposed upon an adult.23 The applicant’s record in the Children’s Court can be summarised thus: 13/02/2002 Use offensive language in/near public place/school  Fined $150  13/02/2002 Robbery in company  Probation 33(1)(e) 2 years subject to conditions 19/04/2002 Robbery armed with offensive weapon Control Order s 31(1)(g) 10 months. Non-parole period  4 months. Conditions imposed. Robbery in company Control Order s 33(1)(g) 4 months concurrent 20/11/2002 Possess implements to Enter/Drive Conveyance Dismissed s 33(1)(a) with caution.  Maliciously destroy or damage property Dismissed s 33(1)(a) with caution Take/Detain person in company with intent to obtain advantage Control Order s 33(1)(g) 6 months from 11/8/02 Robbery in company (2 counts) Control Order s 33(1)(g) 2 years from 11/8/02 Non-parole period  9 months. Conditions on release  Assault with intent to rob in company  Control Order s 33(1)(g) 2 years from 11/8/2002 Non-parole period  9 months. Conditions on release. 13/08/2003 Demand property with menaces with intent to steal Control Order s 33(1)(g) 2 years from 11/6/2003 Non-parole period 18 months. Conditions on release (The details as to this in the papers are confusing) 16/02/2004 Maliciously destroy or damage property Control Order s 33(1)(g) 1 month from 16/2/04.24 At an early stage of her oral submissions counsel for the applicant summarised the basis of the application; the sentence was manifestly excessive being the product of two specific errors. First, excessive weight was given to the applicant’s criminal history and secondly insufficient weight was given to his early plea of guilty. Counsel’s second main attack was based on the lack of due proportion of the sentences imposed on the three co-offenders. In view of the thrust of the submissions I will take grounds 1 to 3 together. Ground 1 – His Honour erred in the manner in which he took into account the applicant’s previous criminal history and placed excessive weight on it. Ground 2 - His Honour erred by failing adequately to take into account the plea of guilty Ground 3 – The overall sentences and the non-parole period are manifestly excessive.25 The applicant does not dispute that the judge was entitled to take the applicant’s criminal history into account. The complaint is as to the manner in which he did so and that this led to an excessive sentence.26 At a relatively early stage of his remarks the judge stated that the applicant had “an extensive record of robbery and has other violence offences” in the Children’s Court.27 The applicant relied on this passage in the later stages of the judge’s remarks: 
     
      
       
        “The guilty plea is taken into account on sentence. The  
       Henry 
        guideline assumes a plea but the Crown concedes that this early plea entitles him, all other things being equal, to a sentence lower than the range set down.  
       He does however, have a criminal record of significance.  
        In general the case matches the  
       Henry 
        case except that this offender has a prior offence for robbery in company with an offensive weapon. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
        I am mindful of the provisions of s 21A and I have taken them into account.  
       In particular, his record calls for consideration and deterrence 
       . This is a very serious crime and the community expects it to be dealt with accordingly.” 
        
         
       (emphasis added by counsel) 
       
      
    28 Counsel for the applicant pointed out that most of the offences of the applicant were committed when he was aged 15 or 16 years and when he lacked family support and had impaired judgment because of his various disabilities. The reports of Mr Champion set out in some detail the marked disadvantages to which the applicant was subject.29 Counsel submitted that the applicant’s lack of judgment, lack of insight and foresight and his lack of internal controls were partly due to his intellectual limitations and partly due to the dysfunctional family background, his lack of support and his lack of skills. As Mr Champion remarked the difficulty was with the applicant’s low language/reasoning skill base; his ability to profit from routine “counselling” was probably inherently limited. This points to the need for an extended period on parole and the need for extended counselling.30 The applicant relied upon the guideline judgment in Henry esp at 380 and the opinion that the overall sentences for offences under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act (armed robbery with an offensive weapon) should generally range between four and five years in respect of young offenders who met the criteria there set out. It was acknowledged that this young offender did not meet the criterion of a young offender with no or little criminal history. On the other hand Henry involved a late plea of guilty. These two differences do not balance out.31 The applicant placed reliance upon the Judicial Commission statistics in 18 cases as to sentences for offences under s 97(1), robbery being armed or in company, after Henry & Ors where there was one count, prior offences of the same type with custodial sentences, a plea of guilty and the offender was aged 18 to 20 years. Most of the sentences were of five years or less. There was one case of a sentence of six years and none for longer periods. The bulk of the non-parole periods were for 2½ years or less, but in three cases there were non-parole periods of three years. There were no longer non-parole periods. The particular facts of the cases are not available.32 Nevertheless the statistics reveal that the sentence imposed in the present case was at the high end of the range of sentences where the offender had prior similar offences. In my opinion, having regard to the gravity of the instant offence, the statistics and the subjective features of the applicant the sentence is manifestly excessive, 
     
      
      Disparity 
       
       
      Ground 4 – The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance when considering the sentences imposed on the co-offenders N and D. 
      
    33 N was sentenced on 2 December 2005 as to the incident involving SD in respect of robbery, being armed with an offensive weapon by a Children’s Magistrate to a 12 months control order with a minimum term of 2 months starting that day. He was also sentenced to a concurrent fixed term control order of 2 months in respect of an attempted theft from an automatic teller machine. N was born on 23 September 1991.34 In the course of his sentencing remarks the magistrate described the robbery with an offensive weapon at Warwick Farm in the circumstances in which it was committed as a very serious offence. At the time of that offence N was on a suspended control order which had been imposed six days earlier, that is on 18 August 2005.35 The magistrate took into account that N had a very unfortunate upbringing. His father was in and out of gaol and both his parents were amphetamine users. He had been effectively passed over to his father’s mother who had attempted to care for him and he had had periods of homelessness. He had learned how to commit crime at too early an age. There was no suggestion that N was of low intelligence.36 At the time of the imposition of the control order for 12 months for the armed robbery N was the subject of a control order of 9 months commencing 4 August 2005 with a non-parole period of 6 months for other serious offences. Effectively, N, if he behaved himself on parole, was not required to spend any extra time in a juvenile justice institution for the armed robbery offence because of the concurrency in part of the sentences. N had a poor criminal history.37 On 18 August 2005 he was sentenced for a raft of serious offences committed in May and June 2005. These included taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner, possessing implements to enter/drive conveyance, serious motor vehicle offences and obtain money etc by deception, for which he had received a 9 months suspended control order. Conditions were imposed. There were other offences for which he received a six months control order.38 On 28 September 2005 in respect of the offence of break and enter building with intent to steal, apparently committed in July 2005 N was sentenced to a control order of 9 months commencing on 4 August 2005 with a non-parole period of 6 months. Conditions were imposed on his release. There were other offences for which he received the same concurrent sentence.39 N received excessive leniency on the offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon.40 D was sentenced on 13 February 2006 as to the incident involving SD in respect of robbery being armed with an offensive weapon to a 7 months control order with 3 months non-parole period suspended subject to conditions. As to the offence of obtain money by deception he was ordered to perform a further 30 hours community service work. D was born on 13 August 1988.41 In the course of her sentencing remarks a different Children’s Magistrate stated: 
     
      
       
        “At the time of this offence you were on a bond for robbery and also shortly after that … you came before the Court on a charge of break enter and steal for which you’ve had a sentence of sixty hours community service imposed.” 
       
      
    42 She also noted that he was undertaking a Draw TAFE program and that there were prospects of rehabilitation. She was influenced by a favourable report from Juvenile Justice and noted that the offender’s co-offender and younger brother had received a relatively short control order.43 On 1 February 2005 in respect of an offence of robbery in company committed at least seven months earlier, D was placed on a 12 months bond, a condition of which was that he endeavour to find and stay in regular work.44 On 15 September 2005 in respect of events that took place not later than July 2005 D was sentenced to 60 hours community service for breaking and entering a building with intent (steal).45 D received excessive leniency on the offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon.46 The Crown submitted that there were significant differences between N and the applicant:: 
     
      
       
       (a) At the time of the offence N was over 5 years younger than the applicant. 
        
        
       (b) N’s past criminal offending had far less significance than that of the applicant. There were no offences of violence against individuals nor of robbery. His offending principally involved driving offences, stealing and possession and possession of implements to steal cars or housebreak. They seem to have involved a binge of offending within a four month period, the bulk of which occurred when he was aged 13 years whereas the applicant’s offending extended over 3½ years to the date of the present offence. 
        
        
        (c) N had not previously been in custody. 
        
        
       (d) His guilty plea was entered four months earlier than that of the applicant  
       
      
    47 The age difference must be acknowledged and is significant. The applicant had learning difficulties from a very young age. He left school before completing his Year 9 studies. He has poor judgment and skills and his skills are seriously below average.48 N appears to have been an adventurous lad. He had matters of driving a motor vehicle on the road while unlicensed and taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner. He was dealt with for “drive vehicle recklessly/furiously or speed/manner dangerous.” The actions of N had the potential to cause harm to members of the public. The offence of break and enter with intent (steal) is a serious one.49 The offences of N appear to have been committed within a confined period of some months and while there were many of them they were generally of a lesser order than those of the applicant. This armed robbery offence was the first such offence in which N had been involved. The Crown is correct in its submission that the offences of the applicant occurred over a period of 3½ years and involved a number of serious robbery offences.50 N was not the subject of a control order involving fulltime custody until 28 September 2005. He was in custody on 2 December 2005 when sentenced for the instant offence. The control order made on 28 September 2005 takes effect from 4 August 2005. It does not appear why the control order took effect from that date.51 The Children’s Court often deals with matters relatively soon after the commission of an offence and without more information I would not attach weight to the plea of guilty being entered by N at an earlier date in the Children’s Court where proceedings tend to be more informal.52 The Crown tentatively accepted that there appeared to be an error of sentencing principle in the case of N in that he received no additional custodial time for the armed robbery due to the sentence for that offence being concurrent with the sentence for the serious unrelated offence of break enter and steal with intent (steal). The magistrate appeared to be influenced, at least in part, by what he regarded as the severe, if not excessive, sentence earlier imposed upon N.53 The Crown submitted that there were significant differences between the cases of D and the applicant: 
     
      
       
       (a) D displayed strong indications of contrition both in words and actions. He made full admissions at the time of his arrest. His mother, with his assistance and information, recovered the Walkman and delivered it to the police. 
        
        
       (b) D had made strong steps towards rehabilitation. He had resumed his education being in the final year at school, was enrolled in a course at TAFE and had prospects of employment with a panel beating shop which he delayed pending the outcome of the proceedings. (If he obtained employment it may be doubted whether he would be at school). He appears to have stopped using drugs, financially organised himself, had a supportive girlfriend and to have had a highly favourable report from Juvenile Justice. By contrast, the applicant had shown little insight into his offending, was ambivalent about addressing his drug and alcohol abuse and lacked positive signs of rehabilitation. The reduction in the applicant’s non-parole period to fifty per cent of the head sentence resulted from his youth and the need for community based intervention.  
        
        
        
       (c) D’s past criminal offending had less significance than that of the applicant. It did not display as much moral culpability or continuing disobedience to the law. D’s offending extended over one year and there were less offences. There were a number of motor vehicle offences, for example, instances of being never licensed driving a vehicle on the road and using an unregistered vehicle. There was the offence of robbery in 2004 and the offence of break and enter building with intent (steal) in about July 2005. (It seems that he was in custody, bail refused from 24 November 2005 to 12 December 2005 on a charge of robbery in company, with conditional bail being granted on the last mentioned day. 
        
        
       (d) D was 2 years 2 months younger than the applicant. 
        
        
       (e) D had never before been in custody having been previously dealt with by way of a bond, probation or community service order. 
       
      
    54 The Crown submitted that there were a number of potential errors in sentencing D. The Crown submitted that:(a) The lighter head sentence imposed upon him than that imposed upon his younger brother was hard to fathom.(b) Whilst good reasons were available for the suspension of the sentence this resulted in an extremely lenient sentence to the point it was inadequate.55 Any sense of grievance in these circumstances was, according to the Crown, not legitimate. The magistrate sentencing D took into account “the relatively short control order” imposed upon his younger brother. The Crown submitted that if there was any sentencing error with the younger brother this was potentially repeated in the case of D.56 The Crown commented that the magistrate dealing with D appeared to have given no consideration whether to sentence him at law or under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act: s 18. The Crown submitted that irrespective of the regime chosen the penalty imposed was manifestly inadequate to punish adequately such a serious crime.57 In Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 the High Court undertook a review of the principles of parity, paying due regard to the foundational decision of the Court in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606. In Postiglione at 301-2 Dawson and Gaudron JJ said: 
     
      
       
        “The parity principle … is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. … 
       
      
     
     
      
       
        Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co--offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.” 
        
         
       (citations omitted) 
       
      
    58 Kirby J was the third judge in the majority. In a lengthy review of the principles he said at 338: 
     
      
       
        “The problem of disparity will ordinarily arise not so much out of a suggested departure from the requirement to punish equally like offenders convicted of like offences, as out of the disparate punishment of co-offenders or offenders in a situation demanding comparison and contrast. It is in these cases, where discrimination has occurred in the sentences imposed on two or more offenders said not to be justified by the facts either of the offence or of the circumstances of the offender, that the problem of alleged disparity in sentencing presents itself in sharp focus. It is then that the appellate court must apply the tests which have been propounded and decide whether it should intervene. “ ( 
       citations omitted) 
       
      
    59 I do not understand Kirby J to be differing in substance from the views of Dawson and Gaudron JJ earlier quoted.60 McHugh J dissented but primarily upon the substantive merits of the appeal. He concluded at p 314: 
     
      
       
        “Parity between sentences imposed on co-offenders is an important sentencing goal. But a disparity between sentences will not give rise to a ‘justifiable sense of grievance’ where the disparity can be explained on the basis of different antecedents and/or an application of the totality principle. “ 
        
       
      
    61 Gummow J also dissented primarily on the substantive merits of the appeal. However, he accepted that significant differences in the antecedents of co-offenders resulted in the failure of an attack based upon disparity. (pp 324-325). Gummow J at 326 referred to the view of Badgery-Parker in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Postiglione thus: 
     
      
       
        “the foundation of the parity principle is ‘the existence of disparity when other things are equal, or, where other things are not equal, a relativity between sentences which does not properly reflect the extent of the inequality’.” 
       
      
    62 I do not understand Gummow J to be disagreeing with that statement of principle nor to be disagreeing with the statement of principle of Dawson and Gaudron JJ.63 In addition to the differences in the sentencing regimes between that of the applicant and that of the co-offenders there were significant differences in their antecedents.64 The approach cannot and should not be that different sentences on the co-offenders were not warranted but rather the differences lack due proportion. The necessary relativity did not exist.65 All the offenders participated in the joint criminal enterprise and all followed and confronted SD late at night on her own in the railway station car park. As would be expected she was much affected by the armed robbery with an offensive weapon.66 In R v Diamond NSWCCA, 18 February 1993, there was a marked disparity in the sentences imposed on co-offenders for the offence of armed robbery. The sentence imposed in the Children’s Court on one offender was so light as to be demonstrably erroneous and did not reflect the criminality of that offender. The District Court judge was troubled by the sentence imposed by the magistrate, which he described as being “too benign”.67 The majority held:(i) The sentencing amoury available to the Children’s Court is quite different to that available to courts dealing with adults but the sentence on the co-offender by the Children’s Court could not be excused on that basis(ii) even where disparity appears to exist, the decision whether to make a reduction in the greater sentence is a discretionary one(iii) there is a stage at which the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is so grave that the sense of grievance engendered can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one. (The majority held that that stage had been reached in that case).”68 In R v Govinden 106 A Crim R 314 there was a Crown appeal against the alleged inadequacy of the sentences imposed for robbery in company and accessory after the fact of armed robbery. Govinden was dealt with as an adult. He was aged about 18 years at the time of the commission of the two offences. Two of his co-offenders were dealt with in the Children’s Court.69 At [36] Dunford J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated that parity principles are not normally relevant to offenders who are dealt with under different regimes, but the sentences imposed on those dealt with in the Children’s Court are not, for that reason, entirely irrelevant; he referred to Broad, unreported, NSWCCA, 13 March 1984 per Street CJ, at p 3.70 In Govinden the view was taken that he was not the instigator of the offence and that it was not irrelevant to have regard to the sentence imposed on the instigator, a classmate at school, in the Children’s Court. It was held that it would be difficult to justify a full time custodial sentence in an adult gaol for Govinden, when the instigator received a non-custodial sentence. The Crown appeal was dismissed.71 In R v Colgan [1999] NSWCCA 292 Spigelman CJ observed at [15]: 
     
      
       
        “In  
       R v Govinden 
        (1999) NSWCCA 118, Dunford J who delivered the judgment of the Court referred to the authority in the Court to the effect that parity considerations do not arise, as such, when comparing a person dealt with in the Children’s Court and adults. Nevertheless as his Honour indicated at paragraph 36 of that judgment, that does not mean that the sentence imposed on a person in the Children’s Court, which would otherwise give rise to issues of parity, is irrelevant. This is so for the reason that an individual sentenced as an adult may very well have a justifiable sense of grievance with respect to that very difference of the regimes … This is important in a context where it may very well often be the case that a 16 year old is very much more mature than an 18 year old, as there is some reason to believe was the situation in the present appeal”. 
       
      
    72 Sully J at [11], after noting that one co-offender had been dealt with in the District Court and another co-offender who was probably the moving party, and a little more than 16 years at the time of the offences in the Children’s Court, said: 
     
      
       
        “It might very well be, as has been said in authorities to which the Court was referred, that what happens in such a context in the Children’s Court is not wholly irrelevant.” 
       
      
     The third member of the Court agreed with the Chief Justice and with Sully J.73 In R v Boney [2001] NSWCCA 432, he was sentenced at law to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of 18 months for the offence of armed robbery, (s 97(2) Crimes Act 1900), taking into account a further offence of take and drive conveyance without consent. The co-offender was dealt with in the Children’s Court for armed robbery and other offences, receiving in relation to those offences concurrent sentences of 100 hours community service, after taking into account four months detention pending sentence. The co-offender was the applicant’s brother and 18 months younger.74 Wood CJ at CL, with whom Grove J agreed, held: 
     
      
       
       (a) There is no longer an inflexible rule that there is no utility in comparing sentences upon co-offenders who are separately dealt with – one in the Children’s Court and the other as an adult. 
        
        
       (b) While there are different sentencing objectives and considerations applicable in the Children’s Court which limit the worth of any such comparison it is appropriate to pay some regard to the sentence imposed in the Children’s Court. 
        
        
       (c) Where there is a degree of disparity as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, the Court does not do so if the result would produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved. 
        
        
       (d) A stage can be reached at which the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is so great that the sense of grievance engendered can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one. 
        
        
       (e) As a corollary to (d), where a co-offender has received a comparatively more lenient sentence then the co-offender whose case is before the Court, the Court may exercise its discretion by declining to interfere because it does not wish to duplicate a gross error in the sentencing of the applicant’s co-offender. 
        
        
       (f) If this Court does intervene, whatever sentence is imposed must significantly reflect the objective and subjective criminality involved. Thus the sentence imposed by this Court may not be comparable to that imposed upon the co-offender. 
        
        
        I respectfully agree. 
       
      
    75 Applying the principles that have been discussed and in the circumstances revealed in the evidence in the instant case, including the significant limitations and disabilities of the applicant and in the absence of any suggestion of limitations and disabilities of either co-offender, this is a case where the Court may have cautious regard to the sentences imposed on D, the co-offender.76 This was a joint criminal enterprise where the three co-offenders worked closely together and all confronted the victim. At the sentencing hearing it was not thought profitable to endeavour to explore whether any of them had a greater moral culpability for the serious crime committed. However, their subjective circumstances and features differed.77 As N was aged 13 (nearly 14) at the time of the offences and was some five years three months younger than the applicant, had no prior armed robbery or robbery offences, had a period of intense offending in 2005 limited to some months and generally his offences were of lesser gravity, parity considerations are minimal to non-existent. Despite N’s young age he received no effective additional custodial punishment for the armed robbery offence because the non-parole period of two months was made wholly concurrent with the non-parole period of an existing control order for an unrelated offence.78 D was aged 17 at the time of the offence and 2 years 2 months younger than the applicant. There was no suggestion that he suffered from disabilities or limitations of the order of those of the applicant or any disabilities or limitations. His subjective features were more favourable than those of the applicant but seven months prior to the instant offence he was placed on a 12 months bond in the Children’s Court for the offence of robbery in company in mid-2004. There was the offence of break and enter a building with intent (steal) for which he was charged on 27 July 2005.79 D’s punishment for the instant offence of a control order for 7 months with a 3 months non-parole period suspended subject to entering into a 7 months good behaviour bond was also demonstrably erroneous in that it does not reflect the criminality of the armed robbery offence. The personal circumstances and features of D do not warrant such a minimal sentence for so serious an offence.80 Taking all the various matters and circumstances into account there is a marked and unjustifiable difference in the punishment imposed on the applicant and that imposed on D, even allowing for the different sentencing regimes and the more favourable subjective features and circumstances of D. A similar comment could be made about the sentence imposed upon N if parity considerations were important in his case. Making all necessary and generous allowances for the differences there is a lack of due proportion in the sentence meted out to D and that imposed on the applicant.81 While this Court should intervene the sentence imposed on the applicant must reflect the objective and subjective criminality involved in the offence. That requires a substantial sentence.82 There are special circumstances. Because of his limitations and disabilities the applicant is going to require supervision for an extended period. His drug and alcohol problems will continue to require attention. He will require more than conventional counselling. A great deal of work will have to be done with him and any recovery is likely to be slow and require persistence on his part and on the part of those who are helping him. He will need extensive preparation for employment. I do not overlook the steps taken while in custody.83 On re-sentencing I have taken into account the material in two affidavits read on his behalf. He is on the waiting list for a drug and alcohol course. He is doing a TAFE course in horticulture and one for obtaining a forklift licence. He is also working in a sewing shop from 8am to 2.30pm five days per week. He is still having problems with his concentration and gets distracted very easily. He is waiting to see a psychologist. On his release he wants to go back and live with his cousin in Brisbane where he has been before. He hopes to obtain work doing metal house framing which he has done previously or use his forklift ticket to help him find a job. The Corrective Services documents reveal that the applicant has had a C2 Minimum Security classification since 28 September 2006. After being sentenced he sought help with his drug and alcohol problems, anger management and in being able to read and write properly.84 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
         
         
        2. Appeal against sentence allowed, sentence quashed. 
         
        
       
      
     3. In lieu of the sentence imposed, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months commencing on 12 January 2006 and expiring on 11 July 2008 and a balance of term of 2 years 6 month commencing on 12 July 2008 and expiring on 11 January 2011. The applicant will become eligible for release on parole on 12 July 2008.

    JUDGMENT25.5.071 HIS HONOUR: The Bells Hotel in Woolloomooloo is a social and literary landmark of Sydney. In the early 1950’s it was purchased by Jimmy Carruthers after his retirement as a world champion boxer. This inspired the lines by poet Kenneth Slessor, 
     
      
      “God help the man who starts a blue 
       
      ""In the Bells Hotel in Woolloomooloo...” 
      
    2 A “blue” in the Australian vernacular is a dispute or fight. This case is about a fight which took place in the Bells Hotel in Woolloomooloo on 17 or 18 December 2004. Unlike Jimmy Carruthers in this respect, the publican was no fighter. He was a peaceful and sociable businessman. In a front bar brawl, he died from a blow or blows through no fault of his own, and notwithstanding the assistance of his family and fellow workers who unsuccessfully came to his aid. 3 This is an appeal to the District Court against the conviction on 20 September 2006 in the Local Court at North Sydney of Mudiawati Leota for an offence against section 316 of New South Wales Crimes Act. The charge was, in brief, that she failed to do her duty and inform police of her knowledge that her husband and or three of his friends had murdered the publican at the Bells Hotel and caused grievous bodily harm. 4 Following police investigations, suspicion fell upon certain people, particularly Joseph Leota, the husband of the appellant and three friends of his. 5 On 14 February 2005, following appropriate warrants being obtained, a listening device was covertly installed at the house at Merrylands occupied by Joseph Leota and the appellant, his wife. Merrylands is a suburb in the west of Sydney, about thirty kilometres from Woolloomooloo. 6 Joseph Leota is a man of south sea island background; the appellant is from an Indonesian background. 7 On 18 February 2005 police released a compilation tape which showed closed circuit television footage of the brawl on the night of 17 or 18 December 2004 when the publican killed. Other television news footage showed a senior police officer calling for people possessing relevant information to come forward (Exhibit 4).8 On 26 February 2005 the covert listening device secured some conversation between the appellant, her husband and another suspect, a man called Taiseni.9 On 3 March 2005 Joseph Leota was arrested and detained. The appellant was taken into immigration custody.10 On 15 June 2005 police interviewed the appellant and a record was made of the interview. That document is before me in evidence in Exhibit A (the crown brief on the appeal) and was of course before the magistrate.11 It is necessary to explain an aspect of the wording of the charge in the papers before me in this appeal. The charge is set out in the Court Attendance Notice in Exhibit A as follows: 
     
      
      “That the accused between 26/2/2005 and 15/6/2005 at Merrylands and elsewhere did fail without reasonable excuse to bring information to the attention of a member of the police force or other appropriate authority knowing that a serious offence had been committed, to wit, murder and assault occasioning grievous bodily harm by Joseph Leota, Etutate Taiseni, Taniela Motuapuka, Aminiasa Tuifua and that she, the said Mudi Leota had information which might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension of the said persons.” 
      
    12 This is the amended version of the charge appearing in the court documents and it is obviously what was intended to represent the charge, since several changes as to date and place were made by hand - presumably by the hand of the magistrate. However, when the learned magistrate gave his judgment (Exhibit A, transcript of 19 July 2006, page 21) he gave the broader dates of between 18 December 2004 and 15 June 2005, and placed the alleged offence at Woolloomooloo rather than at Merrylands. There is no evidence that the appellant was ever at Woolloomooloo. I will assume that the magistrate simply overlooked the amendment.13 On either version of the charge before the Local Court and before me, it is necessary for the crown to prove that the appellant knew: firstly, that a murder and assault occasioning grievous bodily harm had been committed; and secondly, that it had been committed by at least one of the four named individuals. 14 S 316(1) of the Crimes Act if as follows: 
     
      
      “If a person has committed a serious indictable offence and another person who knows or believes that the offence has been committed and that he or she has information which might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension of the offender or the prosecution or conviction of the offender for it fails without reasonable excuse to bring that information to the attention of a member of the Police Force or other appropriate authority, that other person is liable to imprisonment for 2 years.” 
      
    15 The charge in this case was not couched in the rather broader way that section would permit - that is, that the accused knew or believed the relevant matters. On my analysis of the evidence, however, such a formulation would make no difference in fact and to the result. There are other components of proof, but it is not necessary to consider them immediately.16 There can be little doubt that the appellant saw some television coverage of the fact that a fight had happened at The Bells Hotel on 17 or 18 December 2004. Precisely when she saw it is not clear, but it is assumed for the purpose of the exercise that she knew that what happened was a fight involving a murder.17 The main defect in the prosecution case is that there is no satisfactory evidence that the appellant knew that murder or assault occasioning grievous bodily harm had been committed by her husband, or by any of the other three men - that is, in terms of the section, that one of these persons was the offender.18 From the tape recorded conversation of 26 February 2005, (Exhibit A before the magistrate) the most that could be attributed to the appellant is some measure of suspicion about the man, Taiseni (“Eddie”). I have listened to the tape recording and various parts of it repeatedly. The typed version of it which is before the magistrate as MFI A is helpful, but not accurate. There are many incomprehensible parts. There are some words which I hear which are not on the aide memoire transcript.19 The crown case relies on what is transcribed as the commencement of the tape: 
     
      
       
        
        “ET - ‘the guy say to police, That’s my plan, that’s my plan and I’m the one that murdered that key, I’m the one that killed that man. 
        JL - ‘Fuck’. 
        Appellant - ‘Stupid, don’t be stupid’.” 
        
       
      
    20 I do not hear the word “fuck” attributed to the husband, but the word “what?” More importantly I read this, in context of the whole conversation quite differently from the way the crown contends and the way the magistrate interpreted it. Read as a whole, it is clear that Taiseni is saying that someone has made an allegation against him, but that the allegation is false.21 Later, after some further incomprehensible conversation, ET, that is Taiseni, says 
     
      
      “I don’t know when the police are going to turn up to my house, you know they’re gunna talk to my wife.” 
      
    22 The appellant gave some advice, 
     
      
      “You know what you do, you move now, move because they come, they’re gunna come.” 
      
    23 The appellant goes on to talk of some street-smart advice from some friend/lawyer/boss (which is not clear) who says it is always good practice that when the police come, 
     
      
      “Don’t say anything.” 
      
    24 From all of this it is clear that the appellant was attempting to assist Taiseni in some way. What is not clear is that she knew that he or any of the other three, including her husband, had committed murder or assault occasioning grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
      “ET ‘I know maybe the guy was dead, but we didn’t do nothing that day, we didn’t do any thing. Maybe we get charged, maybe the police. You walk.” 
      
    25 I hear various extra words in this conversation, particularly before the statement that  
     
      
      “We didn’t do nothing that day” 
      
    26 I hear 
     
      
      “We saw them that night, but” 
      
    27 which should read as  
     
      
      “We saw them that night, but we didn’t do nothing that day. We didn’t do anything.” 
      
    28 This is nothing like a confession of guilt to murder, either by Taiseni or any of the others named in the charge. The language is not clear, although it seems to be the language or a concerned man. It is not clear precisely what it is that he was concerned about, but it seems to have believed that “that guy” had spoken to police and mentioned his – Taiseni’s - name, wrongly. Not only does he dispute any criminality, he appears to decline the suggestion that he should move house, preferring to endure the prospect that the police should come if they were going to do so.29 Although the listening device was in place for some extended time at the house of the appellant and her husband, there is no other material pointing to the possession by the appellant of the necessary knowledge. 30 Other evidence upon which the prosecution relies is to be found in an interview with the appellant conducted by police on 15 June 2005 (Exhibit 3 in the Local Court). Questions and answers 84 to 86, 89 to 98, 138 to 148 are important. The appellant agreed that she heard about a murder in The Bells Hotel, but  
     
      
      “In the news only”. 
      
    31 She did not know that someone was killed until she read about it in the newspaper (Q 84). Her husband never told her that he was at The Bells Hotel (Q89), but he did tell her that he had been in a big fight (Q91): 
     
      
      “He tell me ‘it’s not your business’, that’s it.” 
      
    32 Her basic position was that  
     
      
      “It’s not my business, it’s his business.” 
      
    33 She denied that she knew that Eddie Taiseni was involved in the fight at The Bells Hotel until he had been arrested (Q142). She said she did not know how many days after 18 December it was that she knew anything. In fact she said  
     
      
      “But I don’t know, I don’t really know, I just see in the news and that’s it.” (Q151). 
      
    34 I can find in the evidence no basis for concluding that the husband or any of the others had confessed to or in the presence of the appellant. She was never relevantly at The Bells Hotel. Her house was bugged and the only real evidence against her is wholly insufficient to prove to the criminal standard the requisite knowledge (or even belief, if the charge had been constructed that way, which it was not). 35 Section 316 of the Crimes Act is not a provision which mandates the communication to police about suspicion of serious wrongdoing generally. For example, there are no doubt many parents of teenagers who would be concerned to think that they were required to “dob in” children whom they suspected, even strongly suspected of serious illegality involving drugs. Before criminality will be imposed there must be the requisite mental state, not only as to the fact of the serious indictable offence having been committed, but that it was committed by a particular person. It is only after these factors are proven that the broad terms 
     
      
       
      “might be of material assistance” 
      
     come into play. That possibility must relate to a crime which is known or believed to have been committed by a particular person.36 In this case, suspicion by the appellant is not enough: proof of her knowledge that either her husband or one of the other three had committed the murder or the other crime is required.37 The prosecution must fail. The appeal is upheld. The conviction and sentence imposed by the magistrate are quashed. I direct the entry on the record of a verdict of acquittal. 22.6.0738 HIS HONOUR: In this matter I heard an appeal against conviction on 25 May 2007. The decision was that the appeal was upheld, the convictions and orders of the Magistrate quashed, the verdict of acquittal was directed to be entered on the record. To the extent that it might be necessary, I add an order that the appellant is discharged. There was a costs application. The costs matter was before me on Friday 8 June 2007, and that matter has been argued. There were further written submissions. I have before me, as well, memoranda of fees from counsel, Mr Gregory Jones and Mr Clark, and a solicitor’s invoice. I have an analysis concerning costs from the crown. I am satisfied that the seriousness of this matter justified the use of two counsel and it seems to me that the amount claimed is fair and reasonable. Let me explain my reasons.39 In the first instance I indicated that the appeal was upheld. In that judgment I made it clear that analysis of the evidence resulted in my conclusion that the appellant lacked the requisite knowledge (or even belief if the charge had been constructed in that way, which it was not). For reasons of judicial economy, it was unnecessary for me to dilate upon any further reasons why the appeal might have been determined. The decision by the trial court focussed on the issue of knowledge.40 There were, however, several further defects of the prosecution case which in my view would vitiate the conviction. One is the argument urged by the defence before the Magistrate and since, that at the time the telephone bug was placed into the house at Merrylands, the police knew when the man, Taiseni and her husband were, and nothing that she could do would materially assist police in apprehending them, to use the word in the statute. These were not, to use the vernacular, “flown birds” - they were present in the house when police were listening to them via the electronic equipment.41 A second further consideration fatal to the conviction, which I do not need to spell out in detail, is that there was inadequate evidence before the learned Magistrate of the fact of a murder or of an offence of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm at all, by whomever committed. Certainly there was film shown on television relating to the incident. But proof of an incident in which someone dies does not prove murder or any other crime. A death might be accidental, or it might be some form of homicide less than murder. I make these observations to confirm the necessity that the prosecution was always bound to fail, which is of course a consideration in the costs application.42 The costs are sought under the Costs In Criminal Cases Act, and that statute allows costs to be given where on appeal the conviction of the defendant is quashed and the information or complaint upon which the defendant was convicted is dismissed: that is indeed the order (or is included in the orders) that I have made.43 But the power to order costs against the public prosecutor is limited by a special provision in the Crimes (Appeal & Review) Act 2001. That relatively recent provision is in the following terms applicable in this case: Section 70(1):  
     
      
      “Costs are not to be awarded in favour of an appellant whose conviction is set aside unless the appeal court is satisfied:  
       
        
         
        (a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner, or  
         
         
        (b) that the proceedings in the Local Court were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith, or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner...” 
        
       
      
    44 The provision continues, but it is unnecessary for me to set out any more. Section 72 is relevant. There is an order that an appellant or respondent pay costs. The order must direct that the costs be paid to the Registrar of the original Local Court and must state a time within which the amount must be paid.45 As I have indicated, I make the cost orders sought. In my view the initiation of the proceedings in the Local Court was always without reasonable cause on the evidence available to the prosecution at the time of its initiation. As I said in the principal judgment on the appeal, I respectfully disagree with the analysis of the facts by the learned trial Magistrate. It seems to me that the applicant never possessed the state of mind required for proof of the charge as particularised.46 Further on the costs application, Mr Jones repeated the submission upon which he had relied from the beginning - that the charge as pleaded alleged that the police could have been assisted in the “apprehension” of the alleged offenders, and yet at all material times the relevant alleged offenders appeared to have been the subject to actual surveillance by police. The police knew where they were; they were simply seeking evidence against them; anything that Mrs Leota could have told police was immaterial to the apprehension to the alleged offenders. It might have been material to the possible prosecution of the alleged offenders, but in the circumstances it could not have been material to their apprehension. That is the way the charge was laid and particularised, and no amendment of the charge was sought or made in those terms.47 In my view, the use by the legislature of the word “material” to qualify “assistance” is an emphasis on practical reality rather than on the hypothetical. This supports Mr Jones’ argument. Furthermore, the crown has argued on the costs application that the word “apprehension” should be given a wider meaning than mere physical capture, and that in that wider sense it can support the charge. I do not accept this. In section 316 “apprehension” and “prosecution” appear as separate terms. The essential meaning of “apprehension” in this context is indeed “physical capture or arrest”. As I have said earlier a similarly fatal and fundamental vice of the prosecution lies in the failure of the prosecution to prove that a murder or an assault occasioning grievous bodily harm had been committed. Even at the present time, as I understand it, no charges against anyone over the Bells Hotel incident have been determined. Proceedings may be ongoing and I will make no comment about any pending matter. However it is clear that over the period of the time frame of the charge, however calculated, nobody had been convicted of murder or assault occasioning grievous bodily harm arising out of the matter.48 Of course for the purpose of an ancillary charge such as this, the fact of murder having been committed or the fact of an assault occasioning grievous bodily harm having been committed might have been proved by other evidence than the fact of a conviction. However no such evidence was presented before the learned Magistrate or me. It is difficult to resist the thought that the present prosecution may have been launched in part with the hope in mind that the applicant might, “spill the beans”, so to speak, on her husband and the other alleged offenders. Such a prosecutorial motivation would not in itself be improper. Where a crime apparently occurs and there are various people suspected, prosecuting authorities who charge a number of parties are legitimately entitled to hope that one or more of them will “crack”, reveal all and incriminate others. This is a standard practice where there are multiple offenders. It is often successful and, in the real world, clears up much criminality.49 However, such an approach depends upon there being reasonable evidence to sustain a charge against the party or parties charged. One critical determinant of whether there is such reasonable evidence is the terms of the charge as pleaded. Prosecution for merely tactical reasons would not be proper, although I do not take the view that there was any such impropriety in this case. It was certainly legitimate for the crown perhaps to have a hope that the prosecution such as this might result in the revelation of material which would comprehensively clear up the matter. However, in the present case, correct legal analysis demonstrates that there was no reasonable basis for the charge as laid.50 This is not a finding that the charge laid against Mrs Leota was malicious or improper. The language used in the tape recorded conversation excited suspicion. The prosecution of alleged offences such as that against Mrs Leota has historically been difficult. The ancient law of misprision of felony, which predates this statute, was doubtful and difficult to apply. It was these doubts and difficulties which lead to the enactment of a suite of “Offences Against Justice” in the part of the Crimes Act where section 316 appears; but this exercise in partial codification has not been wholly successful. The Court of Criminal Appeal has referred on several occasions to the complexities and difficulties of prosecutions of this kind.51 However, whatever these complexities and difficulties may be, they do not justify the present prosecution of Mrs Leota where the prosecution was never going to be successful. The failed prosecution was based on legal misjudgement rather than on bad faith, but it was still not reasonable. The law of costs in criminal cases of this kind is not governed by the necessity to show prosecutorial bad faith. I have referred to section 70. Section 70(1B) distinguishes between proceedings initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith. In this case there was no bad faith, but there was a failure of reasonableness in terms of the section.52 I direct that the respondent pay costs in the sum of $18,766. The costs are to be paid to the Registrar or the Local Court at North Sydney within sixty days.

      Introduction 
       
      
    3 The respondent pleaded guilty to the following charges: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 – He did on 7 February 2006 supply an amount of a prohibited drug, to wit, 1.2 kilograms of methylemedioxymethylamphetamine (ecstasy), being an amount which was greater than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug contrary to the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985  
        s 25(2); 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 – He did on 2 March 2006 supply an amount of a prohibited drug, to wit, 4.5 kilograms of methylemedioxymethylamphetamine (ecstasy), being an amount which was greater than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug contrary to the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985  
        s 25(2); 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3 – He did on 2 March 2006 supply a prohibited drug, to wit, 32.55 grams of cocaine contrary to the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985  
        s 25(1). 
        
       
      
    4 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 25(2) is life imprisonment or a fine of $550,000 or both. A standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment is applicable. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 25(1) is 15 years imprisonment or a fine of $220,000 or both. 
     
      
    5 The respondent was also convicted, pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, in respect of a charge of goods in custody. The maximum penalty in respect of that offence is imprisonment for 6 months.  
     
      
    6 On 14 November 2006, the respondent was sentenced for those offences by Tupman DCJ as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 – non parole period of 5 years imprisonment commencing on 2 March 2006 and expiring on 1 March 2011 with a parole period of 3 years commencing on 2 March 2011 and expiring on 1 March 2014; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 – non-parole period of 6 years imprisonment commencing on 2 March 2006 and expiring on 1 March 2012 with a parole period of 3 years commencing on 2 March 2012 and expiring on 1 March 2015; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3 – fixed term of 2 years imprisonment commencing on 2 March 2006 and expiring on 1 March 2008. 
        
       
       
        
        Section 166 - goods in custody offence a fixed term of 4 months imprisonment commencing on 2 March 2006 and expiring on 1 July 2006. 
        
       
      
    7 The aggregate sentence was thus 9 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 6 years. All sentences commenced on 2 March 2006.8 The Crown has appealed against the sentences on the ground they are manifestly inadequate. It submitted that the individual sentences on counts 1 and 2 and the aggregate sentence did not adequately reflect the objective criminality involved. 
     
      
       
       
      The Facts 
       
      
    9 The relevant facts, in short, were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 – The respondent and a Mr Maule became the target of a drug squad investigation in late 2005 and into March 2006. Numerous telephone and other conversations of the respondent were lawfully monitored. The respondent spoke almost daily to Mr Maule during this period in relation to the supply of prohibited drugs. A controlled operation was set up. This resulted in the respondent supplying 5,000 ecstasy tablets weighing 1.2 kilograms to a police undercover operative on 7 February 2006 for the sum of $75,000 cash. The cash was never recovered. A sample of the tablets to be supplied given to the undercover operator before the supply was effected had a purity of 30.5%. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 – On 2 March 2006 the respondent supplied a further 18,000 ecstasy tablets weighing 4.217 kilograms to the police undercover operative. This was part of 25,000 tablets which the respondent had agreed to supply. The respondent was arrested at that time. A sample of the tablets was given to the undercover operative before the supply had been affected. The sample had a purity of 22.5%. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3 – Following his arrest the respondent’s premises were searched. Cocaine weighing 32.55 grams was located during that search.  
        
       
       
        
        Section 166 – on his arrest the respondent was searched and $8,460 was located on him. He admitted the funds were unlawfully obtained. 
        
       
       
      The findings 
       
      
    10 Her Honour made the following findings as to the objective seriousness of the offences: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. All of the offences were very serious particularly counts 1 and 2. The quantity involved in counts 1 and 2 called for condign punishment. The maximum penalty of life imprisonment clearly indicated the seriousness of those two charges.  
         
         
        2. The respondent was involved in the trafficking of illegal drugs to a significant extent. He was more than a mere runner or courier but he did not appear to have any control over the manufacture of the drugs, nor any real ability to source them except through Mr Maule. 
        
       
       
        
        3. He was involved in this enterprise for financial gain in part to fund his own addiction to drugs though that was not the only motivation given the size of the enterprise. It was unclear how much the respondent was to receive for his involvement.  
        
       
       
        
        4. The fact that the supply was to undercover operatives did not decrease the seriousness of the offence though the fact that the drugs never did and never were likely to find their way to end users was to be taken into account though this was not known to the respondent. 
         
         
        5. The public funds used for the first purchase were never recovered though there was nothing to suggest they had been retained by the respondent. 
        
       
      
    11 Her Honour concluded the respondent had a very strong subjective case. She made the following findings in that regard: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    1. The respondent was a young man (born on 13 May 1977). He had no prior criminal record. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    2. He came from a very dysfunctional background being born in South Africa to a relatively well off family who were more concerned in advancing their business interests than the welfare of the respondent. The respondent was sent to boarding school at the age of 5. He started to drink alcohol at about 11 or 12 and to abuse prohibited drugs not long afterwards. His father sent him to Australia on two occasions to live with relatives virtually as a banishment or to get away from what was thought to be temptation. The Australian relatives were not informed of the respondent’s problems with alcohol or drugs. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    3. The respondent suffers from some brain damage though this does not seriously impact on his behaviour. He has some minor cognitive deficits on testing. This has some, although relatively minor, causal connection with his increasingly addictive behaviour and ultimate involvement in these offences.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    4. The Australian relatives are now fully aware of the extent of the respondent’s drug addiction and are committed to helping him overcome it. The respondent has been forced to recognise the full extent of his drug addiction and the impact it has on his life. If motivated the respondent can rehabilitate to the extent that hopefully he will not come before the Courts again. His prospects of rehabilitation however, are entirely dependent on remaining drug free and away from the drug milieu and environment. Her Honour accepted the opinion of Dr Greenberg that:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            … the respondent’s overall prognosis was somewhat guarded because he has had such a long, ongoing addiction to drugs and thus his prospects of rehabilitation are somewhat guarded. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    5. The respondent pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. Her Honour assessed the pleas of guilty as giving rise to an overall discount of 30% taking into account both the utilitarian value of the pleas and the contrition and remorse represented by them. 
     
      
       
      Quantification 
       
      
    12 Her Honour, in her Remarks on Sentence quantified the sentences as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Count 1 – Absent the plea of guilty an overall term of imprisonment of 12 years would be called for which, reduced by 30%, gives rise to an overall period of 8 years. I would propose a non-parole period of 5 years on the finding of special circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Count 2 – The overall term of imprisonment called for was 14 years as a greater amount of ecstasy than in count 1 was involved. The 14 years is reduced by 5 years to take account of the plea giving rise to an overall period of 9 years. A non-parole period of 6 years was set on the finding of special circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Count 3 – An overall term of imprisonment of about 3 years  
         
          
        would have been set, reduced to 2 years to take into account  
        
       
      
     the plea. 
     
      
       
      Discussion 
       
      
    13 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        54A(2) For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table to this Division. 
        
       
       
        
        54B(1) This section applies when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for an offence set out in the Table to this Division. 
         
        (2) When determining the sentence for the offence, the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. 
         
        (3) The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in section 21A. 
         
        (4) The court must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account. 
         
        (5) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate the sentence. 
        
       
      
    14 The standard non parole period was framed upon the assumption that the case was determined at trial. Accordingly it is not directly applicable where there has been a plea of guilty. Nevertheless in that situation it serves a role as a reference point – Regina v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [122], Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [15]. 
     
      
    15 In R v Mills [2005] NSWCCA 175 Wood CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, held: 
     
      
       
        
        [49] I do not consider that this was a sufficient compliance with the requirements of s 54B(4). A mere statement of the conclusion, accompanied by a confirmation that the submissions of counsel, and the circumstances of the case, have been taken into account, does not constitute an identification of the reasons which are expected in the case which falls within the umbrella of the Division. As is also the case in relation to s 21A of the Act, more is expected than mere lip service to the legislation. What is required is the clear identification of the relevant factors, the weight given to them, and their role in the structuring of the sentencing order. 
        
       
       
        
        [50] The present case, it may be accepted, was one involving pleas of guilty, so that the role of the standard non parole period was as a reference or check point. That circumstance does not however lessen the obligation to given adequate reasons in relation to this aspect of sentencing. 
        
       
       
        
        [51] The absence of sufficient reasons does not necessarily guarantee intervention by this Court.  
        
       
      
    16 Her Honour in her Remarks on Sentence said: 
     
      
       
        
        It seems to me when assessed objectively and to the extent that such a finding is necessary in any event given the plea of guilty, that none the less these two first offences are below the mid range in terms of objective seriousness. I stress that such a finding may not be necessary in terms of assessing the applicability of the standard non parole period but I make that finding in any event. Perhaps more significantly in terms of the issue of the standard non parole period is that this is a case in which there is a plea of guilty and one entered at the first available opportunity. In accordance with the dicta of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the  
        R v Way 
        , the standard non parole period does not apply strictly, though I am and have, taken it into account as an indicator or guidepost in reaching the appropriate sentence for these two first offences. 
        
       
      
    17 Her Honour did not identify the factors that caused her to conclude that the offences under counts 1 and 2 were “below the mid range in terms of objective seriousness”. 18 It was submitted that the Court should infer from her Honour’s starting points for counts 1 and 2 that she had erroneously treated the standard non parole period of 15 years as an indicator of the total sentence rather than an indicator of the non parole period. I would reject this submission. The sentencing Judge was very experienced and an elementary error of the type sought to be attributed to her is, in itself, improbable, particularly as in the relevant passage she made express reference to the “standard non parole period”. 
     
      
    19 However the objective factors in this case are such that I am driven to the conclusion that her Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the count 1 and 2 offences was erroneous and has led to sentences which are definitely outside the appropriate range in respect of those counts – R v Wall (2002) NSWCCA 42 at [70] and which, notwithstanding this is a Crown appeal, require the intervention of this Court.  
     
      
    20 The objective factors include, in particular, those recorded by her Honour namely the maximum penalty of life imprisonment as an indicator of the seriousness of the offences, the respondent’s involvement in trafficking to a significant level and at a level above that of a runner or courier and his involvement in a large scale enterprise for financial gain. To those factors may be added the fact that the total amount of ecstasy involved was more than 10 times the large commercial quantity of 0.5 kg, and the agreed fact that the total street value of the tablets supplied was over $1,150,000. There was nothing in the evidence which suggested that the respondent did not have a full appreciation of the nature, extent and seriousness of the offences. Indeed the respondent said in evidence he thought he was just lucky not to have been caught with drugs or offending at an earlier time. 
     
      
    21 In my opinion the objective seriousness of the count 2 offence places it, at least, in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for an offence under s 25(2) whilst the count 1 offence, because of the lesser quantity of ecstasy involved, is a little below that level. 
     
      
    22 Mathematically the discount which her Honour allowed for the pleas of guilty in respect of counts 1 and 2 exceeded the 30% nominated by her. That discount included an allowance for contrition. Such an allowance is to be avoided - R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [42] and [44]. The appropriate discount for the utilitarian value of the plea on resentence is 25 percent. 
     
      
    23 Her Honour found special circumstances in that this was the first time the respondent had been in gaol, his relative youth, the need for rehabilitation and the somewhat longer than normal period of supervision in the community which he would require.The Crown in its written submissions stated: 
     
      
       
        
        It is not disputed it was open to her Honour to find special circumstances, and the degree of variation of the statutory ratio as such is not the subject of complaint.  
        
       
       
      Resentence 
       
      
    24 In resentencing I have proceeded on the basis the count 2 offence is in the middle of the range for objective seriousness and the count 1 offence a little below that range. I have had regard to the standard non parole period as a reference or check point. I have taken into account the respondent’s subjective factors as found by her Honour and her finding of special circumstances. I have had regard to the fact the respondent commenced upon a course of drug abuse whilst in his early teens though this factor has limited importance having regard to the respondent’s significant involvement for profit in commercial drug supply. I have had regard to the restraints referred to in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]. 
     
      
    25 In my opinion the appropriate sentence on count 2 is a non parole period of 8 years imprisonment with a balance of term of 5 years. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion the appropriate sentence on count 1 is a fixed term of 6 years imprisonment. I would decline to set a non parole period in respect of that sentence as it will be largely subsumed in the sentence imposed for the more serious offence under count 2. 
     
      
    27 I would not vary the sentences in respect of count 3 or in respect of the goods in custody offence. 
     
      
       
      Accumulation 
       
      
    28 Her Honour determined that each sentence should commence on 2 March 2006. Her Honour said, as to the question of accumulation: 
     
      
       
        
        They are separate offences, but if accumulated would give rise to a total overall period of imprisonment, as to the two more serious of them of 17 years with a non parole period of 11 years, which it seems to me is excessive to reflect the seriousness of the offence and the subjective circumstances of this prisoner. 
        
       
      
    29 Her Honour made all sentences concurrent. She made no reference in her Remarks on Sentence to the possibility of partial accumulation. The Crown submitted that her Honour erred in structuring the sentences so that they were entirely concurrent with no apparent consideration of the question of partial accumulation. 
     
      
    30 In Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 it was held: 
     
      
       
        
        A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality. 
        
       
      
    31 It was held in R v Knight [2004] NSWCCA 145 at [31] that: 
     
      
       
        
        The fundamental principle in sentencing for multiple offences is that the overall sentence imposed must reflect the totality of the criminality evidenced by those offences. 
        
       
      
    32 The count 1 and 2 offences were very serious. They involved two separate supplies and occurred at different times though each was part of the same police operation. The third count was a separate offence. It was serious and related to a different type of drug though the individual sentence for that offence was not the subject of submissions by the Crown. 
     
      
    33 In R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 Simpson J said at [7]: 
     
      
       
        
        Whether or not to accumulate sentences imposed in relation to multiple offences is, in the end, an exercise of discretion to be made in accordance with established principle.  
        
       
      
    34 In my opinion her Honour erred in the exercise of her discretion in failing to partially accumulate the sentences on counts 1 and 2. In my opinion there must be at least some measure of accumulation in the overall structuring of the individual sentences. Simply to date each of the sentences from a common commencing date entails, in a real sense, that the respondent is not being adequately punished for each of the serious criminal offences committed by him (c/f R v Drollett NSWCCA unreported 14 February 2002). 
     
      
    35 Counsel for the respondent at the sentencing hearing had submitted her Honour could partially accumulate or alternatively could increase the sentence on count 2 to reflect the totality of the criminality disclosed by all of the offences. It was submitted the Crown had said nothing against that submission and could not now assert that her Honour had erred in failing to accumulate the sentence.  
     
      
    36 This Court has interpreted Pearce as prohibiting the practice of increasing a sentence for one offence merely to reflect the totality of the criminality disclosed by all of the offences for which sentence was being passed – R v Knight [2004] NSWCCA 145.  
     
      
    37 A fair reading of the transcript of the sentencing hearing makes it clear that the Crown did not acquiesce in any such approach. A “non response” should not be taken as an acquiescence. Her Honour’s approach was, in any event, equivocal. She initially said the count 2 offence required a slightly longer sentence because of the greater amount of ecstasy involved. She used a 14 year starting point as opposed to the 12 years starting point which was used for the count 1 offence and she set a non parole period of 6 years on the same findings of special circumstances as in the first count. Later she stated: 
     
      
       
        
        I have come to the conclusion that as to the two most serious offences the non parole period of 6 years is sufficient to reflect the totality with a parole period of 3 years, and thus to give rise to that overall assessment of totality, I thus propose that the sentences for the first 2 offences be served concurrently. 
        
       
      
    38 Bearing in mind the constraints which are applied to Crown appeals as summarised in R v Wall I have concluded that the structure of the sentences should be varied to provide for a partial accumulation of 1 year. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    39 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Appeal upheld; 
         
         
        (2) The sentence as to count 1 is quashed; 
        
       
       
        
        (3) In lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced on count 1 to a fixed term of 6 years imprisonment commencing on 2 March 2006 and expiring on 1 March 2012; 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The sentence as to count 2 is quashed; 
        
       
       
        
        (5) In lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced on count 2 to a non parole period of 8 years imprisonment commencing on 2 March 2007 and expiring on 1 March 2015 with a balance of term of 5 years commencing on 2 March 2015 and expiring on 1 March 2020; 
        
       
       
        
        (6) The sentences in respect of count 3 and the goods in custody offence dealt with pursuant to s 166 of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
         are confirmed.

    1 HER HONOUR: By summons filed 16 August 2006, firstly, the first plaintiff seeks a declaration that proceedings with respect to a Court Attendance Notice (CAN) issued 11 March 2005 for sequences numbered 1-8 were carried on by the Magistrate without jurisdiction and that ipso jure the convictions recorded against him in respect thereof are null and void. Secondly, the second plaintiff seeks a declaration that proceedings with respect to a CAN issued 11 March 2005 were carried on by the Magistrate without jurisdiction and that ipso jure the convictions recorded against him in respect thereof are null and void. 
     
      
    2 The first plaintiff is Paul Charles Wallace (Mr Wallace). The second plaintiff is Paul Anthony Harrison (Mr Harrison). The first defendant is the Director General – NSW Department of Primary Industries (the Director General). The second defendant is Local Court Magistrate Shaughan McCosker. There is no submitting appearance on file on behalf of the second defendant. For convenience, in this judgment, I shall refer to the parties by name. 
     
      
    3 On 11 March 2005 Mr Wallace and Mr Harrison were both convicted in the Local Court at Taree of offences arising under the Fisheries Management Act 1994 (NSW) (the Fisheries Management Act) and the Fisheries Management (Lobster Share Management Plan) Regulation 2000 (NSW) (the Fisheries Management Lobster Regulation).  
     
      
       
      Grounds of review 
       
      
    4 Mr Wallace and Mr Harrison seek declarations that the Local Court proceedings were without jurisdiction due to an alleged failure to comply with a statutory requirement, thereby rendering the convictions null and void on the grounds that each of the Court Attendance Notices (CAN) served upon them were deficient because they did not identify the prosecutor by name as required by s 175(3)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).  
     
      
    5 Under the old regime contained in the Justices Act 1902, proceedings for summary offences were usually commenced by the laying of an information. It was the laying of the information that founded the court’s jurisdiction to deal with the offence – see John L Proprietary Limited v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 163 CLR 508. Provision to secure the attendance of the defendant at court was made separately by the issue of a summons. So under the old regime, summary offences were initiated by means of two documents, an information and a summons. 
     
      
    6 The information and summons regime was replaced by a Court Attendance Notice. Section 172(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that proceedings for an offence are to be commenced in a Court by the issue and filing of a Court Attendance Notice in accordance with that Division. The CAN incorporates both the information and summons.  
     
      
    7 Counsel for the plaintiffs referred to the Second Reading Speech for the Courts Legislation Miscellaneous Amendments Act 2002 (NSW) where Mr Moss, Parliamentary Secretary on behalf of the Attorney General said that it was not intended that the Justices Act reform package change the law in relation to the contents of the initiating process and therefore ss 50 and 175 will be amended to more closely reflect the language of the current law – see NSW Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 23 October 2002. Hence, the approach taken by Counsel for the plaintiffs is that the requirements set out in s 175 are the same as they were under the Justice Act. 
     
      
    8 On each of the CANs the following information appeared in relation to the prosecutor. 
     
      
       
        
         
         Prosecutor: 
         Director-General, NSW Department ofPrimary Industries 
         
         
         Responsible Officer: 
         N. Hams 
         
         
         Address: 
         [Supplied] 
         
         
         Telephone: 
         [Supplied] 
         
         
         Date of issue of Court Attendance Notice: 
         11th March 2005 
         
        
       
      
    9 When the proceedings were listed for hearing before the Magistrate, formal objection was taken to each CAN on the basis that the notices failed to nominate the “prosecutor”. The Magistrate stated that he was satisfied that the documents describing the person responsible did comply with the legislation. After that ruling, Mr Wallace and Mr Harrison pleaded guilty. They were convicted and fines were imposed for each offence. 
     
      
       
      The offences 
       
      
    10 Section 3(1) of the Fisheries Management Act provides that “the objects of this Act are to conserve, develop and share the fishery resources of the State for the benefit of present and future generations.” This Act and the FM Lobster Regulation create various offences consistent with the broad object of the Fisheries Management Act. The offences set out in the Fisheries Management Lobster Regulation are made pursuant to s 289 of the Fisheries Management Act.  
     
      
    11 These criminal penalty provisions in the Fisheries Management Act and Fisheries Management Lobster Regulation relevantly include s 65, contravention of plan, cl 22, rock lobster to have tag attached, cl 42, storage of live rock lobsters, cl 48, daily log sheet and cl 55, endorsement holder offence. These are the offences contained in the CAN. 
     
      
       
      The interpretation of s 175(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 
       
      
    12 Section 175(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) A court attendance notice must do the following:  
         
         
          
          (a) describe the offence, 
           
           
          (b) briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence, 
           
           
          (c) contain the name of the prosecutor, 
           
           
          (d) require the accused person to appear before the court at a specified date, time and place, unless a warrant is issued for the arrest of the person or the person is refused bail, 
           
           
          (e) state, unless a warrant is issued for the arrest of the person or the person is refused bail, that failure to appear may result in the arrest of the person or in the matter being dealt with in the absence of the person.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    13 The plaintiffs submitted that the terms of s 175(3) are mandatory, not directory and that the description of the prosecutor does not comply with the requirements of subsection (3). The Director General submitted that s 175(3)(c) does not require the prosecutor to be identified by the officer’s proper name or as a natural person. In any event, according to the Director General the identity of the prosecutor could only be one natural person as there is only one person who occupies the position of the Director General. Thus, the identity of the prosecutor responsible for the instituting and conducting the prosecution is known. 
     
      
    14 It is trite law that an accused person is entitled to know the identity of the prosecutor responsible for instating or conducting the prosecution. Section 175(3) says that a CAN must contain the name of the prosecutor. 
     
      
    15 Section 175 has been the subject of a recent decision of this Court and a decision of the Court of Appeal. They are Knaggs v Director of Public Prosecutions [2007] NSWCA 83 and Graham Blight v Inspector Barber [2007] NSWSC 448. Knaggs involved whether the particulars of the offence in the CAN fulfilled the requirements of s 175(3)(b) and Blight involved whether a CAN issued without the information contained in s 175(e) was invalid. 
     
      
    16 In Knaggs, Campbell JA (with whom Mason P and Tobias AJA agreed) canvassed the statutory interpretation with particular focus upon s 175(3)(b). While I refer to it, I do not need to repeat all of it here.  
     
      
    17 Relevantly Campbell JA in Knaggs stated at [53]: 
     
      
       
        
        “53 …, another aid to construction is that the word  
        ""must"" 
         appears in both section 175(1) and in section 175(3). Section 175(1) states that a CAN  
        ""must"" 
         be in the form prescribed by the rules – yet section 175(2) confers a mere permission for the rules to prescribe court forms, rather than a positive requirement. The form of the legislation therefore left open the possibility, which has in fact happened, that there is no prescribed form. It would be strange if a failure to comply with section 175(1), through not using  
        ""the form prescribed by the rules"" 
         for a CAN, made that CAN void. Indeed, if that were so, every CAN that the Local Court has issued since the commencement of section 175 would be void, all convictions obtained pursuant to proceedings commenced by such a CAN would be void, and all acquittals obtained in proceedings commenced by such a CAN would be likewise void and so would not give rise to a defence of  
        autrefois acquit 
        . I doubt that the legislature is likely to have intended those consequences. If a failure to comply with what section 175(1) says  
        ""must"" 
         be done does not necessarily result in invalidity of the CAN, that suggests that failure to comply with what section 175(3) says  
        ""must"" 
         be done does not necessarily result in invalidity of the CAN either.” 
        
       
      
    18 The Court of Appeal in Knaggs concluded at [60]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In all these circumstances, and purely as a matter of construction of the legislation, I do not conclude that the legislature intended that a contravention of section 175(3)(b) would result in the invalidity of the CAN, and of any convictions that result in proceedings commenced by such a CAN.” 
        
       
      
    19 And in Blight, Price J stated at [28]-[29]: 
     
      
       
        
        “28 It is well established that a failure to comply with a legislative requirement that some act must be done in a particular way does not necessarily result in invalidity. The test for determining the issue of validity is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid: see  
        Project Blue Sky Inc & Others v Australian Broadcasting Authority  
        (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 388-390. There are, as was recognised in  
        Knaggs 
         [at 34-37] particular considerations that relate to legislative provisions concerning the manner in which the jurisdiction of courts is exercised or invoked. When a statutory provision relates to the exercising by a court of jurisdiction, particular principles of construction of legislation come into play. There is a “basic rule” that it is presumed that the Parliament does not intend to cut down the jurisdiction of courts save to the extent that the legislation in question expressly so states or necessarily implies: see  
        Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth 
         (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 505 [72],  
        Berowra Holdings Pty Ltd v Gordon 
         [2006] HCA 32 at [31].  
         
         
        29 No express provision is made in s 175(3)(e) or in the CP Act itself for the consequences of a failure to provide the required statement. There is no express statement that proceedings commenced by a CAN, which does not comply, will be invalid. Nor is there, in my view, a necessary implication of invalidity.” 
        
       
      
    20 Hence, it is also my view, that although s 175(3) says “must” be done it does not necessarily result in the invalidity of the CAN. 
     
      
    21 In any event, there is another provision in the Criminal Procedure Act which is relevant to s 175(3)(c). It is s 16(1)(f) which reads:  
     
      
       
        
        “16(1) An indictment is not bad, insufficient, void, erroneous or defective on any of the following grounds: 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) for designating any person by the name of his or her office, or other descriptive appellation, instead of by his or her proper name.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    22 In relation to whether the name of the prosecutor was insufficient because it did not refer to his proper name, s 16(1)(f) provides that in this circumstance the indictment is not bad, insufficient, void, erroneous or defective.  
     
      
    23 It is my view that firstly, the description of the prosecutor in the CANs was sufficient; secondly, if the description of the prosecutor was not sufficient, s 16(1)(f) provides that the indictment is not void or defective; and thirdly, if there was a contravention of s 175, it does not result in the invalidity of the CAN. 
     
      
    24 No error has been established which entitles the plaintiffs to the declaration sought. The Magistrate had the jurisdiction to hear the proceedings. The summons filed 16 August 2006 is dismissed.  
     
      
    25 Costs are discretionary. Costs usually follow the event. The plaintiffs are to pay the defendants’ costs as agreed or assessed. 
     
      
       
      The Court orders: 
       
       
      (1) The summons filed 16 August 2006 is dismissed.  
       
       
      (2) The plaintiffs are to pay the defendants’ costs as agreed or assessed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
       Non-publication order in relation to the name of the complainant and any matter that can identify the complainant 
       
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was tried in relation to four counts of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation and one count of aggravated indecent assault. He was acquitted in relation to the sexual intercourse charges but was convicted in relation to the count of aggravated indecent assault. The circumstances of aggravation were that the complainant was under the age of 16 years, namely 11 years of age.  
     
      
    2 The maximum penalty for the offence of aggravated indecent assault is provided by s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, being 7 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years. 
     
      
    3 The appellant was sentenced to a total term of 2 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months. 
     
      
       
      Relevant evidence 
       
      
    4 The Crown case was that the aggravated indecent assault count, which was the fourth count on the indictment, and the fifth count, which alleged sexual intercourse by digital penetration of the complainant, all occurred on the same day. The appellant had been married to, but has since separated from, the complainant’s grandmother (CI). However, he maintained living arrangements with her. 
     
      
    5 On 22 December 2004 the complainant was staying at her grandmother’s house. The appellant was in the house alone with the complainant. Her grandmother returned home, walked into the kitchen and looked into the lounge room. She said that she saw her granddaughter seated on a lounge chair with her trousers and underpants around her ankles.  
     
      
    6 There is a fundamental inconsistency between the evidence of the grandmother and the complainant’s father (TC) as to whether the appellant was first seen kneeling or standing. The grandmother gave evidence that she saw the appellant standing in front of the chair where the child was sitting. She said that he had his pants around his ankles. 
     
      
    7 The complainant’s father said that he saw the appellant “kneeling down in between my daughter’s legs with his pants off and her pants off.” He said the appellant came up from a kneeling position “when he realised we were there.” When cross-examined CI said for the first time that both the appellant’s pants and underpants were off. This was inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence. She said the appellant’s underpants were on all the time and never down but his pants were down. 
     
      
    8 The appellant said he was not wearing a belt. TC said nothing about a belt and CI said nothing about a belt in her evidence in chief or in her statement to the police. However, for the first time in cross-examination CI said she heard the clanging of the appellant’s belt when she entered the lounge room. 
     
      
    9 The Crown case was that, when she saw the complainant and the appellant, the grandmother screamed, the appellant pulled up his trousers and the complainant ran to her grandmother. It was after this had happened that the complainant’s father entered the room. Very shortly thereafter he contacted the police by phoning 000. He reported that his daughter had been “raped.” Only after reporting the matter did the complainant’s father question the complainant as to whether the appellant had touched her. She replied “he was trying to but I put my hand there.”  
     
      
    10 Sometime later, but on the same day, the complainant was taken to the local hospital where she was examined by Dr Young. Dr Young took a history from the complainant of the appellant taking down his trousers, although leaving his underpants on, and then pulling down the complainant’s pants and underpants before putting his hand down where “her rude part is” and putting his finger “inside.” The complainant said it hurt her, “it felt like a severe pain inside my rude parts.” 
     
      
    11 Dr Young carried out a physical examination of the complainant. She observed a “darkening bruise which was rather large on the upper right leg at the back” which she understood was caused by an incident when the complainant was playing at school. The bruise was 25 cm in length and varied between 4 and 2 cm in width. 
     
      
    12 Dr Young carried out an examination of the complainant’s genitalia. However, she was unable to complete the examination. When she retracted the labia “very gently”, she described it as “very very angry and it was very very red, but the most important thing it was extremely painful, it was exquisitely painful so just a light touch would cause intense pain.” 
     
      
    13 The doctor was of the opinion that the pain that she would inflict by a thorough and meticulous examination of the complainant would be unbearable. The doctor also concluded that the inflammation was due to an infection to which, by reason of her physical condition (including high blood sugar levels), the complainant was susceptible. She was of the opinion that the complainant’s infection would have caused her pain on urination.  
     
      
    14 When first interviewed by the police on 23 December 2004 the complainant did not say anything about pain. In fact when asked what she could feel when the appellant’s hand was on her private part she said “nothing.” When cross-examined she said there was “a little bit of pain” when the appellant put his finger into her vagina but not when he touched her in her “private area.” During cross-examination she denied that she had a painful condition in her genital area or that she knew she had an infection at that time. 
     
      
    15 The complainant was examined by Dr Nittis on 24 December 2004 and again on 17 May 2005, but there were no significant findings. The complainant’s hymen was found to be within normal limits. 
     
      
    16 The circumstances of the other three alleged counts (counts 1, 2 and 3) of sexual intercourse were not disclosed when the complainant reported the incident alleged to have occurred on 22 December 2004. The Crown case was that these earlier incidents were first complained of to the grandmother two nights after the incident on 22 December 2004. An account was later given in an interview with an officer of the Department of Youth and Community Services in February 2005. In that interview the complainant told the officer about another occasion on which she said the appellant had done something to her. The complainant said that, some months before 22 December 2004, the appellant had put his private part into her mouth (count 1), then into her private part (count 2) and then he put his finger in her private part (count 3). 
     
      
    17 The complainant said that when these events happened she was in Year 6 or going into Year 6 in school. She said that she had been sitting in the lounge room of her grandmother’s house with her grandmother and the appellant. Her grandmother left the room to have a shower or to help the complainant’s aunt, who was intellectually handicapped, providing the opportunity for the appellant to commit the offences. 
     
      
    18 The appellant’s account of the relevant events on 22 December 2004 differed from the prosecution evidence in critical respects. He said that he had never lowered his pants. He said the complainant had asked him to inspect the bruise on her leg and he was manoeuvring to do this when interrupted by CI and TC. As I have already indicated the complainant did have a large bruise on the rear of the thigh of her right leg. The appellant denied touching or in any way sexually interfering with the complainant. 
     
      
       
      The report by the trial judge 
       
      
    19 The trial judge provided a report to this Court in relation to the trial and in particular count 4. It reads as follows: 
     
      
       
       “REPORT OF THE JUDGE 
       
       
        
        1. I have read the remarks of Wood CJ at CL in  
        Sloane  
        [2001] NSWCCA 201 esp at [9] et seq. 
        
       
       
        
        2. I should explain why I did not certify the verdict of the jury in respect of count 4 as unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The evidence in relation to this count, was, like the evidence in relation to the other counts, largely that of the complainant and her grandmother (who was the estranged wife of the accused). 
        
       
       
        
        4. There was evidence that the complainant, her grandmother and her father had deliberately told lies in the past to officials and I directed the jury on this. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The jury rejected this evidence in respect of all counts on the indictment except count 4. 
        
       
       
        
        6. I gave a  
        Markuleski  
        direction. This case was one in which such a direction was highly appropriate, as, the evidence in respect of each count came primarily from the same witnesses and was remarkably similar. 
        
       
       
        
        7. Given the jury’s verdicts on all counts, except count 4, I would have been prepared, in light of the above considerations, to certify that the verdict on count 4 was unsafe and unsatisfactory, but I was not asked to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        Dated this 26th day of March 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        John Goldring 
         
        Judge” 
        
       
      
    20 Section 11 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides for a report from the trial judge to this Court. The section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The judge of the court of trial may, and, if requested to do so by the Chief Justice, shall, in case of any appeal or application for leave to appeal, furnish to the registrar the judge’s notes of the trial, and also  
        a report, giving the judge’s opinion upon the case, or upon any point arising in the case 
        ……. (emphases added) 
        
       
      
    21 Wood CJ at CL considered the nature and purpose of a report under the section in R v Sloane (2001) 126 A Crim R 188, [2001] NSWCCA 421. His Honour said at [9]-[13]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The purpose of a Report to the Court of Criminal Appeal is not to justify or to explain why a Judge has dealt with a matter in a particular way. The proper place for the exposure of reasoning of this kind is in the Reasons for Sentence, and nowhere else. The reasons for that are obvious: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the Reasons for Sentence are the published statement of the Court, addressed to the community at large, as well as to those immediately involved in the case, as to why an offender was dealt with in a particular way; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the provision of an explanation directed to the Court of Criminal Appeal, after a sentence is handed down and an appeal is lodged, risks conveying an impression that the Judge, whose decision has been appealed, is seeking to justify or to support it. 
        
       
       
        
        An important function of a Report under s 11 of the Criminal Appeal Act is to inform the Court of Criminal Appeal of any problems which might have emerged during the trial, which either do not appear on the face of the record, or which are imperfectly or ambiguously recorded. 
        
       
       
        
        Another permissible and relevant function of such a Report is its use, by a trial Judge, to raise any matters of irregularity or otherwise, which may give cause for significant doubt in relation to a guilty verdict, and which again are not apparent upon a bare reading of the record. 
        
       
       
        
        A third permissible reason for such a Report is its provision, in response to a specific request from the Court of Criminal Appeal, in relation to any matter which may be of concern to it. 
        
       
       
        
        Otherwise, in times where there is in existence an adequate system for Court reporting, occasion for the provision of a s11 Report should only arise in exceptional circumstances. Its use in order to justify, or to explain a decision for which reasons should have been provided, is not such a circumstance.” 
        
       
       
        
        (See also Vos v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 234 at [25]) 
        
       
      
    22 Section 573 of the Crimes Act 1958 (VIC) is a similar provision to s 11. It is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The judge of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court or the County Court before whom a person is convicted shall in the case of an appeal under this Part against the conviction or against the sentence or in the case of an application for leave to appeal under this Part furnish to the Registrar in accordance with Rules of Court his notes of the trial and may also be required to furnish to the Registrar in accordance with Rules of Court  
        a report giving his opinion upon the case or upon any point arising in the case

    23 In R v Marziale (unreported, VCA, 18 April 1996) Winneke P, Brooking JA and Southwell AJA discussed the role of a trial judge's report and the weight to be given to it [at p 34]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The weight to be given to a judge's report must necessarily vary according to the circumstances of each particular case. That weight will generally be the greater when the opinion expressed is based upon factors the assessment of which depends principally upon the atmosphere of the trial or the observations of a witness -- for example, the general demeanour, the unduly delayed or the too hurriedly given answers. In such matters a court of appeal will recognise the advantage enjoyed by the trial judge. However, less weight will be given where, as in this case, the judge's opinion is based, so it appears, almost wholly upon the type of assessment of the evidence which a court of appeal is obliged to undertake where it is said that a conviction is unsafe and unsatisfactory."" 
        
       
       
        
        (R v Marziale was applied in R v Frank (1999) 105 A Crim R 377, [1999] VSCA 39 at [40] per Charles JA with whom Winneke P and Callaway JA agreed). 
        
       
      
    24 In R v Ahmet (1996) 86 A Crim R 316 Winneke P said at 323: 
     
      
       
        
        “On some occasions the reports are of value in the disposition of appeals, if only because they provide the opportunity (to which I have referred) to express views  
        upon matters that may not be readily apparent from a perusal of the written record 
         (see, for example, R v Paxton [1983] 1 VR 178, particularly at 187-188). However  
        such reports are not, are not intended to be, and should not be treated as documents in and through which the trial judge is being called upon to defend the course which he or she may have taken 
        .” ( 
        emphases added 
        ) 
        
       
      
    25 In R v Garofalo [1998] VSCA 145 Ormiston JA said at [44]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of all situations where a report will be of use, it is in cases which raise the significance of a particular witness and his credit, such as that of Kokkinos, where the judge's assessment will provide invaluable assistance to an appeal court. There were a number of issues in the present trial, or at least there could have been a number of issues, but the manner in which the case was fought and the significance of each witness is a matter upon which a trial judge can give direct assistance, albeit not conclusive of the merits of an application. Here one of the arguments has been that there was a considerable body of other evidence which was more than sufficient to justify the conviction of the accused and indeed it was asserted that there was here sufficient evidence to make the applicant's conviction certain without the need to rely on Kokkinos's evidence. One might hope, therefore, that in the future trial judges will comply with their obligation to provide a report and, in cases such as the present, attempt to provide some estimate of the significance of the impugned witness.” 
        
       
      
    26 In R v JMV [2001] VSCA 219, the applicant had been convicted on only one of 29 counts of sexual assault. The verdict was found to be unsafe. The trial judge stated in his report: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was surprised at the verdict, bearing in mind the whole of the evidence, and I am concerned that a grave injustice may have occurred.” 
        
       
      
    27 Winneke P (Brooking JA and Buchanan JA agreeing) discussed the relevance of the report at [6]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of course, this Court, as it has frequently said, is not bound by reports to it of trial judges, but, none the less, it calls for such reports for the purposes of having revealed to it matters which may in the circumstances have been relevant to the trial judge, familiar with the atmosphere at the trial, and not as easily discernible from the transcript of material before this Court. (See R v Franks). The report in this case, as it seems to me, is a factor which we would do well to take into account in disposing of this application.” 
        
       
      
    28 In my opinion the report provided by the trial judge is significant in the resolution of this appeal. As I discuss below, the fundamental thrust of the appellant’s submission is that the credibility of critical Crown witnesses was so damaged at the trial that the conviction on count 4 was unreasonable. The trial judge’s observations are directly relevant to the resolution of that issue. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    29 There are four grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – the verdict of conviction on the fourth count is unreasonable 
       
       
      Ground 2 – the jury verdicts were inconsistent. 
       
       
      Ground 3 – the trial judge erred in admitting hearsay evidence. 
       
       
      Ground 4 – the trial judge failed to properly or adequately direct the jury in respect of the use of video evidence. 
       
      
    30 Grounds 1 and 2 may be considered together. 
     
      
    31 The approach which an appellate court should follow when it is submitted that a jury’s verdict is unreasonable was authoritatively considered in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606. I endeavoured to summarise the principles in R v Habib [2005] NSWCCA 223 in which I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides as follows:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Although the application of the section has at times proved troublesome it was authoritatively considered by the High Court in  
        MFA v The Queen 
         (2002) 213 CLR 606,  
        M v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 487 and  
        Jones v The Queen 
         (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 493.  
        
       
       
        
        There are two joint judgments in MFA. Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ state that when the issue is whether the verdict of a jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported the test to be applied is that stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        As the High Court emphasised in  
        Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) 
         (1984) 153 CLR 521 it is important to appreciate that the role of the Court of Appeal is to decide a question of fact. ""It is supervising or reviewing the findings of a tribunal of fact"" (see  
        Darling Island Stevedoring Lighterage Co Ltd v Jacobsen 
         (1945) 70 CLR 635 at 643; R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74). 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        MFA 
         the High Court was concerned with whether the analysis of the facts of a trial by this Court was appropriate. In carrying out the appellate task the joint judgment emphasised that it was relevant to identify whether the evidence in the Crown case was ""cogent and unequivocal, and it was not inherently implausible""[30]. The relevant question is whether ""it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt"" [36]. 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        MFA 
        , McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ joined in a separate judgment. Their Honours emphasised that it was important to focus on the language of s 6(1) which because of the inclusion of the word ""unreasonable"" ""seems to state a very broad test""[47]. However, their Honours point out that the seeming amplitude is to be restricted by the context. Being a verdict of a jury which is given a special place in the law to set it aside involves ""a serious step""[49]. The requirement of the section is that the court must determine whether there has been a ""miscarriage of justice"" notwithstanding that the jury has returned a guilty verdict. 
        
       
       
        
        Embracing the test adopted by the majority of the court in M the joint judgment stated:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Instead of asking whether the jury 'must' or were 'bound to' have a reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt, the majority posed the question whether it was 'open to the jury' to be satisfied of the accused's guilt, applying the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, acting as a reasonable jury and reaching their verdict 'upon the whole of the evidence' "" [55]. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The joint judgment offered the following by way of guidance:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The majority in  
          M 
           pointed out that '[i]n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced'. In such a case of doubt, it is only where the jury's advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence can explain the difference in conclusion about the accused's guilt that the appellate court may decide that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence'[56]. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In their conclusion their Honours acknowledge that it is not uncommon for some aspects of the evidence in a trial to be less than wholly satisfactory although juries are usually well able to evaluate conflicts and imperfections of evidence. ""In the end, the appellate court must ask itself whether it considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred authorising and requiring its intervention"" [96]. 
        
       
      
    32 The difficulties raised in this case of inconsistent jury verdicts are commonly considered by appeal courts. The problem was considered by the High Court in Mackenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 from which the following principles are found in the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ. 
     
      
    · For reasons of history, institutional integrity and finality of trials, courts have long been reluctant to undermine jury verdicts or to infer from them that the jurors, drawn from the community, have done otherwise than their duty as committed to them by law. (at 365) 
     
      
    · Sometimes, by a series of verdicts or, where permitted, answers to questions posed by the judge, there is placed on the public record an insight into the jury's thinking. If the result of this insight is to cast doubt upon the verdict under consideration, because logically it cannot stand together with another verdict, the court must determine whether it should intervene. In a criminal appeal, it must decide whether the conviction based upon the verdict, which is impugned is unsafe or unsatisfactory. (at 365) 
     
      
    · Appellate courts should not be too ready to jump to the conclusion that because a verdict of guilty cannot be reconciled as a matter of strict logic with a verdict of not guilty with respect to another count, the jury acted unreasonably in arriving at the verdict of guilty. (at 368) 
     
      
    · It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside. It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. ""It all depends upon the facts of the case."" (at 368) 
     
      
    33 Further consideration of these issues was undertaken by the High Court in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439, MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 and by this Court in R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82. The majority decision in Markuleski was approved in MFA where Jones was reconsidered and its future utility largely confined to a decision dependent on its own facts, rather than providing binding principles. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s submission 
       
      
    34 The appellant submitted that the verdict of guilty on the charge of indecent assault was unreasonable because the jury must have rejected the complainant’s evidence on the other counts as either false or otherwise unreliable. Although he accepted that the Crown case was stronger in relation to the last two counts, it was submitted that each of them relied upon the complainant’s credibility and reliability. Apart from the fact that the jury acquitted on the other counts, it was submitted that here were many aspects of the complainant’s evidence which so damaged her credit that it was unsafe for the jury to rely upon her evidence. The matters to which the appellant adverted were: 
     
      
    § When asked by her father “did anything happen, did he touch you?” the complainant answered “no, he tried to, but I had my hand there.” This was entirely inconsistent with her later allegations of touching and penetration. 
     
      
    § The complainant asserted that the two assaults occurred while she was seated in a chair and the appellant had pulled both her pants and underpants off and was kneeling in front of her with his pants down to his knees – but his underpants on. The appellant submitted that this sequence of events was improbable. 
     
      
    § When interviewed by police on 23 December 2004 the complainant gave a number of versions of the events. She indicated that the appellant had placed his hand on the top or outside her vagina and nothing further had happened. However, later in the same interview the complainant told the police that she had lied and then claimed that the appellant had, in fact, put his finger in her “private part” with the finger moving around inside her “private part.” She then said that the complainant had not done anything like that to her before. 
     
      
    § This last comment, made in her interview of 23 December 2004, was at odds with the interview she gave in February 2005 where she related the events which allegedly occurred in 2004 and which formed the basis for counts 1, 2 and 3. Later in July 2005 the complainant suggested for the first time that the appellant had also tried to choke her and that she was frightened of him. 
     
      
    § Evidence was admitted at the trial that the complainant had previously made allegations against the appellant, in 2001, to the effect that he had kissed her and touched her on the chest, but very soon after she said that she had been lying. However, when giving evidence she said that what she had initially told the police was true and, when she said that the accused did not do it, the latter statement was a lie. Further evidence was given by CI that the complainant had been laughing about the matter and that she took the complainant to the police station after she was told by her that she had made it up and had been encouraged to do so by her intellectually handicapped aunt. There was other evidence that the assertions made by the complainant in 2001 were false. 
     
      
    § The complainant told the police in the first interview that the main reason that she had moved into her grandmother’s house was that it was safe there, they were all nice there and they did not let anything happen to her. She also told the police in her first interview of her feelings of being frozen and shocked that the appellant would do these things to her. This was said to be inconsistent with her allegation in the second interview that the appellant had previously assaulted her. When this was pointed out to the complainant she again alleged that she had previously lied to the police. 
     
      
    § The complainant said she had lied to the police in her first interview when she told them that she would have told officers of the Department of Community Services or a school counsellor that someone touched her in a private place. The complainant and her family were receiving counselling in 2004 at the time at which the alleged earlier incident occurred but no complaint was made to the DOCS officer. 
     
      
    § The complainant was demonstrated to be a liar in respect of a number of collateral issues. This is reflected in the judge’s comments during the sentencing proceedings and in his remarks on sentence where he commented that he intended to refer the papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider whether perjury charges should be brought. The trial judge when reviewing submissions in relation to sentence said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “In the course of these proceedings, it seems to me that there is a prima facie case that at least 3 of the Crown witnesses may have committed perjury and for that reason I will be referring the transcript of evidence and the exhibits or copies of the exhibits to the Director of Public Prosecutions on that basis.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In his remarks on sentence he said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “I have already indicated that I intend to refer the evidence in this matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider whether any charges of perjury should be brought against certain Crown witnesses. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The apparent cases of perjury were things that those witnesses said, not relating to any matter directly in issue in the trail that was an essential element of any of the offences, but the credit of the Crown witnesses and particularly of the complainant, was directly in issue. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I have concerns about the reliability of one witness, the complainant. I have particular concerns about the inconsistency in her evidence between what she said to her father immediately after the incident and what she subsequently said.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    · The expert medical evidence made it highly unlikely that any penetration or touching at all had occurred on 22 December 2004. Although the complainant was questioned at length in her first interview as to what she had felt when she said that the complainant had placed his hand on her private part and placed his finger in it and moved it around, she made no allegation at all of being hurt or feeling any pain. By contrast, in her second interview she claimed that it had hurt and felt sore when the appellant had placed his finger inside her. The appellant emphasised that the complainant’s evidence was entirely inconsistent with the evidence of Dr Young. It was submitted that it was also inconsistent with the evidence of Dr Nittis. The evidence of Dr Nittis was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Q: So you agree that in the state of her genital area was in on 22 December, do you agree that one would expect her to cry out or make a statement that it hurt if she was to be touched in the vaginal area? 
           
          A. Yes I think that’s quite reasonable. 
           
           
          Q. And certainly if a finger was actually placed inside her vagina? 
           
          A. I think that’s reasonable.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    · The complainant’s versions as to how the assaults occurred was inherently unlikely. This was particularly with respect to how her pants had been removed and her legs parted. However, this submission was not developed and can be put to one side. 
     
      
    35 The appellant further submitted that the jury’s findings of not guilty on four counts fatally damaged the credibility of the complainant in relation to all counts in the indictment. Implicit in the appellant’s acquittal on the fifth count was a rejection of the complainant’s account of the events which were said to give rise to that count. It was submitted that no distinction can properly be drawn between the complainant’s evidence in respect of any of the counts but particularly between the 4th and 5th count. There was no reason to think that her evidence in relation to the 4th count was of greater veracity than her evidence in relation to the 5th count. It was submitted that if the jury was acting logically and reasonably, having rejected the complainant’s evidence in relation to counts 1, 2, 3 and 5, it should have rejected her evidence in relation to the 4th count: (see Jones v the Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 and R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82). 
     
      
    36 Finally it was submitted that, because there was evidence that the appellant was found in a compromising position, this may have aroused suspicion in the minds of some of the jurors who concluded that the appellant “was probably up to no good.” Accordingly, it was submitted there was a real likelihood of an impermissible compromise on part of the jury in reaching their verdict. 
     
      
       
      The respondent’s submissions 
       
      
    37 The Crown submitted that the jury verdicts were not relevantly inconsistent. It was submitted that the verdicts of acquittal in relation to the first three counts could readily be explained because of the late complaint by the complainant and because there was no corroborating evidence. This could be contrasted with counts 4 and 5 where there was evidence from the complainant’s father and grandmother which was capable of supporting the complainant’s allegations. Because of the evidence of the doctors which indicated that the complainant had an infection of her vagina which made the labia exceptionally sensitive, the jury could have concluded that they were not satisfied that count 5 occurred but, were satisfied that the appellant had touched the complainant externally.  
     
      
    38 It was submitted that just because verdicts are inconsistent they should not be set aside. If the “apparent” inconsistency is explicable on a rational basis there is no reason for this Court to intervene. It was submitted that the verdicts of not guilty to the charges of sexual intercourse and the verdict of guilty to the charge of indecent assault do not represent an affront to logic and common sense and do not indicate that there has been any compromise of the performance of the jury’s duty. It was submitted that there is no basis for this Court to intervene. MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 365; see also Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 and R v Makuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    39 I am satisfied that the not guilty verdicts in relation to counts 1, 2 and 3 can be satisfactorily explained. The lateness of the complaint is relevant but not of great significance. Given the admission by the complainant that, on various occasions, she had lied in relation to complaints which she had made against the appellant the jury would inevitably have sought corroborative evidence before deciding to convict. 
     
      
    40 Counts 4 and 5 present significantly greater difficulties. At one level the evidence of the grandmother and father is corroborative. Their evidence suggests that they discovered the appellant in compromising circumstances. However, they did not give evidence of observing any of the acts of which complaint is made. Furthermore, there are significant problems in their evidence. They differed as to whether the appellant was kneeling or standing. CI said the appellant’s underpants were off, but this was not consistent with the complainant’s account. The complainant did not say that the appellant’s underpants were down. 
     
      
    41 The complainant said in the first police interview that after she saw the appellant undo his belt and pants and the pants fall down to his knees, she then saw his underwear. The history which the complainant gave Dr Young also states that the complainant “observed the appellant wearing black underpants … [the appellant] did not expose his penis or his testicles.” 
     
      
    42 The evidence of the complainant raises a number of difficulties. The medical evidence was clear that her vagina was so sensitive that if touched or penetrated she would have cried out or made some statement that it hurt. There is no suggestion that during the sequence of events she was heard to call out in distress or pain. This may be because her grandmother and father were not sufficiently proximate to hear her, but given their evidence as to the position in which they observed the complainant and the appellant this would seem unlikely. Apart from there being no evidence of such a response from the complainant, when asked in the first interview with the police what she could feel when the appellant’s hand was on her private area and when he digitally penetrated her, she made no allegation that she had felt any pain. This response was quite inconsistent with the allegation that the appellant penetrated her but is also inconsistent with the allegation that he touched her. 
     
      
    43 When cross-examined she continued to assert that there was no pain from the touching although she said there “was a little bit of pain” when digitally penetrated. In light of the medical evidence this evidence seems to me to be entirely unreliable, seriously diminishing her credit, and leaving me with considerable disquiet about her evidence in relation to count 4. 
     
      
    44 The complainant continued to deny that her genital area had been severely infected and denied having a painful condition at the time. She denied that if touched she would have been likely to have screamed out, all of which is entirely inconsistent with the evidence of Dr Young and Dr Nettis. 
     
      
    45 During her first interview with police on 23 December 2004 the complainant did not mention any events prior to 22 December 2004 which were the subject of counts 1 to 3. Those allegations were only ventilated on 2 February 2005 when the complainant was interviewed by an officer of the Department of Community Services. 
     
      
    46 Although these matters require consideration, the evidence of the complainant’s response when asked about the events raises greater concerns. When her father gave evidence he said that he had asked the complainant “Did he touch you?” This question was asked after the appellant had left the house and after the father had called 000. The father said the complainant responded by saying “He was trying to, but I had my hand there … .” 
     
      
    47 When the complainant gave evidence she denied making this response. She said that her father asked “Has he done anything to you?” and she replied “Yes.” She said this exchange occurred as her father was phoning the police. Of course she later makes specific allegations against the appellant to the doctors. 
     
      
    48 To my mind there is no reason for the appellant’s father to have given untruthful evidence about this conversation. After all it was he who responded to the situation by telephoning 000 and reporting a “rape.” His evidence with respect to his daughter’s response to his question made plain that this had not occurred. There is no reason, unless it be true, for the father to provide evidence which suggested that his action in ringing the emergency number may not have been justified. It must also be remembered that the complainant’s response to her father was made after the commotion resulting in the telephone call had occurred. 
     
      
    49 I would have expected the atmosphere which must have prevailed to make it difficult for the complainant to say that she had not been assaulted making it highly likely that her response to her father was a statement of the true situation. 
     
      
    50 The complaint about the events of 22 December 2004 was not initiated by the complainant but rather by the reaction of the grandmother to the scene which she said she witnessed when she looked into the living room. The father’s reaction was to phone the police before any attempt was made to obtain a coherent account of the events from the complainant. 
     
      
    51 There were other unsatisfactory features of the complainant’s evidence. In 2001 she alleged that the appellant had to put his hand down her chest and said to her that he would show her how “boyfriend and girlfriend kiss.” The complainant later retracted that allegation admitting that her intellectually handicapped aunt (JC) had told her to make it up. The complainant’s uncle also confirmed that the allegation was false. He had been present during the entire time when the complainant was in the appellant’s presence and said that the appellant had not done what the complainant alleged. This evidence demonstrated a capacity in the complainant to make false allegations of a sexual nature against the appellant. 
     
      
    52 The appellant said that the reason he was found in a position on his knees with the complainant sitting on the chair with her pants down was because she had asked him to inspect a bruise on her leg. That bruise was subsequently confirmed and was a large bruise on the back of her right leg which she had obtained in a previous accident. Because the complainant was sitting on the chair and the bruise was located on the back of her leg it would have been necessary, if the appellant was to inspect the bruise, for him to lower himself as in fact occurred. 
     
      
    53 At the trial the complainant sought to sustain her complaints of touching and penetration on 22 December 2004. No doubt the jury had little trouble in rejecting the allegation of penetration but in my view the matters to which I have referred should have caused the jury to have a serious doubt as to whether she was touched. By rejecting her allegation of penetration the jury must have formed an adverse view of the complainant’s credit. They must have rejected her evidence as to some of the events which she alleged occurred on 22 December 2004. There is nothing in the evidence relating to the allegation of touching which would justify accepting her evidence on that count but rejecting it on count 5. This was not a case where there was evidence capable of supporting count 4 but not count 5. 
     
      
    54 There are two other significant matters which support the appellant’s case. Firstly, the complainant was shown to have been untruthful on previous occasions when she had made allegations of sexual misconduct against the appellant. Secondly, and of considerable significance is that the trial judge having observed her give evidence maintained very serious reservations about her credit. He reflected those reservations in his report to this Court and in his remarks on sentence. If I had any reservations about upholding the appeal the report of the trial judge dispels them. 
     
      
    55 Because I am satisfied that it was not open to the jury to convict the appellant on count 4 it is unnecessary to consider the further grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    56 In my opinion the appeal should be upheld, the conviction should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered. 
     
      
    57 HIDDEN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    58 PRICE J: In this appeal the trial judge, a very experienced judge, has provided to this Court a report in which he expressed the opinion that the verdict of the jury on count 4 was unsafe and unsatisfactory. For the reasons given by McClellan CJ at CL the trial judge was plainly correct. It was not upon the whole of the evidence open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the charge of aggravated indecent assault. I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was found guilty by a jury of an offence contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901, in that, between 27 March and 30 April 2004, he imported not less than the trafficable quantity of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). The maximum penalty prescribed for this offence is a fine not exceeding $550,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 25 years or both. 
     
      
    2 The quantity of drugs imported was 258.1 grams containing 99.1 grams of pure MDMA This is 180 times the trafficable quantity which is .5 grams. 
     
      
    3 The appellant was sentenced to 6 years and 5 months imprisonment to date from 27 January 2005. A non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment was imposed. 
     
      
       
      The essence of the Crown case 
       
      
    4 It will be necessary in the course of these reasons to examine some of the evidence tendered by the Crown in detail. However, the essence of the Crown case was that on 8 April 2004 a 14 kilogram package from Hong Kong addressed to “Cheng’s Newsagent and Deli” was intercepted by customs at Sydney International airport. The package contained, amongst other things, 1000 MDMA tablets wrapped inside carbon paper and concealed inside DVD cases. 
     
      
    5 It was the Crown case that Henry Chin and the appellant were involved in the importation of these drugs. Various telephone calls were lawfully intercepted. The content of those calls indicated that the appellant had both organised the consignment and made several attempts to gain possession of it after its arrival in Australia. On the days following 8 April 2004 the appellant had several telephone conversations with the freight company in Australia and with Henry Chin in relation to the status of the consignment. The appellant was arrested and charged on 12 May 2004. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    6 The appellant filed a Notice of Appeal which contains 8 grounds. He also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. He was only legally represented in relation to the sentence matter. The Notice of Appeal is lengthy, and parts of it are difficult to comprehend. On occasions the argument which the appellant seeks to advance is not made clear. I have endeavoured to comprehend each ground of appeal, and the Crown response to it. The appellant appeared for himself at the hearing and provided the court with detailed written submissions, including supplementary submissions filed after the hearing. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – The indictment should be set aside as the Crown could not prove the elements of the offence (1) the elements of the offence (2) the question of the material time (3) insufficient evidence. 
       
       
      Ground 2 – His Honour erred to not rejecting the full brief of evidence 
       
       
      Ground 3 – Questions were asked in the Record of Interview that related to two illegal importations of narcotics. 
       
       
      Ground 4 – The applicant was not present in court for the first day of his trial 
       
       
      Ground 5 – Witnesses gave evidence prior to rulings on the admissibility of the evidence. 
       
       
      Ground 6 – The Crown summing up was “distorted and dangerously prejudicial.” 
       
       
      Ground 7 – The trial judge’s summing up was “distorted and dangerously prejudicial.” 
       
       
      Ground 8 – Trial judge’s answers to the jury question was based on “distorted misinformation and was dangerously prejudicial.” 
       
       
      Ground 1: 
       
      
    7 This ground has not been expressed with clarity. However, the Crown submitted that it should be understood as raising three matters: 
     
      
       
      1. The elements of the offence; 
       
       
      2. The question of the “material time” at which the appellant had the relevant intention; and 
       
       
      3. There was insufficient evidence to prove the offence. 
       
      
    8 The Crown case at the trial was circumstantial. This was recognised by the trial judge and appropriate directions were given to the jury. The judge identified that the real issue which the jury had to resolve was whether the Crown had proved the “fault” element of the offence, namely that the appellant knew or was aware that there was a real or significant likelihood that he was importing narcotics. 
     
      
    9 The trial judge directed the jury that if they came to the conclusion that there was a reasonable possibility that the appellant did not know that the box contained narcotics they must find him not guilty. The jury were given clear directions on a number of occasions as to the onus and burden of proof.  
     
      
    10 With respect to the “material time” the appellant complained in particular about the directions which the trial judge gave in relation to the definition of “importing.” As I understand the appellant’s submissions it was that there must be evidence, at the time the relevant items were actually imported, that the appellant was participating in that importation. A question was asked by the jury about this matter following which further directions were given. That direction was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Importing is a process of importing, it does not just stop the minute something lands in Australia because the person who is doing the importing is seeking to get his hands on it after the goods have landed in Australia, he would be seeking to go to the customs agent and pick it up. The evidence in this case is that the previous arrangements were, when parcels landed, the accused was told that he would then go to Mr Ngai’s premises and pick them up. So he would be involved in importing right to the time he actually got his hands onto those goods. In this case he never physically got his hands on any goods. Customs people kept them at all times. Now the process of the telephone calls shows you that from 8, 9, 10 April, 11 April, he is still making enquires and that process continued through. He in fact spoke to the Chinese man Phil on 11 April about the parcel not being there and he is still trying to get his hands on the parcel. 
        
       
       
        
        Now on 13 April, Trissette has a discussion with him about the customs hold on the parcel and tells him that they are x-raying the parcel. It can mean that they are x-raying it so that they can open it up and look at everything. Then there is another discussion on 13 April between Trissette and the accused to say it still was not clear but she thought they will pick it up that day. Then there is a discussion on 13th between Phil and David, who is the accused, about this parcel. There are further discussions on the 13th. On the 14th there is another discussion between Trissette, this is April, and the accused, about what’s in the parcel and she raises for the first time any drugs or anything like that. He says, ‘No, no, no, just no.’ She asks, ‘You are not bringing in porn and what’s in there?’ and he says ‘CD’s and magazines’. Now if by this time he is trying, indeed during any period that he is still trying to get his hands on the parcel, he knows in the sense that I have explained to you, that there is a reasonable likelihood, he either know directly or there is a reasonable likelihood that these goods had drugs in them. Well the importing is not finished. If he acquires knowledge, if he gets knowledge and he still keeps trying to get his hands on the goods, then he is importing the goods. 
        
       
       
        
        If however, he doesn’t have knowledge, he has suspicion, he is not even thinking clearly about it, or you are not sure if he has got knowledge, he may have merely suspicion but knowledge is something that comes to him over a period of time and perhaps becomes clear to him in May when the premises, his own house, is raided – by that stage it is too late. 
        
       
       
        
        If his knowledge comes to him, say at the point the day that his house is raided, he realises that he has got a search warrant in his hand that is searching for drugs – well it must be drugs. By that stage his knowledge has passed the point at which they could be any importing. The importing is something that was still continuing from 8 April probably for some days afterwards. Now it is a matter for you to determine, not for me to determine, when that ceased. You should look again at those tapes and transcripts. You might think it ceased on 14th or 19th or the 20th or it continued right through. I should not tell you what I think. All I can say to you is that at some point it definitely stopped and I am expressing I suppose a view on facts which I say that by the time they went to his house, any question of importing has ceased. 
        
       
       
        
        If he formed an opinion then, or it suddenly hit him that he’d been a bit of a fool and obviously drugs were involved and that is when it hit him, well he could not be guilty,  
        but if he got that knowledge in the sense that I have directed you, in those written directions and he had that knowledge on the 8th, 9th, 10th dates around then of April and knowing there were drugs there, he kept trying to get them, then he is importing.  
        I do not think I can make it any clearer than that you have to determine first of all, when you think his attempts to import that box stopped. If he acquired the knowledge before that point, and he kept trying to get the box nevertheless, then he is guilty. If he only got the knowledge, he had suspicion before that date, most and after that he got knowledge, then he is not guilty.” 
        
       
      
    11 In my opinion the directions which his Honour gave were correct (see R v Lam (1990) 46 A Crim R 402; R v Courtney-Smith (No 2) (1990) 48 A Crim R 49; R v Leff (1996) 86 A Crim R 212; R v Sukkar (2005) NSWCCA 54). 
     
      
    12 The appellant’s fundamental complaint is that evidence of the offence after 8 April, which was the date on which the drugs arrived in Australia, was inadmissible. However, an importation neither begins nor ends at the point of which the goods arrive in Australia. Both events before the goods arrive and activities afterwards, which are incidental to the bringing of the goods into Australia, are admissible to prove the importation (see Sukkar at [75]-[89], [109]-[121]). Even if the appellant only gained knowledge that drugs were in the parcels after they had arrived in Australia, if he, nevertheless continued in his efforts to obtain possession of the box he can be guilty of importing. 
     
      
    13 After the relevant package arrived in Australia the evidence indicated that the appellant made repeated and concerted efforts to obtain it. Evidence of telephone calls which evidenced these efforts were accordingly admissible in evidence. 
     
      
    14 As the trial judge pointed out to the jury it was critical for them to determine the point at which the appellant may have known there were drugs in the parcel. If they found that he had that knowledge at a time when his activities were directed to completing the importation then he was guilty of the offences as charged. The trial judge said: “if (the appellant) acquired the knowledge before that point (being the point at which the appellant’s attempts to import the box had stopped), and he kept trying to get the box nevertheless, then he is guilty.” However, his Honour correctly pointed out that the jury must be satisfied that the appellant had knowledge of the drugs and not merely a suspicion. 
     
      
    15 The third element of the first ground of appeal raised by the appellant is that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. This ground requires the appellate court to make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, considering the whole of the record, it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the guilt of the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant court must allow for the advantage which the jury had in hearing and seeing the witnesses (see M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493). 
     
      
    16 There was no issue at the trial that the box that the appellant was concerned with importing contained MDMA. The issue at the trial was whether the appellant intended to import narcotics. The Crown case relied upon a series of circumstances which it was submitted could lead only to the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to import narcotics. Critical elements in the evidence were as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. The appellant imported a large package from Hong Kong which included two boxes which looked like oversized VHS cassette boxes. Inside each of these boxes was a quantity of MDMA tablets wrapped in carbon paper. 
       
       
      2. The package was forwarded from Hong Kong by Mr Chin who was a long standing friend of the appellant. The appellant with Mr Chin met Marco Ngai of Packtrans Australia Pty Limited, a freight forwarding company and customs broker, to make arrangements for the package once it arrived in Australia. During the meeting with Mr Ngai the appellant used the false name “George.” 
       
       
      3. The package was addressed to Cheng’s Newsagent and Deli – 123 Coogee Bay Road, Coogee. This business did not exist at that time.  
       
       
      4. The appellant provided Mr Ngai with paperwork in the name of “Cheng’s Newsagency and Deli” which included the Coogee address. He also created a document with a letterhead “Cheng’s Newsagency and Deli” although he knew that that business did not exist. 
       
       
      5. The appellant instructed Mr Ngai to arrange for the package to be sent from Hong Kong and when the package arrived in Australia instructed Mr Ngai what he was to do with it. 
       
       
      6. Both before and after the package arrived in Australia, which occurred on 8 April 2004, the appellant spoke with Mr Chin about it. One of those conversations included a discussion between Mr Chin and the appellant about methods of defeating x-ray machines and the use of carbon paper for this purpose. Carbon paper was wrapped around the MDMA tablets. The applicant denied in his interview with the police that he had any knowledge of the use of carbon paper.  
       
      
    17 In some of the telephone calls between the appellant and Mr Chin it is apparent that the appellant did not wish to speak on that phone and he said that he would ring Mr Chin back on a public telephone. There was no reason for him to do this if the importation was innocent. After 8 April 2004 the appellant made a number of telephone calls in which he attempted to ascertain the whereabouts of the package. The clear inference was that he was seeking to obtain possession of it. 
     
      
    18 Apart from the drugs in the package there was no reason for the appellant to use a false name and address. Although the appellant asserted in many places in his written submissions that he had no knowledge of the contents of the package he did not give this evidence at the trial. He gave no evidence at the trial.  
     
      
    19 Having regard to the evidence of the relevant events given at his trial the only rational inference is that the appellant was involved from the outset in making arrangements to import prohibited drugs.  
     
      
    20 Ground 1 of the appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    21 As I understand this ground of appeal the appellant complains that the brief of evidence which was provided to him was inadequate. However, the written submission proceeds to discuss the trial, the Crown’s opening and the evidence given at the trial. Ground 3 of the appeal raises for consideration the admission by the trial judge of an edited version of the appellant’s record of interview. I will discuss that matter below. Otherwise there is no material available to this Court from which it could be concluded that the Crown’s brief was inadequate. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    22 The appellant was originally charged with two offences of importation. The Crown did not proceed on the second count. For this reason it was necessary to carefully confine the evidence tendered at the trial so that evidence of the other alleged importation was not admitted. This had the effect that a number of telephone intercepts were not put before the jury. The appellant’s record of interview was also edited to delete any reference to a second importation of drugs. 
     
      
    23 The appellant was represented by counsel at his trial and although objection was taken to some of the questions and answers in the record of interview the whole record was not objected to. As could be expected there was argument before the trial judge about the telephone intercepts and the contents of the record of interview which should be admitted. 
     
      
    24 The trial judge made the following ruling: 
     
      
       
        
        “My view, I hope I have made it clear, anything that intends to establish the commission of the first offence or his guilty knowledge about anything connected with the first offence is relevant and admissible. If there is some particular ground of prejudice that has to be raised in relation to any of that, Mr Buchen (who appeared for the appellant) can no doubt raise it with me specifically. But anything intending to show he has committed other crimes is irrelevant and inadmissible. Whether it’s possession of a small quantity of drugs or a second importing from China about which there will be no evidence, is inadmissible. The dates that admissions are made on telephone intercepts are irrelevant. The question is what is the content of what is said, rather than what is the date of what is said.” 
        
       
      
    25 It is difficult to fully comprehend the submission which the appellant now makes about the record of interview. However, the Crown has endeavoured to distil the essence of the submission which I believe is generally correct. Those matters are: 
     
      
       
      (a) the entire interview should have been excluded because, once it had been edited to remove references to, amongst other things, the alleged importation in May 2004 it presented a misleading or distorted impression of the appellant’s state of mind or intentions. 
       
       
      (b) the entire interview should have been excluded because it promoted and continued with a “premeditated fabricated lie” by the interviewing officers in relation to the alleged May 2004 importation. 
       
       
      (c) some of the questions and answers that were not edited out should have been because they related to, or included a reference to, the alleged May 2004 importation. 
       
       
      (d) some of the questions and answers that were not edited out should have been because, whilst they were indistinct, they may have related to both the importation the subject of the charge and the alleged May 2004 importation. 
       
       
      (e) some of the questions and answers that were edited out in their entirety should have only been partly edited. 
       
      
    26 It is useful to summarise the version of events which the appellant gave during his interview. He admitted that he was a business associate of Henry Chin who was also known as Henry Chen or “Phil” by which he was referred in some of the telephone intercepts. He admitted that he was the effective consignor of the package that contained the narcotics which were the subject of the indictment. 
     
      
    27 Henry Chin owed the appellant the sum of $50,000 from previous business arrangements. The appellant agreed to organise further arrangements with Henry Chin so as to recoup the money owing to him. 
     
      
    28 The arrangements that Henry Chin asked the appellant to organise involved arranging some “importing type ventures” or “import contact … with the company to import some kareoke music that would be sold into … some Asian type Chinese kareoke bars … .” 
     
      
    29 Pursuant to the arrangement with Henry Chin the appellant went to a freight forwarder and importing agent – Packtrans – and put in place arrangements which allowed parcels to be sent to Australia. This included organising the use of a business name and preparing a letterhead using that name – Chan’s Newsagent and Deli. The appellant had no relationship with that business and it must be the case that he used the fictitious name for “cover.” The arrangement with Mr Chin was that the appellant would pick the parcels up from Packtrans and then drop them at a butcher’s shop in Woodburn Road, Berala. The appellant knew the butcher only as William. 
     
      
    30 The appellant had been introduced to Packtrans by Mr Chin as being a “contact that would – would structure the business” and would communicate with Packtrans when the parcels arrived. Over a period of time a number of parcels were sent to Australia and picked up by the appellant pursuant to his arrangement – up to 2 boxes per week. The appellant believed that in total 11 parcels “came in” pursuant to the arrangement. The appellant also collected money for the payment of freight from the butcher at Berala and gave that money to “Marco” (Ngai) at Packtrans. The payments were approximately $600 or $700 and always in cash. 
     
      
    31 The appellant said that he himself had received nothing for his role in this business arrangement – only the hope to receive the $50,000 owed to him by Henry Chin in the future. 
     
      
    32 The appellant admitted that he communicated with Henry Chin by telephone – either by public phone or by a mobile phone that utilised a SIM card that was not in his name. 
     
      
    33 Throughout the interview the appellant denied that he knew what was in the parcels he picked up or was to pick up and denied any knowledge of narcotics. However, he did admit that he was suspicious about the contents of the parcels and that he did not “block out” that it may have been something illegal but he said that he believed it may have been pornography or pirated CDs. 
     
      
    34 The charge for which the appellant was convicted related to the importation of narcotics that arrived on 8 April 2004. The other charge, which the Crown did not proceed with, related to an alleged importation in May 2004. The original record of interview included questions and answers relating to the May importation and for that reason it was required to be edited. 
     
      
    35 There were significant differences between the steps in the importation in April and that alleged to have occurred in May. The May importation did not utilise the business name Chan’s Newsagent and Deli as the consignee. It also involved a different narcotic. 
     
      
    36 At the trial the appellant objected to all passages in the record of interview that concerned the May 2004 importation. It was also submitted that much of the interview was irrelevant, unfairly prejudicial or involved unfair questioning. Objection was taken to questions relating to Packtrans consignment received prior to 8 April 2004, the finding of a narcotic substance in the appellant’s car and some questions that were directed to whether the appellant had any dealings with Russians. Many of the objections were allowed. The prosecutor and counsel for the appellant agreed on the way “edits” would be made to the transcript and video of the interview. 
     
      
    37 At the first day of the trial the appellant’s counsel provided written submissions with respect to the record of interview. It was submitted that there were two factors which “militated for exclusion of the entire interview under s 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act.” It was submitted that the appellant was “incorrectly informed of the nature of the allegation concerning the second importation at the commencement of the interview” and that the “interview continually oscillates between the two allegations” and the “faced with this disorientating interrogation technique, it would not have been possible for the accused to identify his particular state of mind at different stages of the period in question (for example, before and after 8 April).” 
     
      
    38 When the record of interview was provided to the jury the trial judge told the jury that the “blanked out portions” had been blanked out at his direction and following legal argument. His Honour told the jury that they were not to speculate on what might have been blanked out but that these matters had been removed because they were irrelevant to the case. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the course of a lengthy interview going over, I think, more than 4 hours, it is only to be expected that some things will not be relevant.” 
        
       
      
    39 The submission which the appellant makes on the appeal is in essence a repetition of the submission made by his counsel at the trial. He submitted that the entire interview should have been excluded because the editing changed the structure and meaning of the interview and that what was left was not a true representation of his state of mind at the time. 
     
      
    40 It is not uncommon that a record of interview contains material which should not be admitted at an accused’s trial. The accused will often be interviewed at a time when the precise allegation which is made at a later trial has not been formulated and questions are asked which explore matters which later turn out to be irrelevant. In some cases when a record of interview has been extensively edited the resultant interview must be rejected because it would unfairly prejudice the accused. In Harriman v R (1989) 167 CLR 590 Dawson J at 559 – 600 stated the relevant principles. His Honour recognised that where the editing of a document destroyed its “coherence or character” it is necessary to consider whether the resultant document should be excluded. The question will be whether or not the probative value of the edited interview is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    41 The relevant question in the present case is whether the “edits” resulted in the interview being so distorted as to make it unfair to allow it to go to the jury in its edited form. I have read the entirety of the interview in its edited form and am satisfied that it reveals a sufficiently coherent and consistent account of relevant events and was appropriately admitted into evidence. There are occasions when the interview does lack coherency but this is usually as a result of the implausible and unusual responses of the appellant. 
     
      
    42 The appellant submitted that the interview criss-crosses between both importation events. I do not accept this submission. It seems to me that because the two events had an apparently different modus operandi the questioner was largely able to separate the questions. Although there are some general answers given by the appellant that appear to apply to all importations to which he may have been a party there are no occasions where an answer given by the appellant would be understood as relating only to the May 2004 importation and not also to the earlier events. 
     
      
    43 I do not accept the submission that the edited interview does not fairly represent the appellant’s state of mind during the interview. There is no suggestion that the appellant did not understand the questions he was being asked and there was no evidence at the trial (which could have been given on a voir dire) to the effect that his answers were unreliable because he was confused. 
     
      
    44 The appellant submitted that by reason of the admission of the edited interview the jury were “denied the knowledge that another importing venture was involved in this interview, that was taking place at the same time.” It is difficult to understand this submission when at the trial counsel was successful in sustaining an objection to any material in the interview which revealed the existence of the May 2004 importation. In my view that objection was rightly made and it was neither necessary for the jury to know that it was alleged that there was another importation and it may have operated to the prejudice of the appellant. 
     
      
    45 This submission must be rejected. 
     
      
    46 There can be no doubt that the edited interview was highly probative of the appellant’s guilt. The deletion of discrete portions did not make the admission of the edited version unfair or prejudicial so as to require its rejection. 
     
      
    47 The appellant also submitted that the interview was based on a “premeditated fabricated lie.” As I understand it, the submission is founded on the fact that in relation to the alleged importation in May, the Chinese authorities had intervened and removed the narcotics before allowing the parcel to continue to Australia. As a result there was no actual importation of narcotics in May. 
     
      
    48 The Crown accepted that when the interviewing officers put the allegation relating to the May importation to the appellant at the commencement of the interview, they did not tell him that the Chinese authorities had intervened and substituted the narcotics. However, there was no evidence from which the trial judge could have concluded that this omission was deliberate, premeditated or done with the intention of misleading or deceiving the appellant into making admissions. There was no voir dire in which these allegations were put to the interviewing officers. Although these matters were raised in written submissions provided to the trial judge no request was made for a voir dire to explore the issue or provide an evidentiary basis for an allegation that the interviewing officers employed improper tactics. 
     
      
    49 Furthermore there was no evidence from which the trial judge could have concluded that the appellant was in any way actually mislead or deceived or that the reporting of the May allegations to him at the commencement of the interview had any consequence for the answers which the appellant gave. There is nothing to suggest that the appellant had been mislead or deceived by the alleged “lie” by the interviewing officers. 
     
      
    50 The appellant contended that a number of questions and answers that were not edited out of the record of interview were indistinct and may have related to the May 2004 importation, as well as to the Packtrans’ importations and accordingly should have been excluded. The appellant provides an extensive list of questions and answers which he submitted fell into this category of which only 8 were the subject of any objection at the trial. 
     
      
    51 I have carefully considered all of the questions and answers. In relation to those not objected to at the trial I reject the appellant’s submission and would decline leave pursuant to rule 4. 
     
      
    52 In relation to the other questions and answers I am satisfied that although it is conceivable they may have encompassed the May 2004 importation this would not have been apparent to the jury. I am satisfied that the admission of these questions and answers did not occasion prejudice or unfairness to the appellant. 
     
      
    53 The appellant also submitted that it was unfair to have edited some questions and answers completely from the transcript. It was submitted that it would have been fairer to edit only part of these questions and answers. The essence of the submission is that parts of these answers showed denials which should have been placed before the jury. 
     
      
    54 I reject the submission. All of the passages about which the appellant now complains were objected to in their entirety at the trial. It was never suggested that they should be partially edited. Most of the passages complained about relate to the May 2004 importation and accordingly, any denial or exculpatory statements would have been irrelevant. Furthermore, it would have been difficult if not impossible to partially edit these particular questions and answers without disclosing the appellant’s involvement in the May 2004 importation or without distorting the meaning of particular answers. 
     
      
    55 I reject this submission. 
     
      
       
      Telephone intercepts 
       
      
    56 The appellant submitted that evidence of anything occurring after the period 8 – 14 April 2004 which he refers to as the “material time” was irrelevant and prejudicial to him and should have been excluded. He contended that after this time the importation had finished. On this basis various telephone intercepts would have been rejected. 
     
      
    57 I reject this submission. In my view the Crown correctly submitted that the act of importation can embrace activities that follow the arrival of goods in Australia provided they are related, proximate and incidental to the bringing of the goods into Australia. The appellant’s suggestion that the importation was at an end or aborted when the parcel was seized by Customs on or about 14 April is not correct. Furthermore, acts of the appellant or statements made by him after the importation ceased may nevertheless be probative of his intentions at an earlier time when the importation was still on foot. 
     
      
    58 There is evidence from transcripts of telephone calls made on 18 and 20 April 2004. On 18 April Mr Chin and the appellant discussed conducting a search on the internet to find out how x-ray machines work and whether carbon paper “did or did not work.” There was no dispute at the trial that the relevant packages had been wrapped in carbon paper. During another telephone call on 20 April 2004 between the appellant and Mr Chin the following exchanged occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Appellant: Well as you know most of the product comes through the airports, comes straight through not everything eh. 
        
       
       
        
        Chin: Need to clear. 
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: x-rayed or smelled it comes by air container. 
        
       
       
        
        Chin: Yea 
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: and it comes if you pay the right money. It comes prior priority airport to airport so it will come about of um Hong King (sic) straight to Sydney okay and Maj … the majority of of um okay the last last one was unlucky very unlucky.” 
        
       
      
    59 In my opinion these telephone calls were relevant to establish the nature of the relationship between the appellant and Mr Chin. It demonstrated that the appellant was discussing with Mr Chin his knowledge of custom procedures in Australia. From it the jury could understand that the appellant believed that the interception by customs of the parcel the subject of the indictment was simply “unlucky” and that most parcels arriving by airfreight are not subject to x-rays. Accordingly, the telephone calls are capable of establishing the nature of the relationship between them with respect to a previous importation even though the primary object of the conversation may have been the prospect of a further importation. 
     
      
    60 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: 
       
      
    61 The appellant’s trial commenced on 15 November 2004. On that day he was present in court. 
     
      
    62 The appellant complains that he was not in court on 11 November 2004 when his matter was considered by the court.  
     
      
    63 The record indicates that on that day he was arraigned before Andrews ADCJ. It would appear that the trial did not proceed before his Honour and the matter was referred on the same day to Finnane DCJ. I infer that the appellant had been returned to the cells and was not present in court before Finnane DCJ. 
     
      
    64 This Court has been provided with a transcript of the proceedings before Finnane DCJ on 11 November 2004. It reveals a discussion between counsel and his Honour as to the general nature of the Crown case and the preliminary issues that may arise. There was also discussion of the arrangements necessary to take evidence including the prospect of a video link with China. The Crown brief was provided to his Honour and the essence of the Crown case was explained. Counsel for the appellant indicated matters which may require resolution during the course of the trial. 
     
      
    65 The transcript does not indicate whether the appellant was present before Finnane DCJ. However, before adjourning at lunchtime his Honour was recorded as saying that “the accused is remanded in custody, he will come back before me at 3 pm.” The transcript does not indicate whether the accused was in court either before the luncheon adjournment or when the matter resumed at 3 pm. However, it does not suggest that he was not present. 
     
      
    66 Pre-trial matters were further considered on 12 November 2004 when the transcript records his Honour as saying “we had better get the accused up.” The transcript indicates that he was present on that day. Counsel seeks an opportunity to consult with him during the course of the proceedings. 
     
      
    67 As I have indicated during the course of 11 November the appellant was represented by counsel. Although pre-trial matters were considered the trial did not commence until 15 November 2004. If, as the appellant alleges, he was not in court during these discussions an oversight took place. He was entitled to be present. However, if he was absent this did not prejudice his trial and, in my view, no miscarriage of justice took place. He was present throughout his trial. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 
       
      
    68 During the course of the pre-trial discussions the trial judge indicated that he would not rule in relation to some foreshadowed objections until the trial had commenced. His Honour indicated that this would enable the arguments in relation to admissibility to be assessed in light of the relevant context. As it happened objections to the admissibility of the relevant evidence were heard early in the trial during the evidence of the first witness. That witness was not cross examined until the objections to the evidence had been ruled upon. 
     
      
    69 In my opinion the appellant’s submission on this matter is entirely without substance. The course which his Honour took was appropriate. The transcript reveals that by about the fourth day of the trial practical problems were emerging and rulings were necessary. The matter was raised with his Honour and rulings were made. 
     
      
    70 I reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 6, 7 and 8 
       
      
    71 It is convenient to consider these grounds together. The essence of these grounds is the appellant’s submission that evidence of events after 8 April 2004 was irrelevant. The appellant submitted that any argument or direction which relates to events after 8 April is “distorted” and “dangerously prejudicial.” I have already concluded that evidence of these events was properly admitted at the trial. It must follow that that evidence was relevant and could be referred to by counsel and his Honour when summing up to the jury. 
     
      
    72 The appellant also complained of various phrases used by his Honour in the course of his summing up. Some of the phrases were used in relation to the alleged illegal operation and some are descriptive of the appellant. In using these phrases his Honour was repeating the arguments of the prosecutor and defence counsel. Elsewhere his Honour sought to put the appellant’s case into perspective. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Can I say that that is really the big issue that you are being asked to decide. Is he a man who, because he was short of cash, joined with a Chinese drug dealer in an operation that would give him cash to make up that shortfall or is he a dupe, is he a stupid fellow who is taken advantage of by someone who has failed to pay him, who has been sucked into a scheme which he suspected might have some illegality attached to it, hence his use of a false name and so on, but who did not think for a minute he was involved in importing narcotics. That is really what it comes down to in the whole case, you have got to decide that.” 
        
       
      
    73 Although his Honour used somewhat colourful language a fair reading of the submissions by the appellant’s counsel to the jury make his Honour’s remarks appropriate. The defence case which the jury were required to consider was, as his Honour summarised it, based upon the proposition that the appellant was naïve and did not realise that he was being used for the purpose of importing drugs. 
     
      
    74 I reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    75 The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 years and 5 months with a non parole period of 4 years. The maximum penalty for the importation of a traffickable quantity of MDMA is 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    76 The traffickable range for MDMA is between .5 grams and .5 kilograms. The amount of pure drug which the appellant imported was 99.1 grams. 
     
      
    77 The appellant submitted that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. The submission is supported by reference to the statistics from the Judicial Commission which suggest that both before and after the repeal of s 16G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act the head sentence and the non-parole period were above the median sentence which has been imposed. 
     
      
    78 The appellant submitted that his Honour exaggerated the role of the appellant in the importation. There was no evidence that he financed the activity or shared in the profits. It was submitted that his role was confined to organising the collection of the drugs and their delivery to the distributor. Such a role, involving greater exposure to the risk of detection, was said to be usually associated with those towards the lower end of the criminal hierachy. 
     
      
    79 The appellant referred to a number of previous cases. In R v Muradian (2002) NSWCCA 371 the offender, who was found guilty after trial had imported 452.9 grams of pure ecstasy. She was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3½ years. An appeal against the severity of the sentence was dismissed. 
     
      
    80 In R v Nai Poon (2003) 56 NSWLR 284; [2003] NSWCCA 42 the offender pleaded guilty to importing 5,800 tablets with a net weight of 392 grams. The sentencing judge said there was doubt that the offender was the principal although he was not a mere courier. He was sentenced to 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and his appeal against severity was dismissed. 
     
      
    81 In R v McGregor (2000) 120 A Crim R 24 the offender had been committed for sentence on four charges only one of which was relevant to his appeal. A courier had brought into Australia approximately 8,000 tablets containing 647.3 grams of ecstasy which had been detected at the airport. The offender was found to have been motivated by financial gain. He was 23 at the time and had no prior record and was considered to have good prospects of rehabilitation. The offender was sentenced as a courier and a term of imprisonment of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years was imposed. On appeal the sentence was reduced to one of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole of 5 years although this decision was significantly influenced by considerations of parity. 
     
      
    82 In R v Meloh (2001) 10 NSWCCA 211 the offender pleaded guilty to an offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a traffickable quantity of MDMA being 471.5 grams. The offender arranged to and received a package which contained the drugs. He was sentenced as “a quite low level operative in the hierachical structure of the operation” but “not just a courier” and someone who “did organise the actual importation.” He was accepted to be contrite and susceptible to pressure being a refugee who had participated in the exercise in order to obtain a passport to enable his sister to leave Somalia. The sentencing judge had imposed a sentence of 6 years imprisonment including a non-parole period of 4½ years. The appeal was confined to the non-parole which was reduced by this Court to 3 years and 7 months. The Court was also referred in a supplementary written submission to the cases referred to by Hulme J in R v Schofield (2003) 138 A Crim R 19. Those cases confirm the broad range of circumstances including variations in the role of the offender and the weight of narcotic imported for which sentences have been imposed. 
     
      
    83 When sentencing the appellant the trial judge concluded that he was relevantly a principal. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have come to the conclusion he is a principal because what he did in this operation establishes that he went with Mr Chin to make the arrangements with the customs agent in Australia. He went to pick up every package. He provided false letterheads with false destinations. He made numerous phone calls to Mr Chin and others associated with Mr Chin. He pursued the customs agents if any parcel was delayed. He was the one and was to get the money to pay out the customs agent for the clearance of the parcels in Australia.” 
        
       
      
    84 His Honour said that “in my opinion it was perfectly obvious that he knew that there were drugs of some kind in this box. A person can be a principal without being a financier. He can be a principal even though another person is of more importance in the organisation.” 
     
      
    85 The appellant pleaded not guilty and has continued to maintain his innocence. He has shown no remorse. 
     
      
    86 The appellant’s argument has two primary elements. Firstly, consideration is given to the available statistics and the amount of the drug imported. In Wong v The Queen and Leung v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584; [2001] HCA 64 the High Court questioned whether weight was the “chief factor to be taken into account in fixing a sentence.” Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at [68]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It must be recognised that not all offenders will know or even suspect how much pure narcotic is to be imported. Apart from the extent to which the pure narcotic is diluted or cut (a matter about which those involved in the importation may know little or nothing), it is by no means uncommon for many of those involved in an importation of narcotics to know nothing at all about what they are dealing with, except that it is a quantity of narcotic.” 
        
       
      
    87 Their Honours went on to conclude that this Court had erred in attributing chief importance to the weight of narcotic in fixing sentences. Their Honours said at [70]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The selection of weight of narcotic as the chief factor to be taken into account in fixing sentence represents a departure from fundamental principal.” 
        
       
      
    88 Although it is plain that the weight of narcotic is a relevant matter the offender’s state of knowledge about the importation and the nature of any reward may be more significant when determining the offender’s criminality (see Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048; [2005] HCA 25). 
     
      
    89 In my opinion his Honour was correct to conclude that the appellant was relevantly a principal in the offence. His role was essential. He was responsible for making arrangements with customs agents and set up the facilities by which the drugs were being imported into Australia. He was also to be responsible for making the necessary payments to ensure that the drugs were cleared through customs, collected and made available for distribution. 
     
      
    90 Consideration of the previous decisions to which the appellant referred do not persuade me that the sentence his Honour imposed was excessive. In some of those cases the offender pleaded guilty and in Meloh the judge accepted the offender was contrite. The decision in McGregor is difficult to compare with the present matter because of considerations of parity. 
     
      
    91 With respect to the statistics from the Judicial Commission the appellant submitted that both the head sentence and non-parole period imposed on the appellant were above the median sentence for this offence. This may be so but the statistics also confirm that the sentence imposed was not outside the available range.  
     
      
    92 Although I would grant leave to appeal against sentence I would dismiss that appeal. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted but the appeal dismissed. 
       
      
    93 HULME J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    94 HISLOP J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with James J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Vural Can appealed against his conviction after a trial in the District Court before his Honour Judge Sorby and a jury on one count of robbery in company with wounding, an offence against s 98 of the Crimes Act. Judge Sorby sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment of eight and a half years with a non-parole period of five and a half years commencing on 27 December 2007. In the event of his appeal against conviction being dismissed, the appellant applied for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    3 The offence of robbery in company with wounding of which the appellant was convicted was, according to the Crown case, committed on 4 June 2002. However, the appellant’s trial before Judge Sorby did not take place until late 2005 (25 October 2005 – 1 November 2005). In making the sentence he imposed commence on 27 December 2007, Judge Sorby had regard to another sentence for an unrelated offence that the appellant was serving. 
     
      
    4 There had been an earlier trial of the appellant on the present charge in March 2005 before his Honour Judge Graham and a jury. However, this trial had been aborted, after the appellant discharged his counsel at that trial.  
     
      
    5 The appellant was represented by counsel throughout the trial before Judge Sorby. However, he was not legally represented on this appeal, preparing his own written submissions and making his own oral submissions to the Court.  
     
      
       
      The Crown case at the trial 
       
      
    6 The Crown case at the trial was that the appellant was one of two offenders who on 4 June 2002 robbed a firm named Nine Star Trading of a quantity of diamonds and a man named Mihir Ghandi of two mobile telephones, wounding Mihir Ghandi.  
     
      
    7 The principal Crown witness at the trial was Mr Ghandi and I will briefly summarise some of his evidence.  
     
      
    8 In June 2002 Mr Ghandi was working as a diamond grader for Nine Star Trading, a firm of wholesale diamond merchants. Nine Star Trading carried on business in an apartment on the thirty-third level of a building in Castlereagh Street in the city of Sydney. I will refer to this apartment as “the business apartment”. Mr Ghandi lived in an apartment on the fourteenth level of the same building (“the home apartment”). Mr Ghandi’s immediate superior was a man named Paul Madziar. Diamonds were kept by the business in a safe in the business apartment, to which Mr Ghandi had a key.  
     
      
    9 On the morning of 4 June 2002 Mr Ghandi returned to the building in Castlereagh Street, after making a delivery to a customer. 
     
      
    10 When Mr Ghandi got out of the lift on the thirty-third level of the building, he saw two men standing outside the door of the business apartment. One man, who Mr Ghandi referred to in his evidence as “the first man” was carrying an iron bar. The other man, who Mr Ghandi referred to in his evidence as “the second man” was carrying a small handgun. The second man was wearing a black leather jacket. 
     
      
    11 It was the Crown case at the trial that the appellant was the second man. The Crown said that the first man was a man named Fabian Mariconte, who in fact pleaded guilty to the same charge as that brought against the appellant and who had been sentenced by another District Court judge, his Honour Judge Solomon, before either of the appellant’s trials.  
     
      
    12 Mr Ghandi said that the two men standing outside the door of the business apartment grabbed him. The second man threatened to shoot him. There was a physical struggle and Mr Ghandi fell to the floor. Mr Ghandi dropped the bag he was carrying and also dropped a bunch of keys. The second man hit Mr Ghandi on the face and picked up the keys he had dropped. The second man dragged Mr Ghandi to the door of the exit to the fire stairs in the building, opened the door and dragged Mr Ghandi on to the fire stairs. Mr Ghandi was forced to sit down on a step of the fire stairs. Both the two men put gloves on their hands. 
     
      
    13 The first man produced some ropes and the second man tied Mr Ghandi’s ankles and hands. The second man took the two mobile telephones Mr Ghandi was carrying. The second man put part of the iron bar under Mr Ghandi’s chin and demanded to know where the diamonds were. Mr Ghandi said that the diamonds were in the safe in the business apartment and that the key to the safe was in the bunch of keys Mr Ghandi had dropped. 
     
      
    14 The first man, who now had the handgun, asked the second man whether he should shoot Mr Ghandi but the second man replied “No”.  
     
      
    15 The second man asked Mr Ghandi whether there was anyone inside the business apartment and Mr Ghandi answered “No”. The second man said that he would go inside the business apartment and that, if the key did not open the safe, he would come back and shoot Mr Ghandi. 
     
      
    16 The second man left the fire stairs. The first man remained with Mr Ghandi on the fire stairs. Mr Ghandi started crying. He was conscious that he was bleeding from wounds to his face. 
     
      
    17 After a time the second man returned. He gagged Mr Ghandi with a piece of cloth and tied Mr Ghandi up further with more ropes. The second man then walked away down the fire stairs. The first man told Mr Ghandi not to try to escape and then himself walked down the fire stairs. This was the last that Mr Ghandi saw of either of the two men. 
     
      
    18 Mr Ghandi waited a few minutes and then succeeded in freeing himself from the ropes. He went to the home apartment and telephoned Mr Madziar.  
     
      
    19 Mr Ghandi gave further evidence, to some of which I will refer later in this judgment. 
     
      
    20 Other witnesses in the Crown case at the trial included three police officers, Detectives Gibson, Waites and Huntley. Detective Gibson was the police officer-in-charge of the investigation into the robbery. 
     
      
    21 At the trial the Crown sought to establish that the appellant was the second man referred to by Mr Ghandi in his evidence, by evidence of an identification by Mr Ghandi of a computer image of the appellant as being an image of the second man, by what was submitted to be a resemblance to the appellant of a com-fit picture of the second man prepared by police on the basis of information supplied by Mr Ghandi and by evidence that one of the mobile telephones which had been taken from Mr Ghandi had been used after the robbery with a SIM card in the name of Mustafa Sasi, which the Crown alleged was an alias of the appellant. The Crown also relied on evidence of a use of the SIM card in the city, near the apartment building, at 10:18 on 4 June 2002.  
     
      
       
      The appellant’s case at the trial 
       
      
    22 The appellant did not give evidence at the trial and did not call any evidence.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal against conviction 
       
      
    23 The grounds of appeal against conviction were:- 
     
      
     1. The trial judge erred in allowing evidence of photo array. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
     2. The trial judge erred in allowing a com-fit photo. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
     3. The trial judge erred in admitting irrelevant evidence being the telephone records of Mustafa Sasi. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
     4. The trial judge erred in allowing hearsay evidence to be given by Detective Gibson on behalf of Vodafone. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
     5. The verdict of guilty was unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
     6. Fresh evidence. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
     7. The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury. 
      
       
      
    24 The sixth ground of appeal was abandoned by the appellant.  
     
      
    25 In addition to these grounds of appeal, the appellant also lodged a document with this Court setting out a number of “supplementary” grounds of appeal.  
     
      
    26 As I have previously noted, the appellant was not legally represented on this appeal, preparing his own written submissions and making his own oral submissions. In his written and oral submissions the appellant demonstrated a good command of English and a very detailed knowledge of the facts of the case. His submissions were put forcefully. 
     
      
    27 The appellant, not being a lawyer, had an understandable tendency to seek to base a number of his submissions on documents which had come into existence in the course of the criminal proceedings against him, such as witness statements, evidence given in committal proceedings and evidence given in the trial before Judge Graham, but which had not been admitted into evidence in the trial before Judge Sorby.  
     
      
    28 When this problem with some of his submissions was pointed out to the appellant on the first day of the hearing of the appeal, the appellant sought to tender a number of these documents in the appeal. The Crown prosecutor, in deference to the appellant not being legally represented, did not object to the tender of the documents and this Court, also mindful that the appellant was not legally represented, admitted the documents into evidence on this appeal, without requiring the appellant to establish that the conditions for the admissibility of fresh evidence had been satisfied. 
     
      
    29 A consequence of the latitude extended to the appellant was that there was a substantial amount of new evidence before this Court, which was not before Judge Sorby and the jury at the trial and which complicated the determination of some of the grounds of appeal.  
     
      
    30 Even after the documents which were tendered by the appellant were admitted into evidence, there were still a number of documents referred to in the appellant’s submissions, which had not been admitted into evidence at the trial and had not been admitted into evidence in the appeal. 
     
      
    31 I will now deal in turn with the grounds of appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    1. The trial judge erred in allowing evidence of photo array. 
     
      
    32 In his statement and in his oral evidence Mr Ghandi described the second man as Caucasian, with fair skin, about 5’8” tall, having a solid build, in his mid-30s, with a sharp nose and a slight beard growth, wearing a black leather jacket and with a woollen beanie on the top of his head, leaving his face visible. In his evidence Mr Ghandi often referred to the second man as “the man in the black leather jacket”.  
     
      
    33 On 10 September 2003, that is about 15 months after the robbery, Mr Ghandi, as part of the police investigation, viewed on a computer successive colour images of 12 men, an image of the appellant being the fifth to be presented (“image number 5”). Mr Ghandi selected image number 5 as being an image of the second man in the robbery.  
     
      
    34 Photographs of the 12 images viewed by Mr Ghandi became exhibit 5 at the trial. Black and white copies of the photographs in exhibit 5 were before this Court.  
     
      
    35 Police recorded the process of identification carried out on 10 September 2003 in a video/audio recording and this recording became exhibit 4 at the trial. However, exhibit 4 was not before this Court, so that this Court has not seen or listened to the recording.  
     
      
    36 The evidence about the identification made by Mr Ghandi on 10 September 2003 can be referred to, conveniently if not entirely accurately, as “the evidence of photographic identification” and I will so refer to it in this judgment. 
     
      
    37 The admissibility of the evidence of photographic identification had been challenged at the trial before Judge Graham, on the ground that any probative value it had was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice (Evidence Act s 137). A voir dire inquiry was conducted and Judge Graham gave a judgment in which he concluded that the evidence of photographic identification was admissible.  
     
      
    38 A voir dire inquiry to determine the admissibility of the evidence of photographic identification was also held at the trial before Judge Sorby. Documents which became exhibits in the voir dire inquiry before Judge Sorby but which are not before this Court include a transcript of the voir dire inquiry held before Judge Graham and a transcript of evidence given in the committal proceedings against the appellant on 16 November 2004.  
     
      
    39 Judge Sorby held that the evidence of photographic identification was admissible, its probative value outweighing any prejudicial effect it might have. His Honour referred to Judge Graham’s judgment, which had became available to Judge Sorby during the voir dire hearing, and said that he agreed with Judge Graham’s conclusion. 
     
      
    40 In his judgment Judge Sorby referred to a submission by counsel for the appellant that an examination of image number 5 revealed the collar of a black leather jacket and that that circumstance could explain why Mr Ghandi had identified image number 5 as being an image of the second man, the second man having been repeatedly described by Mr Ghandi as “the man in the black leather jacket”. Judge Sorby considered that some other images in the array showed men with collars and it was not clear that it was a partial revelation of a collar in image number 5 which had caused Mr Ghandi to select image number 5.  
     
      
    41 On this appeal a number of submissions were made by the appellant in support of this ground of appeal, including the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1) On 4 June 2002 Mr Ghandi’s ability to observe the offenders would have been impaired by his emotional state of fear, by the blows he had received on his head and by the instructions, which he agreed he had been given and which he had complied with, to keep his head down. 
       
       
      (2) There were deficiencies in the array of images which Mr Ghandi had viewed. A number of arguments were put.  
       
       
      As already noted, Mr Ghandi, in his original statement to the police and in his evidence, had repeatedly referred to the second man as “the man in the black leather jacket”.  
       
       
      The image of the appellant which was included in the array had been taken by police on 27 August 2003. The appellant asserted that on that occasion police had dressed him in a black leather jacket and the image of the appellant which Mr Ghandi had viewed on 10 September 2003 had shown him wearing the black leather jacket. The appellant asserted that police had subsequently tampered with the image (“chopped” it) by removing most of the part of the image showing the black leather jacket. 
       
       
      It was submitted by the appellant that, notwithstanding the tampering by police, a close inspection of the photograph of image number 5 still revealed part of the collar of a black leather jacket. 
       
       
      It was submitted by the appellant that a further deficiency in the array of images was that it included at number 6 an image of a man names Saffo. Mr Saffo lived in the same building as Mr Ghandi and was known to Mr Ghandi. He was also regarded by police as a suspect. The appellant submitted that the image of Mr Saffo had been placed in the array, next to the image of the appellant, as a “marker”, so as to attract Mr Ghandi’s attention to the image of the appellant.  
       
       
      It was further submitted that the appellant had described the second man in his statement and in his evidence as having a “sharp” nose. It was submitted that a number of images in the array were of men not having “sharp” noses but wide or even broken noses.  
       
       
      (3) Mr Ghandi made the identification about 15 months after the date on which the crime was committed. 
       
       
      In identifying image number 5 as being an image of the second man Mr Ghandi went from initially not being sure to being progressively more confident and then to being completely confident. 
       
      
    42 I do not consider that this ground of appeal should be upheld.  
     
      
    43 The ruling made by the trial judge in applying s 137 of the Evidence Act was that the probative value of the evidence of photographic identification by Mr Ghandi was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. Such a ruling, while it does not involve the exercise of a discretion, is, for the purposes of appellate review, analogous to an exercise of a discretion. See R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 per Sheller JA at [19]. As such, the ruling could be reviewed only in accordance with the well-known principles stated in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. In my opinion, the trial judge has not been shown to have erred, within the principles stated in House v The King, in ruling that the evidence of photographic identification was admissible.  
     
      
    44 Although I have held that the trial judge did not make any error, I will myself consider the merits of the appellant’s submissions.  
     
      
    45 Whatever emotional state Mr Ghandi was in on 4 June 2002 and whatever injuries he suffered, he had the opportunity, for a number of minutes at very close quarters and in an apparently good light, to observe both of the offenders, their faces not being covered. It is clear from Mr Ghandi’s account of what happened on 4 June 2002 that he was not looking down all the time.  
     
      
    46 There was no evidence at the trial or in the appeal to support the appellant’s assertions in his submissions that on 27 August 2003 police had dressed him in a black leather jacket and that subsequently police had tampered with the image taken on 27 August 2003.  
     
      
    47 There are suggestions in the transcript of the trial that the photographs of the images which became exhibit 5 were slightly smaller in scale than the images Mr Ghandi had viewed on 10 September 2003. There was, however, no evidence or even any suggestion that the photographs differed, in any other respect, from the images Mr Ghandi had viewed.  
     
      
    48 When the photographs were tendered at the trial, counsel for the appellant at the trial said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I have no objection. I am not sure it is the same size as that which this witness (Mr Ghandi) observed at close quarters. I think it looks a bit smaller but as a depiction per se of what was shown, I have no objection”. 
        
       
      
    49 In the cross-examination of Mr Ghandi at the trial the following question and answer occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And these photos are precisely what you saw in slightly larger scale on 10 September? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    50 If the police had engaged in the conduct alleged by the appellant, their conduct would have been grossly improper. At the trial it was not put or suggested to any of the police witnesses that police had acted as the appellant in his submissions on the appeal alleged they had acted. 
     
      
    51 It is true that in the cross-examination of Mr Ghandi the following question and answer occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Number 5 appears to be wearing, doesn’t he, a leather jacket? The collar of a leather jacket with a blue shirt or garment underneath, that’s what it looks like; have a look? 
         
        A. Yes. Actually I’m just seeing that now.” 
        
       
      
    52 Although Mr Ghandi agreed with this leading question put to him in cross-examination, I consider, having myself inspected photograph number 5, that it is not really possible to say that the quite tiny amount of a collar, which is the only part visible of the garment the appellant was wearing on 27 August 2003, was the collar of a black leather jacket. Mr Ghandi himself gave evidence that on 10 September 2003 he had not taken any notice of the collars persons were wearing and had made his identification on the basis of the facial features.  
     
      
    53 I accept that an image of Mr Saffo should not have been included in the array. Mr Saffo was known to Mr Ghandi. If Mr Saffo had been one of the offenders, he would have been immediately recognised by Mr Ghandi. Hence, the inclusion in the array of an image of Mr Saffo had the effect of reducing the number of images which might be images of the offender to 11. This was, however, still a substantial number. 
     
      
    54 The submission that the inclusion of the image of Mr Saffo had the purpose and the effect of attracting Mr Ghandi’s attention to the image of the appellant seems to me far-fetched.  
     
      
    55 I have myself inspected the noses in the photographs forming exhibit 5 and have concluded that the differences in the appearances of the noses are only slight.  
     
      
    56 It is correct that more than 15 months had elapsed between the date of the robbery and the date of the photographic identification. In his judgment Judge Sorby expressly referred to this matter and in his summing-up his Honour expressly referred the jury to this matter. 
     
      
    57 With regard to the stages in his identification on 10 September 2003 of image number 5 as being an image of the second man, Mr Ghandi gave the following evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Like first time: yes, this is the man. Second time I get more convinced. Third time I get a 100%, you know. The steps, the more you see, the more you’re convinced. The first time also I was: yes, this is the man. I was not “maybe this man or this man”. No. Like first time I saw: yes. But after so many times, so long period in between, I was doing something which, like I was pointing on somebody. I considered myself very responsible to do that. I didn’t want to make any mistake in any situation…” 
        
       
      
    58 The jury had the advantage of being able to see and listen to the video/audio recording of the process of identification carried out by Mr Ghandi on 10 September 2003 and hence were able to assess for themselves how convincing Mr Ghandi’s identification was. 
     
      
    59 The actual decision in Blick can readily be distinguished from the present case. In Blick the offender had a goatee beard and in the array of photographs shown to the witness only the photograph of the offender showed a goatee beard. In addition, the photograph of the offender was of a different size and shape from that of the other photographs in the array.  
     
      
    60 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    2. The trial judge erred in allowing a com-fit photo 
     
      
    61 Mr Ghandi and Constable Huntley gave evidence about the compiling of a com-fit picture of the second man in the robbery.  
     
      
    62 Mr Ghandi was shown a book containing many pictures of particular parts of the human face. For each part of the face Mr Ghandi selected the picture which he considered was the closest to being a representation of that part of the face of the second man. An image of a full face incorporating all of the parts selected by Mr Ghandi was prepared (“the first image”—“release 1”). 
     
      
    63 Mr Ghandi suggested changes to release 1, which Constable Huntley noted in handwriting on release 1, and a further image was prepared incorporating these changes (“the second image” — “release 2”). 
     
      
    64 Mr Ghandi suggested further changes, which Constable Huntley noted in handwriting on release 2, and a further image incorporating these changes was prepared (“the third image” — “release 3”). 
     
      
    65 All three images were admitted at the trial as exhibit 3.  
     
      
    66 Constable Huntley gave part of her evidence by reading, without any objection, a statement she had made. In her statement she said that the com-fit images had been prepared on various dates specified by her between 6 June 2002 and 11 June 2002.  
     
      
    67 At the trial there was no objection by counsel for the appellant to any of the evidence relating to the compiling of the com-fit images or to the tender of the three com-fit images. Indeed, counsel for the appellant at the trial said that he had no objection to the images being immediately admitted, after they had been identified by Mr Ghandi in giving his evidence, even though the first two releases had handwriting on them by Constable Huntley, who had not yet given her evidence.  
     
      
    68 As there was no objection at the trial to the admission into evidence of the com-fit images, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies.  
     
      
    69 A number of submissions were made by the appellant about the com-fit images.  
     
      
    70 Mr Ghandi made a supplemental statement on 3 May 2004, in which he referred to the compiling of the com-fit images and to which a copy of release 3 was annexed. In paragraph 7 of the supplementary statement Mr Ghandi said that he could remember assisting police in compiling the image which was release 3, on the same day that he had made his first statement, that is 6 June 2002. In fact, he had assisted police in compiling the com-fit images over the period from 6 June 2002 to 11 June 2002. 
     
      
    71 The appellant submitted that there were contradictions in witness statements and in evidence concerning which com-fit images had been released to the media and on which dates.  
     
      
    72 The appellant complained that the jury had not been supplied with further documents about the preparation of the com-fit images. 
     
      
    73 The appellant submitted that Constable Huntley had given evidence that Mr Ghandi had selected a picture of a nose which was bent but in release 3 the image showed a straight nose.  
     
      
    74 Somewhat inconsistently with the ground of appeal, the appellant submitted that release 3 did not look like him. 
     
      
    75 Apart from these particular submissions, I understood the appellant to make a general submission to the effect that the com-fit evidence had been fabricated by the police.  
     
      
    76 I would refuse leave under r 4 to rely on this ground of appeal. The error about dates made by Mr Ghandi in his supplementary statement and any errors concerning the release of com-fit images to the media were insignificant. Mr Ghandi and Constable Huntley did not at the trial give any evidence about how the shape of the nose had been selected for the com-fit images. No suggestion was made at the trial to Mr Ghandi or Constable Huntley that the preparation of the com-fit images had been fabricated.  
     
      
    3. The trial judge erred in admitting irrelevant evidence, being the telephone records of Mustafa Sasi 
     
      
    77 In the appellant’s submissions there was some overlap, and indeed confusion, between this ground of appeal and the following ground of appeal. I will confine my consideration of this ground of appeal to a consideration of its actual terms.  
     
      
    78 The Crown case that the telephone records of Mustafa Sasi were relevant can be stated as follows.  
     
      
    79 As previously noted, Mr Ghandi gave evidence that the offenders robbed him of two mobile telephones. One of the mobile telephones had an international mobile equipment identity number (“IMEI No”) 448902300859530. 
     
      
    80 At the request of Detective Waites a police intelligence agency sought information from Vodafone, which was the service provider, about the call charge records for charged party number 405009780 in May-June 2002. Vodafone provided records, which became exhibit 8 at the trial.  
     
      
    81 These records supplied by Vodafone showed that at 21:04:10 on 8 June 2002 the mobile telephone had been used, for the first time, with a particular SIM card inserted in it. This SIM card was in the name of Mustafa Sasi. Between 8 June 2002 and 11 June 2002 the mobile telephone was used about 70 times, using the SIM card in the name of Mustafa Sasi. After 11 June there was no further recorded use of the mobile telephone.  
     
      
    82 According to Roads and Traffic Authority records, Mustafa Sasi had been born on 26 September 1962, his address was 4/30 Beach Road Bondi and the number of his driving licence was 3864DV. The appellant had the same date of birth, the same address and the same driving licence number. Evidence was also given at the trial that searches of electoral rolls and in the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages had not disclosed any Mustafa Sasi. The appellant departed for overseas on 11 June 2002, the date of the last recorded use of the mobile telephone.  
     
      
    83 In summary then, the Crown case for evidence of the telephone records of Mustafa Sasi being relevant was that between 8 June 2002 (that is only four days after the robbery) and 11 June 2002 one of the mobile phones stolen from Mr Ghandi had been used with a SIM card in the name of Mustafa Sasi and that Mustafa Sasi was identical with the appellant.  
     
      
    84 Evidence of the telephone records of Mustafa Sasi was objected to at the trial. Judge Sorby held that the evidence was relevant and that its probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect it might have.  
     
      
    85 On this appeal it was submitted by the appellant that SIM cards are frequently transferred from one mobile telephone to another; that the mobile telephone taken from Mr Ghandi was not used with the SIM card in the name of Mustafa Sasi until 8 June 2002, that is four days after the robbery; and that he was not Mustafa Sasi.  
     
      
    86 In my opinion, the evidence of the telephone records was relevant and Judge Sorby was not shown to have erred in deciding that the probative value of the evidence exceeded any prejudicial effect. The matters raised by the appellant are matters which, at the highest, might possibly affect the weight of the evidence but were not matters preventing the evidence from being relevant. They were all matters which could readily be assessed by the jury.  
     
      
    87 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    4. The trial judge erred in allowing hearsay evidence — Mr Gibson giving evidence on behalf of Vodafone 
     
      
    88 The mobile telephone records produced by Vodafone which became exhibit 8 were admitted into evidence while Detective Gibson was giving evidence. Before the records were admitted into evidence Detective Gibson had given evidence that the enquiries of Vodafone had not been made by him personally but by a police intelligence agency, acting at the request of Detective Waites. When the records were tendered, counsel for the appellant at the trial did not object to the tender.  
     
      
    89 It is true that counsel for the appellant at the trial had previously objected to the records being admitted but on the ground that the records were irrelevant (that is, the ground which was the basis of the third ground of appeal, with which I have already dealt). No objection was taken at the trial to the records being identified by Detective Gibson and being admitted while Detective Gibson was giving evidence.  
     
      
    90 On the appeal it was submitted by the appellant that the evidence of the Vodafone records was hearsay evidence. However, the submissions made by the appellant went beyond a submission that the evidence was hearsay evidence; it was submitted that the Vodafone records had been fabricated by the police. 
     
      
    91 In support of the submission that the Vodafone records had been fabricated by police, the appellant pointed out that the Vodafone records admitted as exhibit 8, unlike some other exhibits at the trial or in the appeal consisting of records produced by mobile telephone service providers, were not accompanied by a statement by an employee of the service provider verifying the records. 
     
      
    92 It was submitted by the appellant that the presence on the sheets in exhibit 8 of signatures of Detective Waites showed that the records had been fabricated by police. 
     
      
    93 The appellant compared exhibit 8 with other records produced by Vodafone at a different time but also being call charge records for charged party number 405009780 in May-June 2002, which became exhibit L in the appeal. It was submitted that exhibit L was in a different format from exhibit 8, for example having a different number of calls on the first sheet and the difference in the format between exhibit 8 and exhibit L showed that exhibit 8 had been fabricated by police. 
     
      
    94 I accept that the evidence of the Vodafone records was clearly hearsay evidence. However, no objection to its admission was taken on this ground at the trial. If any such objection had been taken, then it is likely that an employee of Vodafone could have been called to prove the records. 
     
      
    95 The sheets in exhibit 8 have Detective Waites’ signature on them, for the simple reason that the sheets were annexed to a statement made by Detective Waites and Detective Waites signed the sheets to authenticate them as forming the annexure to his statement. 
     
      
    96 The sheets forming exhibit 8 and the sheets forming exhibit L are not in identical format but the particulars of the entries in the two exhibits are identical. Exhibit L in fact confirms the authenticity of exhibit 8. 
     
      
    97 At the trial no suggestion was made to Detective Gibson or to Detective Waites that the documents which became exhibit 8 had been fabricated. 
     
      
    98 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    5. The verdict of guilty was unsafe and unsatisfactory 
     
      
    99 The ground of appeal as framed by the appellant uses the expression “unsafe and unsatisfactory”. Since the decision of the High Court in Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250 the expression “unsafe and unsatisfactory” has usually been avoided in stating a ground of appeal of the kind obviously contemplated by the appellant. In lieu of using the expression “unsafe and unsatisfactory” the ground of appeal has been stated, following the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, as being that “the verdict (of guilty) should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence”.  
     
      
    100 The principles to be applied by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining such a ground of appeal have been stated by the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 434 and MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 and need not be repeated here. The ultimate question for the Court of Criminal Appeal is whether it considers that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. 
     
      
    101 In the present case the Crown relied on two bodies of evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The evidence of identification 
         
        (2) The circumstantial evidence based on the telephone records of Mustafa Sasi 
        
       
      
    102 I have already discussed in some detail the evidence of identification in considering the first ground of appeal and the circumstantial evidence based on the telephone records in considering the third and fourth grounds of appeal.  
     
      
    103 In considering the first ground of appeal I dealt with the submissions made by the appellant that on 4 June 2002 Mr Ghandi’s ability to observe the offenders, and particularly the second man, was impaired; that there were deficiencies in the array of images viewed by Mr Ghandi on 10 September 2003; and that a period of about 15 months elapsed between the time the offence was committed and the time the appellant was identified as being one of the offenders and that Mr Ghandi’s identification was initially less than certain. Having regard to what I have said in considering the appellant’s submissions on the first ground of appeal, I have concluded that it was open to the jury to accept that on 10 September 2003 Mr Ghandi had correctly identified the appellant as being the second man in the robbery.  
     
      
    104 It would have been open to the jury to consider that any doubts they had about the evidence of identification were resolved by the circumstantial evidence based on the telephone records of Mr Sasi. There was no doubt that a SIM card in the name of Mustafa Sasi had been used many times between 8 June 2002 and 11 June 2002 in one of the mobile telephones taken from Mr Ghandi. The evidence that Mustafa Sasi was identical with the appellant was compelling.  
     
      
    105 It is true that there was a period of four days between the robbery and the first use of the telephone taken from Mr Ghandi with the SIM card of Mustafa Sasi. However, it would have been open to the jury to regard the period of four days as quite short and to conclude that there was no reasonable possibility that the appellant had come into possession of the mobile telephone at some time after the robbery and before the first use of the telephone with Mustafa Sasi’s SIM card. 
     
      
    106 A further piece of evidence in the Crown case was the use of Mustafa Sasi’s SIM card at 10:18 on 4 June 2002 with the location, according to the call charge records, in the city of Sydney, near the apartment building.  
     
      
    107 The appellant made a number of submissions which appear to me to be irrelevant to whether it was open to the jury to conclude that the Crown had succeeded in proving beyond reasonable doubt that he was the second man in the robbery. For example, the appellant submitted that there was no evidence about how the offenders knew that there would be diamonds in the business apartment, the exterior of which did not disclose the nature of the business being carried on in the apartment, how the offenders knew about Mr Ghandi’s movements and how the offenders entered the building and reached the thirty-third level, without being filmed by the surveillance cameras in the building; that there was conflicting evidence about whether a 000 emergency call was made after the robbery and, if so, by whom; that there was evidence suggesting Mr Ghandi’s evidence that after the robbery he went to the home apartment was untrue; and that a very small photograph of the co-offender Mariconte which Mr Madziar found on the fire stairs of the building in July 2002 had been planted by police. 
     
      
    108 Some other submissions made by the appellant, for example submissions based on the absence of finger print and DNA evidence were not irrelevant but were of limited weight.  
     
      
    109 I would reject this ground of appeal.  
     
      
    6. Fresh evidence 
     
      
    110 As previously stated by me, this ground of appeal was abandoned. 
     
      
    7. The trial judge erred in giving directions to the jury 
     
      
    111 It was submitted by the appellant, in general terms and without making any specific criticism, that the trial judge had not given sufficient warnings to the jury, that the warnings given were merely recitals of formulas and that the summing-up was “hurried, quiet and rushed”. 
     
      
    112 In the summing-up the trial judge gave lengthy directions about inter alia identification evidence and circumstantial evidence. The directions on identification given by the trial judge appear to me to comply with ss 116 and 165 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    113 At the conclusion of the summing-up counsel for the appellant at the trial, having been invited by the trial judge to make any submission about the summing up, said that he did not ask for any additional direction of law. Counsel did ask that two fairly minor misstatements of the evidence be corrected and the trial judge complied with this request. Counsel for the appellant did not make any other complaint about the summing-up.  
     
      
    114 I would refuse leave under r 4 in relation to this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Supplementary grounds of appeal against conviction 
       
      
    115 Apart from the principal grounds of appeal, the appellant also relied on a number of supplementary grounds. These grounds were not precisely formulated by the appellant and had to be gleaned from a document lodged by the appellant headed “Supplementary grounds and submission”. I will deal in turn with what I take to be the supplementary grounds.  
     
      
       
      (1) Prejudicial evidence suggesting that the appellant was in custody or had a criminal history.  
       
      
    116 (a) Detective Gibson gave evidence that on 27 August 2003 he spoke to the appellant at a police station. Although not stated in the evidence, I infer that on 27 August 2003 the appellant, who was serving a sentence of imprisonment for an unrelated offence, was in the custody of a corrective services officer.  
     
      
    117 Detective Gibson gave further evidence that on 27 August 2003 he told the appellant that he wanted to interview the appellant about an allegation that he had been involved in the robbery on 4 June 2002. Detective Gibson administered a caution.  
     
      
    118 The transcript of the trial then records that counsel for the appellant at the trial said to the trial judge that a matter had arisen which should be dealt with in the absence of the jury.  
     
      
    119 After the jury had left the courtroom, counsel for the appellant submitted that Detective Gibson in giving evidence had used the words “corrective services supervisor”. It may be that those words appeared in a statement by Detective Gibson which counsel was following.  
     
      
    120 The trial judge and the Crown prosecutor agreed with each other that Detective Gibson had started to say the word “corrective” but had been cut off by the intervention of counsel, before he had said more than the syllables “correct-“.  
     
      
    121 The trial judge said at p 115 of the trial transcript:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I think the word “corrective” was cut off before the full word was out, the phrase “corrective services” was not used and there is no prejudice to the accused. And I believe that the transcription service, because the word was cut in half, did not transcribe it”. 
        
       
      
    122 (b) Detective Gibson gave evidence that the appellant’s date of birth had been ascertained from the police COPS database (the computerised operational policing system database). Detective Waites gave evidence that a search of the COPS database had disclosed that the appellant had previously provided the address 4/30 Beach Road, Bondi as being his address. 
     
      
    123 No objection was made by counsel for the appellant at the trial to either of these pieces of evidence being given.  
     
      
    124 Any possible prejudicial effect for the appellant would have been lessened by evidence given by Detective Gibson that information is recorded in the COPS database, not only about persons convicted of crimes but about persons who have witnessed crimes, persons who have reported crimes and persons applying for firearms licences or security licences. 
     
      
    125 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      (2) Evidence about searches and enquiries to determine whether a person Mustafa Sasi, separate from the appellant, existed. 
       
      
    126 A general complaint made by the appellant was that the searches and enquiries which had been made to determine whether a separate person Mustafa Sasi existed were inadequate. 
     
      
    127 A particular complaint made by the appellant related to evidence about whether a person Mustafa Sasi appeared in the records of the Australian Electoral Commission. In cross-examination Detective Gibson was asked whether a search had been made of the records of the Australian Electoral Commission for “Mustafa Sasi” and Detective Gibson had replied “no”. Near the end of the Crown case the Crown prosecutor sought to call evidence to show that a search had recently been made of the records of the Electoral Commission and that the result of the search was negative.  
     
      
    128 Counsel for the appellant at the trial opposed the giving of evidence of which the defence had received such late notice. It was originally contemplated by the Crown that the evidence, if permitted, would be hearsay evidence given by Detective Gibson and counsel for the appellant opposed the giving of such evidence by Detective Gibson, long after the cross-examination of Detective Gibson had been concluded. 
     
      
    129 The trial judge permitted the Crown to call Mr David Farrell, an officer of the Australian Electoral Commission, who gave evidence that he had searched the Commission’s records for a person Mustafa Sasi and had found no such person. In cross-examination Mr Farrell gave evidence that only Australian citizens are in electoral records and that persons who are not Australian citizens, of whom there were likely to be many in the Bondi area, would not be in the records. 
     
      
    130 In my opinion, there was no error in the trial judge acting as he did and I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      (3) Two members of the jury were reluctant to continue serving. 
       
      
    131 The transcript records that on the first day of the trial, after the trial had been proceeding for a short while, the trial judge received a note from a juror saying that he was self-employed and wished to be excused from serving on the jury.  
     
      
    132 Counsel for the appellant and the Crown prosecutor both made submissions to the effect that the juror should not be discharged, counsel for the appellant saying that he wished to retain a jury of twelve.  
     
      
    133 The trial judge informed the jury as a body that he had received a note from a juror and that the reason given by the juror for wishing to be excused was not a good enough reason to excuse the juror. 
     
      
    134 The appellant in his written submissions said that two jury members wanted to be discharged. After the trial commenced, the only application to be excused from serving on the jury was the application I have just referred to. However, in discussing the note from the juror with counsel, the trial judge said that before the trial had commenced two members of the jury panel had applied to be excused from serving. The judge had excused one of them on the grounds that she knew some of the witnesses. It would appear that the trial judge did not excuse the other member of the panel, who may or may not have been selected to serve on the jury.  
     
      
    135 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      (4) The address 4/30 Beach Road, Bondi Beach. 
       
      
    136 The appellant complained that in another criminal proceeding against him for a Commonwealth offence, the Commonwealth Crown had alleged that the appellant was not living at 4/30 Beach Road, Bondi Beach and that the placing by the appellant of that address on an incoming passenger card completed by him in December 2002 had been intended by the appellant to mislead the authorities. The appellant submitted that “the Crown cannot have it both ways”.  
     
      
    137 There was no evidence at the trial and there is no evidence before this Court about the alleged allegation by the Crown in a prosecution for a Commonwealth offence. In any event, the Crown would not be disbarred from seeking to show in the present proceedings that 4/30 Beach Road, Bondi Beach was the appellant’s address.  
     
      
    138 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      (5) The trial judge declined to give a  
      Longman 
       direction ( 
      Longman v The Queen 
       (1989) 168 CLR 79 esp at 91). 
       
      
    139 At the trial counsel for the appellant made a less than wholehearted application for a Longman direction. Counsel for the appellant informed the trial judge that the appellant had been notified of an allegation that he was involved in the robbery in March 2003. The trial judge declined to give a Longman direction.  
     
      
    140 The trial judge was not obliged to give a Longman direction in a case where the delay between the date of the offence and the date of the appellant being notified that he was suspected of having participated in the commission of the offence was only about nine months.  
     
      
    141 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      (6) Deficiencies in the summing-up 
       
      
    142 The appellant submitted that in the summing-up the trial judge had not sufficiently directed the jury about the elements of the offence charged and had not sufficient directed the jury about the weaknesses and inadequacies in the identification evidence. 
     
      
    143 This ground of appeal seems to be similar to the seventh principal ground of appeal. 
     
      
    144 In his summing-up the trial judge did direct the jury about the elements of the offence charged and he did draw the jury’s attention to possible inadequacies and weaknesses in the identification evidence. His Honour’s directions about identification evidence occupy about six pages of the transcript of the summing-up. 
     
      
    145 As I previously noted, counsel for the appellant at the trial, having heard the summing-up delivered, did not seek any further direction of law and merely applied for two relatively minor misstatements of the evidence to be corrected.  
     
      
    146 I would refuse leave under rule 4 in relation to this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      (7) The appellant’s address 
       
      
    147 In the summing-up the trial judge referred to 4/30 Beach Road, Bondi as being “the address given by the accused as his address”.  
     
      
    148 The appellant submitted that the fact that on the incoming passenger card completed by the appellant on 27 December 2002 he had stated that his “intended address in Australia” was 4/30 Beach Road, Bondi Beach was not a sufficient basis for the trial judge to say that that address was his address. The appellant said that there was an explanation for his having written that address on the incoming passenger card, other than that he intended to live there. 
     
      
    149 There was no evidence at the trial and there is no evidence before this Court of any other explanation.  
     
      
    150 Counsel for the appellant at the trial did not make any complaint about this part of the trial judge’s summing-up. 
     
      
    151 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      (8) Pre-trial publicity 
       
      
    152 The appellant said that about a month before his trial another District Court judge, Judge Solomon had sentenced Mariconte as being the appellant’s co-offender. The appellant said that in his remarks made on the sentencing of Mariconte Judge Solomon had named the appellant as having been Mariconte’s co-offender and had described how Mariconte and the appellant had allegedly committed the offence. It is true that Judge Solomon said these things in sentencing Mariconte. 
     
      
    153 The appellant submitted that Judge Solomon had infringed the presumption of innocence to which the appellant was entitled and that a member of the jury at the appellant’s trial might have accessed on the Internet the remarks made by Judge Solomon in sentencing Mariconte. 
     
      
    154 Mariconte was in fact sentenced by Judge Solomon on 11 February 2005, which would have been about a month before the aborted trial of the appellant before Judge Graham but was some months before the trial before Judge Sorby. 
     
      
    155 There is no evidence that Judge Solomon’s remarks on sentencing Mariconte had been placed on the Internet before the trial of the appellant before Judge Sorby took place. Remarks on sentence are usually not placed on the Internet, until after proceedings known to be pending against a co-offender have been completed. Even if the remarks on sentence were placed on the Internet, it is a matter of pure speculation whether anyone in the appellant’s jury accessed them. 
     
      
    156 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    157 Having rejected all grounds of appeal against conviction, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    158 There was little, if anything, in the appellant’s submissions in support of the application for leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    159 There was a minor error in the way Judge Sorby pronounced his sentence. His Honour said that he was sentencing the appellant to a non-parole period of five and a half years and a balance of the term of three years. However, as his Honour was sentencing the appellant for an offence committed before 1 February 2003, his Honour should have said that he was sentencing the appellant to a term of imprisonment of eight and a half years with a non-parole period of five and a half years, in accordance with the previous, and not the present, provisions of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, this technical error does not affect the validity of the sentence. 
     
      
    160 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 98 of the Crimes Act is imprisonment for 25 years. Because the offence was committed before 1 February 2003, the standard non-parole period set under Division 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is not applicable. 
     
      
    161 Judge Sorby in his remarks on sentence rightly regarded the offence as objectively serious. The robbery was obviously planned, it was committed in company, with weapons including a firearm, the victim was wounded and tied up and a threat was made to shoot the victim if the key did not open the safe. About a million dollars worth of diamonds was stolen and never recovered. 
     
      
    162 The offence was far worse than the typical case referred to by Spigelman CJ in para 162 of the guideline judgment of R v Henry [1999] 46 NSWLR 346, for which his Honour said that a sentence should generally fall between four and five years for the full term. 
     
      
    163 In his remarks on sentence Judge Sorby found, as he was clearly entitled to, that of the two offenders the appellant was the leader and should receive a higher sentence than that passed on Mariconte.  
     
      
    164 There was only a little information about the subjective circumstances of the appellant, who did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence. He was born in Turkey in 1962 and came to Australia in 1986. Judge Sorby found that the appellant had not shown any contrition. The appellant had a previous criminal history, including a previous conviction for armed robbery. 
     
      
    165 I conclude that the sentence passed by his Honour was well within a proper exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    166 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    167 HARRISON J: I agree with James J.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the inadequacy of a suspended sentence of ten months imposed by his Honour Judge Hughes in the District Court at Penrith on 9 March 2007 pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 2 On the hearing of the appeal on 30 May 2007 the Court decided that although it was satisfied that the Crown had demonstrated error, it resolved to dismiss the appeal in the exercise of its discretion. The following constitutes the reasons for that decision. The Sentence Proceedings in the District Court 3 On 20 November 2006 the respondent entered a plea of guilty in the District Court at Penrith to a single count of malicious wounding contrary to s 35 of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence was committed on 10 December 2005. The maximum penalty is 7 years imprisonment. The Crown accepted the plea of guilty in full satisfaction of an indictment that charged, as an alternative count, the more serious offence of malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes Act. That offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. The plea was accepted on the day of trial. 4 As at 10 December 2005 the respondent was the subject of a recognisance imposed pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  That sentence was passed at the Local Court at Penrith following his conviction for driving with a high range prescribed concentration of alcohol on 21 April 2005. He was also disqualified from driving for a period of two years and fined $2000 in addition to Court costs. Under the terms of the recognisance the respondent was bound by his own undertaking to be of good behaviour for a period of 18 months and to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. Accordingly, in committing the offence of malicious wounding (the subject of this appeal) he breached that undertaking. At the time of the offending he had been subject to the bond for a period of 8 months. The pre-sentence report notes that the respondent’s response to the order for supervision was considered satisfactory and his supervision was terminated in October 2005. He had no other relevant antecedents.5 The respondent was assessed in the pre-sentence report as eligible for a periodic detention order in accordance with the relevant statutory regime. The Court was also advised that that there were vacancies currently available at Silverwater Periodic Detention Centre.  
    6 On sentence the Crown submitted that a full time custodial penalty was warranted.The Facts 
     
      
    7 On the evening of 10 December 2005 the respondent went to the Royal Hotel at Springwood at around 8.30 pm to celebrate Colin Doaks’ birthday with a group of friends. The victim was at the hotel socialising with his friends, unconnected with the birthday celebrations. It would appear however, that the victim, Mr Doaks and the respondent went to the same high school although this was clearly many years earlier since at the time of the offending the respondent was 28 years of age. 8 During the course of the evening there was an altercation between the victim and Colin Doaks concerning an incident where it was suggested that the victim had been suspended from high school because of something Mr Doaks said or did. The argument escalated with Mr Doaks offering to “take it outside”. It is not clear whether Mr Doaks and the victim exchanged anything other than words but at one point the respondent involved himself by stepping between the two men and he then ultimately joined in the argument. He was at that time holding a glass of beer. Mr Blakely, one of the men the victim was socialising with, attempted to move the respondent away but he resisted. It was after this that the respondent struck the victim causing the beer glass he was holding to shatter on impact. 9 The respondent then left the hotel. The victim followed him and together with Mr Blakely the three went to the police station. En route the respondent said “Now I’m going to jail”. At the police station the respondent volunteered responsibility for causing the injury. He said “Look he did not do anything. I did it, he did nothing”. He confirmed this under caution a short time later. 10 The victim was admitted to Nepean Hospital Emergency Department and was treated for his injuries. He suffered multiple facial lacerations and bruising concentrated in the area of the left eye. The lacerations required suturing. He was hospitalised for a period of 4 days although this would seem to be for observation in circumstances where he presented with bleeding into the eye itself. The victim has permanent scarring but no residual impairment of vision. A victim impact statement was tendered in the proceedings.  11 On 21 December 2005 the respondent was interviewed by police and again confirmed his responsibility for the injury the victim suffered. He volunteered that he had consumed 15 middies of beer on the night in question, describing himself as moderately to well affected by alcohol. He also told police that during the incident he thought he saw the victim take a stance from which he believed he was going to be struck and that his response in striking first was “a reflex action”. He also said that he immediately apologised to the victim.The Finding of Lower End Objective Seriousness 12 On the basis of these facts the sentencing judge regarded the offence as falling within the lower end of a spectrum of objective seriousness. It would seem that this was based on an assessment of the respondent’s conduct which the Crown on sentence did not seek to challenge, namely that the respondent became involved in the altercation between Mr Oakes and the victim initially in an effort to stop the fight between them escalating. In the absence of any submission to the contrary from the Crown who appeared on sentence, we are also satisfied that it was open to the sentencing judge to accept the account the respondent gave to police on 21 December 2006 to the effect that the swing at the victim was a reflex response to a perceived threat and that the use of the glass was not intentional. 13 We are of the view that when assessing the objective seriousness of the offending his Honour did not underestimate the seriousness of the injury that the victim suffered and that he gave appropriate weight, in the balance, to the respondent’s conduct in causing the injury.  14 On the appeal the Crown conceded that the view his Honour took of the facts was open to him and, accordingly, that the finding of lower end objective seriousness was not in error in the particular circumstances of this case. 15 Notwithstanding this concession, the Crown maintained that the length of the sentence of imprisonment was manifestly inadequate for other reasons. The Crown also submitted that his Honour erred in his approach to the question of whether the sentence of imprisonment should be suspended pursuant to s 12 of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
      The Plea of Guilty  
      
    16 The sentencing judge allowed a two month reduction for the plea of guilty on a twelve month sentence of imprisonment. This translates to a 16 per cent discount. The Crown submits that no more than 10 per cent should have been allowed since the plea was entered on the date fixed for trial. If accepted, such a discount would have lengthened the sentence by only three weeks, not a result that could on its own attract this Court’s intervention on a Crown appeal.17 In making the allowance he did, his Honour referred to the plea as “not very early”. We consider that by this observation his Honour was quite obviously limiting himself to the utilitarian value inherent in the plea, having earlier in his remarks referred to the respondent’s contrition which he found to be genuine. The evidence disclosed that it was spontaneously expressed within minutes of the assault and was elaborated upon in a clinical interview with Ms Helen Carney, a clinical psychologist, when he said that it is the first thing he thinks about when he wakes and not a day goes by without him wishing the incident had not happened.18 It would appear that 20 November 2006 was the first occasion when the respondent was offered the opportunity to plead guilty to the less serious of the two counts in full satisfaction of the indictment. While that will not of itself entitle an offender to the full discount (see R v SY & Anor [2003] NSWCCA 291), on the assumption that the statement of facts tendered on the plea accurately reflected what occurred on the evening of 10 December 2005, the Crown case on the more serious charge was highly unlikely to have attracted a verdict of guilty had the matter gone to trial. Since the respondent admitted to police that he was responsible for the injury suffered by the victim, the only issue would have been one of specific intent upon which the Crown bore the onus. We were not informed of any reason why in these circumstances the plea was not offered earlier. While the discretion to reduce a sentence for the utilitarian value inherent in a plea of guilty is not at large, a discount of the stated amount was not outside the sentencing judge’s legitimate discretion. There is nothing to suggest that he failed to look at the situation realistically and to assess the utilitarian value of the plea in that light. Accordingly, there is nothing to suggest that in the circumstances the discount was so high as to admit of error. 
     
      
      Breach of the s 9 Recognisance in April 2005  
      
    19 Both at the District Court and on the appeal the Crown submitted that the breach of the bond imposed in April 2005 was significant for two reasons. First, it was an aggravating feature for sentencing purposes pursuant to s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, operating to deprive the respondent of the considerable leniency that is inherent in an order suspending a term of imprisonment (see R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [15]). Secondly, the offending in each case was in circumstances where the respondent was drinking to excess. By that he was shown to have a dependency on alcohol which was not being addressed. For these reasons, it was submitted by the Crown that the suspended sentence failed to address the need for specific deterrence.  20 While it is true that both offences were alcohol related we do not regard them as relevantly similar so as to attract a finding that the subsequent offending is a matter of severe aggravation as that expression was used in Chaplin v The Queen (2006) 160 A Crim R 85 at 91.21 At the sentence proceedings the Crown sought to persuade his Honour that the respondent was in fact alcohol dependent and that this condition was the base cause of his drink driving and the related breach of his undertaking by the malicious wounding. It was implicit in this submission, a submission which was maintained on appeal, that to extend to the respondent the leniency of a suspended sentence was to send the respondent the wrong message and that it would fail entirely to encourage him to address his drinking habits. 22 In addition to the pre-sentence report which dealt with the issue of alcohol, the sentencing judge had available to him the report from a Clinical Psychologist and a letter from the respondent’s mother each of which gave, from different perspectives, some insights into the respondent’s drinking habits and his attitude to them. It was on the basis of this evidence that the sentencing judge rejected the submission that the respondent was either alcohol dependent or that he had a propensity for violent or unrestrained behaviour when under its influence.23 Ms Carney reported that while the respondent was a regular drinker - 4 or 5 glasses of beer on most occasions - he drinks mainly at home or with friends when fishing or camping and that he does not regard his drinking as problematic in the sense that it impacts adversely on his health or his work. Ms Carney regarded the respondent’s conduct at the Springwood Hotel in December 2005 when stepping between two men fighting, as influenced by the alcohol he had consumed in that it would have given him the courage to act in circumstances where he usually does not act precipitously or openly expresses his feelings. She offered this opinion in the context of a clinical interview and psychological testing which revealed the respondent was suffering from underlying despair and insecurity, likely linked to the death of his father and two brothers (one to suicide), and the impact that this has had on his family life. In Ms Carney’s view he suffered from depression and his drinking was likely to be an attempt at self-medication. She was of the view that if he was not in denial about these aspects of his emotional life, he was largely unaware of them. 24 His mother confirmed that the respondent did not drink in hotels and, in addition, that she had never seen her son violent when under the influence of alcohol in her home or her presence. She corroborated the emotional pressures to which the respondent had been subject as a young man and the impact on him of his father’s and brothers’ deaths as the youngest of seven children.25 While opinions might differ as to the weight of this evidence in sentence proceedings where a serious injury was a direct consequence of excessive drinking, the respondent’s attitude to drinking and drinking patterns were put in issue in the proceedings by the Crown and, however indulgent his Honour’s views might be as to the amount and regularity of the respondent’s alcohol consumption, the findings he made were open to him on the evidence.  
     
      
    26 The relevant principles to be applied where issues of intoxication arise in sentence proceedings were stated by Hunt J in Coleman v R (1990) 47 A Crim R 306 at 327 (Finlay and Allen JJ agreeing):  
     
      
       
        
        “The degree of deliberation shown by an offender is usually a matter to be taken into account; (such) intoxication would therefore be relevant in determining the degree of deliberation involved in the offender’s breach of the law. In some circumstances, it may aggravate the crime because of the recklessness with which the offender became intoxicated; in other circumstances, it may mitigate the crime because the offender has by reason of that intoxication acted out of character.” 
        
       
      
    27 It would appear that the sentencing judge was satisfied on the basis of the evidence before him that it was both the fact and the degree of intoxication that caused the respondent to act out of character. Even if it was not perhaps uncharacteristic for this offender to be subject to the influence of alcohol given the regularity with which he consumes it, his Honour was entitled to the view that the respondent’s overreaction or reflex action to the perceived threat was induced by the alcohol he had consumed and, whilst the intoxication might not of itself be used as a mitigating factor, neither was it an aggravating factor in the relevant sense. 
     
      
    The Length of the Sentence 28 We are not persuaded that a term of imprisonment for ten months was the result of an error in the assessment of the competing considerations of objective seriousness or subjective considerations, or that matters of aggravation were not given their proper weighting such as to manifest error.  
     
      
    29 In R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85, Spigelman CJ said,  
     
      
       
        
        “Questions of weight in the exercise of discretion are matters for the first instance judge. The circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined.” 
        
       
      
    The Decision to Suspend the Sentence 30 The Crown submits that his Honour’s approach to imposition of the suspended sentence was vitiated by error of such a kind that a more lenient sentence was imposed than was warranted. It is submitted that this Court should intervene and impose a more severe sentence. In appropriate acknowledgement that this is a Crown appeal, we do not understand the Crown to submit that we should sentence the respondent to serve any sentence in full time custody. Rather, it is submitted that an order for periodic detention should be made.31 In R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 Howie J, with whom Hodgson JA and Levine J agreed, stipulated the steps to be taken by a Court when sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment and then determining to suspend its execution pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. First, the Court is to determine whether a full-time custodial sentence is called for in accordance with s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Next, the Court must determine the length of any such sentence without regard to how the sentence will be served and only then to determine how the sentence should be served having regard to the statutory alternatives to full time custody and their availability. As Howie J made explicit in Zamagias:  
     
      
       
        
        “…the appropriateness of an alternative to full-time custody will depend upon a number of factors, one of importance being whether such an alternative would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purposes of punishment”.  
        
       
      
    32 While a failure to expressly articulate the taking of these steps would not necessarily compel the conclusion that there was a failure to properly carry out the sentencing exercise, the process of reasoning should reveal an appreciation of the gradated alternatives to full time custody and why a suspended sentence, as the most lenient option, is the appropriate order in the particular circumstances of the case. In the absence of reasoning of this kind the sentencing exercise is susceptible to challenge and may, as in this case, give rise to a Crown appeal. 33 The sentencing judge appears to have determined that a suspended sentence was the resolution of the sentencing process without making reference to the prescribed steps at all and without making patent his reasoning to that conclusion. Importantly, he has failed altogether to expressly consider whether an order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention might be a more appropriate penalty or, in the alternative, why it was not.  
     
      
      Error and the Residual Discretion 
      
    34 While we agree that his Honour’s approach to considering the alternatives to full time custody was contrary to law, we are not persuaded that a suspended sentence was outside the range of his sentencing discretion if the discretion was properly exercised (R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 per Wood CJ at CL [70]). This is so, particularly having regard to the finding of low objective criminality, the strong subjective case mounted on the respondent’s behalf and the fact that the sentencing judge was of the firm view that the likelihood of re-offending was low. Accordingly, whilst specific error has been established, we exercise our discretion not to intervene. 
     
      
    35 It was for the foregoing reasons that the Court dismissed the Crown’s appeal.

     Robyn Gay Arnold v REGINA    Judgment1 CAMPBELL JA: I agree with Smart AJ2 HIDDEN J: I agree with Smart AJ3 SMART AJ: Robyn Gay Arnold, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal against sentences of imprisonment imposed for three offences of break and enter a building and commit a serious indictable offence. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 14 years imprisonment. On the first of the three offences  three other offences are to be taken into account, namely, goods in custody, (having possession of a credit card in the name of another In June 2004), using a false instrument (which involved altering a money order and cashing it in October 2003) and obtaining money by deception in October 2003.4 The applicant received an overall sentence of five years consisting of three years non-parole period with an additional term (or balance of term) of two years. On the first count of break, enter etc, taking into account the offences on Form 1 the applicant was sentenced to three years imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years commencing on 1 September 2005 and expiring on 31 August 2007 and a balance of the term of one year expiring on 31 August 2008. On the second count of break, enter etc the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of two years to commence on 1 September 2005 and to expire on 31 August 2007. On the third count of break, enter etc the applicant was sentenced to three years imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of one year commencing on 1 September 2007 and expiring on 31 August 2008 being the earliest date on which she was eligible for parole, and a balance of term of two years expiring on 31 August 2010.5 The first offence of break, enter etc was committed on 5 June 2004 when the applicant, after knocking on the front door of a unit in Bondi entered the unit. The door was locked. The occupant in the unit thought it was his sister as she often knocked to be let in before finding her keys. He then heard the sound of keys jingling. The applicant walked into the kitchen and then into the sister’s bedroom. The occupant called out his sister’s name. He next heard the sound of footsteps running out of the unit. His sister’s bag had been gone through and two $50 notes removed. About $29 cash and a credit card had been taken from his wallet. His mobile phone was also missing. The stolen items were recovered from the applicant’s handbag.6 A little later on the same day the second offence occurred. The occupant of another unit in Bondi arrived home. On opening his front door he saw the applicant inside his unit coming from the direction of the lounge room. She attempted to rush past him but he held her. A struggle ensued as she tried to escape. A neighbour came to the occupant’s assistance. The applicant had taken $50 cash, some coins, some foreign currency and a digital camera. The stolen items were recovered from the applicant’s handbag.7 These offences were committed while the applicant was on a two-year good behaviour bond (s 9 of the Sentencing (Criminal Procedure) Act 1999) which had been imposed in March 2003 after she was  convicted of stealing.8 The applicant was taken back to Waverley Police Station where she gave the police some far-fetched explanations. She was charged on 5 June 2004 and granted bail. She was committed for sentence in February 2005.9 The third offence was committed on 1 September 2005 at a unit in Kingsford. The occupant, upon returning to his unit and unlocking and opening the door, discovered the offender inside the unit trying to open the door to leave. A struggle ensued as she vigorously attempted to escape. With assistance, the occupant restrained her and the police were called. An ipod worth $450 belonging to the occupant was stolen, found in the applicant’s handbag and recovered.10 This offence was committed while the applicant was on bail for the two offences of 5 June 2004. The applicant was taken into custody on 1 September 2005 and has been in prison ever since.11 The applicant was born on 23 November 1969. She has an extensive criminal history which stretches back to 1982 when she appeared before the Children’s Court, aged 12. There were gaps from 1984 to 1989 and 1995-1998. Since 1992 she has spent periods in prison, albeit less than 12 months. There have been drug and dishonesty offences. She has been the subject of bonds and community service orders.12 The Psychological Pre-Sentence Report of 31 January 2006 prepared by psychologists at Emu Plains Correctional Centre states: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Ms Arnold’s history of illicit drug use appears to be the most influential factor in her offending behaviour. She reports her current and past offences as having occurred whilst affected by, or to finance further drug use. Ms Arnold identified a resumption of drug use as a major risk factor in regard to her risk of recidivism. She expressed a desire to maintain abstinence. Although her history would indicate she lacks the skills required to maintain abstinence for any significant period. 
          
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Ms Arnold would benefit from access (to) either community or gaol based psychological and alcohol and other drug services to address the following issues: grief and depressed mood; experiences in childhood; self esteem; emotion regulation and impulsivity; and to maintain abstinence from illicit drugs.” 
         
        
       
      
    13 There is material suggesting that the applicant had a deprived and unsatisfactory childhood.14 The Pre-Sentence Report of 4 November 2005 reveals that the applicant has been known to the Probation and Parole Service since 1992. It contains details of her unsatisfactory childhood. She was raised primarily by her grandmother who died when she was twelve. This distressed the applicant. Her first offence occurred about this time. She left school midway through Year 8 and has had limited employment since that time, her last position being in 1998 when she worked as a stable hand for a brief period. She told the Probation and Parole Officer that she is interested in working with animals. The report records that the applicant has a history of polydrug use from the age of fourteen and that she has been on the methadone program since 1990, but at one stage she had a two year break. Her use of cocaine escalated following the death of her father in 2004. On the day of the offences of 5 June 2004 she had travelled to Bondi to buy cocaine. She stated that the offences were committed to finance her drug habit.15 As at November 2005 Ms Arnold had been in her current relationship for the past six years and her partner had been offered a two bedroom home by the Department of Housing. She was looking forward to the prospect of finally having a proper home after years of poor accommodation. Her partner appeared supportive of her, but he also has a history of substance abuse. The officer regarded the impending relocation as a very positive step for the applicant.16 Ms Arnold was assessed as unsuitable for a Community Service Order and ineligible for periodic detention.17 At the sentencing hearing she attributed her return to drugs and taking cocaine to her father’s death. She said that she had had the cocaine addiction for 12 months. She verified that she had told the psychologist and the Probation and Parole Officer the truth.18 The applicant said that she and her partner were engaged and that he had invited her to live with him at the Department of Housing home in Granville which he had obtained. She confirmed that this was her first stable accommodation. Her partner was in Court. She proposed to go and live with him upon her release. It was the applicant’s evidence that while he had a drug problem in the past, he no longer uses drugs and that he wished to support her in any attempt to stop her using drugs. Despite sporadic contact in the past the applicant’s mother gave evidence that she was prepared to support her daughter on her release. The mother could not explain what triggered off her daughter taking (or resuming) drugs and committing criminal offences.19 It is apparent from the judge’s reasons that she gave careful consideration to all the materials before her and weight to the applicant’s evidence.20 The judge recorded that there was no dispute that the applicant should have the benefit of the maximum discount from her sentence by reason of the plea. The judge accepted that the applicant’s health was poor. She held that the applicant will need considerable support and resources if she is to become free of drugs and that whether she would be successful was doubtful.21 The judge stated, correctly, that the offences were very serious crimes; they were committed in private homes and it could easily be expected that the occupiers of the homes would be in. The judge thought that the crimes were opportunistic and that any planning was minimal. She noted, correctly, that the offences were aggravated by having been committed either while on a bond or on bail.22 The judge found special circumstances, holding that that would enable the applicant to be supported and supervised by the Probation and Parole Service on her release to assist with her rehabilitation.23 The judge considered questions of concurrency, accumulation and totality and imposed the sentences earlier narrated.24 The applicant has submitted that at page 3 of her judgment the judge stated that the applicant has many convictions for break, enter and steal and that this was incorrect as the last charges for break, enter and steal were fourteen years ago dating back to 1992. She added that while she understood that her record was blemished by her previous convictions her last custodial sentence served was between 1999 and 2000.25 At pp 2-3 of the judgment it was stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “She has an extensive criminal history commencing when she was about thirteen with a conviction in the Children’s Court for break, enter and steal. Thereafter she has many convictions for break, enter and steal, possession of stolen property, making and using false instruments. She has been in prison before.” 
         
        
       
      
    26 The record discloses that between 1982 and 1992 the applicant had seven offences of break, enter and steal and one of attempted break, enter and steal. I accept that from 1993 to January 2004 there are no recorded offences of break, enter and steal. There were an appreciable number of dishonesty offences. The point being made by the judge was that the applicant had an extensive criminal history. That was correct. The applicant’s history did not assist her.27 The criminal history shows that the applicant was in custody in 1999-2000 and 2000-2001.28 This submission of the applicant is not of consequence. A relevant error has not been made.29 The applicant has submitted that the judge stated that a lesser sentence was offered for a plea of guilty and that this was incorrect. The applicant further submitted: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “My defense lawyer approached the DPP advising that a plea of not guilty would be submitted for aggravation and charges be dropped, as no such account took place.” 
         
        
       
      
    30 The applicant pointed out that as soon as she became aware that there was a person in the unit (the first offence of 5 June 2004) she ran out immediately.31 The applicant has misunderstood the thrust of what the judge was saying. The judge was merely explaining the delay. The important point is that the judge proceeded on the charges to which the applicant pleaded guilty and gave her the full discount for an early plea of guilty. No relevant error occurred.32 A principal ground on which the applicant relied was her medical condition, the delays in her treatment and her lack of substantial improvement. Allied with this was the lack of time able to be devoted by gaol psychologists to the intensive counselling, she needed to overcome her drug addiction. She also relied on her good behaviour while in gaol and the work she had done. In support she relied on her affidavit of 24 April 2007. some documentary material, and some brief oral evidence. The Crown did not object to the applicant relying on this material taking the view that there was “fresh material as to the applicant’s medical condition and the Court should be apprised of it.” The Crown took a generous approach to the further evidence. This was appropriate. The applicant placed before the Court additional material mainly going to medical matters but also to her period in gaol and her performance.33 The applicant, who appeared in person directed our attention to the matters in support of her application, stated in her affidavit of 24 April 2007 that she was seeking to appeal “on compassionate reasons”. In her affidavit she states in her handwriting: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “… after I was sentenced I have had a lot of test at Nepean Hostpital and have since found I have type 3 Cirrhosis of the liver. I have to have a Hep C Treatment on 12 months couse, if that does not work which it may not, I will need a liver transplant, and I would get better treatment from outside health care. Justice Health is not the best in the gaol system. I have been doing Drug & Alcohole, and seeing the Psyc, not as much as I would like to or need to as they are limited, the gaol is at overflow at the moment ”  
          
         
        
       
      
    34 The applicant has detailed the enquiries she has made to obtain treatment for her drug condition if released. She also details the extensive work she is doing outside the prison in the community. She also refers to being in the minimum security part of the gaol. She reiterates that she could obtain better health care outside the prison. She also states that she could obtain better rehabilitation assistance outside the gaol because of a shortage of manpower in the gaol. She concludes by asserting that she will not go back to drugs as she wants to get better.35 At the sentencing hearing the applicant gave evidence that she had been diagnosed with Hepatitis C, that while she had been in custody on remand she had had a liver biopsy and had to go on a drug called Interferon for 12 months which has severe side effects, the treatment being intense. She was also having medical investigations as to come lumps in her thyroid , in her neck. Her gland was swollen. A biopsy had to be done for that condition. She said that she lost a lot of weight. That loss had been arrested because of the medication prescribed for her. The judge, in her remarks described the applicant’s health as poor.36 In her oral evidence the applicant said that, in addition, she had been on treatment for multinodular goitre for lumps in her thyroid. On the previous day (7 May 2007) the clinic had informed her that the treatment was not working and that she would have to be seen by a visiting specialist. She did not know when this would occur and what the future would be. She knew that she would have to have further tests for possible cancer. She was concerned that the condition had been detected in 2005 and that two years later the position had not been resolved.37 In cross-examination the applicant readily agreed, a biopsy of her liver had been done while she was detained in custody and it had been confirmed that she has cirrhosis of the liver. She agreed that since she had been in custody further steps had been taken to try and work out what was the problem with her thyroid function. The applicant said that she had had about five trips to Nepean Hospital for tests. More than five trips for tests had been cancelled. The applicant was worried about the time being taken to resolve her medical problems.38 The applicant said that at the moment she was doing well. She needed to go to a place where she could receive counselling five days per week. The gaol psychologist had told her of a service in response to her query if there was somewhere she could go to receive such intense counselling.39 Justice Health, due to the requirements of confidentiality, takes the view that it was not able to deal with the applicant’s case specifically. Justice Health in its letter of 2 May 2007 stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “This letter is to inform you of hepatitis care and treatment services that are provided within the NSW custodial environment by Justice Health. This includes management of patients with cirrhosis and hepatitis C. 
          
         
        
        
         
          
          Justice Health provides clinical care for patients with hepatitis within NSW custodial facilities at all stages of liver disease. Clinical care for patients with hepatitis is provided by qualified Public Sexual Health Nurses who have been trained in all aspects of assessment, monitoring and treatment of the condition. A number of visiting physicians specialising in the treatment of liver disease also hold regular clinics within NSW custodial facilities. 
          
         
         
          
          Patients who require hepatitis care and treatment can have this undertaken within all Justice Health facilities overseen by qualified medical specialists and nursing staff. Further more, there is a medical facility within Justice Health available to patients who are at advanced or critical stages of their illness. Should the need arise, referrals to external health services are made and coordinated and managed by Justice Health.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    40 The Crown, after indicating its preference for medical evidence as to the applicant’s future health, submitted that the applicant’s health problems were not so debilitating that she was not able to function. She is to be commended for the work she has been doing by way of assisting disabled children. The applicant conveyed that she became tired by the end of the day. The Crown submitted that much of the material submitted to the Court was available prior to sentence, that the potential problems were known, treatment prescribed, that the applicant has been given ongoing medical treatment and that it did not appear that any of the applicant’s medical conditions had been overlooked.41 The applicant’s worry was that her medical treatment was too protracted and taking too long. She was also concerned about the psychologist not being able to devote sufficient time to her treatment.42 The Court has pointed out that it is the responsibility of Corrective Services to ensure that inmates receive adequate health care. It has recognized that there may be exceptional cases where the health care required is beyond that which the Department can provide. For example, care for unusual conditions may only be available at one or a limited number of hospitals. Deployment of a large number of security officers may be required.43 In the present case there is no medical or expert evidence that the care provided is inadequate. This is not a case where it is necessary to go generally into the provision of health services in gaols. It is not sufficient that the applicant believes she would obtain better treatment outside the gaol.44 What I have written earlier in these reasons deals with the major matters canvassed in the applicant’s written and oral submissions. The following grounds of appeal appear from the Court’s papers: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Her Honour refers to preceding offences on page 3 of the transcripts. She stated – there were multiple convictions for break enter and steal matters. The only preceding offences were back in 1992, which were 14 years ago. 
        
       
       
        
        2. In relation to early pleas which were entered in the Local Court, her Honour affirmed that a lesser sentence was offered by the DPP if a guilty charge was accepted. I wish to disagree as my defense team was seeking for charges of aggravation be dropped, as no aggravation took place. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Her Honour stated that special circumstances were taken into account for remorsefulness and non premeditation. I fail to understand where Her Honour had implemented that in her sentencing. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Her Honour also acknowledged that a discount for early plea should apply. I believe it was not taken into consideration when sentencing. There has been no reprieve given in amount of time to serve or non parole period.” 
        
       
      
    45 What has been earlier written disposes of Grounds 1 and 2.46 As to Ground 3 the judge did taker special circumstances into account as she stated. She did so by reducing the length of the non-parole periods overall to 3 years and increasing the parole period (or balance of term) to 2 years. In the absence of special circumstances the non-parole periods (that is the minimum time that must be spent in prison) would have totalled 3 years 9 months.47 As to Ground 4, the judge would have imposed longer sentences in total if she had not granted the applicant the full discount for an early plea of guilty. The applicant is reminded that the maximum penalty for breaking and entering a building and committing a serious indictable offence is 14 years. The applicant’s challenges both in her submissions and grounds of appeal to the judge’s remarks on sentence fail.48 Unfortunately, the applicant committed serious crimes meriting the gaol sentences she has received. The judge has made no relevant error. While it seems that the applicant has made good progress in gaol and that has to be commended, this Court cannot and should not intervene.49 The application for leave to appeal should be refused.50 I propose the following order: 
     
      
       
        
        Leave to appeal from the sentences imposed on 24 February 2006 refused.

                29 June 2007

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 HISLOP J: The respondent pleaded guilty to two offences of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for such an offence is twenty years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period for this offence. 
     
      
    2 On 16 February 2007 the respondent was sentenced for those offences in the District Court to a total period of two years imprisonment to commence on 16 February 2007 and to expire on 15 February 2009. His sentence was suspended pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 12.  
     
      
    3 In sentencing the respondent his Honour, the sentencing judge, took into consideration that the respondent had been in custody following his arrest on 14 April 2006 to the date of sentence. 4 The appellant has appealed against sentence on the ground that it is manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    5 His Honour found the facts of the offences were: In the early hours of the morning of Thursday 16 March 2006 [the respondent] entered a day/night convenience store in Brighton holding a pair of black handled metal blade scissors and held up a twenty-six year old sales assistant who was stocking the shelves. He punched the victim in the stomach and threatened him, “take out all your money or I’ll kill you”. He removed approximately $250 from the cash drawer, punched the victim in the stomach with a closed fist and demanded that he not call the police or “I’ll kill you”. Ten minutes later on the same morning he entered a 7-Eleven convenience store at Sans Souci, again armed with the same bladed scissors. He held up a twenty-four year old console operator who was seated behind the counter. He pressed the bladed scissors against the kidney area of this victim while pulling him off the chair by the collar of his shirt and demanded that he open the till. He stole approximately $500, holding the blade of the scissors at the victim’s neck. Again he demanded that he not call the police or “I’ll kill you”. 
     
      
    6 The respondent is a single man born on 16 May 1984. At the time of the offences he had a substantial drug problem. He had a previous conviction for steal from person in respect of which he had been placed on a twelve month bond which was in force at the time of the subject offences.  
     
      
    7 The sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The two offences are very serious. This can be gauged from the maximum period of imprisonment which such an offence attracts.  
        I take into consideration that the offence involved some violence and some threatened violence 
         in addition to having a weapon (t 
        his is part of the offence itself 
        , 
         so I do not take that into consideration 
        ) 
         but I do take account of the fact that there was some actual violence 
         and some threatened violence.  
        I take into consideration also that this offence was committed while  
        [ 
        the respondent 
        ] 
         w 
        as on conditional liberty.” 
        
       
      
    8 His Honour did not refer in his remarks on sentence to the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 in which this court identified a category of armed robbery case under s 97 of the Crimes Act which was sufficiently common for the purpose of determining a guideline judgment. The guideline judgment was four to five years imprisonment for offences of this type. The characteristics of the present case were similar to those in the guideline judgment. His Honour did not impose individual sentences in respect of each offence. 
     
      
    9 His Honour had in evidence before him affidavits of the respondent’s mother, elder brother and a neighbour. These affirmed the respondent had been a good son and neighbour, honest, kind and helpful, until he had become involved in drugs. As a consequence of that involvement he ceased working and lived by night and slept by day. The family had sent him back to Lebanon and hoped that a period of time in the army would “knock some sense” into the respondent. For some months following his return to Australia it appeared that he had overcome his problems but he then relapsed and ultimately was arrested following the subject offences. As previously mentioned, he was imprisoned from the date of arrest to the date of sentence. Initially during his imprisonment he “continued to want drugs” but as time progressed he “returned to normal” and wanted to do the right thing. His Honour was greatly impressed by this evidence particularly that of the neighbour.10 His Honour was also assisted by Probation and Parole reports which concluded the respondent was suitable for medium level intervention by the Service “commensurate with the assessed risk” and reports from the treating psychiatrist, Dr Roberts, who had set out a treatment regime. 
     
      
    11 His Honour said in respect of mitigating factors: 
     
      
       
        
        “In mitigation it seems to me that I do not have any evidence that the offence caused injury or lasting substantial emotional harm. It was not a planned or organised criminal activity since  
        [the respondent]  
        was at all times under surveillance. It was an act of desperation it seemed to me but an affront to peaceful living in our community.  
        I note that [the respondent] does not have any significant record of previous offences. There is only one other offence on his record, and until that time, on the evidence of his mother, his brother and the elderly gentleman in his vicinity, he was a person of good character. I find that he is unlikely to re-offend, that there are very good prospects of rehabilitation which spring mainly from the very generous support offered to him by his family and that he has shown remorse from these offences. I take into consideration also his plea of guilty. I consider that this was at the earliest available opportunity and should attract a full deduction of 25 per cent.” 
        
       
      
    12 His Honour then concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “These are offences which can only be dealt with by a full time custodial sentence, there is no other alternative sentence available. Section 3A of the Sentencing Procedure Act advises me as to what considerations I should bring to bear in sentencing. Of course, there should be serious consideration given to general deterrence but in the light of this man’s youthfulness and the support he has from his family and also what the family has said about the conversion which has taken place in gaol it seems to me that he has very good prospects of rehabilitation. I want to enhance those as much as possible.” 
        
       
      
    13 At the conclusion of his remarks on sentence his Honour said to the respondent: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Naji, your family has persuaded me, you haven’t but your family has persuaded me to treat you in the way I have with an opportunity to change your life. Now it’s up to you. No one can make you good but yourself. You’ve made mistakes. We can’t be punished all our life if we want to change our life. You’ve got the opportunity but if you don’t take it you’ll be in gaol as a criminal.” 
        
       
      
    14 The appellant submitted that his Honour had erred in failing to have regard to the guideline judgment in R v Henry and erred in not giving reasons for not doing so - see R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. It was submitted that the facts of these offences were similar to those in R v Henry save that the offences occurred whilst the respondent was on conditional liberty, the first offence involved actual violence and that there had been an early plea of guilty as distinct from the late plea in R v Henry. 
     
      
    15 It was submitted that the guideline principles in R v Henry should only be ignored in the event that there were exceptional circumstances which justified the departure from the imposition of a full time custodial sentence. There were no such exceptional circumstances present in this case. The sentence should have reflected the guideline judgment.16 Additionally, the offences occurred at different times, at different places and involved different victims. His Honour had failed to sentence the respondent for each individual offence contrary to the requirements in R v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 and had taken an incorrect approach in determining that a suspended sentence was appropriate - see Regina v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. The objective seriousness of the offences and the need for general deterrence required that a full time custodial sentence be imposed. 17 There is substance in each of the submissions made by the appellant.  
     
      
    18 Learned counsel for the respondent did not dispute that error had occurred during the sentencing process and that the respondent was afforded undue leniency in the sentence.  
     
      
    19 He submitted, however, that as the sentencing judge had concluded that the respondent was at the crossroads and had taken a chance on him which so far - see the affidavit of Carl Naji sworn 29 June 2007 - was justified this court should “stay its hand”. 
     
      
    20 However, in my opinion the serious nature of the offences, the fact that actual violence was involved in the first offence, and that the offences occurred whilst the respondent was on conditional liberty mandate a term of imprisonment. However, I would take into account a discount for the plea of guilty and find special circumstances by reason of the matters to which his Honour had regard. I would also have regard to the constraints which apply to crown appeals - see R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at para 70. 
     
      
    21 The respondent is entitled to credit for the period in custody between 14 April 2006 and 16 February 2007. He is also entitled to some credit by reason of the fact he has been serving a suspended sentence since 16 February 2007 although this cannot be treated as equal to a custodial sentence. In the circumstances I propose that the sentence be backdated to 29 June 2006. 
     
      
    22 I would not distinguish in the sentences between the two offences notwithstanding that actual violence was occasioned in the first offence. As the offences occurred within ten minutes of each other and this is a crown appeal I would make the sentences concurrent.  
     
      
    23 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Allow the appeal. 
         
         
        2. Quash the sentences. 
         
         
        3. As to the first offence, sentence the respondent to imprisonment for a non-parole period of two years to commence on 29 June 2006 and expire on 28 June 2008 and a balance of term of two years to commence on 29 June 2008 and expire on 28 June 2010. 
         
         
        4. As to the second offence, sentence the respondent to imprisonment for a non-parole period of two years to commence on 29 June 2006 and expire on 28 June 2008 and a balance of term of two years to commence on 29 June 2008 and expire on 28 June 2010. The earliest date on which the respondent will be eligible for release to parole is 28 June 2008.

     Judgment 
      
      
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: The applicant Nathan John Pattison seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him at the District Court at Penrith on 8 May 2006. 
     
      
    4 On 20 September 2004 the applicant had pleaded guilty in the District Court to an indictment containing two counts. The first count is one of break and enter a dwelling house at Cranebrook on 13 February 2002 and commit a serious indictable offence, namely larceny, contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. An offence contrary to s 112(1) is punishable by imprisonment for 14 years. 
     
      
    5 The second count is one of receiving stolen property between 18 December 2001 and 10 October 2002 contrary to s 188(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. An offence contrary to s 188(1) is punishable by imprisonment for 10 years. Two matters of receiving contrary to s 188(1) and two matters of larceny contrary to s 154A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act on a Form 1 were taken into account on sentence on count two.  
     
      
    6 The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to charges, which were referred to by the sentencing Judge as charges numbered 7 to 12. The applicant adhered to those pleas before his Honour.  
     
      
    7 Charge number 7 is one of receiving stolen property between 23 December 2004 and 24 December 2004 contrary to s 188(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    8 Charge number 8 is one of using a false instrument between 21 December and 23 December 2004 being a New South Wales driver licence in the name of Paul Ridgeway with the intent of inducing another person to accept the instrument as genuine. The offence being contrary to s 300(2) of the Crimes Act is punishable by 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    9 Charge 9 is one of dishonestly obtaining a valuable thing on 21 December 2004 being a $40,000 Toyota Hilux by deception, namely signing a lease agreement under a false name, contrary to s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act. The offence is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years. For this charge, an indictment was presented before the sentencing Judge as the charge to which the applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court had not been properly framed. 
     
      
    10 Charge 10 is one of driving a conveyance, namely the Toyota Hilux, between 21 December and 23 December 2004 without the consent of the person in lawful possession of it. The offence being contrary to s 154A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years. 
     
      
    11 Charge 11 is one of break and enter a storage shed at Cattai between 12 December 2004 and 23 December 2004 and steal property contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    12 Charge 12 is one of larceny between the same dates as charge 11 at Cattai. The offence being contrary to s 117 of the Crimes Act is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years.  
     
      
    13 The following sentences were imposed by the sentencing Judge: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: A fixed term of 2 years imprisonment to date from 17 November 2004 and to expire on 16 November 2006. 
       
       
      Count 2: Taking into account the matters on the Form 1, a fixed term of 2 years imprisonment to date from 17 May 2005 and expire on 16 May 2007. 
       
       
      Charge 7: A fixed term of 2 years imprisonment to date from 17 November 2006 and expire on 16 November 2008. 
       
       
      Charges 8, 9 and 10: On each charge a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment to date from 17 November 2006 and expire on 16 May 2007. 
       
       
      Charge 11: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 17 November 2008 and to expire on 16 November 2011 with a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 17 November 2011 and to expire on 16 November 2014. 
       
       
      Charge 12: A fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months to date from 17 November 2008 and to expire on 16 November 2009. 
       
      
    Total effective sentence:  
     
      
    14 As a result of total and partial accumulation, the total effective sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge was a non-parole period of 7 years to date from 17 November 2004 and to expire on 16 November 2011 with a balance of term of 3 years to date from 17 November 2011 and to expire on 16 November 2014.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    15 Documents containing statements of facts for each of the offences were tendered without objection. What follows is drawn largely from those documents: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: On 13 February 2002 the applicant broke into and entered a dwelling house at Cranebrook owned by Phillip and Felice Pollicina. He stole from the house a number of firearms, a telescopic sight, a green army camouflage case, a quantity of ammunition, jewellery, a VCR, sunglasses, binoculars, a mobile phone and other items. The stolen items of jewellery included a gents diamond ring valued at $25,260.00. Mr Pollicina estimated the value of the stolen property to be over $50,000.00.  
       
       
      Count 2: Between 18 December 2001 and 10 October 2002, the applicant received a green coloured deed box containing British passports, banking documents, keys and jewellery the property of Doctor Roger Baxendale stolen during a break and enter at his home at 9 The Grove Austinmer on 18 December 2001. 
       
       
      Offence 1 Form 1: Between 18 December 2001 and 10 October 2002, the applicant received a nurses name plate, car keys, jewellery and a Ryobi Blower-vac the property of Cathy Negus stolen during a break and enter at her home at 7 The Grove Austinmer on 18 December 2001. 
       
       
      Offence 2 Form 1: Between 2 September 2000 and 10 October 2002, the applicant received medical prescription pads the property of Dr Roger Baxendale which were stolen from his home at 9 The Grove Austinmer during a break and enter offence on 2 September 2000. 
       
       
      Offence 3 Form 1: Between 2 September 2000 and 4 September 2000 the applicant took and drove a Mitsubishi Magna motor vehicle, registration number QSD 490, without the consent of the owner, Dr Roger Baxendale.  
       
       
      Offence 4 Form 1: On 13 February 2002 the applicant had allowed himself to be carried in a Mercedes Benz convertible knowing the vehicle had been taken without the consent of the owner, Phillip Pollicina. The Mercedes Benz had been in the garage of the Pollicina’s house at Cranebrook. Mr Pollicina valued the vehicle at over $150,000.00. 
       
       
      Charge 7: The applicant received between 2am on 23 December 2004 and 10.05am on 24 December 2004 at McGraths Hill a large number of items of portable property belonging to Ms Robinson and Mr Conti which was stolen from their home during a break and enter offence on the night of 22 December 2004. The property received by the applicant included a laptop computer, digital cameras and mobile telephones of a value of $8,900.00.  
       
       
      Charges 8, 9 and 10: On 21 December 2004 the applicant used a driver licence in the name of Paul Anthony Ridgeway to hire a Toyota Hilux. After completing a lease agreement for the vehicle and paying a deposit, he did not return the vehicle by the agreed time. On the following day, the applicant returned the vehicle and asked if he could extend the lease for another day. When this was refused, he drove the vehicle away. Police subsequently located the vehicle and the applicant was arrested. 
       
       
      Charge 11: Between 6pm on 22 December 2004 and 7am on 23 December 2004 the applicant committed the offence of break enter and steal from a storage/tool shed on a property near Cattai. The storage/tool shed was divided into two sections by a sheet of steel mesh. There were two doors on the same side of the container, each door gaining access to each section. One end of the container had power tools in it valued at $4,500.00. The other had various items of little value. The door on the left was not locked whereas the door on the right was padlocked shut. The right section contained the power tools. Bolt cutters were used to cut through the steel mesh and the power tools were stolen by the applicant. 
       
       
      Charge 12: On 22 December 2004 the applicant whilst on the same property near Cattai stole a large black coloured Bawer brand heavy vehicle tool box of the value of $500.00 from a large open carport type shed.  
      
     Subjective Circumstances 
     
      
    16 The applicant and Lisa Maree Phipps gave evidence during the proceedings on sentence. Two probation and parole reports were tendered. 
     
      
    17 The applicant was born on 13 May 1975 and at the time of sentence was nearly 31 years old. He told the sentencing Judge that he was raised primarily by his mother and stepfather. He left school in year 7, aged fourteen being always far behind other students because of ADD and dyslexia. He worked as an apprentice floor and wall tiler, then as an apprentice fitter and machinist but could not complete these apprenticeships because of his inability to do the mathematics. His Honour noted that since last in gaol, the applicant worked at a land-scaping business for a year and a half.  
     
      
    18 The sentencing Judge observed that the applicant had a significant drug problem commencing with marijuana at age 14 and progressing to heroin when in Parramatta gaol at age 18. His Honour remarked that since then the applicant had been addicted to heroin most of the time. The applicant had participated in the Drug Court programme but after about a year having re-offended, was taken off the programme and served six months [imprisonment] for the [offence] of goods in custody. 
     
      
    19 The sentencing Judge noted that the applicant began a relationship with Ms Phipps and they have a son then aged three. The relationship broke up which the applicant said he could not deal with and had returned to taking drugs. The applicant told the sentencing Judge that he wanted to enter a proper rehabilitation programme to deal with his drug use and had not used drugs since his arrest in December 2004. 
     
      
    20 During her evidence Ms Phipps confirmed that they had a relationship but it broke down because of the applicant’s drug usage. The sentencing Judge noted Ms Phipps’s evidence that when the applicant was not on drugs he was excellent and got on well with all of her children. She was prepared to offer him support when released to enable him to be rehabilitated.  
     
      
    21 His Honour referred to the pre-sentence report of 25 November 2004 as not being favourable. He expressly mentioned the probation officer’s assessment that a stalemate existed in relation to the applicant’s offending and the applicant’s failure to accept assistance to resolve issues including his drug addiction. His Honour commented that the probation officer‘s reservations appeared to have been justified as a month later the applicant was arrested for the offences committed in December 2004. The sentencing Judge remarked that the pre-sentence report dated 31 March 2006 was a little more positive and quoted from the summary in which the probation officer had observed that the applicant seemed capable of working and behaving responsibly and had concluded that serious doubts remained as to the applicant’s ability to remain consistently law-abiding. 
     
      
    22 The applicant’s prior criminal antecedents are extensive. Offences include prior convictions for break, enter and steal, stealing, assault with intent to rob armed with an offensive weapon, driving a conveyance taken without consent of the owner, receiving and goods in custody. His Honour accepted that the applicant’s present offences were drug related as were those in his past. 
     
      
    23 It is appropriate to note that at the time of the commission of the offences being charges 7 to 12 the applicant was on bail for the offences committed in 2001-2002. 
     
      
    24 The Notice of Appeal identifies two grounds namely: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1  
       
       
      The sentence was manifestly excessive in accumulation of sentences (sic) result in a sentence that is excessive. 
       
      
     Ground 2  
     
      
       
      His Honour erred when he failed to consider special circumstances (sic) pleaded guilty to all offences and long-term drug abuse. No personal monetary gain from totality of crimes committed.  
       
      
    25 In a further document presented to the Court the applicant raised additional grounds, which are conveniently summarised as: 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
     The sentence for count 11 was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
     Ground 4 
     
      
       
      His Honour stated that there was a possibility of rehabilitation a factor that his Honour appears to have overlooked when imposing sentence. 
       
      
    26 Grounds 1 and 3 may be conveniently dealt with together. The applicant, who represented himself before this Court, contends that the total [effective] sentence is manifestly excessive and out of proportion to comparative sentences. He provided the Court with a list of comparative sentences for the offence of break enter and steal and submits that offenders with similar facts, lengthy criminal antecedents and drug addiction have received an average sentence of 3 – 4 years “mid range”. The applicant argues that these comparative sentences were committed on dwelling houses whereas charge 11 involved the entering of an unlocked “disused railway” carriage which was used as a storage shed. 
     
      
    27 The Crown submits that the sentencing Judge dealt leniently with the applicant. The Crown points to the aggravating factors identified by his Honour under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (the Crimes (SP) Act) and the relatively minor sentences imposed when compared with the available statutory maximums. The Crown submits that the reason for the imposition of these relatively minor sentences and the significant degree of concurrency of sentences lies in his Honour’s determination that the principle of totality would not operate to destroy the utilitarian discount for the pleas of guilty by the extent of the accumulation. The Crown further contends that the sentencing Judge could have structured the sentences differently and had he done so a more lengthy sentence could have been imposed. 
     
      
    28 His Honour was faced with a difficult sentencing task, which involved eight counts as well as four matters on a Form 1. As the sentencing Judge was sentencing the applicant for a number of offences, he was obliged to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as questions of totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. From his Honour’s remarks and the structure of the sentences imposed, it is evident that the sentencing Judge carefully considered the principle of totality. His Honour remarked (ROS at 10): 
     
      
       
        
        “The way I have decided to structure the sentences means that the total non-parole period will be seven years and the parole period three years. I have considered the matter of accumulation which was dealt with at considerable length in the Crown’s written submissions. There are eight substantive charges and one of them has four charges to be taken into account on a Form 1. If I were to totally accumulate sequential sentences then the principle of totality would require such a diminution of sentence on each charge as to make the individual sentences inappropriate.” 
        
       
      
    And;  
     
      
       
        
        “…..As there will be partial accumulation it is inexpedient to impose non-parole and parole periods for charges 1, 2 and 7. I will fix a non-parole period on charge 11. I propose to impose fixed terms on charges 8, 9 and 10 to be concurrent with the sentence on charge 7 and a fixed term on charge 12 to be concurrent with the non-parole period on charge number 11. The reason for making those charges concurrent with others is that I cannot effectively incorporate accumulation that is compatible with the principle of totality and those charges are much less serious than the others.” 
        
       
      
    29 The course adopted by the sentencing Judge was consistent with the principles stated in Pearce provided that an appropriate sentence had been fixed for each offence. The structure of the sentences and the collective discount allowed for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty suggest, however, that his Honour’s primary focus was on the total effective sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    30 The most lengthy sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge was for charge 11 which as a result of total accumulation commences on 17 November 2008. The applicant’s criminality for that offence involved the breaking into of what was described as a “rusted train carriage” which was used as a storage container on a property at Cattai. Although one of the container doors was unlocked, as the applicant contends, a bolt cutter was used to cut through steel mesh and power tools valued at $4,500.00 were stolen. An aggravating factor to be taken into account on sentence for the offence was that it was committed whilst the applicant was on bail. The commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been recognised as a factor of aggravation requiring the passing of deterrent sentences for those who abuse their freedom on bail: see for example Regina v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [40-42] and R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 at [48]. After making allowance for a discount of 15 per cent for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years for the offence. A non-parole period of 3 years was fixed. The undiscounted starting point of the sentence must have been 7 years and 22 days.  
     
      
    31 Notwithstanding the seriousness of the offence, the applicant’s offending behaviour for which he was sentenced for count 1, it seems to me, was of a more serious kind. The applicant’s criminality in the commission of the offence being count 1 involved his breaking into the Pollicina’s house and stealing items of property including firearms and jewellery with a value of over $50,000.00. 
     
      
    32 The sentencing for the offence of receiving being count 2 included the taking into account of four matters on the Form 1. Each of these matters were acts of dishonesty. The motor vehicle [offence 4 Form 1] in which the applicant allowed himself to be conveyed was a Mercedes Benz convertible valued at over $150,000.00 which had been stolen from the Pollicina’s garage. His Honour was entitled to take into account the offences on the Form 1 so as to impose a longer sentence for the receiving than would otherwise have been imposed had it been the only offence: see Des Rosiers v R [2006] NSWCCA 16, Regina v Stankovic [2006] NSWCCA 229.  
     
      
    33 The applicant was sentenced to fixed terms of 2 years imprisonment for counts 1 and 2 which were partially accumulated. The approach adopted by his Honour to the totality of the sentences imposed did not involve the lowering of the individual sentences for counts 1 and 2 before aggregation: see Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616. His Honour determined that it was inexpedient to impose non-parole and parole periods for those counts. 
     
      
    34 When considering the applicant’s pleas of guilty, his Honour remarked (ROS at 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “The mitigating factors are firstly, that he has pleaded guilty to all of the offences, these were not at the first opportunity but followed negotiations. I do not detect any significant remorse for his crimes but the pleas of guilty have utilitarian value. I allow a discount of fifteen per cent for the pleas of guilty.” 
        
       
      
    35 It is true that the pleas of guilty to counts 1 and 2 were entered following negotiations after the applicant’s arraignment in the District Court but this was not so in the case of charges 7 to 12. Pleas of guilty to those charges had been entered in the Local Court and the applicant was entitled to have the utilitarian value of the pleas assessed on that basis. Whilst it is established that no course taken by a person offering a plea of guilty creates an entitlement to any particular discount, or to a discount at the maximum of the range of 10-25 per cent (see R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 112 [at 27]), the mistake by the sentencing Judge denied the applicant the possibility of the assessment of the utilitarian value of the pleas entered in the Local Court being in the range of 20-25 per cent. These pleas of guilty had significant utilitarian value avoiding the need for a committal hearing and a trial. With respect, the sentencing Judge in my opinion erred in overlooking this consideration by applying the same utilitarian discount for all the offences. There is no criticism of his Honour’s assessment of a discount of 15 per cent for counts 1 and 2.36 Although the offence at Cattai (charge 11) was committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty (an aggravating factor which was not present on sentence for counts 1 and 2) these considerations lead me to conclude that his Honour did not fix an appropriate sentence for charge 11 before considering accumulation and the principle of totality. By focussing on the total effective sentence to be imposed his Honour, with respect, was in error. 
     
      
    37 The Crown argues that the sentences for the break, enter and steal offences contrary to s 112(1) Crimes Act (count 1 and charge 11) were lenient as the sentencing Judge gave insufficient weight to the seriousness with which these offences are viewed. The purpose of this argument is to support the Crown’s contention that the total effective sentence is not manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    38 In the guideline judgment in Ponfield this Court emphasised the seriousness of an offence contrary to s 112(1) and referred to a number of factors the presence of which enhanced the seriousness of the offence. One of those factors namely the applicant’s prior record particularly for like offences was present at the time of the commission of both offences. As mentioned, the second factor namely the offence being committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty was present for charge 11.  
     
      
    39 It is apparent from the sentencing Judge’s remarks that he took these factors into account. His Honour, as he was obliged to do, did not take into account the applicant’s prior record of similar offending as increasing the seriousness of the offences but as a factor disentitling the applicant to “further leniency” (ROS at 7). His Honour was entitled to have regard to the applicant’s record in giving more weight to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community than would be the case if such a record did not exist: see R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; R v M.A.K R v M.S.K [2006] NSWCCA 381 [at 51].  
     
      
    40 His Honour was clearly aware of the seriousness of the offences and I am not persuaded that the sentence for count 1 of a fixed term of imprisonment of two years was unduly lenient. On the other hand, an undiscounted starting point of 7 years and 22 days imprisonment for charge 11 is, to my mind, beyond the range appropriate for that offence. This Court has said that sentencing for offences contrary to s 112(1) does not involve simply adding up aggravating features. It involves a qualitative analysis of the particular facts surrounding the relevant offence: see R v Webster [2005] NSWCCA 110 [at 26]. 
     
      
    41 The Crown contends that his Honour gave insufficient weighting in count 2 for the four offences on the Form 1. It is evident from the sentencing Judge’s remarks that he was mindful of the offences included on the Form 1. In my opinion, the sentences for each of the offences other than charge 11 were within an appropriate range. His Honour furthermore gave proper consideration to the accumulation or concurrence of all the sentences. As a consequence of my finding of manifest excess for charge 11, it follows that the total effective sentence of 10 years imprisonment is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      
    42 The principal complaint of the applicant in ground 2 of the appeal is that his Honour erred in failing to consider special circumstances. The applicant’s complaint is without merit as the sentencing Judge found special circumstances because of the applicant’s need for “extended supervision” (ROS at 9). As a result, the balance of term of the total effective sentence exceeded one third of the non-parole period an adjustment of 6 months being made in the applicant’s favour.  
     
      
       
      
    43 Ground 4 of the appeal is that his Honour overlooked the possibility of rehabilitation when imposing sentence. Contrary to the applicant’s submission, the sentencing Judge was clearly mindful of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. This ground of appeal has not been established.  
     
      
    44 Further matters have been raised by the applicant in written material provided to the Court. The applicant complains that his Honour erred when he failed to take into account that some of the offences arise out of the same set of facts. It appears that the applicant is referring to charges 8, 9 and 10 (as one group) and charges 11 and 12 (as another group). It is evident that the sentencing Judge recognised that there was an element of commonality in these charges by requiring that the individual sentences imposed be served concurrently. A further complaint is that an error was made when the sentencing Judge said “he didn’t detect any remorse”. What his Honour did say was that he did not detect any significant remorse. Such a finding was open to the sentencing Judge and there is no error.  
     
      
    45 The applicant complains that the sentencing Judge failed to take into account his strict bail conditions. As mentioned, the applicant’s criminal offending in 2004 occurred whilst he was at liberty on bail and there is no entitlement to a reduction in sentence for the terms of that conditional liberty which he breached.  
     
      
    46 Error having been identified, the Court, in my view, should consider whether “some other sentence ……is warranted in law and should have been passed”: s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    47 The appropriate undiscounted starting point of the sentence for charge 11 is 6 years. This sentence is reduced by 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty in the Local Court to 4 years 6 months.  
     
      
    48 Although his Honour erred by over looking the entry of the pleas of guilty at the earlier stage for charges 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12, I am of the view that for these offences lesser sentences are not warranted in law.  
     
      
    49 The applicant has informed this Court that he is currently serving his sentence on protection. From an affidavit of Senior Assistant Superintendent Hornery, it appears that the applicant became a special management area placement inmate on 10 June 2006 at his own request as he feared for his safety. He was transferred to Parklea Correctional Centre and recently signed a further inmate protection application. He is currently housed in Unit 5C at Parklea where he is free to mix with all of the inmates in the Unit and has access to the services detailed in the affidavit. Area 5C inmates it seems have limited employment opportunities, however, the applicant is presently ineligible for employment. The applicant in response points out that inmates on protection do not have the opportunity to participate in work release and spend more time locked in their cells. His Honour found special circumstances. I am not persuaded that the conditions in which the applicant is presently serving his sentence are such to allow for a further adjustment in the balance of term.  
     
      
    50 A total effective sentence of 8 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years, in my view, appropriately reflects the totality of the criminality. This may be achieved by quashing the sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge for charge 11 and by fixing for that offence a non-parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months. 
     
      
    51 In my opinion, the Court should make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      (ii) Quash the sentence imposed by Viney ADCJ for charge 11 being an offence contrary to s 112(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900. 
       
       
      (iii) Sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 17 November 2008 and expire on 16 November 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring on 16 May 2013 for charge 11. 
       
       
      The earliest date the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is  
      
    16 November 2010.

    JUDGMENTIntroduction1 Allan Robert Kessing, the offender, appeared for trial before his Honour Judge Puckeridge in the District Court Sydney on Monday 5 March 2007. Before a jury was selected, the Crown Prosecutor informed his Honour that there were issues to be raised on behalf of the offender to be decided before the trial could commence. Thereafter, his Honour heard and determined a number of pre-trial issues. 2 On Tuesday, 6 March 2007 the offender appeared before me for trial after Judge Puckeridge was allocated to other proceedings.3 The offender was arraigned and pleaded not guilty in the absence of a panel from which the jury was to be selected. There followed a discussion with regard to the way the Crown intended to present its case, which was entirely circumstantial, and with regard to evidence and procedural matters that might need to be resolved by me in the course of the trial. 4 Shortly thereafter, in the presence of the jury panel, the accused was arraigned upon an indictment containing one charge contrary to section 70(2) of the Crimes Act, 1914 (Cth) that he:  
     
      
      Having been a Commonwealth officer, namely, an officer of the Australian Customs Service, did between about 10 May 2005 and 31 May 2005 communicate to Martin Chulov and Jonathon Porter without lawful authority or excuse contents of documents, namely, two reports, ‘Threat Assessment of Airport Security Screening Personnel Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport’ and ‘Sydney Airport - Air Border Security - Risk Analysis 2003’, also known as the ‘Tarmac Report 2003’, which came into his possession by virtue of having been a Commonwealth officer and which at that time when he ceased to be a Commonwealth officer it was his duty not to disclose.  
      
    5 The offender pleaded not guilty. The jury was selected and the trial proceeded. The trial continued over fifteen days and on Tuesday, 27 March 2007 the jury returned with a verdict of guilty.6 The offender did not give evidence and did not call evidence in the trial. 7 Thereafter, the Crown tendered a record of the offender’s antecedents and the proceedings were adjourned for the proceedings on sentence to continue on a later date. Proceedings on Sentence. 8 The offender appeared before me in the District Court, Sydney on Friday, 25 May 2007. The Crown presented a folder of material the contents of which included submissions on sentence and the pre-sentence report prepared for the assistance of the court. This material was marked Exhibit A.9 Included in Exhibit A is a statement from Gail Jennifer Batman, Regional Director, New South Wales, Australian Customs Service. 10 The Crown was given notice that Ms Batman would be required for cross-examination and she was called for that purpose. At the conclusion of this cross-examination the Crown closed its case on sentence. Counsel for the offender tendered a copy of a report by Sir John Wheeler, marked Exhibit 1. Submissions followed. 11 The offender did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence. The Facts12 The Crown alleged that in the course of his former work as an officer of the Australian Customs Service, the offender came into possession of the two reports described in the charge, and between 10 May 2005, when he resigned from his position as a customs officer, and 31 May 2005, he communicated the content of these documents to Mr Chulov and Mr Porter, who were at the time employed as journalists with The Australian newspaper. 13 The jury having returned a verdict of guilty it is now my task to consider the evidence that was presented in the trial and proceed to find facts upon which I may impose sentence. The assessment of the facts must be according to the evidence and consistent with the verdict of the jury. I am not bound to impose sentence according to findings of fact that are the most favourable or advantageous to the offender, however, the findings that are to be made must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: Regina v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. 14 The contest between the Crown and the offender in this trial was focussed essentially upon whether it could be established beyond reasonable doubt that it was the offender who communicated to the journalists content of the two reports particularised in the charge.15 In his opening remarks to the jury, counsel for the offender acknowledged that not all of the elements of the charge were in dispute. He identified first the status of the offender as a Commonwealth officer and an officer of the Australian Customs Service. Nor was it in dispute that the subject reports came into his possession by virtue of that status. Counsel informed the jury that what was in dispute was the proposition that the offender communicated the contents of the documents, or either one of them, to either of the two named journalists.16 As the trial unfolded there were questions raised relevant to other issues but ultimately they became less important if not entirely without significance. 17 Initially, counsel for the offender indicated that he would not object to the tender of copies of the newspaper articles in which reference was made to the reports. He indicated that he would consent to the tender upon a provisional basis, as he described it, subject to the qualification that at the end of the day it was for the Crown to prove that there was a disclosure to the named individuals in the indictment. Ultimately, the issue as to the fact of the publication of the newspaper articles on 31 May 2005 was not contested. 18 Counsel for the offender also made reference in his opening remarks to the notorious prosecution of Schapelle Corby in Indonesia, and suggested the connection between that matter and airport baggage handlers. He cross-examined with regard to this, to suggest that there was some justification for the disclosure of the contents of the reports, whoever might have been responsible for it. Since the offender denied any involvement in the communication, and continues to maintain that position, there could not sensibly be any claim by him that he had a lawful justification or excuse, the proof of which was upon him: section 70(2) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Counsel did no more than make an oblique reference to such matter in his closing address.19 This aspect does have significance, however, in the present phase of these proceedings, and I shall make further reference to that in due course. 20 The work on the first report given the name, ‘Threat Assessment of Airport Security Screening Personnel Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport’, was commenced at some point about mid-2002 until the beginning of 2003 by a team, which included the offender as a researcher, led by Caterina Magni, also a customs officer slightly more senior than the offender. The report focussed upon an organisation, and individuals within it, operating at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport. According to Ms Magni, the report was prepared upon information held from past work, additional information brought to her by the team assembled for the preparation of this report, the product of covert electronic surveillance, and information acquired by way of background checks upon the organisation and its staff. 21 Ms Magni said she wrote the report, and that it was complete in February 2003. She gave the report to her supervisor, and he provided a copy to another manager, John Valastro. Ms Magni had intended that the document be distributed more broadly but it did not find its way to any higher levels of management. Mr Valastro did not disseminate the document further. 22 In his evidence, Mr Valastro described this document as a review of a list of people working in certain parts of the airport whose names had been put through a number of different systems to ascertain whether they had links to criminal or other indices, and to determine whether they ought to be targeted. He described the document as sensitive because individuals were named, and because of the work that had been undertaken in respect of them. It was not a document that would be published widely because of operational security, other than to perhaps be made available to other agencies such as the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission with which Australian Customs engaged upon joint operations from time-to-time. He said that publication of the material could compromise the security required for operational activity and methodology. 23 His assessment of the report was that it was inadequate and he was of the view that more work was required before any decision to embark upon an operation could be made. He referred the document back to its source and to another branch of Australian Customs for further development of the material contained in it. 24 Later in that same year Ms Magni prepared the second report given the name ‘Sydney Airport - Air Border Security Risk Analysis 2003’. This report was also known as the ‘Tarmac Report 2003’. The same methodology was employed. The second report referred to all organisations operating at a particular location at the airport, with additional material relevant to the organisation discussed in the initial report.25 The second report was also passed on to her supervisors for dissemination to other levels of management within Australian Customs. 26 Mr Valastro was provided with the second report and took the view that the conclusions regarding the levels of risk attributed to the particular areas identified were not justified according to the material upon which they were advanced. He was not prepared to further disseminate this report without what he described as more robust work in relation to those matters. He was also concerned about what he believed to be comments made regarding the ethnicity of groups working in the areas discussed. As with the first report, publication of this report to the broader public could compromise operational activity and methodology. 27 The preparation of these reports was not a task that was allocated to Ms Magni. She initiated the projects herself. She gave the reports the classification ‘Highly Protected’. As it turned out this classification was higher than the documents required. The evidence led in the trial was to the effect that the appropriate classification for these documents was ‘Protected’. 28 Sections of these reports were quoted in articles published in The Australian newspaper on 31 May 2005. A photocopy of those articles and a copy of the newspaper in which they were published became Exhibit F in the trial. The articles included passages quoted directly from the reports together with descriptions of their subject matter including:  
     
      
       
        The employment status of individuals who were the subject of the reports;  
       
      
      
       
        The allegation of criminal conspiracies between groups of employees within the airport; 
       
      
      
       
        Examples of misconduct upon which these individuals had allegedly engaged concerned with the diversion of baggage containing illicit drugs; 
       
      
      
       
        That some employees had records of criminal convictions; 
       
       
        That some employees were the subject of references to the Department of Immigration; 
       
      
      
       
        Aspects of airport security, particularly with regard to the placement of surveillance cameras which protected misconduct in certain locations from detection; 
       
      
      
       
        The official names allocated to operations undertaken by Australian Customs and others; and 
       
       
        The racial characteristics and religion of some of the individuals the subject of those operations or suspected of wrongdoing. 
       
       
      
    29 The list is not exhaustive30 The impact of the publication of this material was described in the statement by Ms Batman included in Exhibit A, tendered in the sentence proceedings.31 Following the newspaper publication she was required to attend upon a number of inter-departmental committees, and the Minister responsible for Australian Customs, to discuss the information exposed. She was required to appear and give evidence before a Parliamentary Joint Committee. She represented in her statement that the unauthorised disclosure of this material significantly damaged the reputation of the Australian Customs Service with the Minister, the Parliament, and with other agencies. She expressed the opinion that the publication impacted upon the organisation’s reputation generally, had the potential to undermine community support and trust in Customs, and that it created a loss of confidence from other law enforcement agencies. She referred to what she described as intense media scrutiny to which Customs was subject, until aspects of the articles which were not accurate had been refuted in the aforementioned forums. Her statement included the following passage at paragraph 9: 
     
      
      In particular, the report contained sensitive operational information, including references to operations undertaken by other agencies such as the NSW Police and the Australian Federal Police. Although only parts of the reports have been published, they did contain information that is sensitive to both law enforcement and security and release of the report has the potential to benefit criminal element. 
        
      
    32 She makes the obvious point that law enforcement agencies, such as Australian Customs, manage highly confidential and sensitive information in the course of their work that must not be compromised by unauthorised disclosure of that information. 33 Cross-examination of this witness provided the opportunity for her to amplify certain parts of her statement in the course of which she acknowledged the outcomes from the report by Sir John Wheeler, Exhibit 1, including the allocation of funding. She did not accept that the report criticised Customs to the extent put to her, and she pointed out that the newspaper articles were inaccurate in certain respects.34 She acknowledged that there was no actual compromise to operations as a result of the newspaper publication. 35 Counsel for the offender asked me to consider specific aspects of the report of Sir John Wheeler. The report is named ‘An Independent Review of Airport Security and Policing for the Government of Australia’ and was published in September 2005.36 The Terms of Reference, at p.vii include in the preamble reference to the events of 11 September 2001 and the measures taken thereafter to strengthen aviation security, and continues with the following: 
     
      
      … and also being aware of community concerns about criminal activity Australian airports… 
      
    37 The Terms of Reference were to review the threat from serious and organised crime at airports and related cargo areas within Australia, to make recommendations to strengthen the integration of ground based aviation security, and to review the adequacy of current ground based aviation security requirements put in place in response to threats of terrorism, including in relation to the following matters relevant to these proceedings: 
     
      
       The scheme for security identity cards and related aspects of background checking; 
      
     
     
      
       Airport access controls; 
      
     
     
      
       Scrutiny of airport workers and others entering air site areas of major airports; and 
      
      
       Security compliance of airports and airlines.  
      
    38 I was asked to note paragraph 10 on p.x of the report, which is in the following terms.  
     
      
      Despite a current reference to the Australian Crime Commission (ACC), and some excellent one-off investigations by the Australian Customs Service (ACS), the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and State and Territory Police, there is no ongoing mechanism to draw together and assess regularly the threat of crime and criminality at major airports. This new role would best be performed by the ACC and will require Customs, the AFP and State and Territory Police consistently to input timely data ... 
      
    39 I was also asked to note paragraph 11 on p.xi. This refers to the recognition in the Terms of Reference of the community’s concern about criminal activity at Australian airports, in respect of which it is said that the Review had great difficulty in obtaining comprehensive airport crime data. It is said that there is a culture of under reporting and tolerance of thefts at airports and related cargo areas, and that police are rarely on site. It continues:  
     
      
      … Intelligence material, particularly from Customs, confirmed significant threats and vulnerabilities at major airports that are consistent with the reporting by The Australian on 31 May and 1 June 2005 of the unauthorised release of a classified Customs staff level assessment at Sydney Airport.  
      
    40 Finally, I was invited to p.51 in the main body of the report at paragraph 2 of Chapter 7, which recommends changes to procedures which inhibit the sharing of information between law enforcement agencies, and the amendment of legislation limiting and proscribing the dissemination of information between those bodies, including the amendment of privacy legislation to the extent that it has this effect. 41 The paragraph includes the following passage:  
     
      
      Important Customs intelligence reports shared with the Review dating from 2000 to 2004 were in line with the 2003 report on Sydney Airport that had been provided without authorisation to The Australian in 2005, but it was not clear that they had been shared in a timely manner, if at all, with other bodies with a legitimate need to know.  
      
    Findings42 The Crown reminded me that I must have regard to the matters set out in Pt.1B of the Crimes Act, 1914, and specifically the matters provided in section 16A which provides a check list against which one is to determine a sentence of a severity appropriate to all of the circumstances of the offence. Section 16A(2) requires that I take into account such matters listed therein as are relevant to the matter. I now propose to do so. Section 16A(2)(a)- the nature and the circumstances of the offence43 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the following facts: 
     
      First, the offender was in possession of the two reports by virtue of his former status as a Commonwealth officer. As indicated earlier, so much was conceded by his counsel in the opening remarks he made to the jury; 
     
     
      Secondly, at some time before his resignation from the Australian Customs Service, and without having authority or permission to do so, the offender removed copies of the reports from his place of work and retained them at his premises where they were later found by investigators. It was conceded by his counsel in the course of his closing address to the jury, and in the course of submissions made on sentence, that he ought not to have had the copies of the reports;  
      Thirdly, after his departure from Australian Customs he communicated the content of the reports to the journalists named in the charge. Subsequently, that material found its way into the articles published on 31 May 2005 in The Australian newspaper. It is not established to my satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt precisely how the content of these documents was communicated, that is to say, whether by way of entire copies, or copies of parts of the reports, or by the communication of the text through some other medium. I am satisfied, however, that at least some part of the second report was delivered in the form of hard copy by some medium in light of the picture published in a subsequent article on 2 June 2005 in The Australian newspaper: Trial Exhibit 7; 
     
     
      Fourthly, the offender was in telephone contact with the journalist Chulov. No other inference may rationally be drawn from the evidence of the call charge records demonstrating the telephone contact, and the documents seized from the premises of the offender upon which the name and contact particulars of the journalist were recorded; 
     
     
      Fifthly, the reports contained sensitive information officially protected from publication by the classification that had been affixed, and upon disclosure had the potential to compromise operational security and methodology; 
      Finally, the offender’s conduct was deliberate and purposeful. No other inference may rationally be drawn from the extent of the contact by telephone between the offender and Chulov and the times at which it took place.  
    44 The Crown submits that the trial Exhibits E and M provide evidence that the offender was a disgruntled employee as a consequence of his treatment as such and his perception of the lack of action taken in relation to the reports in the preparation of which he had some role. I believe there is merit in this.45 Exhibit E is a series of emails communicated between the offender and his managers when he was overseas in Ireland and had failed to return to work at the appointed time. The import of the messages is that he had a back complaint which he represented as being the sequelae of a compensable injury from the past, that the claim required support in the form of a medical assessment at the place from which he was communicating, and that he had difficulty finding a medical practitioner who would provide the material required by his managers. His leave was extended, but the point was reached when the patience of management had dissipated and he was to be counselled and re-deployed upon his return. These emails were sent between 14 May 2004 and 1 November 2004. 46 Exhibit M is an email from the offender to a former colleague on 9 June 2005. On any view of that document he is displeased with the senior officers named, such that, according to the email, he resigned promptly by way of a letter in which he wrote simply, ‘I RESIGN’. 47 However, these emotions are to be viewed in light of the demise of the offender’s mother near to the time when the offence was committed. She passed having suffered terminal leukaemia through which the offender provided care for her. He became aware of her illness upon his return from overseas. Although the evidence of the impact from this is scant, and as noted the offender did not give evidence, there is sufficient material before me to come to the view that he cared for his mother, that he provided care for her through her illness and final days, and that it would be expected that this would have caused him some measure of emotional distress, contributing to the decision to communicate this material. 48 The Crown points to this as an objectively serious offence involving a significant breach of trust. The offender was bound to observe confidentiality and failed to do so. These obligations continued after his employment came to an end with his resignation. It is said that general deterrence is to be given significant weight: R v Riccord (Unreported 9/5/1997 NSWCCA). 49 On behalf of the offender it is suggested that there was a great deal of good that came from the publication of these articles, including the appointment of Sir John Wheeler, the product of his Review, and the action taken by government thereafter. It was submitted that this provides significant mitigation. 50 I should consider these submissions in some detail against the background of the approach taken at the trial and the public comment that has followed the guilty verdict.51 The Crown was put to strict proof with regard to the allegation that it was the offender who communicated the content of these reports to the journalists. The case, from beginning to end, was conducted according to the proposition that he did not do so. There was extensive cross-examination of witnesses called in the Crown case to establish the opportunities that were available for others to communicate the content of these reports to the journalists. 52 At the same time, however, with reference made to the Corby matter in Indonesia and to an operation that led to the apprehension of a number of individuals charged with the importation of cocaine through Sydney Airport, the proposition that the publication of these reports was in some way an act of public service was sought to be developed.53 The implication in this is that the offender had not communicated the contents of the reports, but if he was found to have done so, it was with justification because the public had an interest in knowing what was contained in these documents. Section 70(2) of the Crimes Act, 1914 provides for the defence of lawful justification or excuse, the proof whereof was for the offender had he wanted to justify his actions before the jury. The offender persisted and persists with his denial of this conduct.54 It has been impossible to ignore entirely the publicity that this matter has attracted since the trial and the comments offered in the electronic and print media in terms that the offender should be shown gratitude for what he has been found to have done. There is a significant level of sympathy for the offender.55 Although aware of some of these publications I have placed them aside from the matters that I bring to account for the determination of sentence. They are not before me as evidence and are not relevant to that question. 56 In the submissions made by the learned Crown, my attention was taken to Commonwealth of Australia v John Fairfax & Sons Limited (1980) 147 CLR 39 and the observation of Mason J at p.52 regarding the unacceptability in this democratic society of restraint upon the publication of information relating to government when the only vice of that information is that it enables the public to discuss, review and criticise government action. His Honour made the point that the court will determine any claim of confidentiality by the government by reference to public interest. Unless disclosure is likely to injury the public interest, the information will not be protected.57 One could not cavil with this principle. 58 This said, I do not accept the submission that the evidence presented in these proceedings establishes that there was a shortfall in the standards to be expected of the Australian Customs Service such as to justify the belief that has been attributed to the offender by those who presently applaud his conduct.59 However, accepting that it is in the public interest to expose the inadequacy of an agency of government manifested by its failure to respond in a timely fashion to an internal report generated at the lower levels of the organisation to inform management of operational and related concerns, that is an entirely different matter from the unauthorised dissemination of the information harvested in the course of operational activities and the intelligence developed therefrom, upon which the report was generated, such as has occurred in this instance. 60 Whether or not it is appropriate to view the offender in the heroic light with which he has been bathed by some for having exposed what he represents to be inadequate aspects of management within the Australian Customs Service concerned with Sydney Airport, there was no justification whatsoever for the communication of the content of these reports. It has been conceded that there is no evidence of any particular operations having been put at risk, and there is no evidence that any particular law enforcement officer or group of law enforcement officers were put at risk by reason of this publication in the course of operational duties including those of a covert nature. However, I accept the submission by the Crown regarding the potential that the conduct of which the offender has been found guilty had for doing so. At his level within Australian Customs one would not expect the offender to know the extent of operations being undertaken by this service or other law enforcement agencies whether conducted individually or under the auspices of a co-ordinated project. Had there been any such projects under way, in any way connected with the organisations and individuals employed at Sydney Airport to which the newspaper articles have referred, it is at least probable the operations and those engaged upon them in any covert capacity would have been at some risk. 61 Additionally, the content of the articles published in the newspaper have the capacity to taint the reputation of people engaged in work in the specific areas identified at Sydney Airport whether or not the suspicions represented could ultimately be shown to have had any merit. Even accepting that there was justification for these suspicions, it would be surprising to find that all of those engaged in those areas of work would be shown to be engaged upon criminal conspiracies such as the articles described. Nevertheless, those who were innocent of any wrongdoing must still bear the ignominy of the general allegations made, some of which were expressed with reference to cultural and religious characteristics of the persons discussed.62 Relevant to the assessment of the impact of the newspaper articles is the source from which they were prepared, identified within them, and likely to have been viewed as entirely authoritative irrespective of the weaknesses that have been identified in the reports themselves. 63 I agree with the submission made by the Crown that this is to be assessed objectively as a serious offence. I also bring to account the breach of trust demonstrated by the offender in its commission. Section 16A(2)(e) - the loss and damage resulting from the offence 64 I accept the evidence given by Ms Batman, but I note that the perception that might have developed at the time of and shortly after the newspaper articles were published, at least within the law enforcement milieu and other official relationships, was resolved shortly thereafter. Moreover, the report from Sir John Wheeler was not entirely critical of Australian Customs. Indeed, he approached his Review with regard to the role of law enforcement agencies in the relevant contexts generally. 65 This said, I have taken into account the nature of the information that has been published at large, the potential it had for harm to ongoing operations and the methodologies employed, and the damage to the reputation of Australian Customs amongst the general public reflected in some measure by the views of those who have publicly supported the conduct of the offender. Section 16A(2)(f) - the extent of contrition 66 Clearly there is none. The offender persists with the representation that he did not commit the offence and that in any event the conduct was justified. So much is made clear in the pre-sentence report included in Exhibit A. Section 16A(2)(h) - co-operation with law enforcement 67 Once again there has been none. Section 16A(2)(j) & (k) - deterrence of the offender and adequate punishment 68 Although not itemised in this provision, the deterrence of others from such offences is a relevant consideration: DPP (Cth) v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370. This is a significant consideration in this case.69 However, specific deterrence of the offender is not so significant in my assessment. Although he has shown no contrition, his circumstances are such that I am persuaded that there is little risk of him re-offending. The pre-sentence report refers to the question of supervision of the offender in the community and records that he will be unlikely to benefit from it. I accept this as correct, in light of his otherwise good character, and the dissipation of the factors that I find contributed to his decision to commit these offences, namely, the dissatisfaction with his employment within Australian Customs at the material time and the unfortunate demise of his mother. Section 16A(2)(m) - character, antecedents, age, means and physical and mental condition of the offender70 The offender is fifty-nine years of age and has only one conviction for an offence of dishonesty from many years ago. It was minor and of no significance to the present day. I have disregarded it.71 I note that there is evidence of his back complaint before me in the emails exhibited in these proceedings.72 There is no other evidence to demonstrate that the offender might find incarceration arduous. 73 He is a person of good character. No other view can be taken in the circumstances. He has given extensive and what is said to have been valued service as an officer of the Australian Customs Service over many years. It is quite apparent to me that this conduct of which he has been found guilty, more correctly described as misconduct, is entirely an aberration. Section 16A(2)(n) - the prospects for rehabilitation74 This presents something of a challenge, for in the absence of an acknowledgement of the verdict of the jury, and the persistence with the proposition that the disclosure of the material was justified, it cannot be said that the offender has prospects for rehabilitation from the offending of which he has been found guilty.75 However, as earlier stated, I am persuaded that there is little chance of him committing another such offence. The appropriate sentence76 I am of the view, for the reasons earlier explained, that this offence is objectively very serious.77 Notwithstanding that there were stressors impacting upon the offender at the material time by reason of the illness of his mother and the difficulties he was having with the managers to whom he was responsible in his work, reflected in the trial Exhibits E and M, he was an experienced customs officer of mature age, and I am satisfied that he well knew that he was doing wrong at the time of the communication of the contents of these reports. 78 I note in the assessments in the pre-sentence report that he is suitable for community service, but there is the qualification there reported that no available developmental program would significantly benefit him. In the circumstances I agree with this observation.79 He is assessed as unsuitable for periodic detention for reasons not explained. No inference adverse to the offender should be drawn from that representation. 80 I have considered options other than the imposition of a custodial sentence: section 17A(1) Crimes Act, 1914 (Cth), but I believe that this misconduct is so serious that no other course should be taken.81 I have reviewed the various decisions provided by the Crown to assist with the assessment of the sentence required in this case. I find that the course I propose is well within the range of sentencing options appropriate to the offending on this occasion. 82 The Crown has conceded that an appropriate course in this case is to apply section 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, 1914. I agree and I propose to do so. 83 The offender is convicted and is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of nine months. Pursuant to section 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, 1914 (Cth), I order that the offender be released forthwith conditionally upon entering into recognizance in the sum of $1,000.00, without surety, to be of good behaviour for a period of nine months. 84 It is a condition of the recognisance that if the offender is called upon to do so at any time during the period of this recognizance he is to appear before court. In the circumstances, there is no need for any further conditions to attach to the recognizance. 85 The nature of the sentence and the consequences of any failure to observe the terms of the recognisance were explained to the offender. Addendum: The maximum penalty for the offence upon which sentence was imposed upon the offender is imprisonment for 2 years. Through oversight, this was not expressly referred to in the remarks on sentence. However, it was a matter of which the Court was reminded by the Crown in submissions and was brought to account.

     Geoffrey William LEONARD v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant seeks leave under s5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to appeal against the judgment of her Honour Judge Morgan in which her Honour refused a permanent stay of proceedings sought by the Applicant. In those proceedings the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions sought to present an indictment for an offence under s474.22 of the Criminal Code (Cth). The charge is that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 19 September 2005 and 7 March 2006 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Geoffrey William Leonard, used a carriage service, namely the Internet, to make available child abuse material.” 
        
       
      
    2 The background facts can be briefly stated. The Applicant had a website on which he published material about himself and his involvement in what he called “man-boy love”. The website was used, inter alia, as a vehicle to promote the Applicant’s views that there should be changes to existing laws regarding sexual crimes against children. 
     
      
    3 The Crown alleges that on the website the Applicant published a 124 page article entitled “Punished for Love”. Within this article there was an edited police fact sheet and edited police statements of two males and of their father, concerning sexual acts committed on the two males (brothers then aged 13 years and 16 years) by the Applicant during 1989. It is the edited police fact sheet and edited police witness statements which are alleged to constitute child abuse material, the subject of the charge.  
     
      
    4 The Applicant advanced his case before Judge Morgan on three alternative bases, which are substantially repeated in this Court. Furthermore, the Applicant now raises a constitutional issue based on the implied immunity for political communication found in the Commonwealth Constitution. 
     
      
       
      The Legislation 
       
      
    5 Section 474.22 of the Criminal Code provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the person: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) uses a carriage service to access material; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) uses a carriage service to cause material to be transmitted to the person; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) uses a carriage service to transmit material; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iv) uses a carriage service to make material available; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
          (v) uses a carriage service to publish or otherwise distribute material; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) the material is child abuse material. 
        
       
       
        
        Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) To avoid doubt, the following are the fault elements for the physical elements of an offence against subsection (1): 
        
       
       
        
        (a) intention is the fault element for the conduct referred to in paragraph (1)(a); 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) recklessness is the fault element for the circumstances referred to in paragraph (1)(b). 
        
       
       
        
        Note: For the meaning of  
        intention 
         and  
        recklessness 
         see sections 5.2 and 5.4. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) As well as the general defences provided for in Part 2.3, defences are provided for under section 474.24 in relation to this section.” 
        
       
      
    6 “Child abuse material” is defined in s473.1 of the Criminal Code as: 
     
      
       
        
        “child abuse material” means: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) material that depicts a person, or a representation of a person, who: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) is, or appears to be, a victim of torture, cruelty or physical abuse; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) material that describes a person who: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) is, or is implied to be, under 18 years of age; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) is, or is implied to be, a victim or torture, cruelty or physical abuse;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive.” 
        
       
      
    7 Section 473.4 of the Criminal Code provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The matters to be taken into account in deciding for the purposes of this Part whether reasonable persons would regard particular material, or a particular use of a carriage service, as being, in all the circumstances, offensive, include: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the literary, artistic or educational merit (if any) of the material; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the general character of the material (including whether it is of a medical, legal or scientific character).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    8 It is also pertinent to refer to the parallel provisions for an offence of using a carriage service for child pornography material found in s474.19. Child pornography material” is also defined in s473.1. It is unnecessary to set it out in full. It is sufficient to note that it extends to: 
     
      
    · depiction or representation of a sexual pose or sexual activity; 
     
      
    · the depiction of sexual organs for a sexual purpose; 
     
      
    · the description of a person engaged in a sexual pose or sexual activity; 
     
      
    · material that describes a sexual organ of a person. 
     
      
       
      in each case where the person is, or is implied to be, under 18 years of age.  
       
      
    9 With respect to each of these categories, as in the case of child abuse material, the definition contains the qualification “and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive”. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    10 The first ground of appeal is that her Honour erred in refusing to order a permanent stay by failing to properly consider that the evidence relied upon by the Crown would prejudice the Applicant by raising his bad character. In this regard the Applicant relies both on the matter said to constitute an offence, namely the edited police statements and the edited police sheet, as well the whole of the document in which they are, respectively, contained.  
     
      
    11 The statements are part of the publication prepared by the Applicant entitled “Punished for Love” which on p1 he has described as: 
     
      
       
        
        “A collection of autobiographically based essays on the law, prisons, society, ethics and sexuality. This is the tale of a judicial fraud whereby an attempt is made to justify the imposition of a heavy gaol sentence for a moral crime, when doubt is felt that the criminal law should be about morals.” 
        
       
      
    12 There is little doubt that much of the material contained in the Applicant’s own document, including his own admission as to his sexual activities with young boys and his criminal conviction, inter alia, would be regarded by a jury as adversely reflecting on his character. 
     
      
    13 The trial has not yet occurred. The evidence has not yet been tendered. No trial judge has yet considered whether some or all of the material upon which the Crown seeks to rely should be omitted in the exercise of the Court’s discretion. Nor has any trial judge considered whether or not any direction concerning such evidence should be made and, if so, the adequacy of any such direction with respect to ensuring that the Applicant receives a fair trial. 
     
      
    14 This ground for a stay is not only premature. How the trial will be conducted is yet to be determined. How the defence will be conducted has not even been raised in the course of these proceedings. It may very well be that counsel for the defence during the course of the trial may insist on the entirety of the document going into evidence.  
     
      
    15 The overall context of the whole of the documents may reinforce the proposition that the particular passages upon which the charges are based because of the character of the documents – namely a police witness statement and charge sheet – are such that the depiction or representation of the alleged “physical abuse” would not be regarded by a reasonable person as being “offensive”.  
     
      
    16 Judge Morgan stated expressly in rejecting this ground that: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not accept that there is such prejudice to the accused that the trial judge would be unable to cure it by careful directions to the jury.” 
        
       
      
    17 No basis for interfering with her Honour’s exercise of discretion in this respect has been advanced. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    18 The second ground is that her Honour erred in refusing to order a stay by failing to consider properly, or at all, that the evidence relied upon by the Crown does not amount to child abuse material. The ground is primarily based on the proposition that the relevant part of the definition of “child abuse material” in s473.1 of the Criminal Code, namely “physical abuse”, cannot as a matter of statutory interpretation apply to sexual abuse. Her Honour rejected this ground on the basis that it was a matter for the jury. She did not, however, address the statutory interpretation issue in terms.  
     
      
    19 In written submissions it was suggested that the provision should in some way be read down to extend only to a “trade or traffic in child abuse material”. This submission was without foundation and was appropriately withdrawn. 
     
      
    20 It was also suggested in the written submissions that material could not be regarded by reasonable persons as “offensive” within the definition of “child abuse material” in s473.1, having regard to the matters required to be considered in drawing this conclusion by s473.4. In this regard her Honour was completely correct in concluding that this was quintessentially a jury issue and could not be the basis for a permanent stay application. 
     
      
    21 The statutory interpretation submission was based on the parallel regimes for “child abuse material” and “child pornography material”.  
     
      
    22 The relevant charge in the present case is under s474.22(1)(a)(iv) of the Criminal Code, namely that the Applicant used a carriage service to make “child abuse material available”. This section has an exact parallel in s474.19(1)(a)(iv) which makes it an offence to use a carriage service to make child pornography material available.  
     
      
    23 There may be circumstances in which some of the provisions of the definition of child pornography material, to which I have referred above may be seen as constituting a form of “sexual abuse”. However, that is not the primary thrust of the respective component parts of the definition of “child pornography material”. As referred to above the respective paragraphs which concern the depiction, representation or description of such matters are concerned with engaging in a sexual pose or sexual activity or of a sexual organ, etc.  
     
      
    24 Nothing in the terminology suggests that one set of characteristics was intended to be exclusive of the other. The possibility of overlap in particular situations is not of itself sufficient to draw any inference to that effect. Indeed, there may well be cases in which it is entirely appropriate for the prosecution to charge one offence in the alternative to the other. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    25 The Applicant alleged that her Honour erred in refusing to order a permanent stay because the proceedings amounted to an abuse of process on the basis that the prosecution was oppressive. A number of authorities were referred to in which reference was made to the court intervening, by means of a stay, when a prosecution creates abuse and injustice.  
     
      
    26 Her Honour rejected the suggestion that there was any such oppression here. Her Honour was correct to do so. Nothing in the nature of oppressive conduct has been suggested in any of the submissions.  
     
      
    27 I have found it difficult to understand some of the propositions advanced on behalf of the Applicant in this respect. One that comes through clearly is the proposition that the material on which reliance is to be placed, as the conduct constituting the offence, was itself the subject of substantive offences for which the Applicant was convicted and sentenced.  
     
      
    28 As Morgan DCJ correctly said, this was not relevant to an oppression submission. The offences to which the Applicant had pleaded guilty constituted a completely different offence to that brought under s474.22. The conduct is not the same. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    29 The final ground advanced is the proposition that s474.22 and s473.4(a) of the Criminal Code are invalid because they are inconsistent with, indeed contrary to, the implied immunity for political communications established by Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997) 189 CLR 520 and Coleman v Power (2004) 220 CLR 7. Particular reference was made to the provisions of s473.4(a) referring to the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults, as one of the matters to be taken into account in determining whether or not a reasonable person would find the relevant depiction or representation to be offensive and, accordingly, satisfy an essential element of the definition of “child abuse material”. 
     
      
    30 It can be accepted that there are parts of the lengthy documents proposed to be tendered in the Crown case which answer the description of debate about political matters. Some part of the material is, accordingly, political communication within the scope of the constitutional immunity. 
     
      
    31 There may well be circumstances in which an attempt to impose “standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults” in the Australian community, and restricting public debate within such confines, will constitute an impermissible burden on political communication. However, in the present statutory framework this is only one matter to which the tribunal of fact is to have regard when determining whether or not a particular depiction or description is, relevantly, of “physical abuse” that occurs in a manner that a reasonable person would regard as “offensive”. This context does not, in my opinion, indicate anything in the nature of an impermissible burden on political communication. 
     
      
    32 Furthermore, as in Holland v The Queen (2005) 30 WAR 231 esp at [100], the constitutional immunity is not infringed because “the direct purpose of the relevant statutory provisions and regulations in the present case is not to restrict or burden political communication as such in a way that would impermissibly restrict the freedom of communication implied from the relevant sections of the Constitution”. The child pornography provisions under consideration in Holland are not relevantly distinguishable. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    33 Accordingly, each of the proposed grounds for appeal are without substance. Her Honour was correct in the exercise of her discretion. Leave under s5F is not readily granted with respect to matters of this character. There is no basis for doing so in the present case. Leave should be refused.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an appeal concerning three counts of an indictment upon which the appellant was convicted following trial before Maguire DCJ and a jury at Campbelltown District Court in August 2004. Sentences imposed by his Honour have expired and the appeal challenges conviction only.  
     
      
    3 The indictment contained eleven counts, two of which pleaded alternatives (counts 6 and 11). Counts 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9 and 11 charged sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900. The alternative to count 6 charged aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) of that Act and the alternative to count 11 charged attempted sexual intercourse with a child under ten years contrary to s 66B. Counts 4, 5, 8, and 10 charged aggravated indecent assault making allegations similar to that comprehended in the alternative charged under count 6.  
     
      
    4 The appellant was found guilty on count 5, on the alternative to count 6 and on count 10, that is on three counts, each charging aggravated indecent assault. He was found not guilty on all other counts. 
     
      
    5 All offences were alleged to have taken place between 11 April and 17 June 2003 in residential premises. These belonged to the complainant’s grandfather and, inter alia, consisted of six bedrooms which were located on upper and lower floors. One bedroom on the upper floor to which was attached an en suite bathroom was occupied by the grandfather and, from time to time, a lady friend of his. Another bedroom on that level was occupied by the complainant’s mother and father and a third bedroom by her four year old brother. The complainant, then aged nine years, occupied a bedroom on the lower floor and, from about November 2002, the appellant, who was a cousin of the complainant’s mother, occupied another bedroom on that lower floor. 
     
      
    6 A bathroom was located on the lower floor which was used by all the occupants with the exception of the grandfather and his friend who had access to the en suite facilities.  
     
      
    7 The bulk of the complainant’s evidence in chief was presented to the jury by the playing of a video interview of her by an officer of the Department of Community Services made on 26 June 2003. The recording was an exhibit in the proceedings which were heard prior to the decision of this Court in Regina v NZ (2005) 63 NSWLR 628. No complaint is made about the admission of the tape into evidence. That tape is no longer available and could not be viewed by this Court and we have been limited to reading a transcript of the interview. 
     
      
    8 It is convenient to mention a further advantage which the jury had and that is that they requested and were taken for a view of the premises. No plan of the premises was tendered but some rough sketches were made by witnesses. There was evidence that there was a defect in the door to the bathroom and that it could not be kept closed. Its juxtaposition with the bedrooms of the appellant and the complainant was canvassed and it can easily be understood why the jury may have considered it desirable to inspect the situation. 
     
      
    9 The challenge to convictions is made on a single ground that they were unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The approach to be adopted by this Court when such a ground is raised is well established and does not require recapitulation: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. The argument by the appellant also touched upon asserted inconsistency between the verdicts of guilty and the verdicts of not guilty on various counts. Again, the principles guiding the approach to be taken are the subject of clear authority: Mackenzie v The Queen (1996) 196 CLR 348. In written submissions on behalf of the appellant it was conceded that the learned trial judge gave the jury a strong direction “as to taking a doubt as to one count in considering the other counts”: R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82. 
     
      
    10 The complainant’s evidence was that the events giving rise to counts 1 to 6 occurred when the appellant entered her room. She located them by reference to the Easter Show in 2003 nominating the night before the visit as the occasion relating to counts 1 and 2, the night of the visit to the Show to counts 3 and 4 and the night following that to counts 5 and 6. She also spoke of other occasions of sexual interference but these were not the subject of charge. All of the other offences charged were described as having taken place in the appellant’s room. 
     
      
    11 In regard to location it should be noted that the evidence was that the appellant, at the urging of the children, frequently engaged in games with them, considerable parts of which took place in his bedroom. The games included hide and seek, and what was described as “blanket roller” which involved rolling the complainant in a blanket whilst she lay on the appellant’s bed and then carrying her and tossing her onto her own bed. The blanket was apparently sometimes also used as a cover in games of hide and seek. 
     
      
    12 It needs to be borne in mind that the descriptions of the alleged offences emanated from a nine year old child. The matter was initially raised by her approaching her mother on Sunday 16 June 2003 when she complained that the appellant had been looking at her while she was in the shower. The mother spoke to the appellant who denied so doing and said he had just been cleaning his room. That there was a defect preventing the bathroom door being securely closed was not a matter of dispute. The next morning, the complainant again spoke to her mother and said that she had not been lying on the previous day and that the appellant had been touching her. In her terms she asserted that he had been touching her “rudey” (vagina). In answer to enquiry she said that the appellant put his hand inside her pants to do so and had done other things described in terms like “he put his tongue on my rudey, sucked on my nipples, played with my bum and stuck his tongue in my mouth”. 
     
      
    13 The appellant was confronted by the mother and she ordered him out of the house. Her evidence was that he originally denied any wrongdoing but when she rejected his protest he acknowledged that he “did it” but did not go too far. He said that he put his fingers in the complainant’s vagina. The mother took the complainant and her brother from the house and directed the appellant to be gone by the time she returned. He complied, taking his belongings with him. Other family members later spoke to the complainant and the following day a report was made to police. Shortly thereafter the interview which became a substantial part of the complainant’s evidence in chief took place.  
     
      
    14 I do not find it necessary to describe the detail of the alleged conduct of the appellant which constituted the charges. It is conceded by counsel for the appellant that, as a matter of law, there is evidence to sustain the counts upon which the appellant was found guilty. That concession is plainly correct.  
     
      
    15 The essential thrust of the challenge on appeal was directed to a demonstration that the credibility of the complainant was so damaged that it would be unsafe to rely upon her testimony which inculpated the appellant. Neither, it was argued, would it be safe to give weight to the admission alleged by the complainant’s mother to have been made by the appellant. 
     
      
    16 It was contended that the credibility of the complainant was undermined by a series of matters and I shall advert to them in the terms in which they were presented. It was submitted that there was no plausible explanation for the delay in complaint. 
     
      
    17 The probable date of the trip to the Easter Show was established as Thursday 23 April and the first incident was said to have occurred on the preceding day. When interviewed on 26 June, the complainant said “He has done it for two months. And I also got too scared to tell my mum, ‘cause, he said, if you tell Mummy I’m going to hate you forever, and that’s all I can remember”. There is a notable coordination between that estimate of two months and the elapsed time between the visit to the Show and the interview. 
     
      
    18 It is necessary to repeat that the jury had a considerable advantage in being able to assess the complainant’s assertions as they saw her make them as depicted on the video. For my part, I find nothing implausible about the reluctance of a child to raise matters of intimacy. It is obvious that she enjoyed participating in the games with her brother and the appellant and it would be scarcely surprising if she was confused by the ambiguity of the appellant’s behaviour, on the one hand as a games companion, and on the other, in his abusive actions upon her. 
     
      
    19 The observation that the complainant was forthright on other occasions does not demonstrate that reticence about these happenings manifests a lack of credibility. 
     
      
    20 The submissions of the appellant refer to the contradiction of the complainant by her mother concerning an occasion of her being exposed to pornography. Although the matter was not extensively explored, it appears that her father kept some material of that nature and she was aware of it being there. Towards the end of the interview (the transcript records questions numbered from 662 onwards) the complainant mentioned that the appellant “Pulled out his rude magazines and his movies” and put them on. She described seeing a naked man and woman and, it appears from the transcript that she gave some demonstration as she said “like that”. She added that once before it had happened (showing a rude video) and her mother had yelled at the appellant and told him never to do that again.  
     
      
    21 The complainant’s mother did not agree with her description of the latter incident insofar it concerned the appellant but she testified that such an incident had happened concerning another male cousin named Brett. The apparent error of identity by the complainant can be accepted but it is not a matter which is, to my mind, fatal to her overall credibility. It appears that such an incident did take place and the error occurred towards what was the end of a very long interview. It was stated by counsel that the video showed that the complainant had a relatively short attention span and she tended to wander from the topic under discussion. A reading of the transcript confirms counsel’s observation.  
     
      
    22 If anything, the contradiction between the complainant and her mother offers some support to the latter’s testimony. The colourful language which she used to dismiss the appellant from the household strongly implied anger towards him for what he was reported to have done but nevertheless she refrained from corroborating the evidence of her daughter on this issue which she would, I expect, have understood could inculpate him. Some criticism was made of the vagueness of the mother’s evidence about what was said from time to time but I gained the impression that it was the mother’s view that her action in ejecting the appellant from the house was self evident demonstration of what had occurred and she regarded the detail of any exchange of words as subsidiary or irrelevant. 
     
      
    23 The fortification of her credibility offered by her declining to corroborate her daughter is not without significance when one comes to consider her allegation that the appellant had, in brief terms, admitted his offending to her. 
     
      
    24 After the report to the police, the complainant was submitted to medical examination. It is common ground that the medical evidence was neutral in the sense of inculpating the appellant, but it may in fact have been of assistance to him in that the doctor detected an anal fissure which could have been caused by a number of things, including infection, constipation, dermatological conditions or even worm infestation. Count 11 was based upon an alleged act of anal penetration or alternatively an attempt so to do, and the complainant agreed that she had not made this complaint until after she learned of the doctor’s finding of the fissure. 
     
      
    25 That late addition of complaint may itself explain the reluctance of the jury to convict on the count but the harbouring of such a doubt does not necessarily translate into a destruction of the credit of the complainant. 
     
      
    26 On this and on the counts alleging sexual intercourse, it is apparent from a question sent by the jury to the trial judge that they were concerned about the concept of requirement that there be proof of penetration. Their deliberations may also have been complicated by trying to apply the notion of penetration to those counts where the allegation was the perpetration of cunnilingus. His Honour did not distinguish those counts when he gave instructions concerning the extent of penetration necessary to sustain a charge of sexual intercourse without consent.  
     
      
    27 The jury note read: 
     
      
       
        
        “In your summary you detailed the difference between sexual intercourse and indecent assault. Can you clarify whether touching vagina is sexual intercourse or only indecent assault or is penetration required?” 
        
       
      
    28 It is noteworthy that in unprompted descriptions, the complainant expressed herself in terms such as saying the appellant had been “rubbing my rudey”. It is true that, when pressed for detail, in a way which I do not suggest was inappropriate for seeking information from a child about such matters, she spoke of his fingers being “inside” but it is reasonable to infer that the high standard of proof required may have been regarded by the jury as having been reached only to the extent of the spontaneous description. 
     
      
    29 If one accepts that proposition, no point would be served in making an item by item comparison or contrast between counts which resulted in acquittal or counts resulted in conviction.  
     
      
    30 Whilst analysis can detect discrepancies in the detail of the complainant’s testimony, the ultimate question requires focus upon the counts upon which the appellant was convicted. There was ample description by the complainant that the appellant was rubbing her nipples (count 5), rubbing her “rudey” (alternative to count 6) and licking her breasts (count 10) occasions upon which the indictment charged indecent assault. In the circumstances abovementioned there is reason for concluding that the evidence of the complainant’s mother concerning the admission by the appellant was reliable. Neither should it escape notice that the appellant, having had communicated to him the cause for his expulsion from the house, offered no resistance nor did he seek to delay his departure. 
     
      
    31 It was not argued by the appellant that the verdicts of guilty were incapable of being consistent with the verdicts of not guilty but it was submitted that the latter verdicts conveyed a doubt about the credibility of the complainant’s testimony. It is open to perception that the jury, when considering those counts, accorded to the appellant the benefit of doubt whenever they thought imperfection might have been revealed. 
     
      
    32 On examination of the transcript of the interview and the evidence at trial, I am unpersuaded that the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable and that the jury ought to have acquitted the appellant on the three counts above identified. 
     
      
    33 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    34 SIMPSON J: I agree with Grove J.

    JUDGMENT1. This is an application by the Crown to cross-examine a witness proposed to be called by the defence. The witness's name is Shane Raymond Downes and he is the brother of the principal Crown witness in the trial. Mr Downes has a criminal record, but all of the entries relate to the Local Court. Most of the entries are the subject of an order under either s 32 or s 33 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. There is one entry for shoplifting in respect of which the witness received a s 9 bond. 2. The Trial Advocate wishes to cross-examine Shane Downes because it was put to his brother, the principal Crown witness, that he had said certain things to Mr Shane Downes. The principal Crown witness denied saying those things. There is, therefore, an issue as to the credibility of the Crown witness. That is a significant issue in the context of this trial. 3. I regard the conviction for shop lifting as being relevant to the credibility of this witness. It was entered in 2005 and I regard it as having substantial probative value and it demonstrates an inclination to be dishonest. 4. I do not regard the other matters as going so much to the witness's credibility because they are not convictions, they are conditional discharges. However, the basis for the discharges in each case must have been findings by the learned magistrate who dealt with these various matters that the person in question had a mental condition, either as a result of a mental illness or some other condition. That, in my opinion, must affect the reliability of this witness. 5. I therefore propose to allow the Crown to cross-examine the witness about his mental condition and the orders which have been entered in relation to these offences. But I will not permit the Crown to specify the matters with which the witness, Shane Downes, had been charged in each case. The cross-examination must proceed in terms of generic references to offences. 6. To that extent I propose to relieve the Crown of compliance of the credibility rule and grant his application under section 103 of the Evidence Act 1995 and also to allow cross-examination on the grounds of reliability.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 BASTEN JA: In this matter the applicant pleaded guilty to four offences in the Local Court at Penrith and was committed for sentence in the District Court. He appeared before Acting Judge Woods and was sentenced on 19 May 2006, having adhered to his pleas of guilty in respect of each offence. 
     
      
    2 The details of the offences and the criminal conduct are set out in the judgment of Grove J, and need not be repeated here. It is sufficient to say that the most serious offence was one of supplying methylamphetamine on an on-going basis, for which the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of three years with an additional term of 18 months. On three further offences he was sentenced to lesser periods and in addition was sentenced for breach of a good behaviour bond. Because all of the sentences imposed were to commence on 19 February 2006, the three lesser sentences and the term for breach of the bond were all subsumed within the largest sentence. 
     
      
    3 As Grove J explains, each of the four sentences involved an additional term which was 50% of the non-parole period. Because his Honour expressly declined to find “special circumstances” for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), each sentence involved a contravention of the requirement of s 44 that the balance of the term must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence. 
     
      
    4 As the Court noted in Singh v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2006] NSWCCA 333, (2006) 164 A Crim R 284 at [52]-[57] there is some awkwardness in the drafting of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As was explained in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, while the sentence is to be “set” in accordance with the statutory prescription, the Court must nevertheless recognise the inter-relationship between factors relevant to determining the minimum mandatory period of imprisonment required to be served by the offender (the non-parole period) and the balance of the term which the offender may have to serve and which will involve constraints on liberty, whether custodial or otherwise: see Way at [108]-[113] and Singh at [54]. 
     
      
    5 Although, as suggested in Singh, the recasting of s 44 by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002 (NSW) changed the emphasis of the section, the primary purpose of the change was to accommodate the new regime of standard non-parole periods: see ss 54A-54D and Attorney-General Debus, Second Reading Speech, NSW Legislative Assembly Hansard, 23 October 2002, p 5816. 
     
      
    6 Section 44(3) provides that a failure to comply with sub-s (2) does not “invalidate” the sentence: nevertheless, there will be an error of law in fixing a balance of the term of the sentence which exceeds one-third of the non-parole period, absent a determination that there are special circumstances. The statutory constraint permits the balance of the term to be less than the prescribed proportion, but not more, absent the finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    7 I agree with Grove J that the challenge to the respective sentences, and to their overall effect, as excessive, should be rejected. Indeed, the fact that there was no element of accumulation for the fourth offence, involving the separate conduct involved in acting with intent to pervert the course of justice, reflects an element of leniency which, though not challenged by the prosecutor, must be taken into account in assessing the proportionality of the overall term of imprisonment. However, once it is accepted that there can be no interference with the non-parole period, the balance of term must accord with the statutory prescription unless special circumstances are found. If they cannot properly be found, the balance must be reduced in each case. As Grove J explains at [33] there was material before the sentencing judge which would have justified a finding of special circumstances, as counsel for the Director acknowledged. It is therefore appropriate that such a finding be made by this Court and I would make such a finding. 
     
      
    8 The error in this case is not merely a disagreement with the reasoning of the trial judge, nor an inference that the trial judge failed to consider some particular issue (such as “special circumstances”) which appeared to be raised on the evidence: see Astill (No. 2) (1992) 64 A Crim R 289. This case is closer to, but not on all-fours with, Regina v Oastler (unrep, 2 November 1992, NSWCCA) in which Gleeson CJ characterized the errors in “some of the steps involved in the process of reasoning” by the sentencing judge as involving “some misapprehension on his Honour’s part as to the effect of the relevant legislation”. Rather this was a case in which the sentencing judge made an order which could not properly be made without a specific finding. Nevertheless, the making of that finding now provides the basis for the sentences imposed by the District Court. As I agree with Grove J that no “other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed”, there is no occasion to resentence the applicant: Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(3). The appropriate order is therefore that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    9 For these reasons, I too would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    10 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Woods ADCJ at Dubbo District Court. The applicant had pleaded guilty at Penrith Local Court to four charges and in the District Court adhered to those pleas. The first three charges were offences contrary to the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, namely supplying a prohibited drug (0.94 grammes of methylamphetamine); supplying a prohibited drug (4 grammes of cannabis) and supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis (methylamphetamine). The maximum prescribed penalties, excluding possible fines, for these offences were fifteen, ten and twenty years imprisonment respectively. The fourth charge consisted of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the prescribed maximum penalty was fourteen years imprisonment. 
     
      
    11 It will be necessary to examine how his Honour approached his assessment but his impositions were expressed as a non-parole period of two years six months and a total term of three years nine months on the first charge; a non-parole period of two years and a total term of three years on the second charge; a non-parole period of three years and a total term of four years and six months on the third charge and a non-parole period of two years and a total term of three years on the fourth charge. All sentences and non-parole periods were directed to commence on 19 February 2006 and hence all sentences were to be served concurrently. The effective enveloping term was that imposed on the third charge. His Honour stated that “the prisoner is to be released on parole on 18 February 2009”, however, as the term exceeds three years that date should have been specified as the earliest date of eligibility for parole: s 48 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act).  
     
      
    12 The sentences were imposed on 19 May 2006 and his Honour established the commencement date to take into account ninety two days of custody referrable to these offences. The appellant had, after arrest in May 2005, been required to serve a sentence of nine months imprisonment for driving whilst disqualified. His Honour was also asked to deal with a call-up of the appellant for breach of a recognizance to be of good behaviour. The circumstances surrounding this were these. On 9 April 2003 in Mudgee Local Court he was sentenced to imprisonment for three months for the offence of affray. On appeal to the Dubbo District Court on 19 June 2003 the sentence was quashed and in lieu thereof the appellant was required to enter a bond pursuant to s 9 of the Sentencing Act to be of good behaviour for twelve months. During the currency of the bond he was convicted of a number of offences at Mudgee Local Court. His Honour found the breach proved and reimposed the sentence of three months imprisonment for the original offence ordering it to commence on 19 May 2006 which would, he noted, result in it being entirely subsumed within the sentences on the four charges. 
     
      
    13 A lengthy agreed statement of facts was tendered. For present purposes its contents can be summarized. In September 2004 a police task force (“Clearwater”) was formed “to investigate the large scale drug distribution and supply network” by the appellant and his brother Darren. At the time the appellant was living (with his partner and child) with his mother at her home in Mudgee. They moved to an address in Penrith where they took over the tenancy from a friend. The supplies of drugs were made from those premises. 
     
      
    14 Pursuant to authority, on 15 December 2004 an undercover police operative attended the address and negotiated with the appellant for the purchase of amphetamine and cannabis. The appellant extracted some of the former from a larger amount which was in a freezer and transferred it into a smaller bag and obtained the cannabis from a kitchen drawer, again transferring an amount into a smaller foil from a larger container. The operative paid for the drugs and took them to be analysed. Charges 1 and 2 relate to these supplies. 
     
      
    15 On 10th, 11th and 18th February 2005 similar supplies were made by the appellant consisting of 0.75 grammes, 3.3 grammes and 3.11 grammes of methylamphetamine. On every occasion the appellant measured the amounts by use of a set of scales. These three supplies constituted the ongoing supply, the subject of charge 3.  
     
      
    16 The call-up for breach of bond is described above. The matter had come coincidentally before Woods ADCJ at Dubbo District Court on 7 December 2004. A letter was tendered in those proceedings purporting to be authored by John Clarke of Clarke’s Bricklaying, 11 Soper Place, St. Marys, Telephone: 0404 327 887. Police enquiries located no such person or business. The address is fictitious. The telephone number is a mobile service which was then being used by the appellant’s brother. Pursuant to warrant, telephone interceptions were made, the product of which included participation by the appellant in conversation with his brother about arranging a letter demonstrating that he had gainful employment as a bricklayer as well as another call by his brother to the appellant’s solicitor, in which he purported to be one John Clarke, who was providing an employment reference letter. Further intercepts confirmed the steps which were being taken to implement the deceit. Charge 4 reflected this activity. 
     
      
    17 The written submissions of the appellant expressed two grounds namely: 
     
      
       
      (i) The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, 
       
      (ii) His Honour erred in not finding special circumstances. 
       
      
    18 The notice of appeal was more explicit, namely: 
     
      
       
      “1. His Honour did not comply with s44 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
      
     
     
      
      2. His Honour failed to accord appropriate weight to the concession by the Crown that these offences fall into the lower end of the medium range for offences of this kind. 
      
     
     
      
      3. His Honour did not find special circumstances.” 
       
      
    19 Section 44 of the Sentencing Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Court to set non-parole period 
        
       
       
        
        44 (1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
        
       
       
        
         (2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision). 
        
       
       
        
         (3) The failure of a court to comply with subsection (2) does not invalidate the sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        ………….. ” 
        
       
      
    20 In his Honour’s remarks on sentence he stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the drug offences, considering all the factors noted above and the seriousness of the offences in the eyes of the community and the guidelines laid down by the Courts and sentencing statistics, I find that after making full allowance for the pleas of guilty I find that appropriate periods of actual non-parole custody for this offender would be 2 years 6 months for the supply of amphetamines, 2 years for the supply of cannabis, 3 years for the ongoing supply. 
        
       
       
        
        For the offence of pervert the course of justice an appropriate penalty is 2 years non-parole custody after allowance for the plea of guilty.” 
        
       
      
    21 He then proceeded to find that “there is no room for any consideration of special circumstances in relation to the non-parole period” and imposed the sentences in the terms above set out. As noted, he ordered that all sentences be served concurrently which conclusion he said he had reached “having considered the principle of totality”.  
     
      
    22 If the total sentences imposed by his Honour are expressed in terms of non-parole period and balance terms they are, respectively: on charge 1, a non-parole period of two years six months and balance term of one year three months; on charge 2, a non-parole period of two years and balance term of one year; on charge 3, a non-parole period of three years and balance term of one year six months and on charge 4, a non-parole period of two years and a balance term of one year. 
     
      
    23 In every instance the balance term exceeds one third of the non-parole period. The appellant argued that, as his Honour had rejected special circumstances, the explanation for this would be perceived in an arithmetical error in computing the balance terms to be added to the non-parole periods in order to reach the total terms which his Honour expressed.  
     
      
    24 In reference to s 44, this Court in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 observed at p 190: 
     
      
       
        
        “In substance, the section specifies the sequence in which the sentence was to be set, focussing upon the period which was considered appropriate to be served by way of a minimum period of actual imprisonment, followed by the period for a potential supervised release on parole. 
        
       
       
        
        While there are separate considerations involved for s 44(2) of the Act, they need not be regarded as involving a two-step or sequential process since, as Spigelman CJ pointed out in  
        R v Hampton 
         (1998) 44 NSWLR 729, the relevant steps can be taken simultaneously.” 
        
       
      
    25 In fixing a non-parole period under the section it is impermissible to determine that period and then independently to determine the balance of the term of the sentence by considering whether (or not) there are special circumstances so as to depart from the statutory relationship: R v Perez [2004] NSWCCA 218. 
     
      
    26 It is not clear whether his Honour implemented an impermissible approach but there is inconsistency between his rejection of a finding of special circumstances and the proportions between balance terms and non-parole periods. I am, however, unpersuaded that a consequence of that observation is that this Court should simply reduce the balance terms to the equivalent of one third of the non-parole periods. As I shall return to consider in the context of this case, the exercise of the power of the Court to intervene is dependent upon a conclusion that some less severe sentence is warranted in law: Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(3). 
     
      
    27 It is contended that the effective sentence of four years six months with a non-parole period of three years is within the higher range for offences of this kind and “not consistent with the Crown concession” and the objective criminality. In a written submission to the District Court the Crown Prosecutor had stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “As the persons at whom s 25A is directed are those who appear to be participating in a practise (sic) or business of supplying prohibited drugs, it is also relevant to consider the magnitude of the operation for the supply of drugs. Whilst the quantities of drug supplied were relatively small it is submitted that the offender operated a commercial business of supplying methylamphetamine on an ongoing basis. He obtained the drug, was directly involved in the transaction to purchase the drug and actually supplied the drug and received the money. It is submitted that the objective criminality of his offending falls within the lower end of the middle of the range.” 
        
       
      
    28 That statement was focussed particularly upon charge 3. Not only is the magnitude of the operation relevant but the seriousness of the offence should be gauged against that magnitude rather than against the quantities of the drugs involved: cf R v Kairouz [2005] NSWCCA 247. 
     
      
    29 In the present case, the supplies extended over a period of more than two months and as the agreed facts recounted, what was under investigation was a large scale drug distribution and supply network.  
     
      
    30 Were this Court to come to the question of resentence, it would be necessary to consider the appropriateness of ordering the sentence for the offence of acting with intent to pervert the course of justice to be served concurrently with the offences on charges 1, 2 and 3. In my view, at least some element of cumulation would be demanded. 
     
      
    31 Reference can be had to published Judicial Commission statistics and they do show that the enveloping sentence is towards the higher range of impositions for one count of ongoing supply by an offender with prior convictions of the same type. The appellant has a considerable record of prior convictions including a sentence of four months imprisonment for supplying a prohibited drug which was imposed at Mudgee Local Court in May 2004. It is necessary to bear in mind that the appellant is sentenced for additional matters including the entirely separate offence arising out of the production of the false employment letter. The concession by the Crown Prosecutor in the District Court bound neither his Honour nor this Court, but should be viewed in the context of its particular reference to the offence of ongoing supply and the other drug offences. 
     
      
    32 The challenge to his Honour’s rejection of the submission that he should find special circumstances is in a sense rendered moot by the contradictory result that all sentences, including the enveloping sentence, divide the total term so that the period during which the appellant may be on parole exceeds one third of the minimum time in custody. 
     
      
    33 In the District Court, the Crown Prosecutor had acknowledged that there was support for a finding of special circumstances in the relatively young age of the appellant, then twenty seven years, and the need for rehabilitation from his drug and alcohol addictions. Whilst his Honour was not bound to find special circumstances it is, in my view, appropriate to consider his actual impositions which are consistent with such a finding in making an assessment as to whether, in the application of proper principle and authorized approach to determination, it should be concluded that some less severe sentence is warranted in law. 
     
      
    34 Taking account of the magnitude of the operation, the absence of a good prior record attracting leniency, the independent criminality in the commission of the offence constituting charge 4 and the benefit flowing to the appellant from the order for concurrency, it is my conclusion that no less severe sentence is warranted in law.  
     
      
    35 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    36 HOWIE J: I agree with Grove J.

    3 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court. The only ground argued in support of the application is the alleged disparity between the sentences imposed upon the applicant and those imposed upon a co-offender, Woolhouse. The same Judge sentenced both the applicant and Woolhouse but on different occasions. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was sentenced in June 2006 and the co-offender in October of that year. They were each before the District Court for the same four offences, being the break and enter of, and stealing from, commercial premises in 2002 and 2004. The applicant received sentences totalling 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years. Woolhouse received sentences totalling 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months, being effectively an increase in sentences currently being served of 2 years with a non-parole period of 12 months. The lesser sentence imposed upon Woolhouse was notwithstanding that he was before the court for more offences than the applicant, had matters of significant aggravation not present in the applicant’s case, and had a worse record. 
     
      
    5 The applicant and Woolhouse were professional thieves who had embarked on a course of stealing from commercial premises in the Hunter Region whenever the opportunity arose to do so in 2002 and 2004. They were both serving prison terms in 2003, which accounts for their being crime-free in that year. As a result of these two episodes of criminality, as well as the four offences for which he was to be sentenced, the applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account 44 matters on a Form 1. These matters included 24 offences of break, enter and steal, 14 offences of break and enter with intent to steal and 6 offences of larceny of a motor vehicle. The monetary value of the applicant’s offending was just over $300,000. 
     
      
    6 The applicant is aged 36 years and has a criminal record for offences of dishonesty dating from 1982 in the Children’s Court. In 1996 he was sentenced for armed robbery to a minimum term of 4 years 6 months. In 2003 he was sentenced in the Local Court to 9 months imprisonment for an offence of break and enter with intent. A psychological report before the sentencing judge disclosed that the applicant left school at the age of 14 and thereafter had undertaken a number of unskilled or labouring positions. He had spent about 8 years of his life in custody. He has used drugs from an early age and was addicted to amphetamine apart from a period between 1987 and the mid 1990’s when he was in a permanent and stable relationship. He also developed an addiction to gambling. The psychologist considered that he needed general counselling and perhaps medication because of his apparent attention deficit disorder. 
     
      
    7 The applicant’s counsel accepted before this Court that the sentence imposed upon his client was within range and that there was no error apparent in the sentencing remarks. A complaint of disparity accepts that the sentence imposed on the applicant cannot be challenged. It is the sentence imposed upon a co-offender that gives rise to a sense of injustice, not the sentence imposed upon the applicant. The applicant also accepts that the Court’s power to intervene to redress disparity is discretionary and that it will not necessarily act where the co-offender’s sentence is so inadequate that this Court should not take it into account. The latest statement of this principle is to be found in the judgment of Johnson J in R v Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114 in which his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Where there is a degree of disparity so as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, it is not necessary for the Court of Criminal Appeal to intervene if the result of doing so is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved: R v Boney [2001] NSWCCA 432 at [15]. A stage can be reached at which the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is so great that the sense of grievance engendered can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one: R v Diamond (Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 February 1993, unreported, BC9302054); R v Boney, above, at [16].” 
        
       
      
    8 In order to explain, but without seeking to justify, the extraordinary difference between the overall sentence imposed upon the applicant and that imposed upon Woolhouse it is necessary to refer to the history leading up to the charging of the applicant with these offences in June 2005. Police became aware that Woolhouse’s DNA was found at some of the sites of the break and enters. Police spoke to him in December 2004 and he denied the offences. However, in January 2005 he informed police that he was prepared to assist them and as a result informed them of offences he had committed in 2002 and 2004. He also nominated the applicant as his co-offender. When police spoke to the applicant he denied the offences. Woolhouse agreed to have his conversations with the applicant recorded by the police whereby it was hoped that the applicant would make admissions to the offences. This eventuated and, when police confronted the applicant with the recordings, he admitted his offending including some of which the police were unaware. 
     
      
    9 Woolhouse was before the District Court for the same four offences as the applicant but in addition asked the court to take into account 68 matters on a Form 1 including 33 offences of break, enter and steal, 17 offences of break and enter with intent and 11 offences of stealing or attempting to steal motor vehicles. Woolhouse was 43 years of age and had a lengthy criminal record dating from 1982. He was first sentenced to imprisonment in 1991 for offences of dishonesty and thereafter was repeatedly before the courts for matters of dishonesty and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. Eventually he was released to parole in February 2004 and recommenced offending until he was returned to custody in June 2004. He has since that time remained in prison serving various sentences. Woolhouse’s criminality resulted in a monetary loss in excess of $400,000. 
     
      
    10 With respect, the overall sentence imposed upon Mr Woolhouse is so manifestly inadequate as to amount to an affront to those persons who were his victims, some of whom suffered very substantial monetary loss either through unrecovered property or in damage caused during the course of the offences. The sentence imposed was a result of discounts granted to the applicant for assistance to police notwithstanding that on its face there has been clear breach of the injunction against excessive discounting contained in s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as the sentence imposed is “disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence”. There is no reference to the existence of this restriction on a court’s discretion to grant discounts in the sentencing remarks. 
     
      
    11 Not only in my view is the sentence unreasonable, the sentencing remarks reveal a number of errors of principle leading to that result. Yet remarkably there has been no Crown appeal. I accept that the Director of Public Prosecutions has a wide discretion in respect of lodging appeals, but it is difficult to imagine what might have stayed the Director’s hand if this matter had come to his attention. 
     
      
    12 The manner in which the Judge appears to have derived the sentences he imposed upon Woolhouse was as follows. He commenced with an undisclosed notional starting sentence for each offence from which he deducted 25 per cent for the plea. In relation to counts 1, 2 and 4 he then deducted a further 50 per cent for what he described as “an Ellis type discount” and from the resulting figure a further 50 per cent was deducted for other assistance to police. As I understand it, although the remarks do not make it clear, in relation to Count 3, from the notional starting sentence the Judge deducted 25 per cent for the plea and then a further 50 per cent for assistance. 
     
      
    13 For example, for count 1 a fixed term of 6 months was imposed for an offence involving the theft of over $25,000 worth of property where Woolhouse was clearly the principal offender. Trying to understand what notional starting point resulting ultimately in a fixed term sentence is difficult, but working back according to the methodology used by his Honour it appears to be a fixed term of 5 years and 4 months. 
     
      
    14 Quite frankly I fail to understand how the revelation of more criminality can result in a marked reduction in the sentences for offences for which there was evidence against the offender. The police had evidence of 17 matters against Woolhouse. Yet by revealing a further 61 matters Mr Woolhouse’s overall sentence for those 17 matters was reduced to a minor fraction of what the sentence should have been. That is not how I understand that the principle deduced from the decision in Ellis applies. True it is that some leniency was to be given to Woolhouse for his voluntary confession of unknown criminality to police in circumstances where they had evidence of his involvement in similar offences. But, with respect, to describe, as the Judge did, that conduct warranting an “Ellis type discount” and one “close to the maximum” is to overemphasise the nature of Woolhouse’s assistance and to misconceive the effect of the decision in Ellis. 
     
      
    15 R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 was a quite exceptional case where a person who had committed seven armed robberies confessed his involvement in those offences to a minister of religion and then to police in circumstances where the police had not the slightest suspicion of his involvement in any of them. Street CJ, after referring to the effects of a plea of guilty, stated at 604: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision. Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence. 
         
         
        The leniency that follows a confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned."" 
         
        
       
      
    16 Another case where such leniency has been given very significant weight was R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349. There the offender voluntarily walked into a police station and confessed to the manslaughter of a woman some ten years after the event and at a time when there was no chance of his guilt being discovered. Yet this Court held, allowing a Crown appeal, that a sentence commensurate with the objective seriousness of the offence had to be imposed notwithstanding the leniency to which the offender was entitled. 
     
      
    17 There is no decision of this Court that I have been able to discover where a separate quantified discount has been applied under the Ellis principle even where quantified discounts were allowed for the plea and other assistance. In Ryan v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 267 McHugh J stated (footnotes omitted):  
     
      
       
        
         
        [15] ………………..The statement in Ellis that “the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency” is a statement of a general principle or perhaps more accurately of a factor to be taken into account. It is not the statement of a rule to be quantitatively, rigidly or mechanically applied. It is an indication that, in determining the appropriate sentence, the disclosure of what was an unknown offence is a significant and not an insubstantial matter to be considered on the credit side of the sentencing process. How significant depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.” 
        
       
      
    18 Although the leniency referred to in these decisions extends to those cases where the offender volunteers additional criminality otherwise unknown to the police, the extent of the leniency will obviously not be of the same significance as in those cases where the police are unaware of any criminal offences committed by the offender. It is a matter of degree. In some cases the known criminality might be so great that little leniency can be shown for the further offences revealed by the offender. That was so in the case of the present applicant. There was in my opinion no warrant to apply any mathematic reduction to Woolhouse’s sentences by reason of his disclosure of unknown criminality, let alone a discount of the proportion that was allowed. 
     
      
    19 It has been stated that too mathematical an approach to sentencing by using discrete discounts for various factors is likely to result in error. One of the reasons is because of the considerable overlap that occurs between various factors. This is particularly so with the Ellis principle because the voluntary confession of criminality will be relevant to other, more general considerations such as the prospects of rehabilitation and the likelihood of further offending which themselves are mitigating factors under s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In any event it has been made clear that there is a limit to the extent to which a sentence can be discounted for whatever reason in order to avoid a sentence that is manifestly inadequate: see SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19. In that case it was held that a discount of more than 50 percent for both plea and assistance should be reserved for an exceptional case. 
     
      
    20 In SZ, with the concurrence of Simpson J, and in reference to separate discounts for the plea and assistance, I stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “[11] In my opinion the application of two discrete discounts, as was done in the present case, is liable to lead to error unless the court is conscious of the overall discount being given and considers whether a discount of that degree can result in a sentence that does not infringe s 23(3). An overall discount of more than 60%, however derived, will rarely, if ever, result in a sentence that is not manifestly inadequate. If then special circumstances are found and the non-parole period is reduced to say 50% of the overall sentence, the unreasonableness of the sentence is magnified. It should be borne in mind that a discount in the overall sentence will inevitably result in a discount of the non-parole period. This is why it is important to avoid doubt counting in cases of assistance by finding special circumstances for the very same reasons that the sentence was reduced: R v S (2000) 111 A Crim R 225; R v PG (2001) 122 A Crim R 529.” 
        
       
      
    21 The total discounts that were applied in the present case, at least for counts 1, 2 and 4, totalled 82 per cent based upon the method described by his Honour. The Judge then found special circumstances so that the non-parole period was less than 75 per cent of the head sentence. In the case of the longest sentence it was 50 per cent. In respect of count 4 the non-parole period was 6 months. This was about 6 per cent of the assumed notional starting sentence of 8 years. 
     
      
    22 There are further errors of principle in the sentencing of Woolhouse that need not be considered in such detail. For example, notwithstanding that counts 3 and 4 were committed while Woolhouse was on parole after his release from prison in 2004, the sentences were made concurrent with those on the first two counts which were committed in 2002. The Judge also took into account, apparently as a matter of mitigation, that many of the offences could have been dealt with on earlier occasions that Woolhouse was before the District Court notwithstanding that the applicant’s guilt had not been revealed at the time of those hearings. If this was thought to be the application of the principle referred to in cases such as R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517, then, with respect, the Judge was mistaken. That case was not dealing with delay caused by the fact that the applicant had chosen not to reveal his criminality for other offences: Chang v R [2006] NSWCCA 409. The only significance of the fact that offences could have been dealt with on some prior occasion had they been known was to ensure that the offender did not incur a heavier sentence than appropriate by separate sentencing proceedings for related offences. 
     
      
    23 Further, in applying the principle of totality, the Judge thought that it was appropriate to reflect the additional criminality before him by an extension of the sentence then being served by Woolhouse by an increase in the head sentence of 2 years and an increase in the non-parole period of 12 months. Yet this increase reflected what were in effect 54 additional break and enter offences, a number of which were committed while Woolhouse was on parole. In my respectful opinion that result is an affront to the community and tends to bring the criminal justice system into disrespect. 
     
      
    24 I have taken some time to consider, critically, the sentences imposed upon Woolhouse to show that the disparity between the sentences to be served by the applicant and those imposed upon Woolhouse cannot be justified as a result of the proper application of sentencing principles. But there is a further significant error in the Judge’s approach to sentencing Woolhouse that has direct application to the present complaint. 
     
      
    25 In sentencing Woolhouse the Judge referred to the sentence imposed upon the applicant and then stated “no question of parity arises” as between the applicant and Woolhouse. This was because of the discounts that were to be applied in Woolhouse’s case. With respect that statement was erroneous. A question of parity will always arise where two offenders are before the court for the same offence. It may be that in applying proper sentencing principles or because of differences in their criminality or subjective factors different sentences are justified. But a court cannot completely disregard the sentences imposed upon a co-offender, as his Honour appears to have done. This is made perfectly clear by the majority of the High Court in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295. There Dawson and Gaudron JJ stated (at 302-301) 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality………..” 
        
       
      
    26 For example, it would be expected that the notional starting sentence before the application of discounts for any of the offences should bear “due proportion” between the two offenders. In the present case, to take count 1 for example, both Woolhouse and the applicant were to be sentenced for the same offence. The Judge found that Woolhouse’s record was more serious than that of the applicant and was an aggravating factor under s 21A(2). Further Woolhouse was on conditional liberty at the time of offending. It would reasonably be expected that the notional starting sentence for that offence would be greater in the case of Woolhouse than for the applicant. 
     
      
    27 But that does not appear to be so. In the applicant’s case the notional starting sentence was the equivalent of a non-parole period of 4 years. But in the case of Woolhouse it was the equivalent of a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months. There was no basis for such a discrepancy or that it should be in favour of Woolhouse. Similarly on the fourth count the notional starting sentence for the applicant was apparently an equivalent of a non-parole period of 4 years 8 months but in the case of Woolhouse, who was on parole at the time of the offending, the notional starting sentence was one of 8 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 8 months. Had the Judge maintained regard for parity when sentencing Woolhouse, as he should have done, he could not have started from such disparate notional sentences. 
     
      
    28 Quite sensibly counsel for the applicant appreciated that the sentencing exercise in respect of Woolhouse had so miscarried that this Court could not in conscience reduce the applicant’s sentence to anything approaching the sentence imposed upon his co-offender. Initially he submitted that it would be appropriate to adjust the applicant’s sentences by using the notional starting sentences in the case of Woolhouse. But as should be apparent from what I have already written, even if they can be ascertained, the notional starting sentences in the present case are unreliable guides for achieving a proper proportion between the sentences imposed upon these two co-offenders. 
     
      
    29 As an alternative, the applicant’s counsel submitted that the Court should adjust the sentences to the lowest point within the available range. He submitted that, using the decision of this Court in R v Grube [2005] NSWCCA 140 as a guide, the Court might reduce the applicant’s overall sentences to one of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. In Grube the applicant received an overall sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years for 57 offences of break, enter and steal, 35 of those being on a Form 1. 
     
      
    30 Notwithstanding an acknowledgment by the Crown that the sentence suggested by the applicant’s counsel might be at the bottom of the range, I am not satisfied that such a sentence is appropriate in this case in light of all the material relevant to the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending and having regard to his relatively poor subjective circumstances. There was little in his favour apart from the pleas of guilty. However, some adjustment should be made to the sentences imposed upon the applicant although otherwise unwarranted. 
     
      
    31 This is a very exceptional case and the result of this appeal should not be taken in any way to alter the principles that have generally been applied by this Court when dealing with a question of disparity arising from a manifestly inadequate sentence imposed upon a co-offender. But the disparity here is so gross and so unreasonable that it seems to me that this Court must intervene to ameliorate the sentence imposed upon the applicant to some degree otherwise there would be a strong sense that justice has not ultimately been achieved. The result is an unfortunate one that will not result in full justice to the victims of the applicant’s and his co-offender’s crimes or to the community generally. 
     
      
    32 In considering what sentence ought now to be imposed upon the applicant I have taken into account material placed before this Court for the purpose of re-sentencing him. There was an affidavit of the applicant indicating his classification in the prison system and his prospects of improving his classification if the sentence were reduced. It also refers to courses and work being undertaken by the applicant in custody and other matters relating to his personal situation. There is also an affidavit annexing various documents obtained on the applicant’s behalf from his prison file indicating his commitment to work in the gaol and his generally good behaviour. 
     
      
    33 The overall sentence I propose is not one derived by the application of any mathematical approach to the sentences imposed upon the co-offender. Nor is the sentence I propose based upon some notional starting point from which a discount of 25 per cent has been deducted. It should provide no guide to what would be an appropriate sentence for a similar offender with such a multitude of serious offences. It is a sentence that seeks to relieve to a small, but significant, degree the justifiable grievance occasioned to the applicant who has to serve a sentence six and half years longer than the period to be served by the co-offender before being eligible for release notwithstanding that he was before the court for less criminality. Had the Judge approached the sentencing of the two offenders in a principled way, and with due regard to the question of parity, he could not have permitted such a result to occur. 
     
      
    34 The overall sentence I propose is one of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months. I have found special circumstances only to achieve parity by reducing the non-parole period below that which would otherwise be appropriate and because the sentence for Count 3 is cumulative on counts 1 and 2: see Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398. There are fixed terms for Counts 1 and 4 because of the other sentences being imposed. 
     
      
    35 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. Grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. 
         
         
        2. Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court and in lieu impose the following sentences: 
         
          
           
          (i) Count 1: Imprisonment for 18 months fixed term from 10 April 2006 to expire 9 October 2007. 
           
           
          (ii) Count 2 (and matters on Form 1): Imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to date from 10 April 2006. The non-parole period is to expire on 9 October 2010. 
           
           
          (iii) Count 3: Imprisonment for 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 12 months to date from 10 October 2010. The non-parole period is to expire on 9 October 2011, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
           
           
          (iv) Count 4: Imprisonment for 12 months fixed term to commence on 10 October 2010 and to expire on 9 October 2011.

     COURTNEY v. REGINA 
     
     
      
      The appellant was charged with assault with intent to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon and robbery whilst similarly armed. In each case the victim was a woman who was alone in a public place and the weapon was a knife. The offences occurred in January 2001 and the appellant was arrested in that month, a current order for parole was revoked and she commenced to serve the balance of that parole. 
       
       
      In June 2002 the appellant was found unfit to be tried for these offences and a special hearing was directed which took place in March 2004. Following findings of proof of the commission of the offences on the limited evidence, concurrent limiting terms of five years were imposed to commence at the expiry of the balance of parole (18 December 2002) with the terms themselves to expire on 17 December 2007. 
       
       
      As a forensic patient the appellant has been reviewed from time to time by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. She is assessed as at severe risk of self harm and harm to others. She has remained in prison detention, it being found by the Tribunal that there is no hospital capable of accommodating her because of her ongoing problems of violence. 
       
       
      An application for extension of time to apply for leave to appeal against sentence was lodged in April 2007. 
       
       
      Held 
       (by the Court): The extension of time should be granted. 
       
       
      Affidavit evidence detailing the circumstances of the appellant’s custody since the fixing of the limiting term for the purpose of seeking to establish error should be rejected. 
       
       
      (Per Basten JA, dissenting): The sentencing judge erred in holding that although the appellant was not a suitable vehicle for reflection of general deterrence, “more specific consideration” should be given to the question of specific deterrence. It was not clear how his Honour took into account that the appellant was not fully aware of the consequences of her actions because of her disabilities. Imprisonment is unlikely to have any effect on the behaviour of the appellant and her moral culpability is limited. The limiting terms should be set aside and, given the exigencies of the situation, limiting terms of four years and nine months expiring on 17 September 2007 should be imposed. 
       
       
      (Per Grove J): Identified procedural irregularities were of no relevant consequence. In his reference to “specific consideration” to specific deterrence, his Honour was saying no more than that it should have particular attention when general deterrence was an inappropriate factor. There was no indication that undue weight was given to personal deterrence and his Honour committed no error. 
       
       
      Remarks that were made to the appellant describing the regime of review by the Tribunal to which the appellant would be subject did not demonstrate erroneous formulation of terms on an assumption that the appellant would not be in gaol for the entirety of them. 
       
       
      There was no failure to adhere to the principle of totality. The requirement for protection of the public was properly given significant weight. The grounds of appeal are not made out and the appeal should be dismissed. 
       
       
      (Per Howie J): There was error by the sentencing judge referring to the need for personal deterrence because it is obvious that it would have no effect. 
       
       
      The appellant required detention because she presented a danger to society. The offences were serious and, even if error were established, no lesser terms should have been imposed. They were proportionate to the objective criminality and necessary for the protection of the public.

     LISA MICHELLE COURTNEY v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: The problems faced by the courts in dealing with people who are mentally ill and prone to violent behaviour are perennial and to an extent intractable. If a person’s mental condition at the time of an offence is sufficiently serious to constitute insanity, the person cannot be properly dealt with by the criminal justice system, in relation to crimes which involve intentional acts. Where a person is unfit to plead, he or she should not be submitted to a trial in criminal proceedings. In each case, the imposition of punishment, being the usual outcome of conviction for a criminal offence, is inappropriate. Nevertheless, one function of the criminal justice system, namely to protect the community from violent individuals, remains apposite. 
     
      
    2 Where, as in the case of the present applicant, a person is found to be unfit to be tried, the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (NSW) requires a “special hearing” at which “the question whether a person has committed an offence” is to be determined: Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, s 19(2). Section 23 then provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        23 Procedure after completion of special hearing 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) If, following a special hearing, it is found on the limited evidence available that an accused person committed the offence charged or some other offence available as an alternative, the Court: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence which the person is found to have committed, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) where the Court would have imposed such a sentence, must nominate a term, in this section referred to as  
            a limiting term 
            , in respect of that offence, being the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) If a Court indicates that it would not have imposed a sentence of imprisonment in respect of a person, the Court may impose any other penalty or make any other order it might have made on conviction of the person for the relevant offence in a normal trial of criminal proceedings. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) Any such other penalty imposed or order made, under subsection (2), is to be subject to appeal in the same manner as a penalty or order in a normal trial of criminal proceedings.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    3 Since the nomination of a limiting term by the primary judge, the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act has been amended by the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Amendment Act 2005 (NSW), Schedule 1 [14], so as to replace sub-s (5) and add sub-s (6), in relation to the identification of a commencement date with respect to a limiting term. These amendments, had they been in force at the relevant time, would not have affected the back-dating undertaken by the primary judge, nor do they have any different effect now, should this Court nominate a fresh limiting term. 
     
      
    4 In the present case, a limiting term was nominated by the primary judge in the District Court. The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 2(1) defines “Sentence” to mean, amongst other orders,  
     
      
       
        
        “(d) any order made by the court of trial imposing a limiting term of imprisonment on a person under section 23(1) of the  
        Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 
        , and any other order or penalty made or imposed by the court of trial in respect of the person under section 23(2) of that Act.” 
        
       
      
    5 The circumstances of the present case are set out by Grove J. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that on 7 May 2004 the primary judge fixed a limiting term of 5 years in respect of each of the two offences, to run concurrently, and to date from 18 December 2002, being the day after the expiry of her previous sentences, including the balance of a term for which parole was revoked, as a result of the conduct the subject of the present indictment. That term will expire on 17 December 2007. 
     
      
    6 The fact that some four and a half years of the term has already expired is due to two circumstances. The first is the back-dating for a period of some 17 months. The second is that an application for leave to appeal was not filed until 26 April 2007. 
     
      
       
      Extension of time 
      
    7 There is a large and no doubt growing body of caselaw expressing the reluctance of this Court to grant extensions of time where applications are seriously delayed, absent exceptional circumstances: the authorities were conveniently summarized in R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275 at [31]-[50] (Smart AJ, Studdert and Dunford JJ agreeing). Without departing from the principles established in that line of authority, a different approach may be required in relation to a person who has been found unfit to plead due to mental illness or disability. For the reasons given by Grove J the applicant should be granted an extension of time within which to file her notice of application for leave to appeal until 27 April 2006. 
     
      
       
      Further evidence 
      
    8 In Regina v Ehrenburg (unrep, 14 December 1990) this Court noted that evidence of events subsequent to the imposition of a sentence are “ordinarily irrelevant”: p 5. Loveday J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Samuels JA agreed, continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “One circumstance that can make them relevant is if the subsequent events make known or explain something that was either unknown or not fully appreciated at the time of sentencing. An example of this is where a prisoner is sentenced not knowing that he is suffering from AIDS. The subsequent diagnosis means that his period in custody will cause him additional hardship.” 
        
       
      
    9 In Rigby v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 205 at [72] Kirby J (Studdert and Johnson JJ agreeing) held that further material could be admitted if it satisfied the tests of “fresh evidence”, which was relevant to the circumstances at the time of sentence, the absence of which was not due to lack of diligence on the part of the applicant’s legal representatives. 
     
      
    10 In considering the relevance of further evidence on appeal, it is helpful to note the purpose for which it is sought to be introduced. If that purpose is to demonstrate error on the part of the sentencing judge, it will not usually be relevant. On the other hand, where it is tendered in order to assist this Court in resentencing an offender, once error has been identified, relevance may well be established. I would not admit evidence concerning the circumstances of the applicant, as they arose after the fixing of the limiting term, for the purposes of establishing error. 
     
      
    11 A further difficulty arises in relation to the tender of the evidence for the purpose of exercising the statutory discretion afresh. If that exercise becomes necessary, as I believe it does, the delay in bringing the present application may be seen to have conflicting effects. On the one hand, there is a real difficulty in formulating an appropriate new limiting term, given the relatively short period before the effluxion of the present term. On the other hand, the delay means that quite considerable material is now available which could not, on any view, have been available to the primary judge when fixing the limiting term nor to this Court, had the application been timely. Because I would not give significant weight to material which to a large extent reflects the expectations at the time of fixing the limiting term, in my view it is preferable to undertake that exercise without the distraction of a significant volume of new material of relatively little weight. Accordingly, I would reject the tender: Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) ss 55(1) and 135(c). 
     
      
       
      Error in nominating limiting term 
      
    12 The exercise required by s 23(1)(b) involved a lack of clarity in some respects. First, although the term is not a penalty as such, imposed by the Court, s 23 itself appears to treat it as a “penalty” because, where imprisonment is not deemed appropriate, the Court is authorised to impose “such other penalty” as it might have done on conviction for a criminal offence: s 23(2). Further, s 10(4) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act also tends to imply that the fixing of a limiting term and the consequent detention, following a special hearing, may involve the infliction of a “punishment”. Similarly, where the Mental Health Review Tribunal recommends the release of a person who has been held in detention following the nomination of a limiting term, the Attorney-General may object to the person’s release on the ground that “the person has served insufficient time in custody or under detention”: Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW), s 84(1). That is the view which has been adopted by the Court of Appeal and this Court: see DPP v Mills [2000] NSWCA 236 at [39] (Handley JA, Sheller JA agreeing) and Smith v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 39 at [63] (Hall J, Sully and Howie JJ agreeing); cf Regina v AN (No. 2) [2006] NSWCCA 218 at [32]. 
     
      
    13 The nature of the exercise also reveals ambivalence as to how (if at all) the mental illness of the offender is to be taken into account. On one view, the hypothetical assumption of a sentence estimated as appropriate following a “normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who is fit to be tried for that offence” would appear to render the mental illness relevant. However, mental illness or disability should be highly relevant to that sentencing exercise and, on one view, should not readily be seen as irrelevant merely because the degree of illness or disability has passed the boundary beyond which the person cannot be tried. If that were intended, with potentially significant adverse consequences for the offender, one would expect the Parliament to have stated that consequence clearly and unequivocally. That not having been done, the preferable construction is one which attributes to the offender her actual mental characteristics, but assumes that she was subjected to a normal trial. 
     
      
    14 Recent caselaw concerning the proper approach to sentencing a person with mental illness is extensive. In this Court, the principles were adverted to in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, in particular by Wood CJ at CL at [252]-[254], where his Honour distinguished drug addiction from mental abnormality. More recently, the principles were referred to by Spigelman CJ in R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]-[26]. Most recently, the principles have been reconsidered and restated by the Victorian Court of Appeal in The Queen v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32] (Maxwell P, Buchanan and Vincent JJA), following and elaborating upon the statements in R v Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Impaired mental functioning, whether temporary or permanent (‘the condition’), is relevant to sentencing in at least the following six ways: 
        
       
       
        
        1. The condition may reduce the moral culpability of the offending conduct, as distinct from the offender’s legal responsibility. Where that is so, the condition affects the punishment that is just in all the circumstances; and denunciation is less likely to be a relevant sentencing objective. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The condition may have a bearing on the kind of sentence that is imposed and the conditions in which it should be served. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Whether general deterrence should be moderated or eliminated as a sentencing consideration depends upon the nature and severity of the symptoms exhibited by the offender, and the effect of the condition on the mental capacity of the offender, whether at the time of the offending or at the date of sentence or both. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Whether specific deterrence should be moderated or eliminated as a sentencing consideration likewise depends upon the nature and severity of the symptoms of the condition as exhibited by the offender, and the effect of the condition on the mental capacity of the offender, whether at the time of the offending or at the date of sentence or both. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The existence of the condition at the date of sentencing (or its foreseeable recurrence) may mean that a given sentence will weigh more heavily on the offender than it would on a person in normal health. 
        
       
       
        
        6. Where there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a significant adverse effect on the offender’s mental health, this will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment.” 
        
       
      
    15 In Israil, Spigelman CJ noted the doubts expressed by Malcolm CJ as to the relevance of proposition 5 in Western Australia, but noted that it appeared to have been regarded as material in this Court in R v Jiminez [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [25], and saw no reason why it should not be so: at [26]. Proposition 6 was an addition to the five propositions stated in Tsiaras, and was designed to give specific recognition to the second of two possible consequences of imprisonment identified by King CJ in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 589: 
     
      
       
        
        “Generally speaking ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health or when there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse affect on the offender’s health.” 
        
       
      
    16 With the possible exception of proposition 2, which may have limited relevance where imprisonment has been identified as the relevant penalty, these propositions have been broadly accepted, although without the same level of definition and discussion, in other cases in this Court, including R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[35] (Sperling J). His Honour noted a countervailing consideration, namely the level of danger which the offender presents to the community: at [36]. 
     
      
    17 This last remark must be read in the context of the principles established in Veen v The Queen [No. 2] (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465, at 473 in the judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is one thing to say that the principle of proportionality precludes the imposition of a sentence extended beyond what is appropriate to the crime merely to protect society; it is another thing to say that the protection of society is not a material factor in fixing an appropriate sentence. The distinction in principle is clear between an extension merely by way of preventative detention, which is impermissible, and an exercise of the sentencing discretion having regard to the protection of society among other factors, which is permissible.” 
        
       
      
    18 Further, in Veen [No. 2], Wilson J explained the issue at p 487, in terms with which Deane J (p 490) and Gaudron J (p 496) agreed: 
     
      
       
        
        “The difficulty arises in determining the effect that the element of protection of the community may properly have in arriving at a particular sentence. In my view, it should not have the effect of increasing a sentence beyond the longest sentence that the actual offence charged, when viewed objectively, would justify.” 
        
       
       
      Approach of primary judge 
      
    19 In the present case, the primary judge, Geraghty DCJ, outlined the circumstances which he was required to take into account in nominating a limiting term. He noted the assessment made of the applicant by Dr Michael Guiffrida, in the following terms (Judgment, pp2-3): 
     
      
       
        
        “He has assessed her as having an intelligence range in the lowest three to four percent of the population. On measures of social competence, he said that she probably functions below borderline range of intelligence. 
        
       
       
        
        In addition, she clearly has a severe personality disorder, with both borderline and anti-social traits of personality functioning. He said that this was characterised by an extreme degree of impulsiveness and recklessness, together with highly risk-taking behaviour, substance abuse, and extremely serious self-harm behaviour. Her anti-social traits include ongoing and seemingly continuous episodes of rage, aggression, threatening behaviour and actual violence visited on custodial and health staff in the prison system.” 
        
       
      
    20 His Honour further noted Dr Guiffrida’s opinion that the applicant should be given a trial on the medication Clozapine, which in practical terms could only be dispensed as an in-patient at B Ward at Long Bay. Dr Guiffrida stated (Judgment, p 4-5): 
     
      
       
        
        “My hope is that she should respond with some benefit to the Clozapine medication, that there could be a gradual stepping down in the level of security and restriction, such that she could be transferred at some later stage to the Bunya Unit at Cumberland Hospital, thence to the cottages of open wards of Cumberland Hospital, and ultimate[ly] to release to some appropriately supervised accommodation in the community. My guess is that she will always require some degree of supervised accommodation for people with so-called dual diagnosis problems. In Ms Courtney’s case the matter is not so much one of dual diagnosis as quadruple diagnosis.” 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour then considered (pp 6-7) the exercise to be undertaken in setting a limiting term. He referred to R v Engert (1996) 84 A Crim R 67 where Gleeson CJ, at p 68, had noted (in the primary judge’s paraphrase) that in sentencing a person with mental illness, “the principles of general deterrence (which normally apply to sentencing) are given less weight” and that “the Court should give more specific consideration to the question of specific deterrence”: Courtney at p 7. His Honour also noted a submission put on behalf of the Director that he should “pay particular attention” to protection of the community from the offender in setting a limiting term. His Honour referred to factors of aggravation and mitigation derived from s 21A(2) and (3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and the guidance which might be obtained from the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. His discussion of the mitigating factors, in particular, should be set out in full (p 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the mitigating factors I should say that I do not have any evidence that the injury or the emotional harm, the loss or the damage which was caused by the offence was substantial. It was a reckless, immediate, unplanned incursion into somebody’s private space with a knife, but neither of the elderly ladies came forward to say that they had been traumatised or damaged.  
        
       
       
        
        Subs (b) [par (3)(b)] provides as a mitigating factor that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity and it’s clear from this lady’s mental condition that it was not something that she planned or organised in any acceptable way. 
        
       
       
        
        Subs (j) [par (3)(j)] requires that I consider also whether the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of her action because of her disability, and I do take this into consideration also.” 
        
       
       
      An appropriate limiting term 
      
    22 There are three aspects of his Honour’s reasons which give rise to concern. The first two may be explained by reference to express statements in the reasons; the third is a more general concern. The first is the suggestion that R v Engert supported the proposition that in the case of a mentally ill person the Court should give “more specific consideration to the question of specific deterrence”. In fact, I see no such encouragement in Engert and, indeed, it would be consistent with principle that specific deterrence should itself have a constrained operation in circumstances where the evidence demonstrates that the offender is unable or unlikely to modify her behaviour as a result of the sentence. The very fact that she continued to act in the ways described by Dr Guiffrida whilst in custody demonstrate that deterrence is, in a real sense, virtually an irrelevant consideration in relation to her own conduct. 
     
      
    23 The second matter for concern is that although his Honour referred to s 21A(3)(j) as a mitigating factor, namely that “the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his or her actions because of the offender’s age or any disability”, it is not clear how it was taken into account. Generally speaking, the statement that it was taken into consideration should be taken at face value, without the need for any precise explanation of how it affected the ultimate outcome. However, in this case, it was a matter of high relevance and suggested the inappropriateness of the earlier comment that “more specific consideration” should be given to the question of specific deterrence. These propositions required reconciliation. 
     
      
    24 Thirdly, there was, again, no error in principle in taking into account the proposition derived from s 3A(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that one of the purposes of imposing a sentence was “to protect the community from the offender”, at a level of generality. However, it should be noted that immediately following his Honour’s comments in relation to the protection of the community from the particular offender, he noted other considerations in s 21A(2), namely that the offender had “a lengthy record of previous offences and convictions” and that the offences in question were committed “while she was on conditional liberty” in relation to an alleged offence and whilst she was on parole for an offence of armed robbery. 
     
      
    25 Whilst protection of the community is a relevant consideration, its operation in a specific case such as this must be identified with care, lest there be a breach of the principles identified in Veen [No. 2], with the danger that the sentence imposed will be greater than that which the objective circumstances of the offence would warrant. Similarly, a reference to the lengthy record and the commission of offences whilst on conditional liberty, also require care lest there be a failure to apply “the principle of proportionality” which requires “the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence to be set by the objective circumstances of the offence, which circumstances do not encompass prior convictions”: Regina v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242 at [24] (Spigelman CJ, referring to Veen [No. 2] and Baumer v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57-58). 
     
      
    26 The overwhelming feature of the present case is that no imprisonment, past or present, has had or is likely to have any effect on the behaviour of the applicant. Her care and control, and the protection of the community, will ultimately depend on a combination of medical treatment and the operation of the Mental Health Act. In those circumstances, the likelihood of the applicant enjoying extended periods of unconditional liberty, absent effective medical treatment, appears to be remote. Nevertheless, the application of proper principle in establishing a limiting term under s 23 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act should be observed, all the more meticulously, because the answers to the intractable problems that the applicant presents will not ultimately be found solely, or perhaps at all, within the criminal justice system. 
     
      
    27 Adopting the propositions set out in Verdins, together with their accompanying explanations, there should, it seems to me, have been some lesser penalty imposed on this particular applicant. No reasonable person could see general deterrence as a significant element in the setting of a limiting term for her. Nor can specific deterrence in relation to her own future conduct be treated as a significant element. Her personal moral culpability must also be seen as limited. It could well have been predicted at the date of nominating the limiting term, that the sentence would be served, to a significant degree, in isolation and in circumstances which would exacerbate, rather than ameliorate her mental illnesses. 
     
      
    28 Taken together, these factors should have resulted in a sentence significantly below that which would have been imposed on a person not suffering such mental illnesses. In my view an appropriate limiting term would have been a period of no more than four years six months. However, to nominate such a term now would result in the immediate release of the applicant from her present custody, without the opportunity for any appropriate steps to be taken in relation to the operation of the Mental Health Act. In a practical sense, this would be in no one’s interest. Accordingly, given the exigencies of the situation, in large part the result of the belated application for leave to appeal, I would grant leave to appeal, set aside the limiting term nominated by the primary judge, and in lieu thereof, nominate a limiting term of four years nine months to commence on 18 December 2002 and to expire on 17 September 2007. 
     
      
    29 GROVE J: This case reveals an immense personal tragedy affecting the appellant, and I will later refer to some facets of it. Before the Court is an application to extend the time for appeal and for leave to appeal against sentence. At Penrith District Court Geraghty DCJ imposed concurrent limiting terms of five years imprisonment following findings after a special hearing, on the limited evidence available, that the appellant committed two offences of assault with intent to rob being armed with an offensive weapon, and, robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. Limiting terms are within the definition of sentence for the purposes of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (s 2). 
     
      
    30 The facts of the first offence were these. On Friday 5 January 2001 the victim, a forty eight year old woman, was sitting alone at Blacktown interchange waiting for a bus. The appellant approached her and produced a knife from a plastic bag, which she waved at her and said “Give me the bag”. The victim refused and a debate of sorts ensued which terminated when the appellant produced a packet of biscuits, hit the victim on the head with the packet and then walked away without taking anything from the victim. 
     
      
    31 The second offence occurred on the next day. The victim, a fifty five year old woman, was placing items into the boot of her car, which was in a shopping centre car park, again at Blacktown. The appellant approached with a knife in her hand and said “Give me your bag, give me your fucking bag”. The victim attempted to set off her car alarm but the appellant prodded at her with the knife and she surrendered her bag as the appellant was pulling it from her shoulder.  
     
      
    32 The appellant has numerous prior convictions but, significantly, on 31 July 2000 she had been convicted of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon and sentenced (taking into account matters on a Form 1, including a charge of demanding money with menaces) to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of nine months commencing on 16 December 1999, with parole conditions of supervision, attending medical and counselling services, taking medication determined by a psychiatrist and when released to be placed into the custody of a person for return to New Zealand. It is apparent that she did not return to New Zealand and was on parole at the time of the current offences.  
     
      
    33 That parole was revoked on 17 January 2001 and she served the balance of parole which expired on 17 December 2002.  
     
      
    34 On 24 June 2002, after a hearing on that day, O’Reilly DCJ found the appellant unfit to be tried for the offences alleged to have occurred on 5 and 6 January 2001 and referred her to the Mental Health Tribunal (the Tribunal) pursuant to the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. On 1 May 2003 the Tribunal determined that the appellant would not, during the period of twelve months after that finding, become fit to be tried on the charges and the Attorney General was notified of this. On 3 June 2003 the Attorney General directed that there be a special hearing in respect of the offences. 
     
      
    35 The special hearing was conducted by Geraghty DCJ sitting without a jury on 24 March 2004 and he published his findings on the following day and imposed the limiting terms on 7 May 2004. His Honour directed the limiting terms to date from 18 December 2002, the day after the expiry of the balance of parole which the appellant served after the revocation of parole on 17 January 2001.  
     
      
    36 The limiting terms therefore will themselves expire on 17 December 2007, that is to say, in less than six months time. The Form IV notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal is dated 24 April 2007 and it is notated as received in the Registry on 26 April 2007.  
     
      
    37 Upon the matter being called for hearing, senior counsel for the appellant sought to read a number of affidavits on three bases, first, on the application to extend time, second, to be taken into account if the Court came to the question of resentence and, third, “because of the extraordinary nature of what has occurred” as fresh evidence. 
     
      
    38 The Crown Prosecutor did not object to what was proposed on the first and second bases (although the extension of time was opposed) but did object to the affidavits being read on the third basis. The Court deferred ruling on this lastmentioned. 
     
      
    39 It is convenient to deal with the grounds of appeal in sequence. Ground 1: 
     
      
       
        
        “The proceedings miscarried because his Honour failed to take into account the hardship suffered as a result of the conditions of the applicant’s custody.” 
        
       
      
    40 It is to be observed that when imposing the limiting terms his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I also recommend as strongly as I can that she be placed in B Ward at Long Bay initially; that from there she be assessed, and she will be every six months, where her treatment will be reviewed, the need for security established and referred to appropriate locations.” 
        
       
      
    41 Section 24 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Consequences of nomination of limiting term 
        
       
       
        
        (1) If in respect of a person a Court has nominated a limiting term, the Court: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) must refer the person to the Mental Health Review Tribunal, and 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) may make such order with respect to the custody of the person as the Court considers appropriate. 
          
         
         
        (2) If a Court refers a person to the Tribunal, the Tribunal must determine whether or not: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person is suffering from mental illness, or 
           
           
          (b) the person is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital and, where the person is not in a hospital, whether or not the person objects to being detained in a hospital. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The Tribunal must notify the Court which referred the person to it of its determination with respect to the person.” 
        
       
      
    42 His Honour does not seem to have made an order in respect of custody as he was empowered to do pursuant to s 24(1)(b) but articulated the recommendation above quoted. Nevertheless, on 20 August 2004 the Tribunal made a determination pursuant to s 24(2) that the appellant was suffering from a mental illness. The endorsement of reasons concludes with the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “…..Ms Courtney presents challenging problems in regard to her care, treatment and detention. Since the review conducted by the Tribunal in June 2004 Ms Courtney was transferred from Mulawa to B Ward at Long Bay Prison Hospital. However, shortly after this transfer Ms Courtney assaulted a fellow patient and a decision was then made to transfer her back to Mulawa where she now resides. 
        
       
       
        
        Challenging though Ms Courtney’s behaviour may be, it remains the Tribunal’s review that as a mentally ill person she should be detained in a hospital rather than a prison. Despite this view, which is in accord with widely recognised principles of international humanitarian law, no hospital exists within the jurisdiction which can (or will) accommodate Ms Courtney, or a number of other highly disturbed and dangerous female forensic patients. This situation seems likely to prevail until construction is complete of a new forensic hospital in 2006 or 2007.” 
        
       
      
    43 On 12 August 2004 a warrant of commitment issued reciting an order referring the appellant to the Tribunal and also stating: 
     
      
       
        
        “…..and that she remains in custody while the Tribunal makes its assessment, and, 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour recommend that the offender be initially be kept in the prison hospital placement in B Ward Long Bay.” 
        
       
      
    44 The warrant also had this subscription endorsed: 
     
      
       
        
        “NOTE: This Order replaces order issued on 7th May 2004 (Order Pursuant to Section 39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990.” 
        
       
      
    45 Section 39 deals with occasions where there has been a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness and I conclude that an earlier warrant had been issued in error. It can be inferred that the Tribunal notified Geraghty DCJ of its determination as required by s 24(3) and a manuscript dated 21 October 2004 signed by his Honour reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “I order that Lisa Michelle Courtney be detained so that she may be brought into the forensic mental health system for ongoing review by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 
        
       
       
        
        I make this order pursuant to sect 27 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) act 1990.” 
        
       
      
    46 The order in those terms does not coordinate with the terms of s 27 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
         “Orders Court may make following determination of Mental Health Review Tribunal after limiting term is imposed. 
        
       
       
        
        If a Court is notified by the Mental Health Review Tribunal of its determination in respect of a person under section 24(3), the Court may: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) if the Tribunal has determined that the person is suffering from mental illness or that the person is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital and that the person, not being in a hospital, does not object to being detained in a hospital – order that the person be taken to and detained in a hospital, or  
        
       
       
        
        ……..” 
        
       
      
    47 Save the quotations from statute, the foregoing information ought to be in the records of the court below but are conveniently found in annexures to the affidavit of William Dickens affirmed on 2 May 2007 and in a bundle of documents which were tendered at the hearing of the appeal and in respect of which tender no final ruling was made. Insofar as they represent copies of court records I see no reason why their content should not be the subject of reference. 
     
      
    48 The tracing of these matters offers possible explanation for the events which later occurred, that is to say that the appellant remained in prison custody and that by reason of her behaviour she spent extensive periods in segregation from other inmates. 
     
      
    49 The thrust of the appellant’s argument in support of ground 1 is an assertion that her conditions of custody have been unduly onerous and ought to have been taken into account in assessing the limiting terms. There is ample authority for the proposition that unduly onerous conditions of custody may lead to mitigation of the length of sentence: R v Schneidas (unreported, NSWCCA 22 August 1994); AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 11. 
     
      
    50 The tender of affidavit material as fresh evidence (the third basis of tender) sought to detail what has in fact happened in the years that have passed since the appellant was committed to custody pursuant to the imposition of the limiting term.  
     
      
    51 The sentencing judge was not insensitive to the exceptional situation of the appellant. He made extensive reference to the records of the appellant’s behaviour in custody and the psychiatric opinion which included assessment that she was at extremely high risk of harm to herself and others, and that, as a consequence of assaults, she had been held in complete segregation because of the risk issues. 
     
      
    52 There was nothing before his Honour nor did he make any finding that the risk, and therefore the anticipated response, was likely to alter.  
     
      
    53 I am unpersuaded that his Honour overlooked the particular hardship which custody would mean for the appellant although, or course, he would not have been seized with precise detail. I would reject this ground. 
     
      
    54 The above reference to s 27 shows that the availability of a suitable hospital was not canvassed as the terms of that provision clearly contemplate, but it is conceded by senior counsel for the appellant, correctly in my view, that no appeal lies to this Court to remedy any failure to implement that section. 
     
      
    55 Ground 2. “The proceedings miscarried because his Honour failed to properly take into account the impact of the applicant’s mental illness”. 
     
      
    56 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was referred also to  
        R v Engert 
         [1996] 84 A Crim R 67 which dealt with sentencing of a person with mental illness in which the proposition was espoused that the principles of general deterrence (which normally apply to sentencing) are given less weight in the case of a mentally ill person; and that the Court should give more specific consideration to the question of specific deterrence.” 
        
       
      
    57 Both counsel for the appellant and the Crown Prosecutor acknowledged the authority of Engert in which, inter alia, Gleeson CJ approved observations in other cases to the effect that, where an offender suffered a mental illness or abnormality, general deterrence is a factor which should often be given little weight, but that in every case it is a matter for balancing relevant factors in the same fashion as occurs in every sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    58 It is contended by the appellant that there is no rule that “more specific consideration” should be given to specific deterrence than to general deterrence. His Honour did not say that he was according greater weight to specific deterrence and it is a rational approach, when it is concluded that an offender is not a suitable vehicle for the deterrence of others because of mental illness, to have particular focus upon deterrence of the individual. I do not understand his Honour to have been saying any more than that.  
     
      
    59 Although it may be considered that the circumstances of these offences suggested opportunistic behaviour which may have been inspired by abnormal capacity for judgment, the selected victims were alone and apparently vulnerable to threat with the weapon with which the appellant had come equipped. When assessing matters relating to mental illness which might attract mitigation it is necessary to assess the countervailing consideration of the level of danger which the offender presents to the community: R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255. It is undeniable that the appellant is a person representing a high level of risk. 
     
      
    60 This ground is not made out.  
     
      
    61 Ground 3. “The proceedings miscarried because his Honour erred in formulating a sentence on the presumption that the applicant would not be in gaol for the entire period of the limiting terms.” 
     
      
    62 This complaint is to be analysed in the context of what his Honour said in his remarks on sentence, which was: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that handing down a limiting period sentence does not mean that the offender will be in gaol for that period, or for any period more than six, or twelve, or eighteen months, since she comes under review every six months and assessments are made about her ability to be rehabilitated, or to be moved somewhere else. So the purpose of setting a limiting period is simply to set a period beyond which a person cannot be detained for the offence which was the subject of the special hearing.” 
        
       
      
    63 Arising out of the procedures which I have above recounted, the appellant became a “forensic patient” within the meaning of Schedule 1 to the Mental Health Act 1990. The subsequent procedures have been described in R v Mitchell [1999] 108 A Crim R 85 at p 89: 
     
      
       
        
        “Chapter 5 of the  
        Mental Health Act 
         deals with forensic patients. The Tribunal must review forensic patients at least once every six months and make a recommendation to the Minister for Health as to the patient’s continued detention, care or treatment, fitness to be tried for an offence and release (conditional or unconditional): s 82  
        Mental Health Act 
        . A recommendation for release triggers a series of steps which may lead to the patient’s release: ss 83, 84,  
        Mental Health Act 
        . Pursuant to ss 28-30 of the  
        Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
         if, prior to release during a limiting term, a person is found by the Tribunal to have become fit to be tried, and this is confirmed by the court, the criminal proceedings are continued. 
        
       
       
        
        At the end of the limiting term, release from custody as a forensic patient is automatic.” 
        
       
      
    64 What was stated by his Honour was entirely compatible with what appears in that judgment. 
     
      
    65 His Honour was required to estimate a total sentence and not a minimum term or non-parole period: R v Mailes [2003] 141 A Crim R 353. He did so.  
     
      
    66 When he added, after imposing the limiting terms “this does not mean that you will necessarily serve five years in prison, but you will come under review every six months” there was no implication that the sentence would necessarily, or even probably, lead to the release before expiry of the limiting terms. Neither is it to be inferred that his Honour assessed the terms on the basis that there would be such a release nor on the basis that the appellant might not be required to serve the terms in a prison. Whether his Honour harboured a hope, or even an expectation, that his recommendation that the appellant be placed in a hospital, would be fulfilled, it is plain that in setting the term he was conscious that the appellant may be detained in a prison.  
     
      
    67 The argument of the appellant fails. 
     
      
    68 Ground 4. “The proceedings miscarried because his Honour failed to consider the issue of totality.” 
     
      
    69 In his remarks on sentence his Honour did not refer to “the principle of totality” which, as has been said, is a convenient phrase descriptive of a practical consideration: R v Holder & anor (1983) 3 NSWLR 245. 
     
      
    70 The thrust of the appellant’s argument is targeted to the commencement date of the limiting terms at the expiry of the balance of parole as abovementioned. The present offences plainly amounted to breaches of parole, which was revoked within two weeks of their commission. His Honour stated that he noted that the appellant was at conditional liberty and on parole when the offences were committed in the context of referring to s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, clearly indicating that he took the circumstance into account as an aggravating factor.  
     
      
    71 It was contended that taking that aggravating factor into account in assessing the length of the limiting terms when the appellant had been required to serve the balance of parole only at the end of which the limiting terms commenced, involved an element of double counting.  
     
      
    72 It was not disputed that his Honour had a discretion to exercise. In R v Callaghan [2006] NSWCCA 58, Simpson J (James and Hall JJ agreeing) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no clear rule which will govern all cases. The circumstances that bring an offender before a court for sentence after parole has been revoked are far too varied to permit a single absolute rule.” 
        
       
      
    73 On an assumption that the absence of reference can be interpreted as showing that his Honour did not turn his mind to the exercise of this discretion and presuming that that demonstrates error, as I understand senior counsel for the appellant to acknowledge, the intervention of this Court would not be attracted unless some lesser “sentence” was warranted in law. There were many factors to be balanced in this sentencing exercise but the result, in my opinion, is well within the range of the sound exercise of sentencing discretion and I would not intervene to reduce the limiting terms. 
     
      
    74 None of the grounds of appeal which have been argued are sustained. In opening oral argument senior counsel for the appellant referred to the avoidance of the appellant’s situation being placed in the “too hard basket”. It must be remembered that this is a court of error established and vested with powers by its constituting statute, which powers must be exercised accordingly. It is not a tribunal of general review. The consequence of the failure of the grounds presented is that the appeal should be dismissed.  
     
      
    75 However, the affidavit evidence to which I have referred is before the Court, without objection, for the purpose of the application to extend time. I would rule against its receipt as fresh evidence in the appeal. The material has, of course, been seen in support of the first basis but, even if it were received in the appeal the question would remain whether the additional evidence would lead to a different sentence: R v Eliasen [1991] 53 A Crim R 391. For reasons already expressed, I do not consider that it should. 
     
      
    76 I accept that the appellant’s illnesses, handicaps and general conditions of custody sustain the making of an order to extend the time for lodging an appeal. I also advert to the procedural matters previously described. 
     
      
    77 At the outset I said I would return to some aspects of the appellant’s situation. The most recent review by the Tribunal dated 24 April 2007 recommends: 
     
      
       
        
        “That the current arrangements for Ms Lisa Michelle Courtney’s care, treatment and detention as a forensic patient at Silverwater Women’s Correctional Centre should continue to apply.” 
        
       
      
    78 The reasons expressed for reaching that determination are eloquent of what I have referred to as tragedy: 
     
      
       
        
        “As was pointed out in the remarks following the 6th review Ms Courtney is at severe risk of self harm from her own conduct. The use of pens and pencils and so on has been found to be dangerous. She has had ongoing problems of violence to herself and has had altercations with staff and others. 
        
       
       
        
        It remains perfectly obvious that preparations should be made now for the prospect of Ms Courtney having to be released from her preset environment. There is no hospital available for her in New South Wales although it is clear that Ms Courtney should be in a hospital if there is one capable of accommodating her. 
        
       
       
        
        Because of the high risk of violence there is no access to therapeutic facilities. 
        
       
       
        
        CONCLUSION 
         
        There appears, unfortunately, absolutely no alternative at the moment but to recommend that the current arrangements for Ms Courtney’s care, treatment and detention as a forensic patient at the Mulawa Correctional Centre should continue to apply.” 
        
       
      
    79 As observed, the limiting terms will expire in December next and the appellant will automatically be released. 
     
      
    80 Although I have iterated the limits under which this Court appropriately operates, it will not trespass upon other jurisdiction to seek in this judgment to draw attention to the urgency with which adequate arrangements must be made for the sake of both the appellant and the community to respond to the impending inevitable return by her into that community. 
     
      
    81 I propose that necessary extension of time and leave to appeal against sentence be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    82 HOWIE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J substantially for the reasons stated by his Honour. It is in my opinion apposite to quote from the judgment of Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Persons suffering from mental disorders frequently come into collision with the criminal justice system. Sentencing such persons commonly confronts judicial officers with the need to make a sensitive discretionary decision. Sentencing is essentially a discretionary exercise requiring consideration of the extremely variable facts and circumstances of individual cases and the application to those facts and circumstances to the principles laid down by statute or established by the common law. The principles to be applied in sentencing are in turn developed by reference to the purposes of criminal punishment. Those purposes were set by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 as follows: ""protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform"". 
         
         
        A moment's consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. That was the particular problem being examined by the Court in the case of Veen No 2 Again, in a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence, might, at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the offender. 
         
         
        It is therefore erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances. In every case, what is called for is the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, and in the light of the purposes to be served by the sentencing exercise. 
        
       
      
    83 The fact that an offender is mentally ill does not mean that the sentence imposed must be less than that imposed upon a person who commits the same criminal act without any abnormality of mind. It may do so for all the reasons given in R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 225. In particular the fact that the offender is suffering from a mental illness may reduce the person’s culpability. But even that fact does not necessarily result in a lesser sentence. Mr Veen’s culpability for the second killing was diminished by reason of his mental illness but it did not mean that the maximum penalty for the offence was not appropriate: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. This was because the protection of the public required that he be sentenced to a period of imprisonment by way of preventative detention because of his danger to society. Provided that the sentence is commensurate with the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, there is no error of principle in imposing a sentence aimed at protecting the community from the offender’s recidivism by removing him or her from society. 
     
      
    84 The judges in the joint judgment in Veen (No 2) stated at 473: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is one thing to say that the principle of proportionality precludes the imposition of a sentence extended beyond what is appropriate to the crime merely to protect society; it is another thing to say that the protection of society is not a material factor in fixing an appropriate sentence. The distinction in principle is clear between an extension merely by way of preventive detention, which is impermissible, and an exercise of the sentencing discretion having regard to the protection of society among other factors, which is permissible………………………… 
        
       
      
    85 The Court was there concerned with the apparently anomalous situation of the imposition of a heavier sentence on a dangerous offender whose culpability is reduced because of a mental illness. But as was made clear both in the joint judgment and in other decisions concerned with the sentencing of mentally ill offenders, there are considerations that point in different directions when determining the appropriate sentence in such a case. 
     
      
    86 In the present case the Judge was in error in referring to the need for personal deterrence in sentencing the applicant. As Basten JA points out, that was not a valid concern here because it is obvious that personal deterrence will have no effect. However, that makes the applicant more of a danger to other members of the community because she will follow her urges regardless of what the penalty will be, or has been, imposed upon her for similar conduct. The offences were serious and in my view warranted the sentence imposed upon the applicant notwithstanding the difficulties occasioned to her and the prison system by trying to protect others and the applicant herself from her dangerous behaviour. 
     
      
    87 Even if error were established in the exercise of the Judge’s discretion in what was a difficult case, I am firmly of the view that no lesser sentence is warranted. The sentence imposed was clearly proportionate to her criminality viewed objectively and was necessary for the protection of the public.

      This is an application by the Crown to be relieved of the credibility rule in order to cross-examine a witness which defence counsel indicates he proposes to call. The witness is named Shane John Myers. The application is made under s 103 of the 
        
      Evidence Act 1995 
      . Shane John Myers is to be called by the defence because it has been put to the principal witness for the Crown,the alleged victim, that he had spoken to Shane John Myers in terms which clearly amounted to a threat made to the accused in this case. 
       
       
      2.  
      The credit of the Crown's principal witnesses in the circumstances of this case is a very significant issue. That witness has denied speaking to Shane John Myers and indeed denied knowing Shane John Myers. Presumably the intention of the defence in calling Mr Myers will be for him to assert that Mr Downes did say these things to him are therefore contradicting the principal Crown witness and raising an issue of his credibility. 
       
       
      3.  
      There has been tendered as I think VDD the criminal  
      record of Mr Myers. It is extensive and runs for some 26 pages. Typical entries are for break, enter and steal, but others include goods in custody, driving a stolen car and possessing house-breaking implements. 
       
       
      4.  
      In support of his application the trial advocate refers to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
      R v Lumsden 
       [2003] NSWCCA 83, in particular to the judgment of Hulme J (with whom the learned President agreed) at [55] to [59]. 
       
       
      5.  
      On the other hand, Mr Hoare for the accused in this case says that  
      Lumsden's case 
       is factually different from this case. In that case the witness in question volunteered his convictions, next he was giving alibi evidence which was very significant in the context of that trial, and thirdly, the trial itself concerned a drug offence and one of the offences in respect of which the witness had a conviction was a drug offence. That in turn was connected to Hulme J's reasoning in respect to one of the convictions. 
       
       
      6.  
      I have determined to allow cross-examination to a certain extent under section 103 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      . Briefly my reasons are these: I propose to follow  
      Lumsden 
      . I agree that there are factual differences of the kind outlined by Mr Hoare. Although the witness in this case, Mr Myers, is not an alibi witness, his evidence is very significant so far as the credit of the principal Crown witness is concerned. In addition, one of the offences in respect of which the witness in  
      Lumsden 
       was convicted was goods in custody which Hulme J described as bespeaking dishonestly. (I should have said earlier that another argument of Mr Hoare was that the position regarding the cross-examination on criminal records was an unsettled area of the law. That position is reflected in the commentary contained in the seventh edition of  
      Uniform Evidence Law 
       by Odgers. However, in my opinion I am bound by the majority judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
      Lumsden 
      . The reasoning of Hulme J on this point attracted the concurrence of the learned President as I have said.) 
       
       
      7.  
      I regard the evidence upon which the Crown seeks to cross-examine this witness as having substantial probative value, but I propose to limit that cross-examination to convictions relating to the witness' credibility which will relate to offences concerning dishonesty such as break and enter and larceny, and driving a stolen car because I am of the view that such offences tend to prove that the witness is more likely to make a false representation. And I propose to limit the cross-examination to offences committed since 23 May 2002 because they are closer in time.  
       
       
      8.  
      Accordingly, subject to further directions which I will give in the course if any questions, I propose to grant the Crown's application.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 3 November 2006 the Crown lodged an appeal pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the inadequacy of a suspended sentence of 18 months imposed on the respondent by his Honour Acting Judge Mahoney in the District Court at Campbelltown on 28 September 2006. The sentence was imposed in respect of a plea of guilty to one count of malicious wounding in company contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The offence was committed on 2 February 2006. The Crown submits that a sentence of full time custody should have been imposed. 
     
      
    2 On the same date the Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal by summons seeking prerogative relief in respect of an order his Honour made in the same proceedings where he refused to revoke bonds imposed by the Local Court on 5 September 2005 when that Court suspended sentences of 15 months pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offences consisted of three counts of break, enter and steal and one of malicious damage to property. These offences were committed in late 2004 and were the first entry on Mr Cooke’s criminal record. He turned 18 on 14 September 2004. Together with the requirement that he be of good behaviour during the currency of the bonds, Mr Cooke was required to participate in the Triple Care Farm Drug Rehabilitation Program.  
     
      
    3 The offence of malicious wounding in company, the subject of the Crown appeal against inadequacy, was committed 5 months after the suspended sentence and associated bonds were imposed by the Local Court. It was the conduct constituting the breach of those bonds. The judge’s refusal to revoke the bonds has been heard and determined (DPP v Cooke & Anor [2007] NSWCA 2). 
     
      
    4 The Crown submitted on that appeal that the sentencing judge failed to deal with the issue of revocation in accordance with the approach mandated by s 98 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There were no submissions to the contrary.  
     
      
    5 On 7 February 2007 the orders sought in the summons were granted by the Court of Appeal and the matter was remitted to the District Court judge to determine the question of revocation in accordance with law. This Court determined at that time to await the outcome of the orders to be made in the District Court following remittance before hearing the Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the suspended sentence imposed in respect of the malicious wounding. 
     
      
    6 On 30 March 2007 Acting Judge Mahoney heard further submissions and, after adverting to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in DPP v Cook and Anor, determined that the 15 month sentence previously suspended should be ordered to be served by way of periodic detention. That sentence commenced on 13 April 2007 and is due to expire on 12 July 2008. At the time the order for periodic detention was imposed Mr Cooke remained subject to the suspended sentence which is the subject of the Crown’s appeal to this Court. This has created difficulties to which we will refer to later in this judgment.  
     
      
    7 On 28 May 2007, two days before the Crown appeal was listed for hearing, Mr Cooke lodged a notice of appeal seeking leave to appeal against the order for periodic detention. 
     
      
    8 As a matter of practical necessity the two appeals were heard together. Even though the Crown appeal against the suspended sentence for the malicious wounding was lodged in November 2006, and has been outstanding since then, it was resolved that Mr Cooke’s appeal be heard first since it was thought that this may impact on the further conduct of the proceedings on the Crown appeal, in particular, if there was some question as to whether the matter should be remitted to the District Court a second time. 
     
      
       
      Applicant’s Leave to Appeal Against the Revocation of the Recognisance  
       
      
    9 Since the definition of “sentence“ in the Criminal Appeal Act includes by s 2(1) (ca) the revocation of a good behaviour bond, the ordinary principles of appellate review apply to an application for leave to appeal against the revocation of the bonds.10 Three grounds of appeal are pressed although the first two grounds are conveniently dealt with as one single ground. Each of the three grounds concern the operation of s 98 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        98  
        Proceedings for breach of good behaviour bond 
         
          
          (1) If it suspects that an offender may have failed to comply with any of the conditions of a good behaviour bond:  
           
          (a) the court with which the offender has entered into the bond, or 
           
          (b) any other court of like jurisdiction, or 
           
          (c) with the offender’s consent, any other court of superior jurisdiction, 
          
         
         may call on the offender to appear before it… 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (2) If it is satisfied that an offender appearing before it has failed to comply with any of the conditions of a good behaviour bond, a court:  
           
          (a) may decide to take no action with respect to the failure to comply, or 
           
          (b) may vary the conditions of the bond or impose further conditions on the bond, or 
           
          (c) may revoke the bond. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (3)  
          In the case of a good behaviour bond referred to in section 12, a court must revoke the bond unless it is satisfied:  
           
          (a) that the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature, or 
           
          (b) that there are good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond  
          (emphasis added). 
          
         
        
       
      
    11 The orders for periodic detention were made pursuant to s 99(2) which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        99  
        Consequences of revocation of good behaviour bond 
         
        (1) If a court revokes a good behaviour bond:  
        
       
      
     (a) … 
     
      
       
        
         (b) … 
         
          
          (c) in the case of a bond referred to in section 12:  
           
            
            (i) the order under section 12 (1) (a) ceases to have effect in relation to the sentence of imprisonment suspended by the order, and 
             
            (ii) Part 4 applies to the sentence, as if the sentence were being imposed by the court following revocation of the good behaviour bond, and section 24 applies in relation to the setting of a non-parole period under that Part. 
            
           
          (2) Subject to Parts 5 and 6, a court may, on revoking a good behaviour bond referred to in section 12, make an order directing that the sentence of imprisonment to which the bond relates is to be served by way of periodic detention or home detention. 
           
          (3) An order made under subsection (2) is taken to be a periodic detention order made under section 6 or a home detention order made under section 7, as the case requires. 
           
          (4) This Act applies to the sentencing or re-sentencing of an offender under this section in the same way as it applies to the sentencing of an offender on a conviction. 
           
          (5) An offender who under this section is sentenced by a court for an offence has the same rights of appeal as the offender would have had if the offender had been sentenced by that court on being convicted of the offence (emphasis added). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
        
       
      
    The Facts12 Since it is necessary to focus on the behaviour giving rise to the breach of the good behaviour bonds for the purposes of s 98(3), it is necessary to consider the facts supporting the charge of malicious wounding as this was the conduct constituting the breach. These facts also have significance for the Crown appeal. 
     
      
    13 Put shortly, the applicant joined in a fight between the victim and a co-offender on the roadway outside Cabramatta Railway Station and punched and kicked the victim while he was on the ground. The victim suffered injuries to his face requiring sutures. The fight was captured on CCTV security footage which was played on the hearing of the appeal. Whatever may have been the incident that sparked the fight, and irrespective of the fact that it was, or may have been, consensual between the co-offender and the victim, it is clear that the applicant participated while the fight was in progress by punching the victim more than once and kicking him to the head region when he was on the ground. He was not acting in defence of another. The attack was vicious and could easily have been productive of a more serious injury. Contrary to the views advanced by Ms Francis who appears for him, we are satisfied that the applicant did not seek in any real sense to intervene to stop the fight. On the contrary he joined in it. All that can be said is that after the fight had stopped he appeared to restrain his co-offender from restarting it but this was after the co-offender had moved well away from the victim and after the victim had, in turn, staggered off the roadway in the opposite direction. 
     
      
       
      Grounds One and Two 
       
      
    14 It is submitted that error results from the fact that the Judge not only failed to state that the good behaviour bonds were in fact revoked (even though it is conceded as a matter of practical reality this occurred) but he concluded, wrongly, that the judgment of the Court of Appeal left him with no option but to impose periodic detention, home detention or full time custody, when what was in fact required of him was to consider whether s 98(3) mandated revocation and, if it did, to then consider the sentencing options available to him under s 99(2).  
     
      
    15 We accept that the reasons for sentence do not include an order revoking the bonds. In addition, it would appear that his Honour misunderstood that the matter was remitted to him because the reasons he originally found for refusing to revoke the bonds, were not ‘good reasons’ as a matter of law. He appears to have proceeded to sentence on the basis that the Court of Appeal held that revocation was mandated in the circumstances. Furthermore, while again in a practical sense his Honour was right in identifying the available sentencing options under s 99(2), he did not apparently appreciate that it was necessary for him to re-determine the questions posed by s 98(3) and then, if satisfied that revocation was mandated, undertake a sentencing exercise in accordance with ordinary principles. 
     
      
    16 It was submitted by Ms Francis that given these errors we should consider remitting the matter to the District Court a second time. We indicated in the course of argument that we would decline to remit the matter. The reasons for arriving at that conclusion will become clear when we consider the third ground of appeal.  
     
      
    17 Before we turn to that ground however we wish to say something about the fact that his Honour did not formally revoke the good behaviour bonds. 
     
      
    18 A Court exercising the jurisdiction to call an offender before it for breach of a good behaviour bond as provided for in s 98(1) should, if it determines to revoke the bond under s 98(2)(c) or s 98(3), make that order before determining what, if any, further order will be made consequent upon the revocation and before considering what, if any, penalty will be imposed for the conduct giving rise to the breach. This has the virtue of making the exercise of discretion under s 99 a demarked and separate sentencing exercise, although we note that s 99(4) provides that this will be the effect of a sentence imposed under the section in any event. Sentencing for the breach first also allows for the principle of totality to operate in the event that both the breach and the conduct giving rise to it are punished by a term of imprisonment.  
     
      
    19 We wish to make it clear however, that a failure to order revocation of a good behaviour bond does not constitute an error of the kind that would otherwise invalidate any orders made consequential upon revocation. On the appeal, Ms Francis did not submit that his Honour’s failure to revoke the bonds of itself invalidated the order he made under s 99(2). 
     
      
       
      
    Ground Three  
     
      
    20 As the argument proceeded before us, the principle ground of appeal crystallised as his Honour’s failure to exercise the discretion provided for in s 98(3) and, that as a consequence, the order for periodic detention was imposed in error. It was submitted that there were ‘good reasons’ in accordance with 98(3)(b) for excusing the applicant’s failure to abide by the good behaviour bonds and that his Honour did not give proper consideration to them in the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    21 In DPP v Cooke & Anor, Howie J emphasised that in considering the extent of power conferred by s 98(3)(b) to take no action on the breach of a bond, the focus must be upon the behaviour giving rise to the failure to comply with the conditions of the bond and whether that behaviour should be excused. His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        [15]…A conclusion that there were good reasons for not taking action on the breach of the bond may be found in considerations other than the conduct giving rise to the breach. For example, a decision not to take action on the breach may be based upon the subjective circumstances of the offender at the time of the proceedings for revocation of the bond. Yet that is a matter that, in my opinion, is irrelevant to a determination under s 98(3)(b).  
         
        [16] Clearly if there are extenuating circumstances of sufficient importance to explain the behaviour giving rise to the breach, the court can exercise its jurisdiction to take no action on the breach. So, for example, if the breach is the failure to report to a probation officer there might be good reasons to excuse that failure if the offender had some acute personal problem at the time such as illness or a death in the family. If the breach is a further offence, the failure to be of good behaviour might be excused because of extenuating circumstances leading to the offending behaviour. An example might be driving under the influence of alcohol in an emergency situation. In such a case the court is considering whether the conduct represents a contumelious act of defiance or disregard of the conditions of the bond entered into with the court. 
        
       
      
    22 It is not submitted that the commission of the offence of malicious wounding was a case where there were extenuating circumstances leading to the offending behaviour. Neither is it suggested that the facts in DPP v Burrow & Anor [2004] NSWSC 433 are analogous. What is submitted is that notwithstanding the fact that the offence was not trivial there are good reasons for excusing the applicant’s failure to comply with the bonds and that these are to be found in the objective features of the offending. They are said to be:(1) the applicant was not the protagonist and the attack not premeditated,  
     
      
      (2) he endeavoured to stop the assault on the victim (albeit after he had himself delivered blows and kicks),  
       
      (3) the victim had originally consented to the fight with his co-offender, and  
      
    (4) the applicant’s involvement was brief.23 It is also submitted that the applicant’s subjective circumstances at the time of the offending were such that, in combination with the objective features, they constitute ‘good reasons’ for excusing the breach. The subjective features are said to be that he had no previous history of violence and had accepted the guidance and counselling of various intervention programs since the original bonds were imposed.24 We are not persuaded that either the objective or subjective matters so described constitute ‘good reasons’ however relevant they might be in sentencing for the malicious wounding. We have already referred to the objectively serious features of the malicious wounding offence. The subjective circumstances relied upon by the respondent do not inform the conduct in which he engaged, that is, they do not explain or shed light on the respondent’s decision to join the assault upon the victim. They are irrelevant to the principal consideration under s 98(3)(b), namely, the conduct giving rise to the failure to comply with the conditions of the bonds. 25 In addition to these matters it was also submitted that the Court is obliged to inquire under s 98(3)(b) as to whether there is continued utility in the bonds remaining on foot as this would also constitute ‘good reasons’ for excusing the applicant’s failure to comply with them. No authority was offered in support of this submission. We consider the submission to be misconceived.26 As a matter of practical reality the qualitative assessment of triviality under s 98(3)(a) will invariably impact upon the enquiry into whether there are good reasons to excuse the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond under s 98(3)(b). However, as in this case, where the failure to comply with the bonds is the commission of another and objectively more serious criminal offence that cannot on any view be regarded as trivial, it would be unusual for there to persist good reasons for excusing the failure to be of good behaviour since to make that finding on the question of revocation goes very close to excusing the commission of the offence itself. Any matters merely mitigating, as opposed to excusing the offending, can be accounted for when sentencing for the offence constituting the breach. 27 We were also invited by Ms Francis to find that the penalty imposed for the breach was disproportionate to the seriousness of the conduct giving rise to it. In this regard she referred us to an approach taken to the construction of a section not dissimilar to s 98 by the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Marston (1993) 60 SASR 320, an approach to which Hidden J referred in DPP v Burrow and Anor at [25]. In that case his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        [25] Where the offence is relatively minor, it might be appropriate to weigh its gravity against the consequences of revocation of the bond, particularly where the suspended sentence is a long one. One of the matters to which King CJ had regard in Marston (at 322) was the “marked disproportion between the seriousness of the breaching offence and the length of the sentence which is activated by the revocation of the suspension”. (Of course, I am not speaking here of offences which are trivial in their nature, for which separate provision is made in para (a).) 
        
       
      
    28 In DPP v Cooke and Anor, Howie J did not consider it necessary to form a settled view on whether the approach taken in Marston should be followed when applying s 98(3)(b). We are of the same view. We also agree with his Honour’s observations that even assuming that a court could take into account the impact of the revocation of the bond, it would be a rare case where it would be appropriate to do so and such a consideration should not outweigh the legislative intention that significant and relatively inexcusable breach of a s 12 bond will normally lead to its revocation. This is not such a case.29 In the result, we are not persuaded that error has been demonstrated in the orders his Honour made, or that his discretion miscarried when he resolved to impose orders for periodic detention. In short, we are satisfied that there were no good reasons for excusing the breach and that the bonds were properly revoked. We are further of the view that the orders made under s 99(2) were appropriate.  
     
      
    30 Leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Crown Appeal Against the Inadequacy of the Suspended Sentence  
       
      
    31 As a primary submission the Crown argues that the suspended sentence should be disturbed on this appeal because of the operation of s 12(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        An order under this section may not be made in relation to a sentence of imprisonment if the offender is subject to some other sentence of imprisonment that is not the subject of such an order. 
        
       
      
    32 We do not regard that section as having any application where, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, the order for periodic detention (a sentence which is a sentence of imprisonment albeit being served periodically) was passed after the order suspending the sentence for the malicious wounding and, accordingly, at a time when the respondent was not subject to a sentence of imprisonment although he was subject to a suspended sentence. The fact that he was subject to a suspended sentence is not caught by s 12(2) (see R v JRD [2007] NSWCCA 55).  
     
      
    33 Given the conclusions we have reached in dismissing the appeal against the periodic detention orders, it follows that were his Honour to have initially approached the question of breach when the matter was before him on 28 September 2006, he would have revoked the bonds under s 98(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and then undertaken the sentencing exercise provided for in s 99 before determining what sentence should be imposed in respect of the malicious wounding. Assuming, as we do, the correctness of the periodic detention order on breach of the bonds, his Honour could not then have imposed a suspended sentence in respect of the malicious wounding – the conduct giving rise to the breach - because of the prohibition in s 12(2).  
     
      
    34 In this sense, the respondent had the advantage of the error in his Honour’s approach to the operation of s 98 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act identified in DPP v Cooke and Anor, in that when the matter was remitted to the District Court on 31 April 2007, and the proceedings on breach convened some time thereafter, he was already the subject of a suspended sentence imposed in respect of the malicious wounding on 28 September 2006, a sentence which, we emphasise, could not have been imposed if his Honour had approached the sentencing exercise free of error.  
     
      
    35 Even if s 12(2) is not a legislative bar to the passing of the suspended sentence, the Crown identifies additional bases which would compel this Court to conclude that a suspended sentence was a wholly inadequate penalty. 
     
      
    36 Principal among them is the submission that to impose a second suspended sentence was an inadequate denunciation of the respondent’s criminal conduct and, for that reason, the sentence undermines the principles of general and specific deterrence. It is also submitted that this error is compounded by the fact that the sentences of periodic detention imposed in substitution for the original suspended sentence, currently overlap with the suspended sentence for the malicious wounding and produce the result that there is effectively no punishment for that offence –an offence which the Crown submits is objectively more serious than the offences of break enter and steal or malicious damage to property.  
     
      
    37 The Crown submits that while full time custody should have been imposed in respect of that offence, given the fact of double jeopardy on a Crown appeal, an order for periodic detention should be imposed by this Court either wholly or partly cumulative upon the existing order. It is well recognised that an order for periodic detention is itself a lenient sentencing option and is outwardly less severe in its denunciation of criminality than full time custody (see R v Hallocoglu (1992) 63 A Crim R 287 at 294). If this Court were to re-sentence the respondent, the Crown submits that the periodic detention order could be crafted so as to allow for the fact that the respondent has spent some eight months subject to the good behaviour bonds.38 While it is clear that his Honour was conscious of the fact that the dictates of general and specific deterrence usually merit serious punishment for offending of the kind with which he was dealing, he took what can only be described as a benevolent view of the objective facts in so far as they relate to the respondent. He referred to what took place on 3 February as “aimless’ and although it was “reprehensible”, it was nevertheless “understandable” given the personal background of the respondent who was without an adult male in his life upon whom to model his behaviour. In imposing the suspended sentence his Honour was also persuaded by the fact that despite a troubled and sometimes violent family life and interrupted schooling, the respondent was, to his credit, making genuine efforts to turn his life around. He was developing a work history and appeared motivated to work when work was available as a tree lopper. His Honour also noted that the respondent had the support of various community-based agencies and considered that a suspended sentence “hanging over his head” would promote his continued co-operation with them.  
     
      
    39 We are of the view that a suspended sentence for fresh offending of a kind that involves physical violence, and offending that is aggravated by the fact that it was committed in company, was a manifestly lenient sentence. It failed to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence or to fulfil the manifold purposes of punishment where rehabilitation is one but not necessarily the most important consideration. It was patently clear that on 3 February 2006 the sentence of 15 months suspended by the Local Court 5 months earlier had not dissuaded the respondent from participating in a street fight and administering punches and kicks in the process. The fact that he had otherwise complied with the bonds and had progressed positively in other respects does not diminish the fact that the offending was a serious lapse.  
     
      
       
      The Residual Discretion 
       
      
    40 We are of the view that error has been established, however, in the discrete circumstances of this case, we have resolved in the exercise of our discretion not to intervene and proceed to re-sentence. We are particularly moved by the fact that while the bringing of the Crown appeal was timely, there has been an unusual delay in the disposition of issues raised by the appeal because it was necessarily heard in two parts in the Court of Appeal and then in this Court with an intervening proceeding in the District Court. This has been productive of uncertainty and disruption in the respondent’s life for which he bears no responsibility. We are also of the view that were the proceedings for the breach and the malicious wounding conducted free of error, his Honour would have been required to take into account the principle of totality when imposing a penalty for breach of the bonds and sentencing for the conduct giving rise to it. Since on re-sentence this Court customarily imposes a less severe sentence than would have been imposed at first instance, we consider that any order for periodic detention that we might impose would likely be of short duration.  
     
      
    41 In exercising our discretion not to intervene, we are also conscious that the suspended sentence remains in place with the good behaviour bonds expiring on 27 March 2008. Accordingly, the respondent is subject to both the benefits of the bonds and the penalties that are open to be imposed should the bonds be breached until that time. 
     
      
    42 Accordingly, the Crown appeal against inadequacy of sentence is also dismissed.

    3 HARRISON J: The appellant was tried on indictment by a jury before her Honour Judge Murrell in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney between 6 June 2005 and 17 June 2005. The indictment presented at trial pleaded six counts as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        3.1 Count 1: that on 22 March 1981 at Riverstone the appellant assaulted Christine Mary Lindemeier (née Varga) with intent to commit upon her the crime of rape. 
        
       
       
        
        3.2 Count 2: that on 22 March 1981 at Riverstone the appellant committed an act of indecency with a girl Christine Mary Lindemeier (née Varga), she then being under the age of 16 years, namely 14 years. 
        
       
       
        
        3.3 Count 3: that on 22 March 1981 at Riverstone the appellant assaulted a female, Christine Mary Lindemeier (née Varga) and at the time of such assault, committed an act of indecency upon her she then being under the age of 16 years, namely 14 years. 
        
       
       
        
        3.4 Count 4: that on 22 March 1981 at Riverstone the appellant did without her consent ravish and carnally know Christine Mary Lindemeier (née Varga). 
        
       
       
        
        3.5 Count 5: that on 22 March 1981 at Riverstone the appellant did commit with Christine Mary Lindemeier (née Varga) the crime of buggery. 
        
       
       
        
        3.6 Count 6: that on 22 March 1981 at Riverstone the appellant did without her consent ravish and carnally know Christine Mary Lindemeier (née Varga). 
        
       
      
    4 Count 1 was an offence contrary to s 65 of the Crimes Act 1900. By the operation of s 19(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the maximum prescribed penalty for this offence at that time of the trial and sentence proceedings was imprisonment for a term of 14 years. 
     
      
    5 Count 2 was an offence contrary to s 76A of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum prescribed penalty at the time of the trial and sentence proceedings had remain unchanged by the operation of s 19(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and was imprisonment for a term of 2 years. 
     
      
    6 Count 3 was an offence contrary to s 76 of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum prescribed penalty at the time of the trial and sentence proceedings had remain unchanged by the operation of s 19(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and was imprisonment for a term of 6 years. 
     
      
    7 Counts 4 and 6 were offences contrary to s 63 of the Crimes Act 1900. By the operation of s 19(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the maximum prescribed penalty for each of these offences at the time of trial and sentence proceedings was imprisonment for a term of 14 years. 
     
      
    8 Count 5 was an offence contrary to s 79 of the Crimes Act 1900 of which the appellant was acquitted. 
     
      
    9 On 17 June 2005 the jury returned a verdict of guilty on Counts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on Count 5. 
     
      
    10 On 23 September 2005 the appellant was sentenced in relation to these offences to the following terms of imprisonment: 
     
      
       
        
        10.1 On Count 4 to a non-parole period of 5 years to commence on 30 June 2005 and expire on 29 June 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years to commence on 30 June 2010 and expire on 29 June 2012. 
        
       
       
        
        10.2 On Count 6 to a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 30 June 2007 and expire on 29 June 2010 with a balance of term of 4 years to commence on 30 June 2010 and expire on 29 June 2014. 
        
       
       
        
        10.3 On Count 1 to a non-parole period of 5 years to commence on 30 June 2005 and expire on 29 June 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years to commence on 30 June 2010 and expire on 29 June 2012. 
        
       
       
        
        10.4 On Count 2 to a fixed term of 1 year to commence on 30 June 2005 and expire on 29 June 2006. 
        
       
       
        
        10.5 On Count 3 to a fixed term of 3 years to commence on 30 June 2005 and expire on 29 June 2008. 
        
       
      
    11 The aggregate sentence thereby imposed consisted of an aggregate non-parole period of 5 years to commence on 30 June 2005 and expire on 29 June 2010 with an aggregate balance of term of 4 years to commence on 30 June 2010 and to expire on 29 June 2014. 
     
      
    12 The appellant filed a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal against conviction and sentence, and a document entitled ""Grounds of Appeal"", each dated 11 August 2006. The appellant has notified 11 grounds of appeal against conviction. The appellant has also sought leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    13 It is important at this point to observe that the appellant appeared unrepresented in this Court. In addition to the documents referred to in the preceding paragraph, the appellant initially filed a series of four handwritten documents. The first document is headed ""Submissions"" and is one page long. The second document is untitled but commences with the words “Your Honour"". That document is two pages long. The third document is headed ""Statement of Fact"" and is nine pages long. The fourth document is headed ""My Trial - What I Think Went Wrong"". That document is six pages long. 
     
      
    14 In written submissions filed and relied upon in this Court, the Crown has emphasised that the appellant has filed no evidence in support of any of his 11 grounds of appeal, and in the case of some of the grounds of appeal, has made no submissions in support of them. It would appear that at the time those statements were made, the appellant had not served upon the Crown any of the documents referred to in the preceding paragraph. That had been corrected by the time of the hearing of the appellant's appeal in this Court and the Crown quite properly took no point in relation to it. The Crown was in any event able to prepare supplementary written submissions dealing with the matters discussed and described by the appellant in those four documents. The extent to which any of the material in the appellant’s four documents amounts to, or can be relied upon as, evidence in this Court is a matter to which I shall return in due course.15 The Crown has also emphasised that, despite notifying an intention to apply for leave to appeal against the sentences, the appellant had not filed any grounds of appeal nor made any submissions directed to such an appeal. Further, the appellant has filed no evidence in support of an appeal against sentence. These are also matters to which it will be convenient to return in due course.The conviction appeal16 At least five grounds of appeal appear to proceed upon the basis that the appellant did not receive a fair trial because of things done, or omitted to be done, by the appellant’s then legal representatives. The specific grounds of appeal which bring forth complaints falling into this category are the following: 
     
      
       
        
        16.1  
        Ground 1 
        : ""That my solicitor Ms Harris of the Legal Aid was incompetent - she did not heed any of my directions or instructions"". 
        
       
       
        
        16.2  
        Ground 2 
        : ""Three witnesses who were not called, or looked for (as case goes back 25 years ago) Ms Harris failed to look into"". 
        
       
       
        
        16.3  
        Ground 3 
        : ""That the medical evidence was [flawed] - no real challenge to it was made. No medical evidence was called on my behalf, such a person, a medical person, or doctor, to refute the [claims] of the victim's statement - where she [claims] she was a virgin at the time, but there was no blood on my sheets or [pyjamas], when I got them back"". 
        
       
       
        
        16.4  
        Ground 7 
        : ""That I was not permitted to give evidence or be cross-examined by the prosecution"". 
        
       
       
        
        16.5  
        Ground 10 
        : "" That a photo was used to [identify] Ms Varga to witnesses for the prosecution. It was a photo of the girl when she was 10 - not when I knew her - this photo was placed on the bar table some 7 feet from the jury, so when the jury came in or out of the Court they would see it"". 
        
       
      
    17 Ground 1 would appear to be a general ground of which grounds 2, 3, 7 and 10 are particulars. 
     
      
    18 The Crown submitted that there was no evidence that any legal representative appearing on behalf of the appellant at the trial failed to act appropriately on any direction or instruction that may have been given by him. In particular, so the Crown submits, there was no evidence that Ms Harris failed at any time to convey the appellant's instructions to Mr Chicken of Counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial. 
     
      
    19 The Crown had, prior to the hearing in this Court, attempted to obtain from the appellant a waiver of client legal privilege so as to enable representatives of the Crown to speak to Ms Harris and Mr Chicken and, if possible, to obtain a statement or an affidavit from them dealing with the appellant's allegations and complaints against them. Up until the day of the hearing in this Court, the appellant had declined to waive the privilege as requested. 
     
      
    20 However, during the course of the hearing in this Court, when faced with the reality that there was indeed no evidence before the court of any failings by Ms Harris or Mr Chicken of the type that the appellant alleged, the appellant agreed to waive the privilege. In the course of doing so the appellant also conceded that in fact his only complaints were against Ms Harris and that he no longer wished to maintain any complaint against Mr Chicken. 
     
      
    21 By arrangement with the Crown, Ms Harris was present at Court on the day of the hearing of the appellant's appeal. Presumably in anticipation of the appellant possibly waiving privilege, Ms Harris had prepared and sworn an affidavit that dealt, among other things, with the subject matter of the appellant's grounds 1, 2, 3, 7 and 10. It should be noted that neither that affidavit, nor any material which it contained, had been released to the Crown until after the appellant expressly waived his privilege in the way earlier referred to by me. 
     
      
    22 The affidavit in question was that of Joanne Harris sworn 4 May 2007. The Crown in this Court read it and Ms Harris was cross examined by the appellant upon its contents. 
     
      
    23 One of the documents annexed to the affidavit was a letter from the Legal Services Commissioner to Ms Harris dated 24 November 2005. That letter set out a series of six complaints made by the appellant to the Commissioner about Ms Harris's conduct as his legal representative at his trial. Those complaints were as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        23.1 That vital evidence was overlooked and not presented in the appellant's defence; 
        
       
       
        
        23.2 That Ms Harris omitted to call a crucial (unnamed) witness on his behalf; 
        
       
       
        
        23.2 That the appellant's instructions were not followed and his advice was disregarded; 
        
       
       
        
        23.4 That the appellant was intimidated and harassed by the media outside Ms Harris's office, in court and at his home; 
        
       
       
        
        23.5 That inappropriate photographic evidence was allowed to be used; and 
         
         
        23.6 That the DPP and Police lost his file and had to make up a new one. 
        
       
      
    24 Ms Harris replied to the Commissioner's letter by her letter dated 16 January 2006. A copy of her letter is also annexed to her affidavit. Ms Harris responded to the appellant's six complaints. In summary, those responses were as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        24.1 Considerable effort was expended in seeking out evidence to support the appellant's account. This included inquiries of the Attorney General’s Department to establish that the appellant received $14 witness expenses for his attendance to give evidence as a prosecution witness in an unrelated matter in 1981 and to the engaging of a private investigator seeking a potential defence witnesses in his own case. 
        
       
       
        
        24.2 Ms Harris was instructed by the appellant to locate a woman known only as ""Emu"". This woman was the mother of a young man (whose name was unknown) who was said to have overheard friends of the complainant say that the reason she fabricated the complaint against the appellant was because he refused service at the Riverstone Hotel Bottle Shop to underage teenagers in the neighbourhood. The appellant gave no further details of ""Emu"" and accordingly no further inquiries could be made. ""Emu"" turned out to be a woman called Robyn Watt. Her name did not emerge until during the course of the trial and did not appear anywhere in the brief. 
        
       
       
        
        24.3 Ms Harris denies categorically that she did not follow the appellant's instructions. It should be noted that on 14 June 2005 the appellant made an unsworn statement from the dock. The circumstances, including conferences and discussions with the appellant's legal representatives, which preceded the decision that led to the appellant making such a statement, instead of giving evidence in the proceedings, have not been identified in evidence in this Court. 
        
       
       
        
        24.4 Ms Harris agreed that the media harassed both her and the appellant and that the harassment continued throughout the trial. She denied that the blame for that could be sheeted home to her. 
        
       
      
      
     
      
       
        
        24.5 The Crown sought to show a witness a photograph of the complainant at a young age. Ms Harris had no recollection of that either being allowed or of the photograph being left within a view of the jury. The appellant did not bring his complaint to Ms Harris's attention in the course of the trial. 
        
       
       
        
        24.6 The charges against the appellant arose in 1981. The police retained witness statements, the appellant's record of interview, bench warrant and other documentary material. Copies of original documents were provided to the defence. Ms Harris said that neither the DPP nor the police ""made up"" another file. The police did not, however, retain, or had mislaid, physical exhibits, such as clothing and bedding taken in 1981. 
        
       
      
    25 Ms Harris also dealt with some miscellaneous matters raised by the appellant in his letter of complaint to the Legal Services Commissioner. It is unnecessary for present purposes to refer to these matters in detail. 
     
      
    26 The appellant was advised of the fate of his complaint by a letter from the Legal Services Commissioner to him dated 29 May 2006. 
     
      
    27 Cross examination of Ms Harris by the appellant in this Court elicited no matters of any assistance to him in his present appeal. 
     
      
    28 It is also important to note some matters raised by the Crown in its submissions in this Court in response to these grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    29 In the case of Ground 2, one of the three witnesses who the appellant alleged was not called at his trial was apparently a Mr Christopher Skinner. Ms Harris gave evidence at the appellant's trial of quite extensive steps that had been taken by her to locate Mr Skinner in support of an application to vacate the trial date. Ultimately Mr Skinner was located and called in the Crown case.  30 The Crown submits that, on the basis of the material presently to hand, this Court would not be satisfied that there had been a miscarriage of justice as a consequence of any failure on the part of Ms Harris, or any other legal practitioner acting on behalf of the appellant, to locate or to secure the attendance of any witness who might have been called at the trial to give evidence favourable to the appellant. Further, for cognate reasons, the Crown submits that this Court would not be satisfied that there had been a miscarriage of justice as a consequence of the absence of any witness who might have been called for the same purpose. 
     
      
    31 Just as significantly the Crown submits that there is no evidence that Mr Skinner was not asked questions which the appellant proposed should have been asked of him, or that even if such instructions were given, there is no evidence of the terms of the instructions or the questions. Accordingly, the Crown submits in these circumstances that this Court cannot now determine whether the appellant's legal representatives would have been duty-bound to comply with those instructions or whether it would nevertheless have been within their discretion to decline to do so.  
     
      
    32 In his written submissions the Crown pointed out that the appellant had not identified any other witness who may have been the subject of complaint under this ground of appeal. These submissions were prepared in response to the written material originally provided by the appellant. However, the appellant prepared some further written material (see below under the heading Further Submissions), to which it is necessary to refer in the present context. 
     
      
    33 At page 2 of his most recently filed material, the appellant made the following submissions in support of Ground 2: - 
     
      
       
        
        “I told Ms Harris the names of the witnesses, one was a worker, that had worked at the hotel, Richard Atkins or Atkinson of Riverstone. He was there in the bottle shop, the lad came and told us, ""I know you did not touch Kristy, because she told us, that nothing happened at the caravan on the 22nd March 1981, at the bottle shop at that time was, myself, Richard and Chris Skinner, when the lad told us, what he heard. Chris Skinner, said, ""are you telling the truth"", he told us he wasn't the only one who heard it, he said that Treise (sic Therese) and Joann (sic Joanne) and others had heard what was said, we had to stop there as more customers were entering the bottle shop, so I told him to come back later, so I could talk to him. 
         
         
        The teenager's name was Kevin or Jamie Watt (not Watts) he was about 14 or 15 years of age, he was the son of one of the drinkers of the hotel, a Ms Robyn Watt.” 
        
       
      
    34 This material should be compared with what appears on page 7 of the appellant's Statement of Fact referred to earlier. The relevant portion of that material is as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        “It was about a week or so, while in the bottle shop working, Chris Skinner (my boss) Rick (a worker) were talking, when this lad, one of the women, who drinks at the hotel, son, came up to us in the bottle shop and said to me, Hondo I know you did not do anything to Kristy. I said to him how do you know? Kristy Varga just told me and some others up outside the fish shop. Chris (the boss) said to him, you telling the truth? He said ""yes"" cause I am, I was not the only one who heard it. Just then some cars came, so we had to serve them, I said before he left come over to my van at 5 o'clock today, and we will have a talk. 
        
       
       
        
        So at 5 o'clock he came over, and told me the whole story - he believes they wanted me sacked because I would not sell certain people grog.” 
        
       
      
    35 The original version of the appellant's submissions contained no reference to a Richard Atkins or Atkinson. This person is not referred to anywhere else in any of the material to which this Court has been referred. That includes, significantly, the affidavit of Joanne Harris sworn 4 May 2007. In this respect it is important to note that the appellant's handwritten letter dated 14 October 2005, a copy of which forms part of annexure ""A"" to Ms Harris’ affidavit, refers to a failure by Ms Harris to locate a relevant witness, but does not refer either expressly or by implication to a Richard Atkins or Atkinson. For completeness, the relevant portions of the appellant's letter are as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
         
        “2. That Ms Harris had the name of one of my main witnesses mother, in her file, I found out this, after the jury went out. If this witness was used would have been found not guilty.” 
        
       
       
       ********** 
       
       
        
         
        “The DPP got all their witnesses to court, where two Crown witnesses withdrew their statements. One even said that the signature was not hers, on the statement, she showed the judge her own signature, the other one, said she could not remember anything. As you can see, these two people, heard the so-called victim, tell them that nothing did happen on the night of 22nd March 1981, just the same as my witness, who heard the same, but who was not called by my defence team, (the one that Ms Harris had the mother's name).” 
         
         
         ********** 
         
         
        “Why did Ms Harris keep, the mother's name of my witness away from me?” 
        
       
      
    36 In the case of Kevin or Jamie Watt, the position is slightly different. As with Richard Atkins or Atkinson, there is no reference to that person by name in the original version of the appellant's submissions. There is the reference to "" this lad, one of the women, who drinks at the hotel, son"". However, that information has to be read and understood in light of the position deposed to by Ms Harris in her affidavit of 4 May 2007, dealt with above at par [24.2]. Accordingly, Ms Harris was in no better position to locate this person than she was to locate his mother. Any alleged failure by Ms Harris to locate Kevin or Jamie Watt must therefore be considered in exactly the same way as any alleged failure by Ms Harris to locate Robyn Watt (or “Emu”).37 To the extent that the appellant relied upon an alleged failure by Ms Harris, or those representing him at the trial, to locate either Richard Atkins or Atkinson, or Kevin or Jamie Watt, the Crown made the same submissions as those to which I have referred at par [30] above.  
     
      
    38 In the case of Ground 3 the Crown points out that the complainant was medically examined within seven hours of the alleged assault and that the medical evidence disclosed that her physical condition was consistent with the account of non-consensual penile-vaginal intercourse given by the complainant to the doctor and to the jury. Moreover, it is uncontested that investigating police took the bed sheets and other items, including the appellant's pyjamas, later on the day of the alleged assault, and that those items were conveyed to appropriate experts for forensic examination and analysis. A forensics biologist gave evidence in the Crown case that he had examined these exhibits and gave detailed evidence in relation to blood components present upon them. Accordingly, the appellant's contention that there was no blood on the sheets or pyjamas when he received them back from the police does not, in its terms, recognise that there was evidence given in the trial that forensic material had been found on one of the sheets that was consistent with the blood of the complainant. 
     
      
    39 In these circumstances, the Crown submits that, on the basis of the material presently to hand, this Court would not be satisfied that there had been a miscarriage of justice as a consequence of any flaw in the expert medical or forensic evidence in the Crown case or as a consequence of any failure by the appellant's legal representatives appropriately to challenge the expert medical or forensic evidence led in the Crown case, or to call any expert evidence to meet it. 
     
      
    40 In the case of Ground 7, there is no evidence that the appellant was prevented from giving evidence at his trial, had he so desired. Significantly, although the appellant made extensive submissions in this Court, none included details of his having been prevented from giving evidence in any way at all. It should also be noted that, despite the version of events provided to this Court in the form of the appellant's handwritten documents, his dock statement made at the trial contained substantially less detail. Moreover, questions directed to relevant Crown witnesses concerning the alleged attendance of the appellant as a prosecution witness in other sexual assault proceedings, and in relation to the alleged threats made to the appellant, and the remedial steps taken by him as a consequence, appear to draw on considerably less detailed material than the material provided by the appellant to this Court. 
     
      
    41 In the case of Ground 10, the Crown points out that the trial transcript discloses that, in the presence of the jury, a photograph of the complainant was shown to a Ms Scott, and that the photograph was then marked for identification. The appellant’s Counsel took no objection to that process during the course of the trial. There is no evidence before this Court concerning the way that the photograph was dealt with or handled which suggests that the appellant suffered any relevant prejudice at his trial as a result. The photograph was only used when a witness, Ms Scott, denied recognising the complainant or knowing her by name in 1981. On being shown the photograph, Ms Scott acknowledged that she recognised the young girl in the photograph as someone she had known. 
     
      
    42 Ground 4 contends, “That the police evidence [at the trial was] false and misleading”. Particulars of this allegation are given in the document in which the appellant attempts to describe what went wrong at his trial. He alleges that detectives Samuels and Laney gave false evidence as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""These police officers gave false evidence, they told the court, that I never gave evidence in the mass rape trial in 1981 - or it might have been 1982 - the only person who could tell you is the victim of the rape. 
         
         
        The other police officer, detective Francis of Blacktown Police, is I believe the one who wrote the false file - this man told me, he was an expert with computers, and can make anything disappear. This man for some reason hates the sight of me (this officer was not around 1981). 
         
         
        This police officer blames me for making a complaint to the Police Integrity Commission when it was not me, but Miss Varga. 
         
         
        Ms Harris told me that Ms Varga was each-waying her bets for criminal compensation. Now while waiting out here for my sentencing hearing, two officers from the Police Integrity Commission came to see me, and made a tape recording of the interview. I have not heard back from them. I'm not holding my breath. You must know, the police, look after their own. . . 
         
         
        I just could not believe they sat in that box and lied. Out of the three officers only Detective Laney looked over at me, the other two Detective Francis and Detective Samuels, did not look at me once in all the time they were in the witness box."" 
        
       
      
    43 It was not suggested to either Detective Samuels or Detective Laney in cross examination that either was giving false evidence or may have been mistaken when they said that they had no recollection of ever having been informed of discussions concerning the appellant giving evidence for the prosecution in other sexual assault proceedings in 1981 or 1982. 
     
      
    44 The cross examination of Detective Francis was limited to the interaction of the COPS and CNI systems and whether, and in what circumstances, such systems might have put police on notice in the period between 2000 and 2004 that there was an outstanding warrant for the arrest of the appellant. There was no suggestion made in the cross examination of Detective Francis that he had destroyed evidence, falsified police records or otherwise engaged in any corrupt or criminal conduct to the prejudice of the appellant in relation to the charges the subject of this appeal, whether by reason of an erroneous belief held by him that the appellant had made a complaint concerning the matter to the Police Integrity Commission or otherwise.45 The burden of the appellant's material, set forth in great detail in his handwritten documents, was that he did not commit any of the acts alleged against him by the complainant. His account was that he returned to his caravan with the complainant following the end of his shift at the bottle shop shortly after 11.00pm. They watched television for about 15 minutes when there was a knock at the door. He was told to go and pick up his daughter who had asthma, which was quite bad. He subsequently took his daughter to the Windsor Hospital. He left the complainant behind in the caravan by herself. He left the hospital at around 3.00am and returned to the caravan to find the complainant asleep on seats around the table. He put a blanket over the complainant, put on his pyjamas and went to bed. This was approximately 3.45am. The next morning the complainant got up and left ""with a smile on her face"".  
     
      
    46 The appellant went back to sleep after the complainant left. About 10 minutes or so later he was woken by a knock at the door, which he answered, to be confronted by a girl yelling at him saying that he had raped the complainant. He denied this. He got dressed, left the caravan looking for the girl, and came back shortly thereafter. It was then that he noticed that his caravan had been cleaned and tidied but that the ashtray was not in its usual location. When he found the ashtray it contained cigarette butts with filters. He was a smoker but rolled his own. He concluded, and continues to maintain, that the complainant's assailant was present whilst he was at the hospital and that, presumably, the cigarette butts were evidence of that person's presence. 
     
      
    47 The appellant was subsequently charged and given bail. About one or two months later, there occurred what the appellant describes as ""a mass rape of a 14-year-old girl"". In circumstances that remain otherwise unexplained, the victim of that attack apparently made her way to the appellant's caravan when the appellant was there with his 10-year-old daughter. A day or two later detectives Samuels and Laney, the same detectives who were investigating his own case, came to see the appellant to ask him what he knew about this new incident. The appellant gave them a statement and ultimately gave evidence at what would appear to be a committal at what is now the Local Court in Liverpool Street, Sydney. The next day the appellant received threats, first by phone, then by notes left on his caravan, to the effect that if he gave any more evidence in the case in which he was a witness, something would happen to him or to his daughter. The appellant said that he had great difficulty contacting the detectives in order to tell them about this. The appellant said that he ultimately gave one of the notes to a sergeant at the desk at the Blacktown Police Station and was told ""he would put it in the file"". 
     
      
    48 The next day the appellant quit his job at the hotel and thereafter changed addresses on number of occasions. He was not ultimately able to contact detectives Samuels and Laney or to tell them of his fears. Accordingly, the appellant rang Police Head Quarters in the city and ""told them what was going on"". Three or four days later two police officers came to his door, gave him $200 together with a letter to Social Services and told him to pack. They told him that his surname was to be changed and that he should thenceforth be known as JMW. The detectives then took him and his daughter to Central Railway Station and gave him two tickets to Melbourne. They told him that they knew where they could find him. He stayed in Melbourne until his return to New South Wales about six years ago. 
     
      
    49 It can be seen that this narrative contains several references to the role played by the police in a series of events that led to, and went beyond, the appellant's arrest. No detailed evidence would appear to have been given of this version of events at the appellant's trial. The appellant's dock statement did speak to some of these events, including the circumstances in which he began to fear for his life, and those leading up to his departure for Melbourne. However, that statement was extremely short, running only to a little over one and a half pages of double-spaced court transcript.  
     
      
    50 For presently relevant purposes, apart from the material referred to in par 36, or by reference to the terms of his dock statement, the appellant has not in this Court sought to particularise the ways in which the police gave false or misleading evidence against him, if it be the case, or of ways in which the police either prevented this exculpatory version of events being given in evidence, or falsely contradicting it if it had been.  
     
      
    51 The Crown submits in this Court that, on the basis of the material presently to hand, this Court would not be satisfied that there had been a miscarriage of justice as a consequence of any false or misleading aspect of the police evidence given at the appellant's trial. 
     
      
    52 Ground 5 contends, “That the file [relating] to much of the evidence was missing (such as doctors reports, threats, in the form of notes, made against me and my daughter) - that was in the file"". It is not entirely clear precisely to which file the appellant is referring or where it might be located. 
     
      
    53 The Crown points out in its submissions that there was some evidence that the original notes of Dr Little were no longer available at the time of trial. Dr Little gave evidence in the committal hearing in 1981 during which she made direct reference to, and relied upon, her original clinical notes. When giving evidence at the trial, Dr Little relied on and directly referred to that committal evidence. Therefore, as the Crown submits, although the original notes were no longer available at the time of the trial, there was no shortage of evidence about their nature or contents and the evidence referred to by Dr Little, as her evidence given at the committal, was evidence before the jury.  
     
      
    54 However, there was no evidence given at the trial that there were any other missing documents that had, or might have, disclosed any record of threats, in the form of notes, made against the appellant and his daughter. Nor, according to the Crown submissions, was any evidence given or other material presented at the appellant's trial concerning the existence of any threats, whether in the form of notes or otherwise, that had been made against the appellant or his daughter. 
     
      
    55 Ground 6 contends, “That two [witnesses] of the [prosecution] withdrew their evidence (because the two people heard the victims say - that nothing happened on the night of 22 March 1981) some weeks after I was charged"". 
     
      
    56 It is not immediately apparent to which witnesses the appellant is referring. For example, the Crown points out that there was no evidence in the trial that Ms Scott had ever withdrawn her statement. Ms Scott gave evidence in the trial that she did not know the appellant, was not giving evidence to assist him, had not made the statement dated 22 May 1981 which was shown to her in the Crown case and had not signed it. 
     
      
    57 If one of the witnesses is said to be Karen Baldry (née Dickson), there was no evidence in the trial that she had ever withdrawn her statement. Her evidence was of initial complaint and other matters substantially confirming various aspects of the complainant's evidence. If one of the witnesses is said to be Joanne Marsh, there was evidence that, despite police efforts, she had not been located. Finally, if one of the witnesses is said to be Colin Brown, there was no evidence that Mr Brown had ever withdrawn his statement but there was evidence that, despite police efforts, he had not been located either. 
     
      
    58 Ground 8 and Ground 9 can be considered together. They are respectively in the following terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        58.1 ""That the media (namely Channel 7) did withhold evidence, did harass me and did school the victim into how to give her evidence"". 
        
       
       
        
        58.2 ""That Channel 7 did become part of the trial, instead of Ms Varga (the victim) reading out her impact statement, a Ms Anna Coren, a reporter for the TV show This Day Tonight (sic), read the statement instead"". 
        
       
      
    59 There is no evidence or other material before this Court to support the assertions made by the appellant that the complainant was coached in relation to her evidence. The Crown does not dispute that in the sentence proceedings a Ms Anna Coren read out the complainant’s Victim Impact Statement. This was permissible in the terms of s 30A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which deals with the reading of such a statement in court by the victim to whom it relates or a member of the immediate family, ""or other representative"" of the victim. 
     
      
    60 The appellant did not expand upon the way in which any harassment or other allegedly inappropriate behaviour by members of the media had, or may have had, an adverse impact upon the result in his trial. If the jury were said to have been exposed to prejudicial material in the form of inappropriate news reports during the course of the trial, no submissions before this Court made that clear. No application was made on behalf of the appellant to the trial judge raising any such matter and no evidence dealing with it was tendered in this Court. 61 Ground 11 contends, ""The victim and [prosecution witness] story did not quite match"". The appellant has filed no evidence and makes no submissions in support of this ground. 
     
      
    62 The Crown submits in relation to all of these grounds that, although leave to appeal against the convictions might be granted, this Court would dismiss that appeal. 
     
      
    63 Although for obvious reasons the appellant's case has not been articulated in this way, the appellant seeks, in effect, to rely upon the material contained in the four documents referred to in par 13 as fresh evidence in this Court. The Crown's principal submission in response to this contention is that the material contained in those documents does not amount to evidence at all in this Court. Upon the assumption that the appellant could, if so advised, have deposed to the truth of the material contained in those documents, that objection can conveniently be put to one side for the moment. 
     
      
    Further Submissions 
     
      
    64 This appeal was heard on 4 May 2007 and 28 June 2007. In the intervening period, the appellant prepared further written submissions upon which he sought to rely. They were received in the Registry on 31 May 2007 and apparently served on the Crown at about this time. The Crown took no objection to the appellant relying upon these further submissions. 
     
      
    65 They consist of eight handwritten pages and are signed by the appellant. They are dated 19 May 2007. With the exception of some further material in support of Ground 2 (see pars [33] to [37] above), they refer to the same matters with which the appellant dealt in his original written material and in his expanded oral submissions to this Court on each occasion. The Crown did not seek to file further written submissions in these circumstances but was instead content to rely upon the written material originally filed. Consideration66 The Crown's principal objection is that none of the material is relevantly fresh and that the appellant should not be entitled to rely upon it in this Court for that reason alone. 
     
      
    67 This Court has power to permit fresh evidence to be called at the hearing of an appeal, whether the appeal is against sentence or conviction. The principles in relation to fresh evidence were summarised by Kirby J in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “First, a distinction is made between ""new evidence"" and ""fresh evidence"". Fresh evidence is not available to the accused at the time of the trial, actually or constructively. Evidence is constructively available if it could have been discovered, or available trial by the exercise of due diligence. 
         
         
        Second, great latitude must be extended to an accused in determining what evidence, by reasonable diligence, could have been available at his trial [ 
        citation omitted 
        ]. 
         
         
        Third, the court is ultimately concerned with whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. The rationale for setting aside the conviction on the basis of new evidence or fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice. 
         
         
        . . . 
         
         
        Seventh, the concept of a miscarriage of justice is not an abstract investigation of truth . . . It is an investigation in the context of the adversarial nature of a criminal trial. Where deliberate tactical decisions are made on the part of the accused as to the evidence that should or should not be called, and the issues that should or should not be pursued, there is nothing unfair, and there will be no miscarriage, in holding an accused to such decisions, even though it is conceivable that other decisions or something else may have worked rather better [ 
        citation omitted 
        ].” 
        
       
      
    68 The ultimate question for the court to consider is whether, in the light of the evidence sought to be led at the appeal, there has been a miscarriage of justice of the trial: see Gallagher v R (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 295, 402 and 410. There will be no miscarriage of justice where the evidence was not produced at the trial by reason of a responsible decision of counsel not to call the evidence for tactical reasons: R v Ritevski (1989) 39 A Crim R 11. 
     
      
    69 In my opinion, none of the ""evidence"" upon which the appellant now seeks to rely can be characterised as either ""fresh"" or ""new"". All of the appellant's complaints, manifest in his several grounds of appeal, argue that the trial was mismanaged by his legal representatives, corrupted by influences such as the police from within, or uncontrollably and adversely affected by agencies such as the media from without. Criticism is also directed to the way in which individual witnesses either gave, or allegedly declined to give, evidence of the trial. 
     
      
    70 It seems to me that the appellant has not been able to point to any evidence that was not available to him at the time of the trial, actually or constructively. On one view, and in some respects, the appellant's case in this Court is that, by reason of the significant passage of time between 1981 and 2005, evidence may have been lost, or witnesses may have disappeared. The appellant, however, has not, in terms, agitated that as a ground of appeal in this Court, and has not suggested that any application to vacate the hearing date, or to stay the trial on that ground, was inappropriately or appealably rejected by the trial judge. 
     
      
    71 It should be noted that the appellant expressly disavowed any ground of appeal in this Court based upon any complaint about the way in which his counsel conducted the trial of his behalf. Accordingly, the principles enunciated in cases such as TKWJ v R (2002) 212 CLR 124 and Ignjatic v R (1993) 68 A Crim R 333, do not require consideration by this Court. 
     
      
    72 In my opinion, the appellant's appeal against conviction should be dismissed.The sentence appeal73 The appellant has filed no evidence in support of an appeal against sentence. However, in the Notice of Application for Extension of Time for Notice of Appeal or Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal dated 11 August 2006, the appellant says that he has had two heart attacks since he has been in custody, has also discovered that he has emphysema and has contracted, and is still suffering from, pneumonia. He has stated in his written submissions that ""I'm not in the best of health"". 
     
      
    74 The appellant also made oral submissions in this Court, which reiterated these matters. He also emphasised his age. 
     
      
    75 A Pre-Sentence report was before her Honour when the appellant was sentenced. That report included a history given that the appellant then suffered from a heart condition and high blood pressure. It was also apparent that the appellant had suffered from emphysema for approximately nine years. Further, a Medical Certificate dated 8 August 2004 from Corrections Health Service reported that the appellant had ischaemic heart disease. 
     
      
    76 Her Honour accepted that the health of the appellant was one of the matters that constituted ""special circumstances"" warranting an amelioration of the non-parole periods to be imposed. The aggregate non-parole period imposed was 5 years or 60 months. The aggregate term imposed was 9 years or 108 months. Thus, the ratio of the aggregate non-parole period to the aggregate term is 60/108 or approximately 55 per cent. 
     
      
    77 It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that, having regard to the usual ratio of 75 per cent provided by the terms of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, a ratio of about 55 per cent demonstrates that her Honour added very considerable weight to, and significantly ameliorated, the aggregate non-parole period on account of the ""special circumstances"" of the appellant's age, his state of health, and the fact that he will serve his sentence in protective custody.Consideration78 The appellant has not submitted that her Honour committed any identifiable error in the sentencing process. It cannot be contended that her Honour was not possessed of all relevant information concerning the appellant, including the precise state of his health. On the contrary, having regard to the very serious nature of the offences, and to the available maximum sentences, it seems tolerably clear that her Honour fell into no identifiable error, and that her discretion did not miscarry in any way.79 I am not satisfied, having regard to all of the circumstances, that some other less severe sentences than those imposed were ""warranted in law"" and should have been passed: see s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [79] and Sully J at [97].Decision 
     
      
    80 I would grant leave to appeal against the sentences and would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    Non-publication Order 
     
      
    81 For reasons that do not, for present purposes, need to be specified, this Court made a non-publication order with respect to these proceedings on 4 May 2007 “until further order”. On 28 June 2007 it was agreed between the parties that that order should continue in force for a period of 28 days from the date of publication of this judgment regardless of the outcome. That order is discharged with effect from the expiration of that period. 
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    82 Accordingly, I would make the following orders: - 
     
      
       
      1. Dismiss the appellant's appeal against conviction. 
       
      2. Grant leave to appeal against the sentences and dismiss the appeal. 
       
      3. Discharge the non-publication order with effect from the expiration of 28 days from today.

    JUDGMENT1. This is an appeal by a young man who has misbehaved himself in public. He was sentenced for this behaviour by the learned magistrate, sitting in the Local Court at Armidale, to one month imprisonment. He is appealing to me against the severity of that sentence.2. What happened is that it was Australia Day 2007. The young man whose name is Joshua Allan Booth, was at the Royal Hotel in Armidale. A man pulled up in a car nearby, Mr Booth walked over and approached the car. The driver of the car who was a stranger to Mr Booth thought that he was trying to assault him in some way, so he struck back at Mr Booth. Mr Booth responded by going back towards the hotel, pulling his pants and his underwear down to his knees and masturbating his penis in front of this stranger. I should add here that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that activity of masturbating his penis had any sexual overtone. I am satisfied that it amounted to no more than simulated masturbation.3. The victim was offended by the behaviour and reported him to the Armidale Police. The Armidale Police turned up at the hotel and told him not to go in. But he went back in. The police came back. The victim came back as well because he had lost something. The victim who initially did not want to press formal charges, to use the colloquialism, changed his mind and asked the police to treat the matter formally.4. Mr Booth was taken from the hotel and taken home. A few days later on 4 February 2007 he reported to the Armidale Police Station, and told the police that he had been drinking for a good part of the day. For this behaviour, the magistrate as I said, sentenced him to gaol for a month. 5. Joshua Booth has a criminal record. Most of it is related to driving. He has twice been convicted of driving with a prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood, one of them being the high range. That conviction was 2004 and he received a suspended sentence. He also drives his car whilst suspended. Another more relevant conviction is the conviction for behaving in an offensive manner in public. That occurred in 2005. Mr Booth who was called to give evidence by his counsel Mr O’Connor, explained that he was again drunk and on this occasion he had pushed an acquaintance over in the street. He was given a bond for that. He breached that bond. There is a pre-sentence report in respect of Mr Booth. It details his personal history. 6. His family circumstances: he had a very difficult upbringing, being cared for by his older sister for a good period of time. She was only two years older than he was. He left school at year 9 and has been in employment since, first in semi skilled areas. At the moment though he has a job as a miner. He has had that job since March this year, he told me in evidence. He loves the job, it is a very responsible job involving explosives. It pays well: he brings home about a thousand dollars a week. This has made a difference to his life. 7. There is a second thing which has made a difference to his life, that is a relationship. He has met Tammy McCallum and they have moved in together. The combination of his new job and his new relationship have resulted in a subduing of his behaviour. His new job involves him working long hours. He is not allowed to drink at all whilst he is working or before or after working, because he is not allowed to have any alcohol present in his system during employment. He and other employees are randomly breath tested. 8. He works from Monday to Friday either the day shift or the night shift. They are long shifts, hence he is alcohol free for most of the if not all of the week. He comes home tired and usually does not go out during the week. He and Tammy McCallum tend to socialise at weekends. His socialising now takes the form of attending barbecues rather than going drinking to excess with his mates.9. Despite a criminal record which is associated with alcohol, including this offence, driving offences and the previous offensive behaviour in public, Mr Booth does not consider that he has an alcohol problem. This is confirmed by the pre-sentence report, which is why the pre-sentence report assesses him as unlikely to benefit from supervision because he considers that there are no issues that need to be addressed. Hence the report recommends supervision only as a monitoring or punitive role.10. Mr O’Connor submits that the offence is not one which is an objectively serious example of this kind of behaviour. I accept that submission. As Mr O’Connor said, it was not a sexualised exposure. It did not instil that fear into the victim which a sexualised exposure would do. The victim was an adult male, it was not in a secluded area but in a public place. As he said it was a typical example of a street offence related to alcohol where his client was playing the fooling and being a public nuisance. I accept these submissions. He also emphasised the significant changes which have been brought to his life by his new job and his relationship. 11. Ms Mudge submits that the offence warrants a penalty more significant than a fine, I am inclined to agree with that submission. I too am concerned about his record which appears to indicate a tendency to behave inappropriately in public, usually as a result of drinking too much.12. What I propose to do is to impose a fine and to put him on a bond for a period of time. I should say that I am of the view that the offence is not so serious as to warrant a custodial sentence. Because I am of that view a suspended sentence under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  1999 is not an appropriate option. He has been assessed as unsuitable for a periodic detention order and unfortunately as unsuitable for a community service order, which might have been a good sentencing option. My own sentencing options are quite limited. Because of the necessity to deter Mr Booth from this sort of behaviour, I am going to impose a fine which is close to the maximum and I am going to impose a good behaviour bond for a year, but make supervision very much at the option of the Probation and Parole Service.13. Would you stand up Mr Booth. In your sentence appeal, under s 20(2)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine this appeal against sentence by varying the sentence of the magistrate in the following way. Instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment I fine you an amount of eight hundred dollars, and instead of imposing imprisonment I make an order directing you to enter into a good behaviour bond for one year. The good behaviour bond will be subject to conditions. There will be conditions of your bond that you will appear before the Court if called on to do so at any time during the twelve months bond. That you will be of good behaviour. That you will notify the Court of any change of your residential address and that you accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and any recommendations which that service considers appropriate.Anything else Ms Mudge or Mr O’Connor?MUDGE: I just think your Honour in relation to Probation and Parole Service, perhaps if the wording for the supervision being as long as considered necessary.HIS HONOUR: That’s right I was trying to remember what you said.MUDGE: Yes to accept the supervision for as long as considered necessary.14. And I make it part of the condition concerning supervision by the Probation and Parole Service that you accept that supervision for as long as the Probation and Parole Service considers necessary.HIS HONOUR: Anything Mr O’Connor?O’CONNOR: No your Honour.15. Mr Booth I’ve allowed your appeal. I think a month’s gaol was a bit heavy for what you did. You made a nuisance of yourself. I am satisfied you understood that. You behaved stupidly, I fined you a fair amount of money, you’ve got a good earning capacity. It just occurs to me, you probably want some time to pay, a month.MUDGE: Actually the formal orders are 28 days to pay.HIS HONOUR: Is that automatic order.MUDGE: Perhaps if your Honour--16. I allow 28 days to pay. And you’re on a good behaviour bond and I should have added for the purpose of facilitating you going into that bond you should report to the office of the Probation and Parole Service at Armidale, on or before Wednesday of next week 17 October 2007 at 4pm, so you’ve got a week to report. Anything else?MUDGE: No that completes the matter.

    1 GILES JA: The appellant was charged with the supply of 84.61 grams of heroin, an offence under s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He pleaded not guilty. On 31 November 2005 the jury returned a verdict of guilty. On 15 December 2005 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years commencing on 23 February 2005 with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months. 
     
      
    2 On 19 January 2007 the appellant filed a notice of appeal against conviction and an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The appeal and application were well out of time, and in early April 2007 he filed an application for extensions of time.  
     
      
    3 There was no adequate explanation for the delay until January 2007. The explanation given in the notice of appeal was that ""the forms"" were lodged on 15 December 2005, time was then occupied with applications for legal aid but to no effect, and there were difficulties because the appellant was without assistance and was moved between correctional centres. It is not clear what forms were lodged, and appreciation of the difficulties of someone in the appellant's position does not explain the delay which occurred. 
     
      
    4 However, the appellant and the Crown have been fully heard, and in the circumstances I consider it best to bring finality by extending time.  
     
      
    5 By the definition in s 3 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act supply includes possession for supply. For an amount not less than the traffickable quantity, by force of s 29 possession is deemed to be possession for supply unless the accused proves possession otherwise than for supply. The 84.61 grams of heroin exceeded the traffickable quantity.  
     
      
    6 The Crown case was that the appellant had in his possession heroin found in the false bottom of a red “Paklite” bag in the back seat of a Ford Falcon motor vehicle stopped by police on the Pacific Highway south of Ballina. The appellant was the driver, and Ms Christina Harris occupied the front passenger seat. The Paklite bag was the appellant's bag and contained some men's clothing, but in an ERISP interview an edited video tape of which was tendered in the Crown case the appellant denied any knowledge of the heroin. The ultimate issue at the trial was whether the accused knew that the heroin was in the bag.  
     
      
    7 The police were alerted to the motor vehicle by erratic driving. When it was stopped the police formed the view that both the appellant and Ms Harris were affected by drugs. The appellant got out of the motor vehicle and was slumped over, leaning on its roof. He was breath tested, with a negative result. What appeared to be needle track scars, including a fresh mark, was seen on his forearms. The same was seen on Ms Harris's arms. The appellant produced a wallet containing about $3500. He said he owned an internet design company.  
     
      
    8 One of the police officers asked Ms Harris to get out of the motor vehicle so that he could search it. He saw what appeared to be a syringe wrapper on the passenger front floor, and the appellant told him that there might be a sharps kit in the back. He found a sharps kit on the floor behind the driver's seat, containing drug paraphernalia and used syringes. He found on the front passenger seat side a small plastic bag containing a number of bloodied tissues and on the floor a hand-rolled cannabis cigarette. In the centre console of the vehicle he found a blood filled syringe. He asked who owned it, and Ms Harris said it was hers, that she mixed and injected something but then drew it back out. He also found $2300 in cash in the centre console which Ms Harris said was hers.  
     
      
    9 The police officer found the Paklite bag in the rear seat. It had a Virgin Blue airline tag bearing the name William Phillips. He opened the bag in the appellant's presence. It contained some men's clothes and toiletries. He asked who owned the bag, and the appellant said it was his. The officer removed the clothes and toiletries and found under cardboard creating a false bottom some plastic bags containing heroin. The appellant said to him, ""That's not mine. I never saw it before in my life.""  
     
      
    10 The appellant and Ms Harris were taken to Ballina Police Station, where they were interviewed. The appellant was taken to a hospital, where blood and urine samples were taken. When tested, morphine was detected which could have come from recent use of heroin.  
     
      
    11 In his interview the appellant denied any knowledge of the heroin. Some of his answers, while rather unclear, were to the effect that when he and Ms Harris packed they swapped bags so that the appellant used the Paklite bag for his clothes. In her interview Ms Harris denied any knowledge of the heroin.  
     
      
    12 The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. Ms Harris died prior to the trial. The appellant relied on the ERISP interview in which he denied any knowledge of the heroin, tendered in his own case an edited video tape of Ms Harris's ERISP interview and letters purportedly written by Ms Harris to which I will later refer, and called expert evidence directed to negating recent use of heroin. 
     
      
    13 The appellant's case was in essence that the jury could not be satisfied that he knew the heroin was in the bag, because it might have been Ms Harris's heroin put there by Ms Harris. An element of that case was that he had not recently used heroin, in aid of the proposition that Ms Harris was the current drug user and so the heroin was her heroin.  
     
      
    14 The appellant, who was unrepresented, relied on eleven grounds of appeal against conviction. He supported them by written and oral submissions.  
     
      
    15 A number of the grounds of appeal were complaints about the police investigation. It was said that the police had destroyed crucial evidence, namely the blood filled syringe and the cannabis cigarette, and had failed to test the sharps kit for DNA or to do any background checks on Ms Harris. It was said that the police failed to provide a video of the motor vehicle, which as I understand the appellant's submissions he contended would have shown that there was sufficient opportunity for Ms Harris to put the heroin in the Paklite bag. Of a similar nature was a ground to the effect that the result of the blood and urine tests was suspect and the appellant was unable to have independent testing since his portions of the samples were given to Ms Harris. All these matters are best regarded as suggestions that the Crown case was attended by such doubt that the jury's verdict was not reasonably open.  
     
      
    16 The Crown case included that neither fingerprints nor DNA from the appellant were found on the Paklite bag and the sharps kit. There was no suggestion in the evidence called for the Crown or through cross-examination that the syringe or the cannabis cigarette were unavailable or had been destroyed. The cross-examination appears to have been directed in part to the police “going easy” on Ms Harris and not treating her as the committed drug user which, again as I understand the appellant's submissions, he contended would have supported that the heroin was her heroin. But the appellant's counsel took that point as far as he must have considered he could have take it. Counsel could also have explored in cross-examination any question of timing and location material to an opportunity for Ms Harris to have put the heroin in the Paklite bag if his instructions had so warranted.  
     
      
    17 The police officer who gave the appellant's portions of the samples to Ms Harris was cross-examined with the suggestion that the appellant had not given his permission. The officer denied that this would have occurred without the appellant's permission, and produced a “Returned Property Document” signed by the appellant acknowledging that his property, including those items, had been given to Ms Harris.  
     
      
    18 The matters on which the appellant relied were raised to the jury's consideration to the extent to which his counsel must have considered appropriate, and none of them in my view casts doubt on the jury's verdict. In my opinion it was well open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty.  
     
      
    19 There was a ground of appeal to the effect that in letters written to the appellant Ms Harris had asserted his innocence. Extracts from letters purporting to have been written by Ms Harris were tendered in the defence case. One did say that the writer knew ""that the drugs found in your bag were not yours"". Thus this was raised for the jury's consideration, and what I have last said applies.  
     
      
    20 Under three of the grounds of appeal the appellant contended that the judge failed to give a proper circumstantial evidence direction, despite a request for it, with particular mention of such a direction in relation to the extracts of the letters purportedly from Ms Harris. It was suggested, as I understand the submissions, that the appellant was prejudiced in the eyes of the jury, because responding to a request for a direction that he did not have positively to prove alternative hypotheses, the judge said in the jury's presence, ""I think they have taken that on board."" This was suggested to have been an indication “that the Court had heard enough and let’s all go home”.  
     
      
    21 The judge gave full direction as to the onus of proof and that the appellant did not have to prove anything or give evidence, and an appropriate direction that the jury was asked to infer the appellant's knowledge that the heroin was in the bag from all the circumstances and had to be satisfied that it was the only reasonable inference to make and no other conclusion would be reasonable. The appellant's counsel asked his Honour to make it clear that the accused did not have positively to prove alternative hypotheses, to which the judge responded, ""I think they have taken that on board.""  
     
      
    22 In my opinion there is no deficiency in the directions in relation to circumstantial evidence, and the judge's response was appropriate. I do not see that the response could have been taken in the manner suggested by the appellant.  
     
      
    23 The summing up included reference to Ms Harris's ERISP interview and the extracts from the letters, and the judge told the jury that they should assess them and make such use as appeared to them to be appropriate. Counsel for the appellant had not made a point of either in his address to the jury, and the denial by Ms Harris in the ERISP interview of any knowledge of the heroin made it difficult for him to find support for Ms Harris putting the heroin in the bag without the appellant's knowledge. Had the judge spelled out for the jury why the letters did not assist the appellant, it would have been quite detrimental to the appellant.  
     
      
    24 In the appellant's written submissions he said also that in the course of the trial he saw a member of the jury nod and wink to one of police officers and say hello, and that the clerk representing his solicitor confirmed what he saw. There is no evidence this occurred. Had it occurred, and to the knowledge of the clerk, an application for discharge of the jury would almost certainly have been made. No application was made. This assertion should not be accepted.  
     
      
    25 Other matters were raised in the appellant's submissions, but do not assist his appeal. In my opinion, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.  
     
      
    26 The appellant's submissions in support of the application for leave to appeal against sentence referred to the sentence imposed by Judge Black on one Ogle, a sentence of 6 years with a 3 year non-parole period, as I understand it, contrasting the 84.61 grams of heroin with the commercial quantity of heroin and quantities of cocaine in that case giving rise to two charges and suggesting that the comparison pointed to undue severity in the appellant's sentence. He also referred to Judicial Commission statistics for the offence of supplying less than a commercial quantity of heroin, submitting that his sentence fitted in the upper range of the sentences, and provided a table of sentences for the supply of heroin printed from a database of the Public Defenders Office.  
     
      
    27 The submissions otherwise spoke of separation of the appellant and his mother and her poor health and separation from his daughter, and the hardship to them. They described difficulties that the appellant had encountered with other inmates in correctional centres, his achievements nonetheless in courses and becoming drug free while incarcerated, and his strategies for avoiding further criminal activity.  
     
      
    28 The comparison with the sentencing of Ogle does not assist the appellant. Ogle had the benefit of a 25 per cent discount for a plea, no prior record of significance and contrition. The statistics do not have details of the offending and the offenders’ subjective positions, and are of limited use. They do not point to the sentence imposed on the appellant being out of the range available for his offending and position.  
     
      
    29 Although the quantity of heroin was not large, it had a street value of about $60,000 and the judge considered that the majority of it would have reached the streets. The appellant was aged 34 when he was sentenced, and had an extensive criminal history in Queensland. He was not entitled to leniency. Personal and general deterrence were very significant, and in addition the offence was committed while the appellant was on conditional liberty as a result of sentences imposed in Queensland. In my opinion, the sentence was within the range of the judge's sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    30 The judge noted the separation from the appellant's mother and daughter and the hardship. The appellant can be commended for achievements and a change of direction while incarcerated, but neither that nor any difficulties with other inmates comes into consideration unless the sentencing by Black DCJ miscarried, which it did not.  
     
      
    31 The Crown properly drew to our attention that the judge said at the close of his remarks on sentence that he had taken into account charges of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of heroin and possession of 1 gram of cannabis. These were related charges, for which the judge should have separately sentenced the appellant. They were trifling in comparison with his possession of the heroin, and their effect on the sentencing cannot have been of significance. Despite this error, I do not think that any lesser sentence was warranted.  
     
      
    32 I propose the orders:  
     
      
      1. Extend the time for filing the notice of appeal and application for leave to appeal.  
       
      2. Dismiss the appeal against conviction.  
       
      3. Grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.  
       
      
    33 LATHAM J: I agree with Giles J.  
     
      
    34 MATHEWS AJ: I also agree. 
     
      
    35 GILES JA: They will therefore be the orders of the Court.

     HEADNOTE 
     
     
      
    FactsOn 28 September 2005, the appellant was convicted by a jury of the murder of Gurkan (known as Gary) Moustafa, who was shot dead on 15 February 2001 in his business premises, a mobile phone retail outlet on Victoria Road, Gladesville. The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 24 years with a non-parole period of 18 years.  
     
      
    The appellant was in the vicinity of the mobile phone shop around the time of the shooting. Shortly afterwards he went to the home of a friend, Jacob Compagnon, in Gladesville, from where he telephoned Jacob Compagnon. Jacob Compagnon returned home and agreed to drive the appellant to Danny Kalischer’s home at Kenthurst. In an induced statement given to the New South Wales Crime Commission on 10 August 2001, Jacob Compagnon said that the appellant had confessed to the murder of the deceased. However, at trial Jacob Compagnon said that that statement was a lie. Thereafter, the Crown cross-examined Jacob Compagnon pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) during the course of which the Crown read to Jacob Compagnon earlier statements he had made and his evidence at the committal in which he said that the appellant said that he had killed the deceased.  
     
      
    The Crown and counsel for the appellant agreed, with the trial judge, that the prior inconsistent statements could only be used in relation to the credit of Jacob Compagnon. However, his Honour directed the jury that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Jacob Compagnon’s account of the appellant’s confession was truthful and if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was the truth, then not only would they find the appellant guilty, but indeed, had a duty to do so.  
     
      
    The appellant appealed against conviction. The principal ground of appeal was that the trial judge misdirected the jury as to the use it could make of the alleged confession. Leave to argue this ground of appeal was required as counsel at trial failed to seek a redirection: r 4 Criminal Appeal Rules. The Crown submitted that, even if the appellant had established error in the trial judge’s directions, the Court should nonetheless apply the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) as there was no substantial miscarriage of justice given the significant circumstantial evidence in the case. Held per Beazley JA (Grove and Simpson JJ agreeing):(1) Evidence of prior inconsistent statements are admissible on a question of credit of a witness: [27] 
     
      
      Lee v The Queen  
      (1998) 195 CLR 594; [1998] HCA 60 (cited) 
       
      
    (2) Evidence of a witness’ prior inconsistent statements regarding an accused’s confession should not be admitted as evidence of the truth of the confession allegedly made by an accused. A trial judge may reject the evidence of the prior inconsistent statements. Alternatively, if the prior inconsistent statements are admitted, clear directions must be given to the jury about the limited use to which the statements may be put: [32] 
     
      
      Lee v The Queen  
      (1998) 195 CLR 594; [1998] HCA 60 (applied) 
       
      
    (3) Save for the passages of the summing up in which the trial judge stated that the jury could use the prior inconsistent statements only to assess Jacob Compagnon’s credibility, the directions given by the trial judge to the jury in relation to the use that could be made of the prior inconsistent statements of Jacob Compagnon were erroneous: [33]-[34] 
     
      
    (4) This is not a situation where the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) should be applied. The Court could not be satisfied that a jury would have necessarily convicted the appellant on the circumstantial case upon which the Crown otherwise relied. Accordingly, it could not be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred: [44] 
     
      
    (5) In order to obtain leave pursuant to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, an appellant must first establish at least an arguable case of error. Leave to rely on an error will only be granted where the appellant can demonstrate that the error led to a miscarriage of justice. There is a miscarriage of justice where, by reason of the error made, the accused may have lost a chance fairly open to him of being acquitted: [45] 
     
      
      South v Regina  
      [2007] NSWCCA 117 at [34] (followed);  
      Tekely v R; Nagle v R  
      [2007] NSWCCA 75 (considered) 
       
      
    (6) Leave to appeal on the ground relating to the trial judge’s misdirection to the jury should be granted. There was a misdirection of a significant kind such that the appellant may have lost a chance fairly open to him of being acquitted: [49]

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 28 September 2005, the appellant was convicted by a jury of the murder of Gurkan (known as Gary) Moustafa, who was shot dead on 15 February 2001 in his business premises, a mobile phone retail outlet on Victoria Road, Gladesville. The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 24 years with a non-parole period of 18 years. 
     
      
    2 The appellant now appeals against his conviction.  
     
      
    3 The principal ground of appeal was that the trial judge had misdirected the jury as to the use it could make of an alleged confession that the appellant made to a friend, Jacob Compagnon.  
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    4 The deceased had operated the mobile phone retail outlet with his brother, Kenan (known as Ken) Moustafa. The appellant is the brother of a previous owner of the store, Danny Kalischer. Adam Kalnins was employed at the store and was at work on the day of the murder. 
     
      
    5 There was evidence that Danny Kalischer owed Kenan Moustafa money and that requests for payment had been ignored. Kenan Moustafa gave evidence that in December 2000, the appellant rang him and told him to “leave Danny alone or you’ll get some more of the same treatment”. There was also evidence that the business had purchased $1,500 worth of phones from Ronny Kalischer, another of the appellant’s brothers. The arrangement was that the deceased would co-sign a cheque for the phones on his return from Melbourne. It appears that that did not happen and in late January 2001, Ronny Kalischer came to the store seeking payment. Kenan Moustafa told Ronny that he would be paid the following month. Kenan Moustafa gave evidence that Ronny was not happy with that. Ronny Kalischer subsequently made numerous telephone calls to Adam Kalnins demanding the money and Adam Kalnins reported this to Kenan Moustafa. 
     
      
    6 There was a further demand for the money on 14 February 2001, when Peter Kalischer, the father of the appellant, Ronny and Danny, rang Adam Kalnins. Adam Kalnins knew Peter Kalischer, as he had boarded with the Kalischer family for a couple of years in his late teens. Adam Kalnins handed the call to Kenan Moustafa who said that he would pay when he was ready. It was apparent from the evidence that Kenan Moustafa was delaying paying Ronny Kalischer until he had secured payment from Danny. There was otherwise an issue as to the content of the conversation between Peter Kalischer and Kenan Moustafa. Kenan Moustafa said that Peter Kalischer told him that “he’d fix him up if he did not pay”, but that he understood that to mean that Kalischer would issue a summons against him. Peter Kalischer’s version was that he said to Kenan Moustafa, “You’ll hear from me”.  
     
      
    7 The deceased was killed at about midday on 15 February 2001, when he was shot twice inside the mobile phone retail outlet. The first bullet passed through the deceased’s chest, while the second wound was to the back of the head. There was soot around the wound to the back of the head, indicating that the deceased had been shot at close range from between two or three and ten centimetres from the skin. There was no soot around the chest wound. The evidence established that the wound to the deceased’s head would have killed him instantly. It was not established that both the fired bullets came from the same firearm, although the ballistics and forensics expert, Christian Pietersen, gave evidence that both bullets exhibited similar characteristics.  
     
      
    8 There was no dispute that the appellant was in the vicinity of the mobile phone shop around the time of the shooting. He was first seen at about 10am, riding a red trail bike in a street that ran diagonally from Victoria Road from behind the phone shop and the adjacent business, a bottle shop, and a Caltex service station adjacent to the bottle shop. He was again seen at about 10.30am riding the red trail bike. At 11.16am, he entered the Caltex service station, his presence being picked up by closed circuit television (CCTV). At 11.30am, the red trail bike was observed being ridden from Victoria Road into Pearson Street and at 11.55am, Telstra technicians, who had seen the appellant earlier in Pearson Street, saw the trail bike rider on the western driveway of the Caltex service station. He entered the service station at about 11.55am and telephoned his brother Ronny Kalischer.  
     
      
    9 The manager of the bottle shop, Stephen Crass, gave evidence that at about 12 noon, he saw someone walking down the footpath at the front of his drive-in bottle shop. He said the body of the person was obscured, but he saw a pair of feet with white shoes and socks and noticed that the person was wearing a white helmet and carried a bag in front of him. The appellant had earlier been identified as wearing a white helmet when he was riding the trail bike and the CCTV footage taken at 11.16am showed him with the white helmet and wearing white socks and sneakers. Mr Crass heard police cars about five to ten minutes after he had observed the person walking along the footpath in front of his drive-in bottle shop. 
     
      
    10 The movements of Adam Kalnins and Kenan Moustafa during this time were also the subject of evidence. Adam Kalnins was seen on CCTV footage entering the Caltex service station at 11.20am. Adam Kalnins gave evidence that he had a conversation with the appellant in the service station at that time, asking the appellant if he was there to collect the money. Adam Kalnins told the appellant that the deceased and Kenan Moustafa were at the mobile phone shop. Kenan Moustafa left the shop at 11.50am to attend an auction in the city. At 11.56am, a minute after the appellant had rung his brother Ronny Kalischer from the service station, Ronny Kalischer rang Adam Kalnins. Adam Kalnins gave evidence that Ronny Kalischer told him to get out of the shop. He did so and went to the service station where he observed the appellant wearing a white helmet and goggles.  
     
      
    11 There was evidence that a “bang” was heard at about midday. Adam Kalnins returned to the mobile phone shop at about that time and said that he found the deceased shot dead. He made a 000 call at 12.02pm. At about that time, a courier walked into the shop and spoke to Mr Kalnins and also saw the deceased lying under a desk. Mr Kalnins said that he had not called the police, but had called an ambulance. The courier said that the police were needed and he went outside and flagged down a passing police car. This was between 12 noon and 12.05pm. At 12.14pm, the appellant telephoned Jacob Compagnon, from Jacob Compagnon’s house, also in Gladesville. At 12.48pm, the appellant telephoned Laura Saaib, with whom he had had a short term relationship and told her not to tell anyone that he had been at Gladesville that day.  
     
      
    12 The evidence to which I have referred was, of course, given in greater detail. However, the above provides an overview sufficiently to enable me to deal with the evidence which is central to the main ground of appeal. That evidence was as follows. Jacob Compagnon said that, having received the telephone call from the appellant, he returned to his home and agreed to drive the appellant to Danny Kalischer’s home at Kenthurst. In his evidence at the trial, Jacob Compagnon denied having any conversation with the appellant about the murder. However, in an induced statement given to the New South Wales Crime Commission on 10 August 2001, Jacob Compagnon had made this statement: 
     
      
       
        
        “4. … I got a call on my mobile from [the appellant] … It was during the middle of the day … [the appellant] said something like, ‘It’s a code five. I’m at your house, how quick can you get here?’ A code five means whatever you’re doing just leave … But I couldn’t leave straight away … I said, ‘It’s not straight away, about an hour.’ 
         
         
        5. I think it took about an hour and a half to get to my place at 8 Higginbottham Road, Gladesville. [The appellant] was already in the house. I assumed he borrowed the spare key to get in … He said something like, ‘You got to give me a lift. There’s a secret, but it dies with you’ … I think he was wearing jeans and a dark coloured shirt. I think he had a motor bike helmet and a backpack with him. Although he had a motor bike helmet, I didn’t see a motor bike.  
         
         
        6. We then went to my truck … [the appellant] said something like, ‘Give me your shirt’ … I took my shirt off and gave it to him … He put his shirt in his backpack he had with him. I was driving with no shirt. [The appellant] then said, ‘Drive past [the deceased’s mobile phone shop] ([which] is a mobile telephone shop at Gladesville, across the road from the old cop shop and next to the tennis ranch …) … I drove east along Victoria Road towards the city. When we went past [the shop] [the appellant] said, ‘Look at that.’ I looked and saw police and blue and white tape around the shop … As we drove past [the appellant] said, ‘I killed someone.’ When he said that I knew it was the secret he was talking about. I said, ‘Who was it?’ [The appellant] said, ‘Gary Moustafa.’ I said, ‘Which one was that?’ I think [the appellant] said, ‘It’s the short one, Ken’s brother.’ 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        11. A couple of days later I heard [the appellant] had been questioned about the murder and the police came back and found my girl’s car at his place … I think either I called [the appellant] or he called me to talk about the car. We arranged to meet at the cemetery near my house. It was early morning when I walked to the cemetery and met [the appellant]. I think it was the Saturday after the murder. I said to [the appellant], ‘Have you got rid of the gun yet?’ [The appellant] said something like, ‘Not yet, I gotta get it to get rid of it.’ I said, ‘Where is it?’ [The appellant] said, ‘In your roof’ … I said something like, ‘Get rid of it’ … 
         
         
        12. In my house we went into the bathroom and [the appellant] climbed up on the sink, pushed back the manhole and once you stand on the sink your head is pretty much in the ceiling. [The appellant] then pulled down something like a cotton moneybag. I said, ‘Give me a look?’ [The appellant] rolled the bag back so his fingerprints won’t be on it … [the appellant] handed the revolver to me on the bag. I handled with two hands with the gun on top of the bag. The gun was silver colour, stainless steel, but I’m not sure of the colour of the butt. By looking at the size of the barrel I estimated that the calibre was smaller than a 9 millimetre … After looking at [sic] I handed the gun back to him. [The appellant] then left my house.” 
        
       
      
    13 In his evidence at trial, Jacob Compagnon said that that statement was a lie. Thereafter, the Crown cross-examined Jacob Compagnon pursuant to the provisions of s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). In the course of that evidence, the Crown read to Jacob Compagnon his statement of 10 August 2001, a later statement of 29 August 2001, his evidence at the committal and a further statement of 18 February 2004.  
     
      
    14 In the committal hearing, Jacob Compagnon reiterated that the appellant said that he had killed the deceased. In his statement of 18 February 2004, Jacob Compagnon again said that the appellant told him to drive past the mobile phone shop and that as they drove past, the appellant said, “I killed someone” and, on being asked who it was, he said, “Gary Moustafa” and identified that person as being Kenan Moustafa’s brother. Jacob Compagnon also repeated what he had said in his earlier statement relating to receiving a telephone call from the appellant on 15 February 2001, saying it was “a code five” and requesting him to return to his house; that the appellant had made the request to be driven to Kenthurst and that he had said “There’s a secret but it dies with you”.  
     
      
    15 In his address to the jury, the Crown prosecutor invited the jury to rely upon Jacob Compagnon’s prior consistent statements as evidence that the appellant had confessed to the murder and that this evidence could be used as evidence of the appellant’s guilt. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, we have heard the evidence of Mr Compagnon since where he has withdrawn that and it is a matter for you working that out as to where the true version lies … But if indeed you accept that there was an admission order made by the [appellant] to Mr Compagnon, of his involvement in this murder, that he committed it, well, you wouldn’t have to go much further than that given the very strong circumstantial case, you will be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt without doubt that the [appellant] has committed this murder.” 
        
       
      
    16 In the absence of the jury, his Honour raised with counsel the question of the use that could be made of the prior statements of Jacob Compagnon. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The preliminary view I have formed is this; one, so far as Jacob Compagnon’s alleged confession is concerned, it seems to me that can only go to the jury, the prior inconsistent statement that he has made in relation to the confession must be confined to his credibility. I think I will make it clear that that would be second hand hearsay to say it was evidence of the truth of the confession. That would be limited, as I see it, to credibility.” 
        
       
      
    17 Notwithstanding this ruling, his Honour gave the following directions to the jury in relation to the Crown case in general and these admissions in particular. Having given general introductory directions, his Honour then stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is a trial in which the Crown has sought to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt in two ways. 
         
         
        First, by the evidence of an alleged confession by the [appellant] to Jacob Compagnon. Throughout my summing-up I will call that the direct evidence case presented by the Crown. 
         
         
        The second way in which the Crown has sought to prove its case is by pointing to a substantial body of circumstantial evidence from which it asks you to infer beyond reasonable doubt that it was the [appellant] who shot the deceased on 15 February 2001.” 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour then referred to the nature of circumstantial evidence. His Honour moved to what he described as “directions regarding the charge of murder and to isolate for you the critical issues in this trial”. His Honour explained the essential ingredients of the charge, the need for the Crown to prove the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt and gave a brief overview of the facts. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In his submissions the Crown has acknowledged that the Crown bears the onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt that it was the [appellant] who shot and killed the deceased on that day.  
        The Crown says that it has discharged that onus by proving the guilt of the [appellant] in two different ways. 
         
         
        First, the Crown argues that you will accept that on 15 February 2001 the [appellant] admitted to Jacob Compagnon that he had killed Gary Moustafa. I shall refer to this as the Crown’s direct evidence case and I will give you, as I have promised, details and more specific directions regarding this aspect of the Crown case shortly. 
         
         
        Secondly, the Crown relies upon what has been described as a circumstantial case. It has placed before you a considerable number of circumstances, depending on how you label them, some thirty in all, these circumstances being matters both before and after the shooting of the deceased and it asks you to infer or conclude from an overall consideration of such of those facts as you find proved that it was the [appellant] who shot the deceased very shortly before or after midday on 15 February 2001.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    19 His Honour then referred to the defence case, including the position it took as to Jacob Compagnon’s statements as to the appellant’s admission that he had killed the deceased. His Honour then reiterated the two ways in which the Crown was attempting to prove its case. In this regard, he again referred to the admission. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the direct evidence case is one that is based on the confession allegedly made by the [appellant] to Jacob Compagnon in the afternoon of 15 February 2001.” 
        
       
      
    20 His Honour then gave three specific directions to the jury in relation to the use that they could make of the alleged admission. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So the Crown, in relation to its direct evidence case, seeks to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, in the first instance by relying upon the confession allegedly made by the [appellant] to Jacob Compagnon. 
         
         
        Members of the jury, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Compagnon’s account of his conversation with the [appellant] on the afternoon of 15 February 2001, outside or near the shop at Victoria Road, Gladesville, was a truthful one, that is honest and accurate,  
        and 
         if you are satisfied also beyond reasonable doubt that the confession allegedly made was the truth, then you would find the [appellant] guilty. Because, in effect, you would find that [the appellant] had confessed the very fact of murdering the deceased on that day. This is what I described as the direct evidence case.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour then explained to the jury that the matter had become complicated, because Jacob Compagnon’s evidence in the trial had been different and that he had resiled from the statements that he had made, as well as resiling from the evidence he had given at the committal. His Honour summarised the effect of Jacob Compagnon’s evidence in this regard, namely, that he said that he had fabricated the confessional statements allegedly made by the appellant. His Honour then referred to another complication which occurred during the trial when evidence was given that the appellant’s brother, Danny Kalischer, had, it was said, attempted to coach Jacob Compagnon in the evidence he was to give. This particular matter is the subject of Ground 3. Having reiterated that Jacob Compagnon had said in his evidence that he had fabricated the confession, his Honour then gave this direction: 
     
      
       
        
        “So may I say this, quite simply: At the end of your conclusions, if, notwithstanding the warnings I shall give you regarding the way in which you approach or should approach the evidence of Mr Compagnon, you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the [appellant] did tell Mr Compagnon on 15 February 2001, that he killed Gary Moustafa,  
        and 
         if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt it was the truth, then your duty would be to find the [appellant] guilty of murder. 
         
         
        If, on the other hand, there is a reasonable possibility that the witness Jacob Compagnon may have fabricated the confession, then you are not entitled to find the [appellant] guilty of murder based on that confession. 
         
         
        That of course is but another way of expressing the following proposition; namely, that if there is a reasonable possibility that the confession was fabricated by Compagnon, then you will not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the confession was made, nor would you be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt for the same reason that it was the truth.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    22 At that point in his address, his Honour concluded the proceedings for the day and recommenced his address the following morning when he commenced dealing with Jacob Compagnon’s evidence in detail. His Honour, towards the end of his review of Jacob Compagnon’s evidence, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you do not accept Mr Compagnon as a witness of truth in relation to the evidence he gave before you, if you come to the view he was not telling you the truth generally, the question will still remain whether the various statements implicating the [appellant], particularly the confession in the earlier statements, are themselves the truth. In other words, can you be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of those various statements and evidence that the [appellant] admitted to Jacob Compagnon on 15 February 2001 that he killed Gary Moustafa, the deceased. You are of course entitled to make use of those earlier statements but, in relation to this alleged confession,  
        only to assess the credibility of the evidence he has given in the witness box 
        . As far as the alleged confession is concerned, you cannot use those earlier statements in any other way. 
         
         
        The Crown has asked you to accept that the [appellant] did make the confessional statement to Jacob Compagnon on 15 February 2001. The Crown asks you to accept beyond reasonable doubt that not only was the statement made by the [appellant], but that it was true. 
         
         
        Of course, as I have said to you a number of times members of the jury,  
        if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt 
         of each of those matters, namely  
        that the confession was made and that it was the truth then your duty would be to find the [appellant] guilty on the basis of the alleged confession 
        . That is because you would find that he had confessed the matter that is centrally at issue in this trial, namely that it was [he] who shot the deceased on 15 February 2001.” (Emphases added) 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour then warned the jury that before they could act upon the earlier statements made by Jacob Compagnon and the evidence that he had given at the committal, it was necessary to “act with considerable circumspection”. His Honour then continued to summarise the evidence in relation to the making of the statements. He pointed out that prisoners sometimes “work the system” by fabricating material, in the hope that they will receive some benefit. He stated that it was not every prisoner that did that, but from experience, it was known that many prisoners acted in that way. His Honour reiterated that, for the reasons that he had been discussing, the statements made by Jacob Compagnon to the Crime Commission and his evidence at the committal might be unreliable, because they had been fabricated to obtain a benefit. It followed, therefore, that those statements had to be approached with “considerable care and circumspection”. His Honour added: 
     
      
       
        
        “May I make it clear to you that I am not telling you that you should not accept those statements and evidence given by Mr Compagnon regarding the alleged confession. I am making no comment about it at all. I am not expressing any opinion about it and that is because it is a matter for you and you alone as to whether you accept Mr Compagnon beyond reasonable doubt in relation to the statements made to the various authorities at that earlier point of time.” 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour concluded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have said to you earlier if you were, however, to come to a conclusion that you do not believe what Mr Compagnon said in the witness box before you, it would not follow automatically that what he said in his statements to the authorities, the Crime Commission and the police in the earlier period was true. It is possible that Mr Compagnon may be lying before you and yet he may have fabricated the evidence before the Crime Commission. This is particularly so in relation to the confession. It would be obvious to you that if you were to find that Mr Compagnon lied to you in the witness box about anything, or indeed everything as the Crown has suggested to you, that would be a matter that you would be entitled to take into account in relation to his honesty generally. I do not need to tell you that or stress that, that is simply a matter of commonsense and based upon your own experience you could view the matter in that light. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        May I conclude on this topic in the following manner: You have to remember throughout your deliberations in relation to Mr Compagnon as a witness, particularly in relation to the confession that he originally said was made to him by the [appellant], that it would be dangerous to convict upon the evidence of a class of witness to which Mr Compagnon belongs, so if you were simply in this trial to take the evidence of Mr Compagnon by itself, ignoring all the other evidence, if that were the only evidence in the case, and if you are asked by the Crown to convict on that evidence alone on the basis that the [appellant] had made a confession, then clearly it would be dangerous to act upon that evidence alone in order to convict the [appellant]. You could do so, but you would have to have regard to the difficulties about his evidence generally, his position as a prison informer, and you would also have to be satisfied at the end of the day, after carefully examining the making of statements to the Crime Commission and the police station, et cetera, that you have been referred to, you would have to be satisfied at the end of the day beyond reasonable doubt, after you made that examination in fine detail, that the evidence of those statements was honest evidence, accurate evidence and reliable evidence. As I have said to you, you are entitled to examine those prior inconsistent statements as evidence against which you may assess the truthfulness of the evidence given before you by Mr Compagnon in the witness box.” 
        
       
      
    25 That concluded his Honour’s review of Jacob Compagnon’s evidence. He then decided that the jury should have a short break and, in the absence of the jury, asked counsel whether there were any matters that they wanted to raise. Both the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the appellant at trial responded in the negative. 
     
      
       
      First ground of appeal: misdirection in respect of confessional evidence 
       
      
    26 The appellant’s first ground of appeal was stated in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) the trial miscarried because of the admission into evidence of prior statements of the witness Jacob Compagnon which contained assertions of what the appellant had said to him, and which were second hand hearsay and inadmissible 
         
         
        (b) the trial miscarried because the learned trial judge did not give the jury adequate directions about what use could be made of the prior statements of the witness Jacob Compagnon which contained assertions of what the appellant said to him” 
        
       
      
    27 Although this ground of appeal raised two separate issues, the principal argument on the appeal was confined to the issue raised in Ground 1(b). Presumably, this was because counsel for the appellant at trial had agreed that the evidence was admissible by way of the various statements being read to Jacob Compagnon and because his Honour had indicated and it had been agreed by both the Crown and counsel for the appellant that the prior statements could be used, and only used, in relation to the credit of Jacob Compagnon. There is in any event authority that such evidence is admissible on a question of credit: Lee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594; [1998] HCA 60. The essential argument was that the trial judge failed to give adequate directions to the jury as to the use that could be made of Jacob Compagnon’s prior statements to the effect that the appellant had confessed to the crime. The appellant needs leave to argue this ground of appeal as no issue was raised by counsel at trial that the direction was wrong: r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) (the Criminal Appeal Rules). I deal with the question of leave below. 
     
      
    28 In Lee v The Queen, a similar situation arose as occurred here. A principal witness, Mr Calin, had made a statement to the police that the appellant, Lee, had confessed to the crime with which he was charged, namely, assault with intent to rob. He signed a statement to that effect and later confirmed that he was willing to give evidence about the matter. Sometime before the trial, however, he informed the police that he was not willing to give that evidence, because he had heard that he was being called “a dog”.  
     
      
    29 Mr Calin was nonetheless called as a witness at the trial, but in evidence said that although he had spoken to Lee on the night of the offence and had asked him about money that Lee had owed him, he did not recall any other conversation with the appellant. The prosecution then sought leave to cross-examine Mr Calin about what he had said in the written statement to police. Leave was granted and, in that cross-examination, Mr Calin admitted signing the document in which he had recorded the confession he said the appellant had made to him, but denied that the statements in that document were his.  
     
      
    30 The trial judge directed the jury that if they accepted that Mr Calin had told police what was contained in the written statement, that was “evidence of the fact that the appellant did say those words”. The High Court considered that the effect of the trial judge’s instruction to the jury, taken as a whole, was that if the jury were satisfied that the appellant had said those words to Mr Calin, they were a confession by the appellant to the crime with which he had been charged. 
     
      
    31 The High Court said that that direction was erroneous. As their Honours explained at [30]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… that evidence that Mr Calin had earlier reported that the appellant had confessed was not evidence of the truth of that confession. It should not have been received at the trial of the appellant, as it was, as evidence establishing that the appellant had committed the offence.” 
        
       
      
    32 Their Honours said further at [41]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence of Mr Calin's prior statements of what the appellant had said should not have been admitted as evidence of the truth of the confession allegedly made by him to Mr Calin. Because those prior statements of what the appellant had said went only to Mr Calin's credit, the trial judge could either have rejected those parts of the statements [(the  
        Evidence Act 
         1995 (NSW)] (s 137) or, if that course was not followed, would have had to give clear directions to the jury about the very limited use to which they could be put. In the circumstances of this case, the former course was to be preferred.” 
        
       
      
    33 As I have already said, in this case, during the course of discussions with counsel, his Honour had already identified the use to which Jacob Compagnon’s prior statements could be put, namely, that they could be used in relation to his credit. However, in the passages of the summing up to which I have referred, other than that in which his Honour stated that the jury could use the prior inconsistent statements only to assess his credibility, his Honour explicitly directed the jury that if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Jacob Compagnon’s account of the conversation with the appellant was truthful, that is, honest and accurate and if they were also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the confession was the truth, then not only would they find the appellant guilty, but indeed, had a duty to do so. His Honour further instructed the jury that, if accepted beyond a reasonable doubt, the confession directly proved the appellant’s guilt.  
     
      
    34 In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that the directions that his Honour gave, set out at [24] above, relating to Jacob Compagnon’s credibility, ameliorated, let alone corrected, his Honour’s previous express directions. Indeed, it may be that the jury could have understood these directions set out at [24] to mean that, having regard to the prior statements Jacob Compagnon made, then, if they did not accept his evidence in Court, that being the credit issue, they could reject his evidence and then accept what he had said in the prior statements.  
     
      
    35 The Crown submitted that Lee’s case was distinguishable in that, in Lee, the direction which had been given by the trial judge had only involved a single step process, whereas the direction given by the trial judge here involved a two step analysis. Thus, in Lee, the effect of the direction was that if the jury were satisfied that the appellant had said the words to Mr Calin, then those words constituted a confession by the appellant of the crime. In this case, however, it was said that the jury were directed that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had made the confession to Jacob Compagnon and, if they were also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that that was the truth, then their duty would be to convict.  
     
      
    36 I do not consider that there is any point of distinction in the directions given in this case and in Lee. Although in Lee, the precise terms of the directions are not given, I have already stated the effect of the directions as summarised by the High Court. Even on that direction, the jury could not have found the appellant in that case guilty, unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was true. Here, the trial judge stated explicitly what I consider what was implicit in Lee. 
     
      
    37 Senior counsel for the Crown also submitted that, the jury having been given those two steps, were implicitly being directed that they had to be satisfied independently of the confession of the fact that the appellant was guilty. In making the submission, senior counsel for the Crown had to concede that they were not so told explicitly and that the directions could have been better, to indicate that that was what they were to do. In my opinion, there was no such implied direction contained within his Honour’s directions to which I have referred. The direction was express and clear on its terms and, with respect to his Honour, was wrong, for the reasons I have given. Indeed, such an ‘implicit direction’ would have been superfluous. If they were independently satisfied of the appellant’s guilt, the reliance on the confession would be unnecessary. 
     
      
       
      Application of the proviso 
       
      
    38 It was submitted by the Crown that, even if the appellant had established error in the giving of the directions, the Court should nonetheless apply the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (the Criminal Appeal Act). The Crown submitted that the circumstantial evidence in the case, including other aspects of Jacob Compagnon’s evidence, was significant.  
     
      
    39 So far as Jacob Compagnon’s evidence was concerned, the Crown relied upon the appellant’s telephone call to him within 15 minutes of the shooting, in which the appellant asked Jacob Compagnon to return home. The Crown also relied on the evidence that the appellant had changed his shirt and washed himself and his bike with chemicals. He had retrieved a revolver from the manhole in Jacob Compagnon’s bathroom and had taken the revolver away with him.  
     
      
    40 The Crown further relied upon the essentially undisputed evidence of the sightings of the appellant in the vicinity of the mobile phone shop from 10am up until the time of the shooting. It was said that the need to be in the vicinity as an alibi for Adam Kalnins was weak and implausible as, if Adam Kalnins needed an alibi, it would be available from CCTV footage in the service station.  
     
      
    41 In my opinion, this is not a matter where the proviso should be applied. The presence of the appellant in the vicinity of the deceased’s business premises was, of course, highly significant. Nonetheless, there was no direct evidence that linked the appellant with the killing and no evidence that the appellant was seen entering or leaving the business premises. 
     
      
    42 Further, the evidence linking the appellant with possession and/or ownership of a gun was itself evidence which depended upon the credibility of the witnesses concerned. In Jacob Compagnon’s case, the trial judge had directed the jury, in the passage referred to at [24] above, that it would be dangerous to convict the appellant acting on Jacob Compagnon’s evidence alone. Insofar as other witnesses had given evidence of having seen the appellant in possession of a gun, Jacob Compagnon had recanted from statements to that effect made to the Crime Commission.  
     
      
    43 Senior counsel for the appellant also submitted that the evidence as to the appellant’s behaviour after the murder was consistent with his case, which was that the appellant had agreed to be in the area to provide a false alibi for Adam Kalnins, who was planning to do a standover robbery of the mobile phone shop. The appellant’s evidence was that Adam Kalnins had told him shortly after the event that the robbery had gone wrong. It was submitted that all aspects of his behaviour afterwards were consistent with the knowledge that the robbery had gone wrong.  
     
      
    44 I am not satisfied that a jury would have necessarily convicted the appellant on the circumstantial case upon which the Crown otherwise relied. Accordingly, it could not be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred. 
     
      
       
      Rule 4 
       
      
    45 Senior counsel for the appellant acknowledged that leave was needed under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to argue this Ground. The operation of r 4 was explained by Hunt AJA in South v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 117 at [34]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides,  
        inter alia 
        , that no direction or omission to give a direction at the trial shall, without the leave of this Court, be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction or omission by the appellant. In order to obtain such leave, an appellant must first establish at least an arguable case of error — in this case, that there was a misdirection. Next, leave to rely on an error where no point was taken at the trial will be granted only where the appellant can demonstrate that the error led to a miscarriage of justice. There is a miscarriage of justice where, by reason of the error made, the accused may have lost a chance fairly open to him of being acquitted. The authorities are collected in  
        Regina v Wilson 
         (2005) 62 NSWLR 346 at [19]–[21].” 
        
       
      
    46 Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that this Court should be wary of granting leave merely because counsel for the appellant at trial had provided evidence to the Court that there was no tactical advantage sought to be achieved by not taking the point at trial. He referred the Court to Tekely v R; Nagle v R [2007] NSWCCA 75, where Howie J said at [131]: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no explanation from trial counsel before the Court for failing to take the point. True it is that counsel might be so incompetent as to have overlooked such a grievous error made in a relatively short summing up but there is nothing otherwise in the conduct of the trial that indicates that this was a possibility. It can be accepted that there could have been no tactical advantage to the accused Nagle perceived by his counsel that might account for the omission to complain. But, as I pointed out in  
        R v Moussa 
         [2001] NSWCCA 427; 125 A Crim R 505 at [63], rule 4 is not overcome simply by showing that there was no tactical advantage for not taking the point at the trial. The real position is that where there is a tactical advantage discernable it would be difficult for the appellant to show that a miscarriage of justice arose from a failure to take the point.” 
        
       
      
    47 On this appeal, counsel for the appellant at trial had filed an affidavit in which he stated that he did not understand that when his Honour limited the use of Jacob Compagnon’s evidence of the appellant’s confession to murder, to credibility only, that the evidence could not be used as evidence of the fact. He said that it was for that reason he did not seek a redirection. He stated specifically that there were certainly no tactical reasons for not seeking such a direction.48 For the reasons I have given, there was a misdirection of a significant kind, such that the appellant may have lost a chance fairly open to him of being acquitted. It is apparent from the affidavit evidence that counsel for the accused did not appreciate the significant error in his Honour’s direction and that his failure to raise it before his Honour was not due to any tactical decision. Having regard to the observations made in South v Regina; Tekely v R; Nagle v R; and R v Moussa, leave to raise this ground on appeal should be granted and the appeal should be allowed on this ground. 
     
      
    49 Since preparing my own reasons, I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the additional comments of Grove J with which I also agree.  
     
      
    50 That is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. There were three other grounds of appeal which were pressed. Each of those grounds related to matters which occurred during the course of the trial. Whilst I initially expressed concern about the matters that gave rise to Ground 3, the trial judge had given a clear and correct direction and I am not necessarily persuaded that the appellant would have established error, or that it would have been appropriate to apply the proviso. However, the error in respect of Ground 1, in my opinion, is overwhelming and the appeal should be allowed. 
     
      
    51 It follows, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed and I would propose the following Orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Conviction quashed; 
       
       
      3. Order that there be a new trial. 
       
      
    52 GROVE J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Beazley JA in draft form. I agree with her Honour for the reasons which she has given that ground 1(b) which complains of the directions concerning the prior statement of the witness Jacob Compagnon must be sustained and that a new trial be ordered. 
     
      
    53 The submission by the Crown Prosecutor in his final address which her Honour has quoted was made on 20 September 2005. It was on the following day, in the absence of the jury and before the Crown address was resumed that the learned Trial Judge expressed the view that the evidence of the alleged confession claimed to have been made to Compagnon in the statement from which he was seeking to resile should be limited in its availability to the jury’s consideration of that witness’ credibility. That view was undoubtedly correct. His Honour continued to foreshadow some other proposed directions to the jury and both counsel confirmed that the matters raised were not “a problem for anyone”. 
     
      
    54 The summing up commenced on Thursday 22 September and the jury retired to consider its verdict shortly after 10 am on Monday 26 September. From time to time the Court was reassembled to respond to requests for further direction. The jury returned their verdict at 2.18 pm on Wednesday 28 September. The impugned directions were very much in the standard form in which directions are given in a case where the prosecution does rely upon the making of a confession in proof of guilt. That was not this case. 
     
      
    55 It is disappointing to note that neither counsel – and I have set out some chronology to demonstrate the considerable opportunity – seemed to have been alert to the selection of the inappropriate direction and his Honour did not receive any assistance from them. It should have been provided and they must bear some responsibility for the outcome which involves a potential third trial. 
     
      
    56 SIMPSON J: I agree with Beazley JA. I also agree with the additional observations of Grove J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: The appellant appealed against his conviction of one count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent and one count of aggravated indecent assault. The circumstance of aggravation was that the offences were committed in company. One of the co-offenders was Scott South who had also been convicted on a count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. 
     
      
    2 Prior to the hearing of this appeal, judgment had been delivered by this Court in the appeal brought by Scott South against his conviction: South v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 117. The Court in that case allowed the appeal. The ground of appeal that was successful in South’s case is also available in this case. For that reason, the Court made orders at the conclusion of this appeal allowing the appeal, quashing the conviction and ordering that there be a new trial. The Court indicated that its reasons for decision would be delivered at a later date.  
     
      
    3 I have now had the opportunity of reading in draft the reasons of Simpson J for joining in the orders the Court made. I agree with her Honour’s reasons and have nothing further to add.  
     
      
    4 GROVE J: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Simpson J in draft form. As her Honour has observed, the upholding of a ground of appeal in the case of the alleged co-offender in South v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 117, which ground is also available to the appellant, produced an inevitable consequence that this appeal must also be allowed and a new trial ordered. The concession by the Crown that this should happen was appropriate. For those reasons I joined in the orders made at the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
    5 SIMPSON J: Between 8 November 2004 and 1 December 2004 the appellant was tried in the District Court on an indictment that charged him with one count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent and one count of aggravated indecent assault. In each case, the circumstance of aggravation alleged was that the offence was committed in company. One of the persons with whom the appellant was alleged to have been in company was Scott South, who was tried on the same indictment on a single count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. Both men were convicted. 
     
      
    6 Three other men were alleged to have been present at the time of the offences. They were Leigh Perrin, Daniel Willemsen and David Annabel. In separate proceedings Perrin pleaded guilty to a charge of sexual intercourse without consent; he asked, pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that an offence of aggravated indecent assault be taken into account on sentencing. Willemsen and Annabel were also charged with aggravated indecent assault; it was proposed to prosecute these offences in a separate trial but the complainant declined to give evidence again, and they were ultimately discharged.  
     
      
    7 South appealed against his convictions. On 30 April 2007 this Court (by a bench of which I was a member) upheld one of his grounds of appeal, allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial: South v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 117. The appellant now appeals against his conviction and has sought leave to appeal against the sentences subsequently imposed (a total of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6½ years commencing on 18 November 2004, with a balance of term of three years, expiring on 17 May 2014). At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, the Court made the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      (2) Conviction quashed. 
       
       
      (3) Order a new trial. 
       
      
    8 These are my reasons for joining in those orders. 
     
      
    9 The grounds of appeal pleaded on behalf of the appellant largely, but not entirely, mirror those pleaded and argued in support of South’s appeal. Since the Crown has conceded that the ground of appeal that was there successful must also here succeed, and since that concession is clearly properly made, the appellant’s appeal must likewise be allowed. However, counsel for the appellant has raised additional arguments in relation to grounds of appeal that did not succeed in South’s case, and has raised an additional ground of appeal. In written submissions she contended that the additional ground casts new light upon one of the formerly unsuccessful grounds, but this position was modified, if not abandoned, in the oral presentation.  
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    10 The facts alleged by the Crown are set out comprehensively in the judgment in South. I do not propose to restate them in the same degree of detail. I will attempt to encapsulate them, without doing injustice to the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    11 The events giving rise to the charges took place in the late evening of 4 May 2003, and the early hours of the following morning. The complainant, who was then 18 years of age, was invited by Leigh Perrin (who was the former boyfriend of the complainant’s female friend, Romaine Gattellari) to join him and Ms Gattellari at a gathering. The complainant obtained permission from her mother and Ms Gattellari picked her up by car and took her to a house in Ruse, occupied by David Annabel. Shortly after they arrived, Perrin, Willemson, Annabel, South and the appellant arrived at the house. Alcohol was supplied to the complainant as was a white powder, which was some form of amphetamine. The complainant felt unwell and telephoned another (male) friend who agreed to pick her up. However, she did not know the address and had exhausted the credit on her mobile telephone and he was unable to do so. 
     
      
    12 The complainant therefore remained in the house. She felt dizzy and strange. She was carried to a bedroom by Ms Gattellari, Perrin and South. Ms Gattellari left the room. All five men were then present in the bedroom. 
     
      
    13 The appellant removed the complainant’s pants and underwear. She protested. He had penile-vaginal intercourse with her. This was the subject of the first count, of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. South followed suit, as did Perrin. The complainant was turned on her stomach. The appellant masturbated, and ejaculated. The ejaculate covered the complainant’s hair and face. This was the subject of the second count, of aggravated indecent assault. Thereafter, penises were placed in the complainant’s mouth, but she was unable to identify which of the men did this. Perrin attempted anal intercourse. 
     
      
    14 The complainant remained at the house until 11.30am with Ms Gattellari, who drove her, initially, to her own (Ms Gattellari’s) home, which was close to the complainant’s home. The complainant was feeling unwell, and at one point collapsed. At Ms Gattellari’s home the complainant had a shower. She slept on Ms Gattellari’s bed for a time. Ms Gattellari eventually took her home at 4.30pm. She had bruises on her inner thigh. 
     
      
    15 On seeing the condition of her daughter, the complainant’s mother screamed, and took her to a medical centre. From there she was taken to the Fairfield Hospital. She was examined by a doctor, to whom she denied having been sexually assaulted. (In the trial she said that she did this because she was “all out of it”, could not speak properly, and her parents were present and she did not want them to know what had taken place.)  
     
      
    16 On 14 May another friend of the complainant’s, Stephanie Munzone, visited the complainant. The complainant gave her an account (which appears to have been abbreviated) of the event in question. Ms Munzone persuaded the complainant to tell her parents what had happened. This she did, but not in complete detail. 
     
      
    17 On 16 May the complainant gave a statement to police. On 29 May the appellant voluntarily attended the Campbelltown Police Station where he took part in an electronically recorded interview. The interview was lengthy. It began at 4.29pm, and ran until 6.15pm, 1¾ hours. It extended to almost 500 questions and answers.  
     
      
    18 In essence, he agreed that he had been present at the house; that Perrin and South had, to his knowledge, had sexual relations with the complainant; and that he himself had masturbated, in her presence, to the point of ejaculation, and that ejaculate had struck the complainant’s face and hair. He denied having had penile-vaginal intercourse with the complainant. He claimed that she was a consenting party to the entirely of the events.  
     
      
    19 The appellant did not give evidence in the trial. He relied upon the answers given to police in the recorded interview.  
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    20 Initially, three grounds of appeal against conviction were pleaded. They were framed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The trial judge erred by giving inadequate and incorrect directions to the jury concerning the possibility of the appellant’s mistaken belief that the complainant was consenting. 
         
         
        2. The trial judge erred by failing to direct the jury in relation to the impact of the victim’s intoxication on proof of lack of consent, honest and mistaken belief of consent and recklessness. 
         
         
        3. The verdict is unreasonable.” 
        
       
       
      (Ground 3 was, at the hearing, abandoned.) 
       
      
    21 Following South’s successful appeal, the appellant sought (and was granted) leave to plead an additional ground, framed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “4. The trial judge erred in summing up the jury on the basis that the Crown case invited the jury to consider ‘why would the complainant lie?’.” 
        
       
      
    22 This was the ground that succeeded in South’s case, for the reasons there set out, and which the Crown properly concedes should have the same result in the present case.  
     
      
    23 Ground 1 is in precisely the same terms as Ground 1 as argued in South’s case. It was rejected. In my view, it should again be rejected. That this was inevitable was accepted by counsel who appeared on the application. 
     
      
    24 However, on behalf of the appellant it was argued that the failure to give direction concerning the complainant’s intoxication, which is the subject of complaint in Ground 2, adds weight to the deficiencies in the summing up said to have been identified in the Ground 1. 
     
      
    25 It was accepted that, the point not having been taken at trial, the appellant requires leave, pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, if this ground is to be argued. 
     
      
    26 Counsel relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court (in Banco) of South Australia in The Queen v Wilson, Tchorz and Young (1986) 42 SASR 203. There the prosecution allegation was that the three appellants had, after consuming alcohol with her, raped the complainant. Each admitted having had sexual intercourse, but claimed that he had done so with her consent. Each claimed that she was intoxicated.  
     
      
    27 It was put that this decision is authority for the proposition:  
     
      
       
        
        “Where there is evidence that the alleged victim was intoxicated, a direction should be given as the bearing of that evidence on the possibility of mistake as to consent.” 
        
       
      
    28 On my reading of the three separate judgments in that case, the decision does not support a proposition so broadly put. King CJ, having observed that no legal issue arose involving intoxication and that there was no evidence capable of raising issues associated with intoxication, noted that the evidence of the complainant’s intoxication was relevant to the defence contention that she, in a state of intoxication, engaged in voluntary sexual conduct in which she might not otherwise have engaged and which she subsequently regretted; and for the possibility of misunderstanding resulting from a combination of confusing signals given by an intoxicated woman and dulled perceptions by intoxicated men. He said that the evidence of intoxication was simply part of the factual context in which the legal issues fell to be decided. 
     
      
    29 His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “But I think that the  
        prominent place which the evidence of the alleged intoxication of the alleged victim occupied in the defence  
        case called for some reference in the summing up. I think, too, that the failure to mention the bearing of the evidence of intoxication on the possibility of mistake as to consent must be regarded as a defect in the summing up.” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    30 Leggoe J (who dissented in the result) held that the issue of intoxication was a factual issue for the jury (as to which adequate directions had been given); Johnston J took a similar approach to the Chief Justice, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, this was a case where,  
        since alcohol loomed so largely in the defence cases  
        and in the history of events leading up to the crucial acts, it would have been appropriate for the trial Judge to explain the significance of intoxication for the defences raised.” (italics added) 
        
       
       
      He added, however, that if that were the only criticism to be made, it would be difficult to conclude that the failure to make the reference constituted error in law by way of non-direction. 
       
      
    31 It will be seen that as King CJ and Johnston J reached their conclusions by reference to the issues as they had arisen in that case – King CJ referred to the “prominent place” which the issue of intoxication assumed; Johnston J to the fact that the issue “loomed so largely in the defence cases”.  
     
      
    32 This calls for an examination of the issues raised in the appellant’s defence. As I noted above, setting out the case he made by reference to what he told police when interviewed, he denied that penile-vaginal intercourse had taken place between himself and the complainant. The judge made it clear to the jury that the sexual intercourse alleged against him was penile-vaginal intercourse. He reminded the jury that there was some evidence of some of the men placing their penises in the complainant’s mouth, but pointed out that, firstly, this was not the allegation made against the appellant, and that the evidence was quite insufficient to establish that he had been one of those men. The Crown case was, as I have said and was made clear, of penile-vaginal intercourse. This the appellant denied had taken place. And this jury found against him. Consent was irrelevant to his defence to this charge.  
     
      
    33 There was, it must be said, a level of confusion in the address of the appellant’s counsel. At various points, he laid great emphasis on the drugs and alcohol that had been consumed by the complainant. At one, early, point in his address, he put to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “When in actual fact what happened was [the complainant] took a large dose of stimulant and she became hyperactive and she became disinhibited and she conducted herself in a way which she would not normally conduct herself.” 
        
       
      
    34 However, at other points, he reiterated what had been said by the appellant in the course of his record of interview, denying sexual intercourse.  
     
      
    35 Arguably, consent may have been an issue in relation to the charge of aggravated indecent assault. It was the appellant’s position, in his record of interview, that the complainant had been a willing participant in all of the events.  
     
      
    36 However, since there is to be a new trial, it is not, in my opinion, necessary to consider in detail either of the grounds concerning consent and intoxication. Those are matters which may properly be argued before the trial judge. 
     
      
    37 It is, in my opinion, unnecessary to consider the application for leave to appeal against sentence. That may also be the subject of submissions to the trial judge, should the appellant be convicted again.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: The appellant was convicted of a charge of conspiracy to import a prohibited import, being a commercial quantity of MDMA. He was sentenced to a period of imprisonment. He has appealed on the single ground there was not a trial in accordance with law in that the trial proceeded on more than one indictment. 
     
      
    2 An extension of time for the appeal is necessary. The Crown does not oppose the extension of time, and concedes that the appeal should be allowed. The concession was correctly made, and appropriate orders will follow. We should, however, explain why. 
     
      
    3 The defendant was one of a number of persons charged with conspiracy to import the MDMA. He and four of the other persons were tried together. The other persons included one Henry. Separate indictments were presented for each of the accused. The jury returned verdicts of guilty for three of the accused, including the appellant and Henry. 
     
      
    4 Henry appealed against conviction. His grounds of appeal included that the trial and conviction were nullities as the trial proceeded on more than one indictment. The appeal on that ground was upheld: R v Swansson; R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 67. The Court considered that it should not depart from the longstanding rule that there could be only one indictment in the one trial, the “one trial one jury” rule, and that any change should be left to the High Court. It considered that the infringement of the rule was fundamental so as to preclude application of the proviso in s 67 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Henry’s conviction and sentence were quashed and a new trial was ordered. 
     
      
    5 The High Court subsequently refused the Crown’s application for special leave to appeal. 
     
      
    6 The appellant’s position cannot be distinguished from that of Henry. Accordingly, the orders will be that the time for appeal against conviction be extended, that the appellant’s conviction and sentence be quashed and that there be a new trial.

     SAMUEL BIKHIT v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: At the hearing of the appeal of this matter, the Court was of the opinion that the sentencing process was flawed and that Mr Bikhit’s application for leave to appeal against sentence should be granted and that the appeal be allowed. The Court ordered that Mr Bikhit be released forthwith and indicated that the Court’s reasons would be published at a later date.  
     
      
    2 The formal Orders of the Court are set out in the judgment of Simpson J. I agree with the reasons stated by her Honour as to why the Court made its Orders. I also agree with the additional comments of Grove J. 
     
      
    3 GROVE J: This applicant pleaded guilty to two counts of being an accessory after the fact to frauds committed by brothers named Gomes. The victim of the frauds was identified as Scottish Pacific Business Finance (Scottish), a subsidiary of St George Bank Limited, which engaged in debt factoring. The Gomes brothers were directors of a company called Smartpak Australia Pty Limited (Smartpak), which had an arrangement with Scottish to sell their trade debts to Scottish in return for fees and charges to be made by Scottish. The applicant was a director of Egypco Chemical Australia Pty Limited (Egypco), which was a customer of Smartpak.  
     
      
    4 On two occasions Smartpak invoiced Egypco for goods which were never ordered or delivered. Hence the invoices were false. Smartpak presented these invoices to Scottish. As a result Scottish paid to Smartpak part of the amount of the invoices known as the advance. Scottish then turned to the trade debtor Egypco for payment of the invoices. The total amount involved in the charges was a little over $200,000. Simpson J has pointed out the anomaly in amounts when comparison is made with the charges against the Gomes in respect of the transactions involving Egypco. Egypco paid Scottish the amount of the invoices. On one occasion the amount which Egypco paid to Scottish was supplied by Smartpak. On the other Egypco paid the account itself but was reimbursed by Smartpak. Consequently Scottish sent to Smartpak the balance of the invoice less its charges and commissions.  
     
      
    5 The Gomes brothers were involved in factoring a number of other false invoices to different companies which had nothing to do with the applicant. It was said that Smartpak engaged in these arrangements of presenting false invoices in order to meet a liquidity problem. It was also said that when the scheme was detected there was a loss to Scottish of $1.3m. Neither counsel for the Crown nor senior counsel for the applicant (neither of whom appeared in the proceedings below) could explain how this loss was established. The facts tendered in the District Court did not elucidate the matter but that sum might represent a loss when, as it eventually did, Smartpak went into liquidation. 
     
      
    6 It is true that dishonesty on the part of the applicant can be perceived in his cooperation with the Gomes brothers in the negotiation of an invoice for goods which he knew had not been supplied. Nevertheless, in respect of the two matters in which he was involved, Scottish were paid the full amount of the invoices out of funds supplied by the Gomes brothers and following the “round robin” it would appear that the only persons out of pocket would be them, as Scottish had deducted its charges and commissions. No part of any deficiency could have arisen out of the Egypco transactions. 
     
      
    7 As I have stated, the applicant pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact and, whilst I can detect a detriment to Scottish in the sense that it made an advance to Smartpak on the basis of false invoicing, it is difficult to identify how the applicant is an accessory after the fact to that fraud. Perhaps it was intended by the prosecution to rely upon the payment (with the money provided by Smartpak) to Scottish after the factoring company sought to recover the invoiced debt, and that the applicant was an accessory after the fact in the sense that his action in making the payment obstructed the detection of the offence by the Gomes brothers in obtaining the advances to which they were not entitled.  
     
      
    8 However, neither counsel specified that this was the basis of the presentation of the charges. It is not articulated in that way in the statement of facts. The learned sentencing judge did not make a finding to that effect but he referred to the “agreed fact” that Scottish had incurred a loss of $1.3m. His Honour noted that, although that loss was agreed, it was disputed that it was due to the transactions which were the subject of the charges. He went on to say that the agreed facts in the cases of another offender and the applicant “expressly state that there was such a loss and that it was attributable to the actions of those offenders.” Although it is not entirely clear, I take that to be a finding by his Honour rejecting the contention that the loss was not due to the applicant’s transactions. However, as I have indicated above, neither counsel who appeared in the appeal could explain how any action of the applicant could have contributed to any loss.  
     
      
    9 The applicant has been in custody pursuant to the sentence imposed by his Honour for nearly three months. He gave explicit instructions to senior counsel to maintain his plea of guilty. In the extraordinary circumstances of this case, that is to say that the Crown was unable to point to precise facts and formulate what the criminality arising out of them for which the offender was to be punished, nor, I should add, was senior counsel for the applicant, I was, for my part, driven to the conclusion that the incarceration of the applicant for the time already served must be sufficient punishment for whatever misconduct he was acknowledging by his plea of guilty. In coming to that conclusion I took into account the potential liability of the applicant as an accessory after the fact along the lines abovementioned. 
     
      
    10 For those reasons I joined in the order that the proceedings be disposed of without imposing any other penalty pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    11 SIMPSON J: The applicant sought leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him by Mahoney ADCJ in the District Court on 29 March 2007 following his pleas of guilty to two counts of being an accessory after the fact to a serious indictable offence. By s 350 of the Crimes Act 1900 each offence is punishable by imprisonment for five years. On each count the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months, made up of a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of term of six months, commencing on 27 March 2007 (and to be served concurrently). At the conclusion of the hearing of the application on 21 June 2007, the court made the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      (2) Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      (3) Quash sentence. 
       
       
      (4) Re-sentence applicant under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 making an order under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to the effect that the proceedings be disposed of on the basis that no other penalty be imposed. 
       
       
      (5) Order the release of the applicant forthwith. 
       
       
      What follows are my reasons for joining in those orders. 
       
      
    12 The “serious indictable offences” to which the applicant was alleged to have been an accessory were offences against s 176A of the Crimes Act – defrauding by company directors. A series of such offences were alleged to have been committed by the two principal offenders, Alfredo Julio Gomes and Jose Manuel Gomes, over a period between November 2002 and June 2003. These were the principal charges, against the Gomes brothers, in respect of which the applicant was charged as accessory. Paul Enzo Baldini (the director of State Packaging Pty Ltd, another customer of Smartpak) pleaded guilty to three counts in similar terms to those charged against the applicant, and asked that a further two offences be taken into account pursuant to the provisions of Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“(Sentencing Procedure Act”). 
     
      
    13 Given the unusual circumstances of this case, it is necessary to set out in full the terms of one of the charges to which the applicant pleaded guilty. The second charge is, except for variation of dates and other particulars, in identical terms. The first charge appears in the Court Attendance Notice served upon the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        DETAILS OF OFFENCE/S 
        
       
       
        
         
         Crimes Act 1900, s 350 Law Part Code 35349 
           
            
             
              
             
            
          Accessory after the fact to a serious indictable offence  
           
            
             
              
             
            
          Between 9.00am on 01/11/2002 and 9.00am on 12/11/2002 at Marrickville  
           
            
             
              
             
            
          That Alfred Gomes and Jose Gomes between the 6th and 21st day of January 2003, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did, being a director of a body corporate namely Smartpak Australia Pty Ltd, defraud by factoring three false invoice (sic) in the name of Egypco Chemical Australia Pty Ltd for the amount of $104,164.72 to Scottish Pacific Business Finance a body corporate who had dealings with Smartpak Australia Pty Ltd, and, the Attorney General aforesaid (sic) charges that Samuel Bikhit the director of Egypco Chemical Australia Pty Ltd, knowing the said Alfred Gomes and Jose Gomes to have committed the said serious indictable offence in the manner aforesaid, afterwards, to wit, on or about the 28th day of May 2003 in the said state did receive, harbour, maintain and assist the said Alfred Gomes and Jose Gomes. 
         
        
       
      
    14 As stated in the charge sheets, the charges were brought under s 350 of the Crimes Act, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “An accessory after the fact to any other serious indictable offence [other than murder – see s 349] is liable to imprisonment for 5 years, except where otherwise specifically enacted.” 
        
       
       
      S 347 makes provision for the indictment, conviction and sentencing of accessories after the fact to serious indictable offences.  
       
      
    15 A “serious indictable offence” is defined in s 4 of the Crimes Act as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… an indictable offence that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of 5 years or more.” 
        
       
      
    16 The offences to which the applicant was alleged to have been accessory were offences against s 176A of the Crimes Act, which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whosoever, being a director, officer, or member, of any body corporate or public company, cheats or defrauds, or does or omits to do any act with intent to cheat or defraud, the body corporate or company or any person in his or her dealings with the body corporate or company shall be liable to imprisonment for 10 years.” 
        
       
       
      For the purposes of s 350, therefore, an offence against s 176A is a serious indictable offence.  
       
      
    17 From the material provided to the sentencing judge, and to this court, it is not easy to understand how the principal offences were alleged to have been committed. I will return to this. 
     
      
    18 The applicant entered pleas of guilty on 21 September 2006. Proceedings relevant to sentence took place in the District Court on 10 November 2006. On that date a document identified as an agreed statement of facts was put before Mahoney ADCJ.  
     
      
    19 The manner in which the prosecution case was presented was, to put it mildly, unsatisfactory. The statement of facts is remarkable for its level of obscurity. However, with the application of some imagination, and generously reading between the lines, it can be discerned that the Crown alleged the following. 
     
      
    20 The Messrs Gomes, who are brothers, were the directors of a company called Smartpak Australia Pty Ltd (“Smartpak”). The business of Smartpak was supplying various kinds of paper products. Both brothers worked in the business. In 1994 Smartpak entered into a “factoring agreement” with Scottish Pacific Finance Pty Ltd (“Scottish Pacific”). This involved Scottish Pacific purchasing invoices rendered by Smartpak to its customers. The purchase price was less than the face value of the invoices. Within a day or two of receiving the invoices Scottish Pacific paid a percentage on the invoice to Smartpak. This was called “the advance”. Scottish Pacific then recovered the balance from the customer, which it then forwarded, minus a “factoring fee” to Smartpak. The balance was known as “the reserve”. 
     
      
    21 The advantage of the arrangement to Smartpak was to ensure that it had a continuous cash flow and received money without having to wait until the customer paid. The arrangement so made was perfectly orthodox and many legitimate transactions took place. However the Messrs Gomes devised a means of raising false invoices which they sent to Scottish Pacific. This involved their creating invoices in respect of which no product order had been received and no product supplied. The false invoices all named existing known customers of Smartpak. These were customers who participated in the arrangement. When Scottish Pacific received the false invoices it paid, in accordance with the arrangement, a percentage of the invoice to Smartpak (that is, the advance). Thus, Smartpak received from Scottish Pacific money in respect of transactions which had not taken place, in payment for goods that had not been supplied. Scottish Pacific then sought to recover the balance (the reserve) from the customer. At the request of Smartpak, these participating customers paid to Scottish Pacific amounts owing on invoices they knew to be false. In order to have them do this, Smartpak provided them with funds. 
     
      
    22 The applicant became involved as an existing customer of Smartpak. He was the director of a company called Egypco Chemical Australia Pty Ltd (“Egypco”). On the two occasions represented by the charges against him, Egypco received from Scottish Pacific invoices relating to goods which it had not purchased and had not received. The applicant nevertheless paid the invoices to Scottish Pacific. On one occasion he did this using money provided to him by the Messrs Gomes; on the other, he paid from his own funds and was reimbursed by Smartpak. These transactions occurred in January and March 2003. Scottish Pacific was paid in full and, in fact, made its usual profit, by deducting from what it had received from the applicant, and before it paid Smartpak, its usual factoring fee. 
     
      
    23 The Messrs Gomes devised a system of record keeping which identified the invoices that were false. These were recorded in the computer system by placing a dot point after the product code on the invoice. By this means those who were aware of the arrangement could immediately recognise which sales were genuine and which were not. This was seen as indicative of the level of sophistication of the scheme implemented by the Gomes brothers. In my view, however, the scheme could hardly be described as sophisticated. While Smartpak, on the rendering of each false invoice to Scottish Pacific, received an immediate injection of some funds, it was obliged, once the invoices were forwarded by Scottish Pacific to the participating customers, to provide funds to that customer to pay to Scottish Pacific the amount on the full invoice. It then received back from Scottish Pacific something less – probably considerably less – than it had paid. Smartpak could not do other than lose money on the arrangement. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing proceedings 
       
      
    24 The applicant did not give evidence. No pre-sentence or psychiatric report was tendered. A Mr Arthur Essey gave character evidence in which he spoke highly of the applicant’s honesty and reliability. Written testimonials were provided by four other individuals. He was said to be “a sincere Christian”, generous with his time, money and energy, active in church affairs, and trustworthy. 
     
      
    25 On the day of the hearing a lengthy debate took place between his Honour and counsel for the applicant. During the course of this it was suggested that the proceedings against the Gomes brothers, and those against Mr Baldini, could conveniently be dealt with by the same judge. On 19 March 2007 those matters were listed before his Honour. The applicant was not present. Both Gomes brothers entered pleas of guilty to 12 charges of fraud as directors of Smartpak. These charges, too, all followed the same pattern with variations only in the particularisation of the offence. The second count appeared on the indictment in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Further that you between 1 November 2002 and 2 November 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being directors of a body corporate, namely Smartpak Australia Pty Ltd  
        did defraud  
        Scottish Pacific Business Finance Pty Ltd by factoring false invoice number 46142 in the name of Egypco Chemical Australia Pty Ltd for the $44,144.40 to Scottish Pacific Business.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    26 The seventh charge also related to Egypco, and alleged a false invoice in the amount of $20,589.36. It is to be observed in passing that the amount by which the Gomes brothers were said to have defrauded Scottish Pacific does not correlate with the amount specified in the corresponding charge against the applicant. That is also the case in respect of the second charge. The remaining 10 counts against the Gomes brothers made similar allegations of factoring false invoices, but in the names of various other customers of Smartpak. Each Gomes brother asked that a further 62 offences, listed on Forms 1 pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Sentencing Procedure Act be taken into account. The total of the frauds alleged against them in the 12 charges is $389,144.72. However, that did not accurately reflect the case sought to be made against them by the prosecution. 
     
      
    27 A chartered accountant in the employ of the NSW Police Fraud Squad (Mr John Fogarty) gave evidence (in the Gomes proceedings) to explain the transactions. In cross-examination he agreed that, in respect of these transactions – that is, the transactions the subject of the 12 charges against the Gomes brothers – Scottish Pacific had been paid in full and was not out of pocket. These included the two counts involving Egypco, to which the applicant was alleged to have been an accessory.  
     
      
    28 As I understand the transcript, including the transcript of argument, the prosecution sought to establish that Scottish Pacific was out of pocket because Smartpak subsequently went into liquidation owing Scottish Pacific $1.3 million. Just how this came about was never fully explained. I assume that this represents the quantum attributable to false invoices outstanding on Smartpak’s liquidation. Obviously, in those circumstances, it could no longer fund the payments, through its customers, to Scottish Pacific.  
     
      
    29 The charges to which the applicant pleaded guilty involved, in total, so it was said, fraud on Scottish Pacific amounting to $212,354.23, although, as I have commented above, this was not the amount by which the Gomes brothers were alleged to have defrauded Scottish Pacific in respect of the Egypco transactions. That was a total of $64,733.76. The discrepancy was not, apparently, observed by any involved in the District Court proceedings and was never explained. 
     
      
    30 Mahoney ADCJ proceeded to sentence all four offenders on the same date, 29 March 2007.  
     
      
    31 His Honour sentenced the Gomes brothers identically to one another. The sentences imposed were in three tranches. On Counts 6 and 11 they were sentenced to fixed terms of imprisonment of 16 months commencing on 29 March 2007; on Counts 4, 5, 7 and 9, to sentences which his Honour expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Non-parole periods of 69 weeks imprisonment … commencing on 29 September 2007 and ending on 25 July 2008 and a total term of 23 months commencing on 29 September 2007 and ending on 28 August 2009.”; 
        
       
       
      and on each of Counts 1, 2, 3, 8, 10 and 12, to imprisonment for 47 months, commencing on 8 March 2008, with non-parole periods of two years, expiring on 7 March 2010. 
       
       
      (The date of 25 July 2008 in the sentences imposed in relation to the second tranche appears to be a transcription error, since his Honour went on to specify that their earliest date of eligibility for parole was 28 July 2008.) 
       
      
    32 The non-parole period of 69 weeks translates to about 15 months; however, on the dates specified, the non-parole period is one of 10 months, with a balance of term of 13 months, a total head sentence of 23 months. All this appears to yield an overall head sentence of four years 10 months and 9 days with a non-parole period of two years 11 months and 22 days, and a balance of term of approximately 57¼ months. In sentencing the Gomes brothers Mahoney ADCJ stated his intention of allowing each a discount, pursuant to the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, in recognition of their pleas of guilty, of an unusually high 35 percent. Mr Baldini was sentenced to an aggregate total term of 2½ years, with a non-parole period of 2 years. He also was given a 35 percent discount, referable to the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty, together with an offer of “worthwhile assistance to the authorites”.  
     
      
    33 There is no application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on the Gomes brothers and it is unnecessary further to attempt to sort out this rather unusual sentencing process. It is, however, necessary to note the Gomes sentences, because one of the grounds raised on behalf of the applicant concerned parity of sentencing, having regard to the extent of their relative criminality.  
     
      
       
      The remarks on sentence 
       
      
    34 The sentencing itself took an unusual course. The remarks on sentence run to a little over 41 pages of transcript. His Honour opened by observing that the remarks would be “very long”. He provided to counsel a “draft typescript” of his remarks, announced the sentences, and then proceeded to read from that document. 
     
      
    35 Quoting from the statement of facts tendered against the applicant, he said that Scottish Pacific had: 
     
      
       
        
        “… suffered a $1.3 million loss as a result of the alleged fraud committed by the directors of Smartpak  
        and the customers identified as being involved in the fraud  
        … 
         
         
        In summary the actions of the offenders assisted the directors of Smartpak to maintain the fraud 
        .” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    36 He then referred to submissions made on behalf of the various offenders as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Messrs Gomes, in their evidence in this Court, and the legal representatives of all four accused presently standing for sentence, strenuously submit – with one exception which I will mention shortly – that Scottish had sustained no financial loss as a result of anything their respective clients had done with regard to Transactions 1 to 24 inclusive … 
         
         
        The exception mentioned above was the submission put on behalf of Mr Baldini that his involvement in the offences did not cause Scottish to suffer any loss and that any loss which might have been sustained by Scottish would have been confined to the investigation of the matter and the costs associated with the liquidation. When asked to reconcile this submission with the agreed fact that Scottish had incurred a loss of $1,300,000, the explanation offered was in these terms:  
         
         
          
          ‘The loss is agreed but not due to the transactions the subject of the charges’.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      He concluded: 
       
        
         
        “These submissions on behalf of all the accused are not sustainable in light of contested (sic - ? uncontested) evidence in the case. The agreed facts in the cases of Mr Baldini and Mr Bikhit expressly state that there was such a loss and that it was attributable to the actions of those offenders.” 
        
       
      
    37 His Honour then made the following finding: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all four of the offenders presently before this court and all the business entities referred to in exhibits 5 and 6 [these were the statements of facts tendered against the Gomes brothers] were hand in glove with one another and were fully aware in all presently relevant respects of why Smartpak was raising the sham invoices presently in question. As with a burglar and a receiver of stolen goods, there would have been no defrauding of Scottish by Smartpak, using sham invoices, without the sort of cooperation provided by the persons charged as accessory.” 
        
       
      
    38 His Honour found, in respect of Mr Baldini, that the three offences admitted by him were “in the high range of seriousness”; he held that the two offences committed by the applicant were also “in the high range of seriousness”, but less so than those of Mr Baldini. He gave two reasons for this:  
     
      
       
        
        “First, because his crimes are only two thirds the number and approximate value of Mr Baldini’s; and secondly, he made each repayment to Scottish only two calendar months after receiving the repayment demand.” 
        
       
       
      He considered it noteworthy that the second repayment was made before he had been provided by Smartpak with the funds to do so. 
       
      
    39 In contrast to the 35 percent discount he allowed on sentence for each of the Gomes brothers and Mr Baldini, he allowed the applicant only 25 percent. He gave no reasons for this discrepancy. 
     
      
    40 He found, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, that special circumstances existed justifying departure from the statutory ratio between the head sentence and non-parole period that would otherwise have been applicable. This finding applied to all four offenders. At the conclusion of this lengthy procedure, his Honour imposed the sentences I have already mentioned, which he had already announced. Immediately before he did so, counsel for the applicant asked that he defer the actual passing of sentence in order to consider whether the applicant would be suitable for an order, pursuant to Pt 6 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, that the applicant serve his sentence in home detention. Without calling on the Crown, the Judge rejected that application. 
     
      
       
      The application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    41 On behalf of the applicant it was contended that: 
     
      
       
        
        “In their own right the sentences were too severe.” 
        
       
      
    42 Heavy reliance was placed upon the circumstance that no loss was occasioned (by the two transactions in which the applicant was involved) to Scottish Pacific; that the applicant neither sought nor received any benefit from the transactions; and that the applicant was not shown to have been aware of the larger scheme being operated by the Gomes brothers. It was contended that error could be shown in the assessment of the objective criminality of the applicant as being “in the high range of seriousness”. The final of these (no loss to Scottish Pacific) was contrary to an express statement contained in the agreed facts and was the subject of express rejection by his Honour.  
     
      
    43 Also challenged was the finding that all those involved: 
     
      
       
        
        “… were hand in glove with one another and were fully aware in all presently relevant respects of why Smartpak was raising the sham invoices …” 
        
       
       
      This, it was argued, infected the sentencing process because the applicant was sentenced on an erroneous assessment of his objective criminality.  
       
      
    44 A parity argument was also advanced, although this is more properly characterised as a “disparity” argument – the contention being that the criminality of the Gomes brothers was so significantly greater than that of the applicant that the sentences imposed ought to have themselves contained a greater element of disparity. It was pointed out that the total sentence imposed upon the applicant amounted to approximately one-third of the total of those imposed upon the Gomes brothers. It may here be observed that they pleaded guilty as principals to 12 charges of offences carrying maximum penalties of 10 years’ imprisonment, involving an elaborate (though remarkably foolish) scheme, together with acknowledging their guilt of another 62 such offences. This suggests that there is considerable merit in this aspect of the application. 
     
      
    45 Complaint was also made of the disparity in the discounts allowed in relation to the pleas of guilty. This, too, is well made. 
     
      
    46 A further complaint was made concerning the application of the finding of special circumstances which, it was argued, was not fully implemented in the result. Finally, it was argued that his Honour failed to consider assessment of the applicant for suitability for alternatives to fulltime imprisonment, such as suspension of the sentences, or service of the sentence imposed by home detention. There is merit in all of these complaints.  
     
      
    47 This court experienced significant concern about a number of aspects of the proceedings. I have extracted, in full, one of the charges against the applicant. It alleges that he was accessory to the defrauding (that is, actual defrauding) of Scottish Pacific by the Gomes brothers. That defrauding, it was alleged, occurred in respect of a discrete transaction in which three false invoices were provided to Scottish Pacific. The second charge was in relevantly identical terms. It is true that the statement of facts – agreed on behalf of the applicant – expressly asserted that Scottish Pacific had suffered a very significant – $1.3 million loss: 
     
      
       
        
        “… as a result of the alleged fraud committed by the directors of Smartpak  
        and the customers identified as being involved in the fraud 
        .” (emphasis added)  
        
       
       
      and that: 
       
       
        
        “… the actions of [the applicant] assisted the directors of Smartpak to maintain the fraud.” 
        
       
      
    48 These, however, were general statements about the scheme operated by the Gomes brothers. The applicant was charged with two specific offences referable to two specific transactions. The evidence (in the Gomes/Baldini proceedings) clearly established that, in respect of these transactions, Scottish Pacific suffered no loss. 
     
      
    49 “Defraud” is not defined in the Crimes Act. However, it has been the subject of judicial consideration on a number of occasions. Some of the authorities are referred to in Howie and Johnson: Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW, LexisNexis Butterworths 1998 at pp 116, 626 in the notes to s 176A of the Crimes Act. In my opinion to “defraud” necessarily imports a loss to the victim of something of value. I acknowledge that the loss may be intangible, although, it must, in my opinion, at best involve prejudice to the victim’s “proprietary rights” (R v Negline (NSWCCA, 5 December 1990)). 
     
      
    50 Here, the evidence failed to establish that Scottish Pacific was deprived or defrauded of anything in respect of the transactions in which the applicant was involved. There was therefore no “defrauding” of Scottish Pacific. But this was an essential element of each offence charged. 
     
      
    51 This conclusion raises an awkward question for this court. In my opinion, based on the evidence presented to Mahoney ADCJ, the prosecution did not establish that either principal offence (defrauding Scottish Pacific by the Gomes brothers) had been committed. Axiomatically it did not establish that the applicant was an accessory to either of those offences. 
     
      
    52 The awkward question thus raised is whether the pleas of guilty ought to have been rejected. 
     
      
    53 The applicant was legally represented and entered pleas of guilty to both charges. It would have been open to the judge to reject the pleas, but this he does not appear to have contemplated. The transcript of the sentencing proceedings makes it clear that the applicant’s counsel strenuously pressed for the pleas to be maintained. He did not want to become involved in a lengthy and expensive process of seeking leave to withdraw his pleas or having rejection of the pleas imposed upon him. This is entirely understandable. The evidence did establish that the applicant was involved in some wrongdoing. He undoubtedly assisted the Gomes brothers in a deceitful enterprise as a result of which Scottish Pacific eventually suffered significant losses. Had he been charged, for example, with being an accessory to an offence of obtaining a benefit by deception (s 178BA, itself punishable by imprisonment for five years, and therefore a serious indictable offence), his pleas would have been quite appropriate.  
     
      
    54 But that does not mean that the judge is obliged to sentence on the basis of the applicant’s accessorial liability to a serious fraud in the absence of adequate evidence as to the nature and extent of the fraud. It is inescapable, in my opinion, that the applicant was sentenced on the basis that he bore or shared, responsibility for the loss of $1.3 million ultimately suffered by Scottish Pacific as a result of the conduct of the Gomes brothers. In fact, on the basis of the charges to which he pleaded guilty, he bore no responsibility for any loss. 
     
      
    55 In my opinion, what his Honour did was to characterise the applicant’s participation in two discrete transactions as participation in what might properly be called a conspiracy, or an overall scheme or enterprise. But that was not the charge brought against him. 
     
      
    56 In my opinion it was not open to the judge to sentence the applicant as he did. The evidence was simply deficient and failed to establish any criminality relevant to the charge brought.  
     
      
    57 It is for these reasons that I joined in the orders made.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      1. Jessica Rose Anderson has been charged with a number of offences. She has been charged with making a false or misleading statement in relation to a foreign travel document. That is contrary to s 18(1)(b)(i) of the  
      Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act 2005 
       of the Commonwealth and carries a maximum of ten years imprisonment. In addition, she has been charged with eleven offences of imposing upon the Commonwealth by an untrue representation contrary to s 29B of the  
      Crimes Act 1914  
      of the Commonwealth, each offence carrying a maximum of two years imprisonment. Thirdly, she has been charged with eight counts of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth contrary to s 135.1 5 of the  
      Criminal Code Act 1995 
       of the Commonwealth. 
       
       
      2. Ms Anderson was arrested on 14 December 2006 and has been in custody since then. On her arrest she was interviewed by the Federal Police and made full admissions. Proceedings were commenced against her in the Local Court by way of court attendance notices. She first appeared at the Central Local Court on 15 December 2006. She appeared at two more mention dates in February and April 2007 following orders made for the service of the brief. On 16 May 2007 Ms Anderson indicated that she would plead guilty to each offence and on that day she was committed for sentence to this court. 
       
       
      3. I should add that she was also originally charged with making a false or misleading statement for the purposes of obtaining a passport other than an Australian passport contrary to s 10(2)a of the  
      Passports Act 1938 
       of the Commonwealth. Ms Dobraszczyk who appears for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has indicated that her client proposes to direct in writing pursuant to s 107 of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
       that no further proceedings will be taken against Ms Anderson in respect of that offence. That indication is noted, and a letter will be written by the prosecutor to the Registrar of this court with a copy sent to Ms Duchen who appears for the offender. If that letter has not been received by Ms Duchen within fourteen days of today, Ms Duchen will arrange to have the matter re-listed before me. 
       
       
      4. I turn now to a consideration of the facts of this case. They are contained in part of exhibit A which was a bundle of documents tendered by consent and unless where otherwise indicated I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the following facts. 
       
       
      5. I commence with the admissions made by Ms Anderson when she was arrested and interviewed. She was born on 29 June 1957. She obtained a birth certificate from a friend of hers whose surname was Keno in New Zealand in 1982. She used that document to obtain a New Zealand passport because she was not able to obtain a passport legitimately in her own name. That was because she was, at that stage, on probation for various offences. Later she made further applications for a replacement or renewal of her New Zealand passport in the name of Tua Toro Keno. She made these applications whilst she was in Australia. One was made in 2001 and the latest was made in December 2006. She used these New Zealand passports, issued not in her name but issued to her under a false name, to gain numerous further forms of identification in the name of Keno. She used various aliases and false names, both in New Zealand and in Australia. 
       
       
      6. In addition, and this is why the matter has come before me, she used the identity to obtain Centrelink benefits in Australia knowing that she was committing these offences. She also worked in paid employment at various times whilst receiving Centrelink payments but that is not the subject of any charges. 
       
       
      7. The matter came to light because of a joint operation by Australian and New Zealand authorities concerning false passports being issued to New Zealand citizens. Her false passport was discovered and it was ascertained that on 31 March 1983 she had, as I indicated earlier, fraudulently obtained her New Zealand passport using the name Keno and that she used this passport to leave New Zealand and enter Australia on 2 April 2003. 
       
       
      8. As I mentioned, this passport was renewed at least once between then and 2006 and then she made a further application for renewal in December 2006. The Australian Federal Police received notification from the New Zealand police that she had applied on 4 December 2006 in Sydney at the New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs for a fresh passport. However, in the meantime search warrants were obtained by the Australian Federal Police and on 14 December 2006 they entered her residence pursuant to those search warrants and arrested her on 14 December 2006. 
       
       
      9. The facts indicate that Ms Anderson was paid social security benefits by the Department of Social Security until 1 July 1997 and after that by the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency in the name of Tua Toro Keno. In respect of the social security payments paid by the Department these commenced as early as 3 July 1984, about a year after she arrived in Australia, and proceeded until 1997 when the legislation was changed. Payments were made by the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency up until 7 December 2006. Hence, the overall period of Ms Anderson receiving Commonwealth benefits under a false name and also not being entitled to those benefits, was some twenty-two years, although I regard the overall period as one of about twenty years since there were some gaps within that time frame. 
       
       
      10. The benefits which she received included the sole parent pension, the family payment, the basic family payment and additional family payment, Newstart allowance, parenting payment single, and family tax benefit. 
       
       
      11. I also note that between 16 August 1983 and 29 April 2004 Ms Anderson lodged numerous forms with the Department or the Agency providing the Department or the Agency with relevant information to justify the payments which she was falsely seeking. Information, for example, included the names of her children. In addition, Ms Anderson was sent some one hundred and eighty three advice letters by either the Department or the Agency between 15 August 1983 and 15 November 2006 informing her of the social security payments being paid in the name of Tua Toro Keno.  
       
       
      12. As the agreed facts sheet records Ms Anderson was not entitled to receive those benefits because she was not in fact Tua Toro Keno. As a result of her false claim in that name she was paid social security payments, which were not payable at all, for some twenty years. The overall amount paid was the sum of $304,008.04. 
       
       
      13. I turn now to consider Ms Anderson’s subjective circumstances. These have been set out in exhibit B which is the pre-sentence report issued by the Probation and Parole Service and in exhibit 1, a psychological report.  
       
       
      14. Exhibit B, the pre-sentence report, authored by David Tibos and dated 27 June 2007, records a good deal of Ms Anderson’s most unfortunate personal history. She was made a State ward at the age of seven in New Zealand and removed from her parental home. She returned at the age of sixteen but, at that age, reports that she was gang raped and, as a result, bore a son. She met a man named Peter in 1976 and that relationship lasted on and off for many years. She commenced to live with Peter and in 1983 he went to live in Australia and she followed him. Just before leaving New Zealand he became violent and the violence intensified once they were both living in Australia. Her sons were often the victims of the violence. She separated several times from him and on those occasions he found her and on other occasions she feared for her safety and decided to return. For some period of about three months she stayed at refuges. 
       
       
      15. The intensity of the violence perpetrated on her by her partner Peter would, she told the probation officer, vary depending upon his drinking and gambling problems. Evidently contact was made with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship which confirms those issues of domestic violence.  
       
       
      16. Ms Anderson has had several positions of paid employment, including one where she occupied a position as a senior supervisor. But on a number of times she ceased her employment as a result of the violence on the domestic front. 
       
       
      17. She indicated to the probation and parole officer that many of her decisions have been motivated by fear of being assaulted. Her partner has presently left Australia and is now living in a new relationship in New Zealand. Nevertheless, she feels still fearful for her safety.  
       
       
      18. She explained that her motivation for her offending was that her family was often left without food as a result of her partner Peter’s drinking and gambling. She has expressed to the probation and parole officer her regret for her behaviour. The records of the Probation and Parole Service indicate that Ms Anderson has not abused alcohol since 2005 although alcohol does appear to be an underlying factor in her offending history. 
       
       
      19. The author of the report expresses the view that unless Ms Keno is able to address what the author calls her ‘lifestyle issues’ then the risk of her re-offending remains high.  
       
       
      20. The psychological report has been prepared by a psychologist named Suzanne Freeman and is dated 25 June 2007. Ms Freeman interviewed Ms Anderson at Dillwynia Correctional Centre on 15 June 2007. She obtained a similar history about the family background. However, she obtained some additional information. During the period of separation from her parents as a young girl she was fostered in numerous different foster families. In one foster family she and her sister, who was fostered at the same time with the same family, were required to work at night with their foster parents and experienced constant fatigue a school. In addition, she says that she was sexually abused by the male foster parent who had also sexually abused her sister. 
       
       
      21. Ms Anderson and her partner Peter had seven children. One of them, a boy named Sidney, was tragically killed in a car accident when he was seven years of age. The others are Roberto aged twenty-six, Jack aged twenty-two, Cara aged nineteen, Marvin aged sixteen, Tennessee aged fifteen and Shardae aged twelve.  
       
       
      22. The report indicated that Ms Anderson was the only regular bread winner for this large family and was constantly concerned about obtaining enough money to pay the bills. After her partner Peter left, Ms Anderson met a man named Allan. This is now some two and a half years ago and she has commenced a very satisfactory and supportive relationship with him.  
       
       
      23. The psychologist indicates that objective testing applied by the psychologist pointed to Ms Anderson having wide ranging and complex personality pathology. The psychologist noted that currently Ms Anderson is highly anxious and suffering from major depression and severe symptoms of trauma and noted that she has clearly suffered many serious losses in her life. 
       
       
      24. She has been selected to attend a course on domestic violence and the psychologist expressed the opinion that she requires psychotherapy to deal with her depression, anxiety and trauma.  
       
       
      25. Ms Duchen called her client to give evidence under oath before me today. She confirmed the accuracy of the information she had provided to both the probation and parole officer and the psychologist. She indicated that she still had problems with arthritis in her lower back which at this stage is untreated because the prison authorities are waiting for her medical records. She expressed her remorse and sorrow for what she had done. 
       
       
      26. In cross-examination she acknowledged that Allan had provided financial and emotional support but conceded that she had continued to receive her social security benefits after she had met Allan. Indeed she had also continued to receive her social security benefits for the period of some months that she resided in a refuge. She confirmed once again her regret at what she did and indicated that she had used the money mostly to support herself and her children. There is no suggestion that she was supporting herself in any inappropriate or extravagant manner. 
       
       
      27. I was provided with some very helpful written submissions by Ms Dobraszczyk and I heard helpful oral submissions from her and from Ms Duchen as well. Briefly, I take into account the following matters in those submissions.  
       
       
      28. Public deterrence is of great importance in social security fraud cases. There is authority for that proposition in  
      Regina v Winchester 
        
      (1992) 58 A Crim R 345 at 347. In addition, and it is important to understand the reason that the law regards these offences so seriously, I quote this passage from the Court of Criminal Appeal’s judgment in  
      Regina v Purdon 
       unreported, 27 March 1997. In that case the court comprising Mr Justice Hunt and Justice McInerney and Acting Justice Donovan said the following: 
       
        
         
        “ 
        The rationale stated for the rule that a custodial sentence is to be imposed for social security fraud except in very special circumstances is that the offence is easy to commit but difficult to detect. It is widespread and the introduction of more checks upon applicants for social security would cause delays in the payment of benefits and therefore hardship to those whose need is urgent. 
         
         
        It has also been said that the rule reflects a concern for the protection of the revenue but I would prefer to express it as a concern for the additional burden upon all taxpayers who shoulder the heavy burden of providing the funds for the social security system to operate and even heavier burden created by the widespread abuse of it by frauds such as these. 
         
         
        The rule is not based upon the fact that many of the frauds are perpetrated from motives of greed rather than need. Both types of fraud are widespread, they are equally difficult to detect. If the fraud is based upon a perceived need a custodial sentence must be expected except in very special circumstances. If the fraud is based on greed the custodial sentence will be longer. The principle of deterrence is of vital importance in these cases 
        .” 
         
        
       
      I accept, as indeed I am bound to, that proposition and I approach this sentencing exercise with those principles in mind. I have also taken into account s 16A of the  
      Crimes Act 
        
      1914 
       of the Commonwealth, in particular the matters in subs (2) which are relevant to this particular sentencing exercise. 
       
       
      29. I accept the submission that this case is objectively very serious. There was a large amount of overpayment, just over $300,000 and the offence continued over a period of about twenty years. In addition Ms Anderson regularly filled in forms whereby she supplied information to support the money which she was fraudulently extracting from the Commonwealth. Not only that but she received notifications from the various departments or agencies confirming that she was receiving these benefits. There can be no doubt that Ms Anderson knew what she was doing for the whole of the period of the twenty years that she chose to continue to extract money from the Commonwealth. 
       
       
      30. As was said by the court in  
      Regina v Hawkins 
       (1989) 35 A Crim R 430 at 435: 
       
        
         
        “ 
        This was no temporary ‘dipping into the till’ crime to overcome a problem that may have arisen. It was a consistent and persistent demonstration of fraud over a significant period 
        .” 
         
        
       
      I regard that passage as applying to this case. I have taken into account the amount of the fraud which is not the highest amount which has been the subject of these kinds of offences in the precedents but which is significantly high. As I have already said I regard the period of time as very significant. I note that none of the overpayment moneys has been recovered so that Ms Anderson can receive no benefit for any contrition shown by any action to make reparation for any loss. 
       
       
      31. Ms Anderson, as I indicated, pleaded guilty. She pleaded guilty on 16 May 2007. The Crown submits that this was a plea at a relatively early stage whereas Ms Duchen submits that it was a plea at the earliest realistic opportunity. I propose to accept Ms Duchen’s submission in this regard. It is acknowledged in the Crown’s submissions that between her first appearance in December 2006 and her plea in May 2007 two further appearances concerned orders being made for the service of the brief. I accept Ms Duchen’s submission that it must be reasonable for a person to be able to be in possession of the full brief which is to be prosecuted against them and to be in a position to obtain legal advice before entering a plea. However, I do note that there was an overwhelmingly strong Crown case against Ms Anderson. 
       
       
      32. Taking that into account and the extent of her early plea, I propose to allow her a discount which reflects not only her remorse and acceptance of responsibility expressed in evidence before me and to other persons but her willingness to facilitate the course of justice. This will be reflected by a discount of some thirty per cent from the sentence which I propose to impose. 
       
       
      33. Ms Anderson has a lengthy criminal history. It covers her time in New Zealand as well as in Australia. She has served periods of imprisonment before, once in New Zealand for some two months and on two or three occasions in Australia. The offences which are contained on her record are mostly dishonesty offences. Many of them are for theft and stealing. They include shoplifting but they also include driving offences. Ms Anderson cannot receive the benefit of additional leniency as a result of this criminal record. Indeed to some extent it demonstrates a consistent disregard for the law which requires people to behave in a way that does not infringe on the property rights of others. Ms Anderson’s behaviour over the years according to her criminal record has consistently demonstrated a disregard for the property and the possessions of others. These particular offences for which I am sentencing her today are by far the most serious examples of her criminal behaviour. 
       
       
      34. I have taken into account the submission about the hardship which might be caused to Ms Anderson’s family as a result of her imprisonment. This is a factor which is referred to in s 16A(2)(p) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      . I adopt what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
      Regina v Hinton 
       (2002) 134 A Crim R 286 where Justice Howie said at [31]: 
       
        
         
        “ 
        It is now clear that the reference in s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act to the ‘probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants’ should be read as if it were preceded by the words ‘in exceptional circumstances’. It should be emphasised that the question of whether the probable effect of a sentence upon a third party will give rise to an exceptional case cannot be considered in isolation from the facts of the particular matter and the degree of criminality involved in the offences for which sentence is to be imposed. 
        ” 
         
        
       
      The consequences of imprisonment upon the family of any prisoner are harsh. The prisoner is deprived of the benefits of having his or her family close by. Perhaps more importantly the family, particularly if they are young, are deprived of the benefits of, in the usual case, their parent. This is perhaps particularly so in the case of a mother with young children. In this case Ms Anderson has three teenage children. However, the consequences of her imprisonment are sadly in a way no greater than the unfortunate consequences that follow when any person has committed a serious crime which warrants a term of imprisonment. Her case is no exception and the authorities constrain me as to the extent that I can take into account the impact that a gaol term has on the family of an offender. 
       
       
      35. I have also taken into account and I am satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate other than a period of full-time imprisonment. This is, in my opinion, very clear from the authorities and Ms Duchen realistically conceded this. There was no other option in my respectful opinion than to make that concession. I will date the sentences from the date when Ms Anderson went into custody, namely, 14 December 2006. I have also taken into account the submissions made today. I have, so far as the Crown is concerned, given weight to the period of time over which the offences were committed. 
       
       
      36. So far as the psychological report is concerned, Ms Duchen made it clear that she was seeking no benefit from that report to explain the criminal behaviour and I regard the contents of the psychological report as descriptive of the subjective circumstances of Ms Anderson rather than offering any explanation by way of mitigation for her behaviour. The conditions referred to by the psychologist, which were major depression and severe symptoms of trauma as well as anxiety, are not at all surprising given Ms Anderson’s circumstances and I hardly need a psychologist’s report to confirm that a person in her position might be suffering from those conditions. 
       
       
      37. Ms Duchen has pointed to her client’s incredibly traumatic life and she has explained her client’s offending behaviour in the past as stemming from need. I understand that that may well have been the case although I still regard her criminal record as providing her no assistance so far as leniency and compared with the criminal record of other persons who may have far fewer offences or none at all, it is one that, in my opinion, demonstrates a consistent disregard for the law concerning the property of others. I accept Ms Duchen’s submission that these offences did not involve any elaborate planning. Unlike other offences in the authorities where people had half a dozen or more identities or where a person was employed by the agency, Ms Anderson’s offending behaviour was not part of some elaborate and complex scheme. Nevertheless, it was a serious fraud upon the Commonwealth. 
       
       
      38. I acknowledge that her psychological needs will be attended to in prison but I accept Ms Duchen’s submission that realistically it is unlikely that her psychological needs will be attended to as well as they might be were she not in prison. I acknowledge the submission that this was one ongoing offence but I do not accept that submission in its entirety. There was a consistency in the behaviour but in this instance Ms Anderson’s opportunities were numerous, when she filled in forms or received information from the departments, to cease her criminal behaviour. I regard her need for supervision on release as being significant given her personal history and personal problems so that I propose to allow a parole period in the region of forty per cent. 
       
       
      39. I will tell you now, Ms Anderson, I am going to sentence you to five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years. So you have three years to serve from 14 December 2006 and the overall sentence will be five years.  
       
      HIS HONOUR: I need to divide that up according to the principles in  
      Pearce 
      , and this is where I might need some assistance. Ms Dobraszczyk, just remind me of the section which contains the parole periods and non-parole periods. You haven’t got it in front of you, have you? 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: I have a little bit. A head sentence in excess of three years must fix a non-parole period or recog order. That’s section 19AB. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: That’s right. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: There is also a section which your Honour may be looking for which deals with cumulative and concurrent sentences. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. Where’s that? 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: That I don’t have in front of me, 19AG. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Can I fix sentences, fixed terms without a non-parole period? 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Yes. There is a section dealing with that. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I propose to sentence in respect of the passport offence, if I can call it that, to a fixed term of twelve months and I propose to fix concurrent periods of six months for the s 29B offences, which are less serious in amount, so that is counts 1, 2, 3, 4 and probably 8, 9 and 10. And I propose to fix fixed periods of twelve months in respect of those 29B offences, which are 5, 6 and 7, which are significant amounts. They will all be concurrent so that the passport offence of twelve months and the mixture of 29B offences of twelve months and six months will all be - sorry, the twelve months ones will be cumulative on the six month ones under the 29B. So in effect there will be fixed sentences of eighteen months. Does that make sense? Do you understand what I mean? 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Yes, I understand, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Then in respect of the  
      Criminal Code 
       offences I propose to do the same, namely, a mixture of six months and twelve months but I need to attach a non-parole period to some of those. The less serious ones are 1, 2, 5, 6 and the more serious ones are 3, 4, 7 and 8. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Does your Honour mean therefore those less serious ones for the six months and 3, 4, 7, 8 for 12? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Correct. I should have said before but I’ll return to the formal remarks in a moment, the overall sentence I had in mind was seven years and after the discount of about thirty per cent it will be reduced to an overall sentence of five years and the minimum period or non-parole period will be three years. What I need to do is to-- 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: As your Honour knows in terms of the dates, in terms of when things start and overlap, that’s what needs to be done. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Do you need your Act back to direct my attention to-- 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: I might just check some of those sections in order to assist. The section, your Honour, in relation to cumulative, partly cumulative or concurrent sentences is s 19, in particular subs (2). 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: And I don’t have to give reasons like in the State system for a longer than normal parole period because there is no notion of a normal parole period, am I right, there’s just the authorities which suggest?-- 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: That’s correct, your Honour. If your Honour was going to issue at the higher end then there might be a reason for that but that’s not this case, with respect. I was just going to check in relation to the fixed sentences. Section 19AB subs (3) and (4) really deal with the fixed sentences issue and subs (4) where the court decides that neither a non-parole period nor recognisance release order is appropriate, the court must state its reasons for so deciding and cause the reasons to be entered in the records of the court. 
       
        
       
      HIS HONOUR: Thank you. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: I think they’re the main sections your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Alright, may I borrow that back? 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Certainly. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I’ll just resume my remarks on sentence.  
       
        
       
      40. As I have indicated I propose to impose a sentence in effect of five years with a non-parole period of three years and that is after taking into account a discount of roughly 30% for the reasons that I have indicated.  
       
       
      41. I have, in fixing that period, had regard to four cases which have been provided to me by the prosecution. One is  
      Regina v Murphy 
        
      [2007] NSWCCA 18. The second is  
      Bick v The Commonwealth 
        
      [2006] NSWCCA 408. The third is  
      Sanchet v The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions 
        
      [2006] NSWCCA 291 and the last is  
      Regina v Knight 
        
      [2004] NSWCCA 145. I regard the cases of  
      Knight 
       and  
      Sanchet 
       as more serious than this case. In  
      Knight 
       the offender received a sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of five years, but in that case the offender had committed some thirty-three different offences and had extracted some $362,000 from the Commonwealth using twenty-three false identities. I also regard the case of  
      Sanchet 
       as more serious than this case. There were sixty-one separate charges in  
      Sanchet 
       and an amount of $400,000 was obtained over a period of four years using twenty-two false identities. The offender is that case received a maximum of six years with four years non-parole. 
       
       
      42. Murphy 
      , the most recent case, was a case where the offender was an employee of Centrelink, committed eleven offences. That is about half the number committed by Ms Anderson. The amount was greater, $375,000, but they occurred over a much shorter period, that is eighteen months. The Court of Criminal Appeal regarded the sentence of three years and three months as lenient. Nevertheless, it reduced the non-parole period of two years and three months to two years because it was regarded as relatively too high.  
       
       
      43. In  
      Bick 
       which I regard as relatively close to the circumstances of this case, there were fourteen offences, fewer than in this case. It had additional complexity though in that five false names were used, but the period of time involved was some twelve years which is much shorter than the period of time over which Ms Anderson committed her offences. The sentence was four and a half years with a non-parole period of three and a half years. I regard this case as more serious, but not significantly so than the case in  
      Bick 
       which is why I fix a head sentence of five years, but because of the subjective circumstances of Ms Anderson, I regard an appropriate non-parole period as three years overall in this case.  
       
       
      44. Ms Anderson for the offence of making a false or misleading statement in relation to a foreign travel document application, that is the passport, which is an offence against the  
      Foreign Passports Law Enforcement Security Act 2005 
      , I sentence you to a period of imprisonment of twelve months to commence on 14 December 2006 and to expire on 13 December 2007. I do not fix a non-parole period in respect of that offence because of the other sentences which I am about to impose. In respect of the following offences, again s 29B of the  
      Crimes Act 1914 
      , namely the offences contained in the court attendance notice. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: What’s the best way of describing these? 
       
      DUCHEN: Maybe if your Honour looks at the facts and they’re numbered there. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, there’s lots of numbers. There’s a H number. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Which is crossed out. That doesn’t help because that’s only in relation to the one document. But is it still appropriate - well we have two CANS-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: We do.  
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: --dealing with section 29B. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Correct, how do I identify them? 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Perhaps then with that separate one, that is in relation to the period 3 July 84 perhaps making it clear that it’s in relation to that separate offence between that period and-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, and then I’ll identify the second court attendance notice as the one containing eight counts. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Eight counts and then on that piece of paper counts number whatever we’re dealing with. 
       
       
      45. In respect of the offence against s 29B of the  
      Crimes Act 1914 
       which was committed between 3 July 1984 and 7 January 1986, I sentence you to a period of imprisonment of six months to commence on 13 June 2007 and to expire on 12 December 2007. In respect of the following number defences contrary to s 29B of the  
      Crimes Act 1914 
      , contained in the court attendance notice which contains ten numbered offences, numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10, I sentence you to concurrent terms of six months imprisonment to commence on 13 June 2007 and to expire on 12 December 2007. In respect of the counts in the same court attendance notice which are numbered 5, 6 and 7, I sentence you to concurrent periods of imprisonment of twelve months to commence on 13 June 2007 and to expire on 12 June 2008. In respect of all of those offences under s 29B of the  
      Crimes Act  
      I do not fix a non-parole period because of the additional sentences which I am about to impose.  
       
       
      46. In respect of the offences contrary to s 135.1 subs (5) of the  
      Criminal Code Act 1995  
      which are contained in the court attendance notice, itself containing eight offences, in respect of the offences numbered 1, 2, 5 and 6, I sentence you to six months imprisonment to commence on 12 June 2008 and to expire on 11 December 2008. In respect of the offences contained in that court attendance notice and bearing the numbers 3, 4, 7 and 8, I sentence you to imprisonment for a period of three years to commence on 11 December 2008 and to expire on 10 December 2011. I fix in respect of each of those offences non-parole periods of twelve months to commence on 11 December 2008 and to expire on 10 December 2009.  
       
       
      47. I make an order for reparation pursuant to s 21B of the  
      Crimes Act 1914 
       in the amount of $304,008.04 which should be payable to the Commonwealth. In addition I make an order for fingerprints to be taken from you pursuant to s 3ZL of the  
      Crimes Act 1914 
      .  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Ms Dobraszczyk, what if anything-- 
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: A few technical issues. In relation to-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I was afraid you’d say that. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: The code offences, the more serious Code offences where your Honour gave three years. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Correct. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Three, four, seven and eight, we’re assuming that that means that they’re to be served concurrently. So that’s three years for each offence? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Correct. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Is that correct, to be served concurrently? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: That's correct. Those three year offences under the Code are to be served concurrently and each of them has a non-parole period of twelve months to be served concurrently.  
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: That’s my second issue. In relation to the non-parole period, your Honour in the Commonwealth legislation there’s only one non-parole period that can be given. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I see, yes, I was wondering that. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: There is a section in relation to that which of course I’ve forgotten. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I’ll hand it down. It might be 19A(b). 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: I’ll find it. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: So how does it work, that I-- 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Then the non-parole period in relation-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I fix one non-parole period for the whole period? 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Yes. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: That makes it a bit easier, perhaps less-- 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Yes, it’s in 19A(b). So where a person is convicted of a federal offence or two or more at the same sitting, and where the court imposes a federal sentence that exceeds, or sentences that in the aggregate exceed three years which we have here. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: So I should have just fixed the concurrent three years sentences. In respect of the code offences leave it at that and then fix one non-parole period in respect of the lot? 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Yes, because that section then goes onto say the court must either fix a single non-parole period in respect of those sentences or make a recog release order. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: If I could have that back? Ms Duchen just before I - is there anything you want to add? 
       
       
      DUCHEN: No. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Do you agree with what Ms Dobraszczyk was saying? 
       
       
      DUCHEN: Yes, I think that’s right your Honour and so when your Honour those last four offences are three years concurrent with each other and then when you set the non-parole period you said “and I set a non-parole period of” not concurrent or anything. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Thank you. 
       
       
      DUCHEN: I think that’s right. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Which would be your Honour’s three year period.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Exactly. 
       
       
      DUCHEN: No, it’s twelve months the non-parole period is it not? 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: No, three years. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: No, the overall non-parole period is three years. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: That's right. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: It’s a three year non-parole period, two years additional. Total sentence is five. 
       
       
      DUCHEN: That's right, I’m sorry, that’s quite right. 
       
       
      48. So in respect of the offences contrary to the  
      Criminal Code Act 1995 
       which are numbered 3, 4, 7 and 8 I sentence you to a period of three years imprisonment to commence on 11 December 2008 and to expire on 10 December 2011. 
       
       
      49. In respect of all of the sentences which I have just imposed under all of the pieces of legislation I fix a single non-parole period of three years to commence on 14 December 2006 and to expire on 13 December 2009.  
       
      Ms Dobraszczyk anything to be corrected or added? 
       
      DUCHEN: I don’t think that’s right. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: I’ll come to you Ms Duchen. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: No, I think that’s correct. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Nothing I need to add or-- 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: No, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: We’ve got a reparation order, fingerprint order, sentence. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: I think we have dealt with every offence. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, I’m pretty sure we have. Ms Duchen? 
       
       
      DUCHEN: I’m just wondering about the non-parole period your Honour and I might be wrong here because it’s quite a complicated-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Commences 14 December 06. 
       
       
      DUCHEN: I have the date your Honour. I’m just concerned you’ve put that after the three years which basically turns into a fixed term now from December 08 to December 11, right. That’s for those last four offences. Then you’ve gone back to a single non-parole period and you’ve taken it right back to before those offences occur. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: It seems that is what I have to do under the legislation under 19A(b). I have to fix a single non-parole period in respect of federal sentences that I impose. 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: Yes. 
       
       
      DUCHEN: That's right, but-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Have a look at 19A(b). 
       
       
      DUCHEN: I know you have to fix a single one your Honour, I don’t cavil with that. What I was concerned about was whether that refers to one non-parole period for one offence or one non-parole period for all offences. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I think it is in for all offences. The section says-- 
       
       
      DUCHEN: If it says that then that’s right then your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: It says “where the court imposes on the person a federal sentence or federal sentences that in the aggregate exceed three years” I’ve done that, “then if at the time that they’re imposed the person is not already subject to a federal sentence” which Ms Anderson is not “the court must either fix a single non-parole period in respect of that sentence or those sentences”. 
       
       
      DUCHEN: Or those sentences, well then that’s fine. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: So I’ve imposed all the sentences and I-- 
       
       
      DUCHEN: If it says or those-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I fix a single non-parole period in respect  
       
       
      of all those sentences to commence 14 December 2006 of  
       
       
      three years and to expire on 13 December 2009. 
       
       
      DUCHEN: Thank you your Honour. I was just concerned about a sentence or all those sentences, that’s all. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: It seems to be what the legislation says. Anything else that I need to do? 
       
       
      DOBRASZCZYK: No, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I will return your legislation, thanks Ms Dobraszczyk. I will return exhibits 1 and B. I will return exhibit A comprising tabs 1 through to 4 inclusive. 
       
       
      DUCHEN: I’m wondering if your Honour should maybe keep these on the file? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Say that again? 
       
       
      DUCHEN: I’m wondering if your Honour should perhaps keep these on the file, the report and everything? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: You’re quite right Ms Duchen. They obviously should stay with the file. So exhibit A 1 to 4 goes with the file as well. Ms Anderson I have to make sure you understand the sentences. I think you do. You have received a sentence of five years from 14 December 06 to 2011. The non-parole period that you must spend in gaol is three years from 14 December 06 to 13 December 09. Do you understand that?

       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The two accused, Hoang Quang Lu (Lu), and Dinh Khuong Pham (Pham), are charged with the murder of Phillip Anthony Rousianos on 1 October 2005. Pham is further charged with the assault of Sophie Rousianos on the same day.  
     
      
    2 Applications have been made by each of the accused that they be tried separately from each other. An Outline of the Crown Case 3 The Crown case commences with an incident which occurred about a month before the alleged murder when the deceased and his girlfriend went over to Lu's premises in the early hours of the morning. The deceased's girlfriend knocked on the front door, and an argument ensued when Lu's girlfriend refused to wake him. Some four-letter words were exchanged, and the deceased's girlfriend returned to the deceased's car. Lu's girlfriend followed her and the argument continued. The deceased emerged from the car and it seems struck Lu's girlfriend. When Lu arrived the deceased then struck or kicked him.  
     
      
    4 The deceased and his girlfriend left the scene and returned to their home unit, which was a couple of streets away. Whilst they were in the driveway Lu arrived and threatened the deceased with a machete. When the deceased's father and 15-year-old brother Dannis intervened Lu then left.  
     
      
    5 The evidence concerning the prior incident is the subject of an objection by Mr Button SC on the part of Lu. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine that objection. 6 On Saturday 1 October 2005 the deceased with his mother and brother Dannis was walking to the Westfield shopping centre in Liverpool sometime between midday and 12:30pm. When they were near Liverpool Boys' High School Dannis saw Lu driving his car. He said to the deceased: ""Phil, there is Wayne driving past."" 
     
      
    7 Lu, who was known as Wayne, was the only one in the vehicle. A short time later Lu's car pulled up behind. Lu was driving and Pham was in the front passenger seat. When Lu and Pham got out of the vehicle Dannis told the deceased to run, which he did. He ran around the corner and jumped the gate for the fence of a residential property and went towards the front door.  8 Pham, with Lu about two metres behind him, ran towards the deceased's mother. As Pham got to her, he punched her in the face. The deceased was then at the doorstep of the house. Pham ran back to the passenger side of the car and Lu was standing at the fence. When Pham got out of the vehicle he was carrying what was described by Dannis as an object with a black handle. The Crown contends that object was a knife. 9 It is the Crown case that both Pham and Lu jumped the fence and ran towards the deceased, who was at the front of the door. Lu was seen by Dannis to punch the deceased to the face and Pham was standing next to the deceased. They were seen to run down the side of the house, jump the fence and get into the car, which drove away with Lu at the wheel.  
     
      
    10 The deceased walked over to the fence and said, ""Call the ambulance."" There was blood on his shirt and in the centre of the chest. The deceased fell to the ground. Dannis jump over the fence and turned his brother over. He could see there was a silver blade sticking out of his chest. The blade was broken and Dannis could see about two centimetres of it. The deceased died a short time later.  11 Lu, that afternoon, went to the Liverpool Police Station and entered into an electronic record of interview (ERISP). Lu's account in the ERISP of the event a month earlier includes that the machete was a fake and on the following morning that he told the deceased's father, ""What's done is done, forget it."" He told police that on 1 October he and Pham were travelling by car to Westfield when he saw the deceased and said, ""This guy, last time he hit my wife."" He recounts that Pham said, ""Hang on, stop."" So they parked and Pham jumped out of the car. Pham chased the deceased and they both jumped over the fence. Lu said he followed behind and had a metal pipe in his hand. He tried to climb over the fence but could not. The deceased he heard saying, ""Call the cops. Call the cops. He's got a knife. Call the cops."" He was trying to get over the fence when he heard the siren. Lu said that when Pham got back into the car he pulled the black handle out. He just saw the handle and thought it had been broken off. Pham said to him ""I stabbed him"" in Vietnamese. Pham, he recounts, had a cut on his middle finger. He did not know what Pham did with the handle. Lu denies in the ERISP that he drove past the deceased earlier, that he was in the front yard at all and that he punched him.  12 On 2 October 2005 Pham spoke to his brother Dinh-An Pham. According to Dinh-An Pham, Pham told him that when he arrived at Lu's house Lu was on his way out in his car because he had just seen two brothers who had bashed and tried to rob his wife. Pham said he got into the car with Lu and they had a scuffle with these brothers. During the scuffle one of the guys lunged at Pham with a knife. Pham said he turned the knife around and then went to chase the other brother. As he looked back he saw the guy with the knife fall to the ground.  13 Pham, after his arrest on 3 October 2005, entered into an ERISP during which he described Lu as looking very upset when he was walking to his car. Lu explained that he had a problem with [the deceased] and wanted to sort it out. The conversation continued whilst they were driving in the car for a short time which Pham estimates to be 10 to 15 minutes. After they saw the deceased they jumped out of the car, the deceased jumped over the fence and must have been scared because he saw Lu with a pole in his hand. Pham recounts that he jumped over the fence to grab the deceased who had a blade which came into contact with his hand. As Pham shoved and pushed his arm away, Pham tried to turn and run the other way. As he turned he noticed the deceased fall and he was screaming. The deceased must have slipped and fallen onto his blade. Pham initially recounts that Lu did not climb over the fence but at a later stage in the ERISP resiles from the firmness of that position by stating that he was busy and did not knowHow the Crown Intends to Present its Case 14 The Crown intends to present its case against Lu and Pham as a joint criminal enterprise and, in the alternative, as an extended joint criminal enterprise. Both Lu and Pham went to the front door, the Crown contends, with the intention of at least inflicting grievous bodily harm. The act of stabbing was done by one of them in pursuance of and in carrying out the joint criminal enterprise. The Application for Separate Trials  15 Where the Crown case is that the accused were parties to a joint criminal enterprise, the starting point is that they should be tried jointly, Webb v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41. In Regina v Jon Leslie Baartman (unreported, NSWCCA 6 October 1994) the Court of Criminal Appeal approved the relevant principles governing the exercise of the discretion to grant a separate trial as enunciated by Hunt J in Regina v Stephen Frederick Middis (unreported, NSWSC 27 March 1991), an approval repeated in Regina v Georgiou [1999] NSWCCA 125: “Briefly, the relevant principles are that: 
     
      
      1. Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and  
       
      2. Where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and 
       
      3. Where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material,  
       
       
        
        a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.” 
        
       
      
     16 In Regina v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190 Adams J provides in the leading judgment some explanation of the principles enunciated in Middis: 
     
      
      “39. Two phrases in this summary need some explanation. In ordinary speech, “immeasurably” usually connotes something of such an enormous degree that it is beyond measurement. It is obvious that it was here not used in this sense. I think that his Honour meant “significant, though incommensurable”. The starting point is that the inadmissible, prejudicial material is completely irrelevant. If, when placed on the scales, it would be likely to turn a potential acquittal to a conviction then this would, I think, amount to “positive injustice”. Of course, the likelihood cannot be measured: if it is real, as distinct from inconsequential, having regard both to its inherent character and the context of the Crown case, then the trial must necessarily embarrass the affected accused. The question then arises whether the risk that the material might be placed by the jury on the scales is such that the trial miscarried. It should also be noted that Hunt J necessarily assumed that clear and emphatic directions would be given to the jury that he inadmissible material must be ignored and the point made by the summary is that, in the posited circumstances, such directions may well be insufficient to avoid a miscarriage and separate trials should be ordered to prevent such an occurrence. 
      
     40. I interpolate that, with unfeigned respect, I am doubtful that the weakness of the applicant’s case as compared with that of the co-accused against whom it is proposed to tender the prejudicial evidence can be a relevant consideration. Assume that the case against the co-accused was much weaker than the applicant, even with the prejudicial evidence. If there was such a significant risk that the prejudicial evidence could be used by the jury adversely to the applicant and that evidence was itself significantly prejudicial, I am unable to see why the mere fact that it was adduced in a weaker co-offender’s case is material. Indeed, the opposite would seem to be the case since, if the co-accused’s case was weak, or weaker than the applicant’s, the prejudicial evidence might well assume even more importance than otherwise. As it seems to me, with respect, the crucial issue is the potential effect of the inadmissible evidence on the jury’s consideration of the applicant’s case.”17 It follows that an applicant for a separate trial must demonstrate that there is a real risk that a positive injustice could be caused to him in a joint trial. Mr Button SC for Lu submits that it is the combined effect of Pham's ERISP and the conversation with his brother which demonstrate that there is a real risk that a positive injustice would be caused to Lu in a joint trial. Those parts of Pham's ERISP which conflict with Lu's account of what occurred and the conversation with his brother go to the central question in the trial, which will be: was there a joint criminal enterprise and, if so, what was it?  
     
      
    18 Referring to the principles in Middis Mr Button argues that the case against Pham is much stronger and different from the case against Lu principally because of the evidence of the deceased's brother and mother that they saw Pham return to the vehicle and get something, from which it can be inferred that he was in possession of the knife. Moreover, Pham's account of how the deceased came to be stabbed by the knife strains credulity. The material in Pham's ERISP and the statement of his brother are highly prejudicial to Lu, Mr Button submits, although not admissible against him. There is the real risk that the weaker prosecution case against Lu, Mr Button contends, will be made immeasurably stronger by that prejudicial material as the jury may be inclined to use it even subconsciously to undermine the position of Lu and to ultimately reject it.  19 I do not consider the evidence against Lu is significantly weaker than and different from that admissible against Pham. It is common ground that the evidence of Sophie and Dannis Rousianos is admissible against each of the accused. Whilst it is true that each of them gives an account of Pham returning to the vehicle and Dannis describes seeing Pham carry an object with a black handle, each witness deposes to both Lu and Pham going over the fence. Dannis recounts Lu punching the deceased to the face with Pham standing next to the deceased. Moreover, according to Dannis, Lu was seen driving his vehicle alone a short time before he returned with Pham. An account is provided by both witnesses of the earlier incident, which includes Lu holding a machete.  20 Although the Crown case points firmly to Pham being the person who actually stabbed the deceased, the proposed evidence with equal firmness points to the attack upon the deceased being motivated by Lu's desire for revenge and to his actual participation in the attack. The Crown case, it seems to me, against each of the accused depends upon the acceptance of the evidence of Sophie and Dannis Rousianos.  21 The admissions made by Pham in this ERISP and the conversations recounted by Dinh-An Pham are not admissible against Lu. Pham's statements to police and his conversations with his brother are inconsistent with Lu's account that his disagreement with the deceased had been reconciled and the attack upon the deceased was a spontaneous attack by Pham in which he did not participate. This inadmissible material considered in combination adds little, in my view, to the inferences available from the admissible evidence of Sophie and Dannis Rousianos of the prior incident with a machete; the driving past by Lu alone in his car; his return accompanied by the co-accused and the attack that followed. Although there is some prejudice to Lu from the inadmissible material I am not persuaded that it is highly prejudicial.  
     
      
    22 It follows from what I have said that I do not consider that there is a real risk of a weaker Crown case being made stronger by reason of the prejudicial material. Irrespective of the relative strengths of the Crown cases against each of the accused, I do not consider that there is a significant risk that prejudicial evidence could be used adversely to the applicant: see Pham per Adams J at [40]. The jury would be given specific directions that Pham's ERISP and the conversations with his brother are admissible only against Pham and are not to be taken into account against Lu.  23 The application made by Pham for a separate trial is founded on what was said by Lu to police in his ERISP and the use that may be sought to be made by the co-accused of the evidence of Andrew Klintworth. Lu told police that when Pham got back into the vehicle he pulled the black handle out and said to him in Vietnamese, ""I stabbed him."" What was said by Lu in the ERISP is not admissible against Pham. The prejudice to Pham which arises from the inadmissible material is very high. It amounts to an explicit admission by Pham to Lu that he inflicted upon the deceased the wound which caused his death.  24 Although I have assessed the comparative strengths of the cases against each of the accused as about the same, there is a real risk that the Crown case against Pham will be made significantly stronger by reason of the inadmissible material. In this instance a clear and emphatic direction that the inadmissible material must be ignored may not be sufficient to avoid a miscarriage of justice.  25 The risk of a positive injustice to Pham by a joint trial is enhanced by the evidence of Andrew Klintworth. Klintworth told Detective Senior Constable Kneipp and Senior Constable Bullow on 3 October 2005 that Pham had tried to stab him in the heart with a knife. Notices had been served by the Crown and Lu of an intention to rely on that evidence to prove that Pham had a tendency to act in a particular way, namely, to possess a knife, retrieve it from a car, and to use a knife in a particular manner, namely, an action of stabbing to the heart.  26 Mr Klintworth during his evidence on a Basha inquiry this morning resiled from what he told the police officers in 2005 and told this Court it was not true. The Crown no longer seeks to call Mr Klintworth on the basis of tendency, but for a more limited purpose.  
     
      
    27 Mr Klintworth, however, is a witness of importance to Lu. The statement he gave to police in 2005 has the potential to assist Lu in his case that the death of the deceased was caused by Pham, an act in which Lu was not involved. When Klintworth is called by the Crown, Mr Button SC has informed me that he proposes to endeavour to get the statement in as a prior inconsistent statement.  28 Klintworth's statement to police in 2005 has a potential to strengthen the reliability of the inadmissible admissions in Lu's ERISP. The prejudice to Pham, already very high, would be enhanced. It could not be cured by a strong direction. 29 It seems to me that Pham has demonstrated that there is a real risk that the positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial. I order that Lu and Pham be tried separately.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was originally indicted jointly with his son, NB, in relation to three counts. The indictment read as follows: 
     
      
       
       DJB 
       
       
        
        On 9 October 2004 at Narrabri in the State of New South Wales did unlawfully cause TE to take an overpowering drug, Diazepam, with intent to enable himself to commit an indictable offence, namely sexual intercourse without consent. 
        
       
       
       DJB and NJB 
       
       
        
        On 9 October 2004 at Narrabri in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with TE, without the consent of TE, knowing she did not consent thereto, in circumstances of aggravation, DJB and NJB then being in company. 
        
       
       
       DJB 
       
       
        
        On 9 October 2004 at Narrabri in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with TE, without the consent of TE, knowing she did not consent thereto, in circumstances of aggravation, TE then being under the age of 16 years namely 14 years of age.” 
        
       
      
    2 This indictment was presented on 2 September 2005 when both the appellant and NB pleaded not guilty. However, NB asked for a separate trial and, following discussion between his counsel and the Crown Prosecutor, the trial was adjourned. It would seem that NB had given instructions that he would plead guilty if separately indicted. This occurred. 
     
      
    3 On 14 November 2005 a fresh indictment was presented which confined the charges to the appellant. That indictment was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “DJB 
       
       
        
        On 9 October 2004 at Narrabri in the State of New South Wales did unlawfully cause TE to take an overpowering drug, Diazepam, with intent to enable himself to commit an indictable offence, namely sexual intercourse without consent. 
        
       
       
       DJB 
       
       
        
        On 9 October 2004 at Narrabri in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with TE, without the consent of TE, knowing she did not consent thereto, in circumstances of aggravation, TE then being under the age of 16 years, namely 14 years of age. 
        
       
       
       DJB 
       
       
        
        On 9 October 2004 at Narrabri in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with TE, without the consent of TE, knowing she did not consent thereto, in circumstances of aggravation, TE then being under the age of 16 years, namely 14 years of age.” 
        
       
      
    4 The drafting of the second count was changed in relation to the circumstances of alleged aggravation. In the first indictment the pleaded circumstance of aggravation was that the appellant was in company with NB. In the second indictment the pleaded circumstance of aggravation was that the victim was under the age of 16 years. This count was put to the jury on the basis that the appellant had “aided and abetted” NB, the latter having had intercourse with TE. 
     
      
    5 The appellant was convicted on each count and sentenced to concurrent terms of 12 years imprisonment comprising non-parole periods of 8 years to commence on 11 October 2004 and expire on 10 October 2012 and a balance of 4 years to expire on 10 October 2016. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    6 The complainant was a 14 year old girl who was staying with her cousin who lived across the road from the appellant. On 9 October 2004 she spent time with the appellant’s sons, 14 year old NB and 12 year old MB. They set some rabbit traps and played football. 
     
      
    7 After a time the complainant went back to her cousin’s house to obtain a drink. A while later the complainant returned to the appellant’s house to again play football with the boys. The appellant was not home but arrived after about half an hour holding a bottle of rum. Both the sons had a drink and the complainant had a glass of diet Coke. When they finished playing football, they went inside the appellant’s house to play with the PlayStation. 
     
      
    8 The appellant asked the complainant if she wanted a drink of Diet Coke. She said “yes.” She gave evidence that the next thing she remembered was waking up in the appellant’s bed with his hand over her mouth. She managed to get away by kicking him in the groin and running outside. Her shirt was twisted and her bra was undone. She ran around trying to find the front door but when this failed she left by the back door, jumped the fence and ran to her cousin’s house. 
     
      
    9 When she arrived at her cousin’s place her uncle attempted to settle her down before taking her to the police station. Constable Grant Bell arrived at the station at about 2.30 am. After she had been at the police station for about 3 hours the complainant was taken to the hospital. 
     
      
    10 In her evidence the complainant said of the meeting with the appellant when he came home holding a bottle of rum:  
     
      
       
        
        “He had a bottle of rum and he was out the back and he gave N and M a drink of it, and he asked me and I said, no, and then we just kept playing football for about an hour and then he told N to, if we wanted to go inside, play PlayStation. So then we went and played PlayStation and he asked me if I wanted a drink of Diet Coke and I said, yeah, and then next thing I woke up in his bed with his hand over me mouth.” 
        
       
      
    11 The complainant said that while they were outside the appellant was “saying dirty stuff to her.” “He’s saying stuff about head jobs. He offered me $50 if I gave him a head job and I said, No, and then he offered me $100 and I said, No, and that is when I went back to [her cousin’s place] to get a drink and that.” 
     
      
    12 She said that when the appellant came back from town he was “just saying stuff like that and he’s going, you’re lips are big and I go, yeah, and he goes, no, not the one upstairs, the one’s down lower, and all dirty stuff like that.” 
     
      
    13 The appellant’s sons were standing about 2 metres away but the complainant believed they did not hear what the appellant had said. When she told NB that their father had just offered her $50 then $100 for “a head job” NB said “yeah I know, he was talking about it earlier.” 
     
      
    14 At another point in her evidence the complainant said that after they had gone inside and were playing the PlayStation the complainant said “we’re just racing each other and that, and (the appellant) asked me if I wanted a diet Coke and I said, yes, and then he brought it out and he told NB to keep racing me, like, in a real queer way, and then he brought back the drink and he said, Cheers, and he said to skull it. So I skulled it and then I woke up in his bed.” She said that she did not see the appellant mix the drink and it just tasted like diet Coke. 
     
      
    15 After she had returned to her cousin’s place she noticed that she had a “hickey” (love bite) on the left side of her neck and one on her right breast. 
     
      
    16 When she was examined at the hospital she was found to have blood in both her ears and in her hair. She had vomit all through her hair and she said her stomach felt “just, like, crook as.” 
     
      
    17 The complainant gave evidence that she had not consented to anybody having sexual intercourse with her that night. She said that at the time of the offence she was not on any medication and did not take any type of medication with Diazepam in it. 
     
      
    18 When cross-examined the complainant denied any memory of having sex with NB or drinking alcohol that evening. She agreed that the possibility she had been drugged was first raised with her by the doctors in the hospital. She denied saying that she was drunk or that she had told anyone she had been drinking. However, she did say she had passed out. 
     
      
    19 The complainant accepted that the sequence of events which she recorded in her record of interview may not be entirely correct. However, if there was an error it was of no significance. 
     
      
    20 The complainant said that she recalled that when she woke up in the appellant’s bedroom it was pitch black and her head was spinning. She said she could not focus and she was not aware of what was happening around her in the lounge room. She said that when she woke up she knew from its size that it was the appellant’s hand that had been over her mouth. She accepted that at the police station she said that it was either the appellant or NB but as she became less shocked she said her memory became more certain. 
     
      
    21 The complainant agreed that she had a recollection of kissing NB that evening in the lounge room. She said she kissed him on the cheek. She said that she had no recollection of having had sex with him or saying during intercourse “Oh that is good.” She disagreed that she was flirting with NB the whole afternoon. The complainant had no recollection of vomiting in the bedroom and had no recollection of NB trying to mop it up. 
     
      
    22 The appellant’s son, MB, who was 12 years at the time of the offence, was an important Crown witness. Although he was staying at his father’s place on the day of the offence, he usually resided elsewhere with his mother and her boyfriend. He made a record of interview which was tendered in evidence and played to the jury. He said that when MB, NB and the complainant were at the appellant’s house playing a game of football: 
     
      
       
        
        “… and then me dad and that was chattin’ her up, sort of thing, and she wanted me dad, like, me dad went to buy her a pack of smokes, and then when me dad was gone, she said that me dad said to her that he’ll pay her $100 to give, like, have sex with him. And then after that we was playin’ footy and that, me and me brother, and she was watchin’, and what else was it? And after that we were talkin’ about it and talkin’, and then me dad and that, like, me dad suggested that, Go buy a big bottle of rum, Go buy some rum, or somethin’, to like, drink it and all that … and then get drunk, and [the complainant’s], like, she agreed to, like, get drunk and that ….” 
        
       
      
    23 MB said that he himself had drunk some rum with diet Coke and after they had gone inside his father had filled his glass again and he was sick. He said that his brother (NB) was “pashing” the complainant and his father went out into the kitchen and mixed what MB thought was “bicarb soda or somethin’” in some water. The interview contained the following exchanges: 
     
      
       
        
        Q: Yeah? 
         
        A: I’m not exactly sure what it was, but what it looked like in the glass with the water, ‘cause he used to drink it all the time to clean himself out, and it just looked like that. And then he poured it into her drink, ‘cause he was puttin’ about that much in a schooner, it was, schooner glasses, and then toppin’ it up with diet Coke. And then he poured stuff in it and then it all just foamed up, sort of thing, and then me brother was, like, tellin’ her to drink it and that. And then she was basically knocked out, almost, and me dad and me brother took her in and put her on the bed and … 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Mmm 
        
       
       
        
        A: … then me brother was, like, got on the bed and was pashin’ her, and then me father was basically just, like, just pulled her pants down and pulled me brother’s pants down, and then me brother started havin’ sex with her, and then he was doin’ that for about 10 minutes. Then me dad pulled, pulled me brother off and then he pulled her over to the side of the bed, like, while me brother was havin’ sex with her, me dad pulled his, like, took his undies and everything off, his pants and that, and then he pulled her over to the side of the bed, like, and put her legs in the air and he started havin’ sex with her. And then we went out and, like, he started hurtin’ her, he, she was yelln’ that, You fucked me hip, ‘cause, like, he pushed her hip right down, oh, no, that’s right, we went into, me dad asked us to go get the olive oil. We went in there to get the olive oil and then, while we was in there, she fell off the bed, like, she fell off the bed and hit the cupboard and we was in there and then the photo fell off the wall and smashed on, near his cupboard. And then, then she started yellin’, Oh, you fucked me hip, and all that, and I can’t really remember it. And then she … 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What happened after that? 
         
        A: … she was, I can’t really remember but she started yellin’, You’re hurtin’ me, you’re hurtin’ me, and all that, and then she was yellin’, I’m scared, and all this. And then me dad’s goin’, Wake up to yourself, and all that, and then after that, me brother and me was tryin’ to get him off her, and then me dad just, like, went, smack, and smacked me brother in the mouth and me brother was walkin’ round like he was sort of puttin’ his arms above his, above his head shakin’ ‘em and sort of half cryin’, sort of thing, and then sort of stompin’ his feet and that, and tryin’, he’s sayin’, How can we stop him, and everything. And then, oh, like, me dad was, she was tellin’ me dad to stop and everything … 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Mmm. 
         
        A: … but me dad wouldn’t stop and that. And me brother sort of chucked a schiz sort of thing, like, wasn’t hurtin’ no one or nothing, but he sort of didn’t know what to do. And then she was screamin’ that she wanted, who was it? Was it, I think it’s T she was yellin’ or something’, or, oh, what was it? Oh, well, it was whoever, whoever her cousin or brother or whoever it was girlfriend, that’s who she was yellin’ out to. And then, oh, and then me brother kept getting’ me to go out and check if anyone was home, and, like, they come to the door and they said, Is [the complainant] here? Then me brother said, No, she’s not here, and then me dad goes, Last time we seen her, she was goin’ up the shop. And then he kept getting’ me to run out and see if anyone was home. There was no one home for, I don’t know about an hour, 2 hours or somethin’, and then, like, they fell off the bed and then me dad left her and, like, we come out of the room, me dad did and that. And I didn’t know whether to run over the road, see if anyone was home and get ‘em to come over or not, and then I thought if I did, me dad would’ve flogged the shit out of me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Sorry. Yeah? 
         
        A: And then, like, I kept runnin’ out the door, runnin’ to the gate and runnin’ back, sort of thing, didn’t know whether to do it or not. And then, and then, like, me dad and that come out of the bedroom … 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Mmm. 
         
        A: … then we made a cake. Me dad said he wanted some cake and coffee, so we cooked a cake, and then we had to make him a coffee and everything. And, like, she spewed everywhere, she was layin’ on the floor and, like, spewed all over herself, and then, like, I heard her spewin’ so I ran in and lifted her up so she wouldn’t choke or anything. And then what was, and then I told, yelled out to me brother to come and help, and then me dad was sayin’, Just, just leave her there. And then he was forcin’ us to clean his floor and everything and then he, me brother and that was tryin’ to, me brother and me dad was tryin’ to make me take her clothes off to, so they could go wash ‘em. And then I, I didn’t want to touch her, ‘cause I didn’t want to get into trouble for nothin’, ‘cause I knew that he would’ve ended up gettin’ in trouble. And then me brother and me dad took the clothes off her and then they made me take ‘em out and put ‘em in the washin’ machine and we had to clean all the spew up and everything. And after that, me dad was tryin’ to have sex with her again, and then she’s yellin’, Leave me alone, don’t touch me, and, I want, whatever her brother or cousin’s, T, or whatever her name is, she was yellin’ out for her, then she’s yelled, then she was yellin’ out to me brother and she’s yellin’, Take me home, NB, take me home. And then me brother was sayin’, Yeah, I will if you be quiet. And then she’s yellin’ that, Don’t touch me and that. I’ve already said that. Oh, I just can’t think. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: That’s all right, you’re doing well. 
         
        A: Yeah, after that, then about half hour after that or somethin’, I can’t remember in between … 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Mmm. 
         
        A: … sort of thing, and then I think it was, she got up, like, walkin’ round the house sayin’, yellin’, Where’s the door, NB, show me the door, and everything. And then me dad’s sayin’, Don’t let her out the door, ‘cause she’s drunk and off her head and everything, and if you let her out the door she’ll probably go and get run over. And then she was yellin’, MB, where’s the door? And then I was just sayin’, I don’t know, ‘cause oh … 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Mmm. 
         
        A: I just said, I don’t know where it is, ‘cause I didn’t want me dad to do nothing. And then she kept yellin’, and stuff and then me dad said, If you keep yellin’ and screamin’, you spewin’ bitch, I’m goin’ to call the police. And she’s yellin’, Call the police and I’ll have you on charges, and stuff like that, she was. And then she said, I’m goin’ to have you on charges for rape, and then she was, she got up, like, me dad was tryin’ to have sex with her again, then she got up, runnin’ round the house lookin’ for the door, and then me and me brother was hidin’ from her, like, ‘cause we didn’t want her to see us, and, yeah, and then she kept yellin’ and screamin’ and stuff and she spewed all through me dad’s bed and everything, and then he got the shits and that, and then after a while of her yellin’ and screamin’ and stuff, he told me brother to take her home. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Mmm. 
        
       
       
        
        A: And then, oh, no, she was walkin’ round the house and then she sat down on the chair. She was sort of cryin’, sort of thing, mumblin’ and stuff, and the, what was it? She went to sleep and then, like, we ate the cake and everything, ‘cause we had to wait about 40 minutes or 35 minutes or somethin’ for it to cook. And then after that, she was just, like, she was asleep on the lounge, and then me dad, after we’d eaten some, me dad told us to go to bed, and then me brother said, Don’t touch her, and then me dad said, I’m not goin’ to touch her. And then we went into the bedroom and then we heard her yellin’ and screamin’, Don’t touch me, ‘cause, but she was on the lounge, and me dad’s goin’, Come on, get up and get in the bed. And she said, I don’t want to get in the bed. And then me dad said, You can’t sleep here all night, and then she said, Yes, I can, she said, and he goes, Well, you’re not, and he goes, she goes, Yes, I am. And then he tried carryin’ her into the bed and then he was, she was yellin’, Don’t touch me, leave me alone, and me dad yelled out to me brother, NB, and then he, what was it? He went and helped him take her into the bed. Oh, no, first he was sayin’, Dad, don’t touch her, and then he goes, I’m not touchin’ her, I’m tryin’ to put her into the bed, and then, so me brother went and helped him after me dad had called out to him to come and help. And then, yeah, and then they got her on the bed and then me dad got on the bed and then we was in there and then all we could hear was her yellin’ and screamin’, Don’t touch me, and, I’m goin’ to have you up for rape, and everything. And then me brother was goin’, sayin’, Don’t touch her. And then me dad said, I’m not, you can come and turn the light on if you want. And then me brother was doin’ it, he did it a couple of times. He just kept flickin’ it on and off. He kept doin’ that a few times. And then me brother, he sort of stayed on the lounge for a little while and then he heard her screamin’ again so I ran up and flicked the light on and then was he come, she got up and was walkin’ round the house again and yelling out, Where’s the door? And then me dad got sick of it and so he said, NB, take her home. And then, so he took her to the door and then she just walked home and me brother watched her walk across the road to where she was stayin’, and then that was it, basically. We just went back to bed and went to sleep.” 
        
       
      
    24 MB said that he did not hear the appellant offer the complainant money for sex but he had heard his father say other things such as “do you want to play turkeys, I’ll be the turkey and you do the gobblin’” and “do you want to play lions and tigers? You be the lion and I’ll feed you the meat.” MB gave evidence that he knew what occurred during the sexual act between humans. 
     
      
    25 MB said he saw the appellant pour a glass of rum and coke for the complainant. He said that about half the glass was rum and the rest was diet Coke. He gave evidence that “me dad was tryin’ to get her drunk. He said, when she went over there to take the dogs home, he said, I’m goin’ to get her drunk and I’m goin’ to root her.” 
     
      
    26 MB said that a minute or two after consuming the drink prepared by the appellant the complainant “crashed out” and the appellant and his brother got her onto the bed. He said the appellant started to pull the complainant’s pants down and his brother was hitting him to stop him but the appellant kept pulling them off and then the appellant pulled off NB’s pants and NB then had intercourse. MB said he was standing at the end of the bed and he could see what was happening. He said that his brother and the complainant still had their shirts on. He said that the complainant had said “Oh, that’s good.” He said she was “not moving much at all, she was almost knocked out but was still talking.” 
     
      
    27 MB said he was frightened at the time. His father had said “you tell anyone and I’ll kill you.” When asked whether he thought the complainant was participating in the sexual act he said “nuh-uh. Not really. She didn’t want me father to do nothin’ to her, like, she was yellin’ and screamin’ to, tellin’ him to get off her.” 
     
      
    28 MB said that he thought his dad would “belt the shit out of him” if he let anyone know what was happening. He said that the appellant had belted him before and would zap the boys with a cattle prod. He said that the appellant had a gun in the cupboard in his bedroom for which he had made a silencer. 
     
      
    29 MB said that he had cleaned up most of the complainant’s vomit and the next morning the appellant had made him and his brother scrub the floor in the appellant’s room with disinfectant. He said that his brother and the appellant had taken the complainant’s clothes off her and then he put her shorts and shirt in the washing machine. 
     
      
    30 MB also gave oral evidence and was challenged in cross-examination. It was suggested to him that he had made up the story to “get his father out of the picture.” He did agree that he hated his father and said that “I hated him at the time for what he had done.” He said that his father was drunk on that night and could barely stand up. 
     
      
    31 The complainant was referred from Narrabri Hospital to the sexual assault clinic in Tamworth. She was examined by Dr Croker who said the complainant appeared tired with blood shot eyes, her hair was messed up and matted with vomit and her hands and feet were dirty. She found a red substance in both external ear canals that could have been blood and a lesion consistent with oral suction on her neck and right breast. Dr Croker took both a low vaginal swab and a high vaginal swab. She said that her examination of the complainant was consistent with the complainant having had sexual intercourse the night before.  
     
      
    32 Dr David Lee was a pathology technician at Royal Prince Alfred hospital in Sydney. He tested a sample of the complainant’s blood but did not detect Diazepam or Nordiazepam which results from the ingestion of Diazepam. His laboratory used gas chromatography. Blood may also be tested by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. He said that the equipment he used was less sensitive than the more modern equipment which, since testing the complainant’s blood, he had commenced using. 
     
      
    33 Mr Lee was aware that the Division of Analytical Laboratories detected 0.02 milligrams per litre of Diazepam and 0.01 milligram per litre of Nordiazepam in the blood sample. Less than .1 milligram per litre of Nordiazepam was lower than the detection limits of the detection equipment he used, although 0.2 milligrams per litre of Diazepam should have been within the range of his equipment. He explained the fact that his equipment had not detected Diazepam as being due to a loss of sensitivity in his equipment and natural variation in testing samples. He said that although laboratories analyse the same specimens they do not analyse the same actual goblets of blood and because of this there can be slight variations in their findings. When cross-examined he said that he had become aware that his machine was losing sensitivity when he had compared it with the results from other laboratories. 
     
      
    34 Mr Glyn Hanson from the Division of Analytical Laboratories at Lidcombe gave evidence that the laboratory had detected 0.02 milligrams per litre of Diazepam and 0.01 milligrams per litre of Nordiazepam in the complainant’s blood. He said that his laboratory used liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. He said that each time they did an analysis they ran quality control samples which checked that their machine was functioning accurately. 
     
      
    35 Mr William Allender is a forensic pharmacologist with the police service. He said that Diazepam belonged to the drug group benzodiazepines which have anti-convulsive muscle relaxant and amnesic properties. They cause drowsiness, sedation and ataxia. The symptoms are exacerbated by other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol. He was aware that the complainant reported having no memory at all for a period of some hours following the taking of the drug. He was of the opinion that the complainant’s reported symptoms were characteristic of a person who had taken benzodiazepines. He said it was also consistent with the ingestion of benzodiazepines that the complainant was unable to walk and had to be carried by two people to a bed. 
     
      
    36 He said that Diazepam would not fizz if placed in water but it would if placed in a carbonated drink, such as diet Coke. Although he had reservations about the accuracy of a back calculation of the drug dosage his best estimate was that having regard to the later blood tests the complainant had received a dose of 5 milligrams of Diazepam. 
     
      
    37 Evidence was also given by a scientist from the Division of Analytical Laboratories at Lidcombe, who had analysed the DNA of the buccal swab from the appellant. Ms Franco visually identified sperm in the complainant’s vulval smear and a chemical test indicated that sperm was present in an extract from the combined low and high vaginal smears. The DNA recovered from the sperm in the vulval smear had the same DNA profile as the DNA profile which is expected to occur at the frequency of 1 in 1500 million of the appellant’s buccal swab. Although the DNA of the complainant was also identified the presence of the DNA of another male contributor other than the appellant could not be confirmed. A buccal swab was also obtained from NB and the same DNA testing procedure was carried out to identify his DNA profile. The analysis showed that NB could not have been a male contributor. Similarly, the analysis ruled out that the DNA on the vulval and vaginal swabs could have originated from Fiona Golding (mother of NB and MB) based on her buccal swab. Although no buccal swab was taken from MB, assuming that he is the biological offspring of Fiona Golding and the appellant, from whom buccal swabs were taken, the available genetic information allowed MB to be excluded as a DNA source from the vulval swab. However, in respect of the vaginal swabs, the best Ms Franco could conclude was that it was “unlikely” that MB was a DNA source, since there was no indication of a third contributor (other than the appellant and complainant) and there was only a small amount of male DNA present in the vaginal swab testing sample. 
     
      
    38 Professor Christie, Professor of Pharmacology at the Royal North Shore Hospital was called in the appellant’s case. He gave evidence that in his opinion it would take a relatively large dose of benzodiazepine to render someone unconscious for four hours. He believed that a dose of at least 10 milligrams would be necessary. He believed from the later analysis of the complainant’s blood that the complainant had consumed less than 5 milligrams of Diazepam which he thought unlikely to make a person fully unconscious. They may be drowsy and fall asleep and suffer a loss of gross motor control. He also accepted that benzodiazepine had an amnesic effect but said he would not expect profound amnesia until doses above 10 milligrams. 
     
      
    39 Professor Christie said that he believed that a blood alcohol reading of 0.2 grams per 100 millilitres would be necessary to render someone unconscious for 4 hours. He noted that alcohol also produces amnesia, where the person would experience black outs and form no memory of them. He said that the effects of alcohol on a 14 year old girl would be more profound and would begin to be observable at blood alcohol concentrations lower than 0.2. He accepted that the combined effect of benzodiazepine and alcohol was “essentially additive.” 
     
      
    40 When cross-examined Prof Christie accepted that if the complainant ingested a glass of liquid which was one-third full of rum she would consume five standard drinks. If consumed in a short time he believed the complainant would be affected very quickly and become profoundly intoxicated. He accepted that Diazepam had a combined effect with alcohol and if the complainant was still functioning after five standard drinks, the addition of 5 milligrams of Diazepam would have rendered her helpless. He accepted that within half an hour the complainant would have been unable to walk, would have appeared to have been almost unconscious, but would have been able to protest from time to time. He accepted that the complainant vomiting was consistent with the consumption of five standard drinks in a short period of time. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    41 There are seven grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – the trial miscarried 
       
      Ground 2 – the trial was a nullity 
       
      
    42 The appellant submitted that the indictment dated 15 November 2005 which was presented to the court in the presence of the jury panel on that day was invalid. It was submitted that because the indictment dated 2 September 2005, whereby the appellant was jointly charged with his son in relation to the second count, continued to exist, with the consequence that there was more than one indictment, the trial was fundamentally flawed. Reference was made to R v Landy [1943] VLR 73; Munday v Gill (1930) 44 CLR 38 at 87; R v Tagaras (NSWCCA, unreported, 9 April 1974) and R v Howard (1992) 29 NSWLR 242 at 247-248. 
     
      
    43 Section 130 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) provides that the court has jurisdiction with respect to the conduct of proceedings on indictment “as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused person is arraigned” (s 130(2)). Section 20 provides for the amendment or substitution of an indictment which has been presented. After presentation it may not be amended except by the prosecutor (a) with the leave of the court, or (b) with the consent of the accused. Section 21 provides for amendment of a defective indictment and for separate trials and postponement of the trial. Section 22 provides for the recording of an order amending an indictment and is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If any indictment is amended, a note of the order for amendment is to be endorsed on the indictment, and the indictment in its amended form is to be treated as the indictment for the purposes of the trial and all proceedings in connection with or consequent on the trial. 
         
         
        (2) Any verdict or judgment given after the amendment of an indictment is to have the same force and effect as if the indictment had originally been in its amended form. 
         
         
        (3) If it is necessary at any time to draw up a formal record of an indictment, the record may be drawn up in the words and form of the amended indictment, without notice of the fact of the amendment.” 
        
       
      
    44 Section 129 of the Act provides that an indictment is to be presented within 4 weeks after the committal of an accused at the trial, “except as provided by this section” (s 129(2)). The time for presentation of an indictment may be extended by regulation or order of the relevant court (s 129(3)). Subsection 129(4) of the Act provides for the continuation of a trial even when an indictment has not been presented within the time required by the section. 
     
      
    45 For the purposes of s 129(3), extensions to the time within which the indictment is to be presented are provided for by the District Court Rules 1973 (NSW). Clause 10D of Part 53 permits an indictment to be presented by filing a copy of it with the registrar and then serving a copy on the accused or their legal representative within 14 days of filing. Presentation of the indictment by filing must still comply with s 129(2) of the Act within 4 weeks after the committal. However, Clause 10E of Part 53 extends the time to 8 weeks after the committal. 
     
      
    46 The appellant submitted that there were two deficiencies of fundamental significance in the present case. Firstly, it was submitted that the indictment on which the appellant was tried was not the original indictment and was not presented pursuant to any order allowing for its amendment. Furthermore, it was submitted that it was presented out of time and no order as contemplated by s 129(4) of the Act was made. 
     
      
    47 It was suggested that the indictment upon which the appellant was tried was presented in order to overcome the difficulties created by the fact that the appellant’s son NB had pleaded guilty to the second count. This would seem to be a likely explanation. It was apparently recognised by the prosecution and, in the absence of any protest or contrary submission by counsel for the appellant, accepted on his behalf, that if an indictment which included the second count in its original form was presented, the jury would inevitably be alerted to the fact that the appellant’s son NB had pleaded guilty. This may have had the effect of prejudicing the appellant’s trial. As the charge could be reformulated without any reference to the appellant’s son NB this was considered by all concerned to be the appropriate course to take.  
     
      
    48 The appellant is correct in his submission that there is no record that the court granted leave to amend the original indictment. However, s 20(1)(b) provides that an indictment may be amended with the consent of the accused. The appellant’s counsel at the trial gave evidence before this Court but he has no recollection of the sequence of events. This trial was conducted over a number of days and the appellant pleaded to each of the counts in the indictment. There was not the slightest suggestion that he did not consent to being tried on that indictment. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the appellant’s consent to the substitution of the new indictment is to be implied for the purpose of s 20(1)(b) of the Act. Subsection 20(3) provides that an amendment to an indictment includes the substitution of an indictment (see R v Taylor [2003] NSWCCA 194 [155]; R v Sepulveda [2003] NSWCCA 131 [33]). The appellant was not prejudiced by the presentation of the fresh indictment, indeed it was prepared for his benefit and I do not consider that any irregularity has occurred which could vitiate his trial. 
     
      
    49 I understand that the process followed in this case is the common practice in the District Court where, by reason of circumstances which arise after an indictment has been presented, it is necessary to prepare a fresh indictment. Rather than deal with the matter informally as happened in this case, where an accused pleads to a fresh indictment the court should ensure that the procedure provided by the statute is followed and, if necessary, leave is granted and consequential orders made. If this course is taken the controversy identified in the present case will be avoided. 
     
      
    50 To my mind the appellant’s argument directed to s 129(4) should be rejected. Although the court may “take such other action as it thinks appropriate in the circumstances of the case” s 129(4)(c), s 129(4)(a) provides that the trial may proceed even if the indictment has been presented but not within the relevant time and thus not in compliance with s 129(2) and s 129(3) of the Act or cl 10D and Cl 10E of the District Court rules.  
     
      
    51 Furthermore, in my opinion the decisions referred to by the appellant do not require a different conclusion. In each of those cases the problem arose from the indictment presented to the jury. It was not authorised in R v Janceski (2005) 64 NSWLR 10 and there were multiple indictments in Munday. In the present case the substituted indictment was presented to the jury and he was tried on that indictment. There was no injustice occasioned to the appellant and the trial was not affected by any fundamental defect. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – the trial judge misdirected the jury in respect of the second count in the indictment 
       
      
    52 The appellant’s submission was that the directions by the trial judge in relation to this count “hopelessly confused” the jury as to the matters which they were required to find in order to convict the appellant. The count required directions in relation to the liability of an accessory and were of necessity complicated. Before they could convict the appellant the jury had to be satisfied, inter alia, that his son, NB, had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent and with knowledge that she did not consent, she being then under the age of 16 years, namely 14 years. 
     
      
    53 In the course of the summing-up his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second charge, members of the jury, in this charge the Crown does not seek to prove that the accused himself committed the crime of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation. On the second count the Crown alleges that the accused was aiding and abetting in the commission by the principal offender, [NB], of that offence. An aider and abetter is a person who is present at the time when a crime is committed by another person and who intentionally aids or gives encouragement to that other person in the commission of that crime. The law regards such an aider and abetter as just as guilty of the crime as the person who actually commits it. The mere presence of the accused at the scene of the crime is not sufficient to make the accused an aider and abetter, it must be shown that there was also intentional aid or encouragement to that other person, in this case, [NB], in the commission of the crime. Such encouragement is established if the Crown satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was both present and ready to give aid to the person, [NB], who was actually committing the crime. Such readiness to give aid if required amounts to an encouragement to that other person to commit the crime and makes the accused an aider and abetter and as equally as guilty of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        First of all of course you must be satisfied that the crime of sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without her consent, knowing that she did not consent thereto in circumstances of aggravation, she then being under the age of 16 years, namely 14 years, that that offence was committed by [NB] before you can be satisfied that the accused was an aider and abetter to the commission of that offence. If the Crown has satisfied you that the crime was committed, you must then consider whether at the time when that crime was being committed the accused himself was both present and intentionally gave either aid or encouragement to its commission by [NB]. Before you could find that the accused intentionally gave either aid or encouragement in the commission of the crime, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew all the essential facts or circumstances that have to be proved by the Crown to show that the crime was committed by the principal offender. The intention to assist or encourage must be based on the accused’s knowledge of the essential facts. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown relies on various matters in support of the allegation that the  
        accused 
         gave aid and encouragement to [NB]. Amongst other things, that the  
        accused 
        , together with [NB], carried the complainant to the bedroom of the house, that the accused helped to remove [NB’s] pants as well as the complainant, [the complainant’s], pants. He was present and encouraging [NB] to have sexual intercourse with the complainant, knowing that it was against her will, that the complainant was not capable of giving consent, of which the accused well knew. 
        
       
       
        
        In short then, to establish this offence on the second count, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of the offence by the principal offender, [NB], the presence of the accused at the time the crime was committed; and thirdly, that the accused knew all the essential facts or circumstances necessary to show the crime was committed by the principal offender, [NB], and fourthly, that with that knowledge he intentionally assisted or encouraged [NB] to commit the crime. 
        
       
       
        
        For you to be satisfied that the principal offender, [NB], committed the crime, the Crown must prove each of the following elements beyond reasonable doubt. Firstly, that the person, [NB], had sexual intercourse with the complainant; secondly, that sexual intercourse occurred without the consent of the complainant; thirdly, that [NB] knew or was reckless to the lack of consent of the complainant to the sexual intercourse; and fourthly, the complainant was under the age of sixteen, namely fourteen. 
        
       
       
        
        Firstly, in relation to the first element, that [NB] had sexual intercourse with the complainant. Sexual intercourse is defined in law as being a sexual connection occasioned by the penetration to any extent of the genitals of a female person by any part of the body of another person. Consequently, the penetration of the vagina by the penis of another person would constitute an act of sexual intercourse. The Crown does not have to prove that full penetration occurred, nor does it have to prove that the accused ejaculated. 
        
       
       
        
        The second element is that sexual intercourse occurred without the consent of the victim. It should be noted that [NB] does not have to prove that the complainant consented, it is for the Crown to prove that she did not. Consent involves conscious and voluntary permission by the complainant to engage in sexual intercourse. It can be given verbally or it can be expressed by actions. Similarly, absence of consent does not have to be in words. The law specifically provides that a person who does not offer actual physical resistance to sexual intercourse is not, by reason only of that fact, to be regarded as consenting to the sexual intercourse. 
        
       
       
        
        Thirdly, that the  
        accused 
         knew of the lack of consent. The Crown must prove to you beyond reasonable doubt that [NB] knew that the complainant did not consent. This is a subjective and not an objective test, that is, it is not what you or a reasonable person knew, it is whether [NB] in his mind knew that she did not consent. 
        
       
       
        
        You might ask how, in the absence of an admission by the  
        accused 
         or by [NB], if the Crown can prove that he was aware that she did not consent. The Crown asks you to infer from the facts that she did not consent. The Crown asks you to infer from all of the facts which she has set out to prove that he, [NB], must have known, that he indeed did know that she was not consenting. 
        
       
       
        
        In a situation where the complainant does not in fact consent, the  
        accused’s 
         state of mind at the time of the act of sexual intercourse might be that he actually knew that she was not consenting. This is a guilty state of mind. If the Crown satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt that that was the state of mind of [NB] at the time of the act of intercourse, then that element has been made out. On the other hand, [NB’s] state of mind might be that he honestly, though wrongly believed the complainant was consenting to intercourse. This is not a guilty state of mind. It is for the Crown to prove that [NB] had a guilty mind so that if the Crown has failed to prove that at the time of intercourse, if the  
        accused 
         did not honestly believe that she was consenting, then you would have to say that the third element of the offence is not made out, and return a verdict of not guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        Between the two situations I explained to you, being on the one hand the knowledge of [NB] that she did not consent - on the other hand, and honest though mistaken belief that she did consent - there lies a third possibility, that is whether [NB] was reckless as to whether she was consenting or not. If the Crown has, in your opinion, established beyond reasonable doubt that the [NB] had sexual intercourse with the complainant and he was reckless as to whether she consented to that intercourse, then in law the  
        accused 
         will be taken to know that she did not consent to the sexual intercourse. 
        
       
       
        
        In order to establish that the  
        accused 
         was acting recklessly, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt either (1) [NB’s] state of mind was such that he simply failed to consider whether or not she was consenting at all and just went ahead with the act of sexual intercourse, notwithstanding that a risk that she was not consenting would have been obvious to someone with his mental capacity, if he had turned his mind to it; or secondly, [NB’s] state of mind was such that he realised the possibility that she was not consenting, but went ahead regardless of whether she was consenting or not. 
        
       
       
        
        The fourth element of the offence is in circumstances of aggravation, that is [the complainant] then being under the age of sixteen years, namely fourteen years. Circumstances of aggravation are defined in law. They include the fact that the complainant is under the age of sixteen years. In this case there is no dispute that she was in fact under that age. 
        
       
       
        
        Members of the jury, in relation to that second count, there is an alternative verdict open to you on that count. It is not contained in the indictment, but as a matter of law there would be an alternative verdict open to you, that is, if you were not satisfied of the guilt of the accused in relation to any aspects of the charge on the second count, it would be open to you to reach an alternative verdict, that is a verdict to a lesser offence, namely that any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of ten years and under the age of sixteen years is guilty of an offence. That is, the elements of this offence are that [NB] had sexual intercourse with [the complainant], that she was then between the ages of ten and sixteen and that the  
        accused 
         was encouraging, aiding and abetting [NB] to have sexual intercourse. That means, of course, that the element of consent is not an issue in that charge. The consent of the complainant is no defence to a charge under that section. I hope I have made that clear. It is really referring to the charge which has commonly been known as carnal knowledge, so it does not involve a matter of consent, so the facts, if you were not satisfied under the second count, you could proceed to consider that alternative verdict, that is that - if I could just repeat that, that [NB] had had sexual intercourse with [the complainant] and that the  
        accused 
         aided and abetted him in having that sexual intercourse.” 
        
       
      
    54 The appellant does not complain about the explanation which his Honour gave the jury of the criminal liability of an aider and abetter. Furthermore, he does not complain about his Honour’s identification of the factual elements which the Crown relied on. The appellant’s complaint arises from his Honour’s reference to the “accused” in the various paragraphs which I have set out above and where the word “accused” has been underlined.  
     
      
    55 His Honour is careful when introducing this aspect of the summing up to separate the actions of the son, [NB], from those of the appellant. His Honour referred to the appellant’s son “as the principal offender” and said that the Crown must prove that he committed the crime which comprised four elements. His Honour then proceeds to discuss each of those elements and relates them to the circumstances of this case. The reference to the “accused” in the paragraph commencing “thirdly” is followed by a direction that the Crown must prove that NB knew the complainant did not consent. I am satisfied that the jury would have understood the reference to the accused as a reference to the appellant. The reference to NB was of course a reference to his son. No confusion could arise.  
     
      
    56 The next reference to the “accused” is made when NB is referred to in the alternative. Again, no confusion could arise. 
     
      
    57 The third reference to the “accused” is to the “accused’s state of mind” and his Honour explains that he is speaking generally. He then refers to the state of mind of NB. No confusion could arise.  
     
      
    58 The fourth reference to the “accused” occurs as part of the same discussion and his Honour distinguishes the mind of NB from the belief of the appellant. The fifth and sixth references to the accused also occur in sentences where his Honour makes plain that he is referring to the appellant distinguishing findings in relation to him from the findings which must be made in relation to the knowledge and conduct of NB. 
     
      
    59 The references to the “accused” in the final passage of the directions which I have included are without ambiguity. 
     
      
    60 I am satisfied that this ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 – the trial judge misdirected the jury in respect of the first count in the indictment 
       
       
        
        “The first offence is that on 9 October 2004 it is alleged that a Narrabri in the State of New south Wales, the accused did unlawfully cause TE to take an over-powering drug, Diazepam, with intent to enable himself to commit an indictable offence, namely sexual intercourse without consent. 
        
       
       
        
        The elements of this offence which must be proved beyond reasonable doubt before the accused can be found guilty are: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The accused unlawfully applied, administered or caused to be taken a substance; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Which was an overpowering drug or thing to the complainant, TE; 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The accused intended to enable himself, the accused, or some other person to commit an indictable offence, namely sexual intercourse without consent. 
        
       
       
        
        Those are the four elements. Members of the jury, an overpowering drug or thing is not defined in this charge, however, the term ‘overpowering’ ordinarily means to make helpless or ineffective.” 
        
       
      
    61 Count 1 in the indictment alleged that the appellant caused the complainant to take the Diazepam with intent to enable himself, ie the appellant, to commit an indictable offence. Accordingly, the reference which his Honour made to “some other person” to commit sexual intercourse without consent was erroneous. Although the Crown relied in relation to the second count on the appellant having been an “aider and abetter” this was not relevant to the first count. 
     
      
    62 Notwithstanding that this error occurred, I do not believe it was of significance. When convicting the appellant on count 1 the jury must have accepted that the appellant gave the complainant the diet Coke and rum drink after he had placed Diazepam in it. They must also have accepted that after the drink had taken effect the complainant was taken into the bedroom by the appellant and NB and was sexually assaulted by both males. The drug could only have been administered by the appellant with the intention of minimising the complainant’s resistance to sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    63 In convicting the appellant on count 2 the jury must have accepted that the appellant aided and abetted NB to sexually assault the complainant, an offence which occurred prior to the sexual assault alleged in count 3. In these circumstances, even though count 1 did not refer to a person other than the appellant, the jury must have accepted that when NB sexually assaulted the complainant she was under the influence of the drug administered by the appellant. Accordingly, the elements comprising the first count must have been found by the jury. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 - trial judge misdirected the jury on intoxication 
       
      
    64 The trial judge did not initially direct the jury in relation to intoxication. He was requested to do so by counsel for the appellant. In response to that request his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Secondly, in relation to the first count, that count as you know involves a question of specific intent. On the defence case there was evidence that the accused was intoxicated – I think that is really a question of fact. If you thought he was so intoxicated and affected, you may take that into consideration as to his intent to carry out that offence.” 
        
       
      
    65 Counsel for the appellant did not ask for any further direction and accordingly rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. 
     
      
    66 It was submitted on the appeal that the directions were wrong and rather than being confined to the first count his Honour should have referred to intoxication as being relevant to each count. It was further submitted that his Honour erred in apparently suggesting that “specific intent” was only relevant to the first count. Furthermore, it was submitted that his Honour should have brought home to the jury the effect of intoxication on the appellant’s appreciation as to NB’s understanding of whether the complainant was consenting as well as his own understanding. It was submitted that his Honour should have referred to the evidence of the appellant’s drinking and evidence from MB that the appellant was so drunk that he could hardly stand up. 
     
      
    67 Section 428C provides that intoxication, whether self induced or otherwise, may be taken into account in determining whether the accused intended to cause the result necessary for an offence of specific intent. An offence against s 38 of the Crimes Act, which constituted count 1 is an offence of specific intent (see the table to s 428B(2)(a)) and accordingly, intoxication may have been relevant. However, s 428C(2)(a) excludes evidence of intoxication where a person resolves to do the relevant act before becoming intoxicated, which the evidence suggests occurred with the appellant. 
     
      
    68 Counts 2 and 3 are not offences of specific intent. They are not included in the table and do not otherwise involve an intention to cause a specific result (s 428B(1)). Accordingly, leaving aside s 428C(2)(a) a direction in relation to intoxication was not required. 
     
      
    69 Even if the appellant was correct in the criticisms made of his Honour’s directions, I do not believe they have led to a miscarriage of justice. Notwithstanding the evidence that the appellant was drunk, the evidence of his actions do not admit of the possibility that he did not appreciate that the complainant was not consenting to sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    70 As I have already indicated the sequence of events commenced with the appellant making lewd suggestions to the complainant including asking for sex in return for payment. There was evidence that he said to MB “I am going to get her drunk and root her.” The appellant purchased rum and gave the complainant a significant quantity of it, included Diazepam and encouraged the complainant to “scoll” the drink. The evidence was that soon after taking the drink the complainant was for all purposes “unconscious.” She was quite simply unable to consent to or resist the sexual advances of the males. 
     
      
    71 The appellant and NB then carried the complainant to the bedroom, placed her on the bed, where the appellant removed NB’s pants and the complainant’s pants. NB made advances on the complainant and had intercourse with the complainant with the appellant present near by. The appellant then pulled NB away and proceeded himself to have intercourse with the complainant. The evidence was that he later told MB that he had “blown his load.” Later the appellant warned MB not to tell anyone what happened “’cause it’s 25 years’ gaol.” He also caused MB to put the clothes of the complainant in the washing machine.  
     
      
    72 In these circumstances I am satisfied there was no reasonable possibility that NB believed that the complainant was consenting to intercourse with him or the appellant thought that NB had that belief. Nor was there any reasonable possibility that the appellant believed the complainant was consenting to having sexual intercourse with him. 
     
      
    73 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6 – the appellant was prevented from properly testing the evidence 
       
      
    74 The appellant complained that counsel at his trial was unreasonably restrained by the trial judge and prevented from fully exercising his rights of cross-examination. The specific complaints related to: 
     
      
    · the witness MB denied that he had been accused by a friend of spiking his drink and volunteered that he had never spiked anyone’s drink. The judge rejected the specific question of the witness as to whether he had on another earlier occasion spiked another person’s drink; 
     
      
    · the witness MB admitted that he had been asked questions by his mother about having a pornographic movie at home but denied it was his. The trial judge ruled that he would reject questions of the mother in relation to her son’s possession of pornographic material; 
     
      
    · the witness MB denied that he had continued to hear voices. The trial judge rejected further questions of his mother as to telepsychiatry and his hearing voices; 
     
      
    · MB denied that he had stolen medication and the trial judge rejected questions of his mother to the effect that she had been informed by the police that he had stolen medication; 
     
      
    · the trial judge ruled that he would not compel the Crown to call the witness LB, the appellant’s mother, for the purpose of establishing a false complaint by MB; 
     
      
    75 There is no substance in these complaints by the appellant. In my view his Honour was correct in confining the questioning as he did. There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that MB was involved in any of the offences. The question in relation to the spiking of the drink was bad in form and rightly rejected. I see no significance in exploring the question of whether MB had access to pornographic material. The jury were able to observe MB both on video and at length in cross-examination and were accordingly able to assess his reliability and credibility. 
     
      
    76 In my opinion his Honour rightly confined the cross examination to matters relevant to the issues in the trial. 
     
      
    77 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7 – the conviction of the appellant on the second count was unreasonable 
       
      
    78 The appellant submitted that there was no objective evidence that NB had sexual intercourse with the complainant. No DNA of NB was located on her and the complainant said she had no recall of it having happened. In fact she believed that it did not happen. The evidence of these events came from MB.  
     
      
    79 It was further submitted that the evidence was consistent with consensual intercourse or at least a belief in NB that the complainant was consenting. Under cross-examination the complainant admitted that she knew NB was keen on her and was flirting with her. She admitted to a recollection of kissing NB. MB described his brother and the complainant as “going for it” and as “pashing” and said that when he saw them having sex he heard the complainant say things consistent with her enjoying it. The appellant also said that there was no evidence that NB was aware that the complainant had been supplied with a spiked drink. Finally, the appellant emphasised that the trial judge specifically left open the prospect of “conviction for consensual intercourse.” It was submitted that the evidence of MB was entirely consistent with consensual intercourse having taken place.  
     
      
    80 In my opinion this ground of appeal fails.  
     
      
    81 There was ample evidence that MB understood the nature of an act of intercourse. He testified that both the appellant and NB had intercourse with the complainant. The vaginal swabs confirmed his evidence in relation to the appellant and it was for the jury to assess whether they would accept his evidence in relation to NB. 
     
      
    82 With respect to the question of whether the act of sexual intercourse was consensual it must be remembered that the complainant, if not unconscious, was barely conscious when she was carried into the bedroom by the appellant and MB. She was then undressed by the appellant and NB proceeded to have intercourse with her. If the jury accepted MB’s evidence that intercourse took place, the fact that the complainant did not remember operates to support the Crown case that she did not consent. Apart from the noises which the complainant allegedly made in her seriously compromised condition there was nothing to suggest that she was consenting to intercourse with NB. It was for the jury to assess all of the evidence and I see no reason for this Court to intervene. 
     
      
    83 In my opinion a conviction on the second count was clearly open and I would dismiss this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Supplementary matter 
       
      
    84 At the hearing of this appeal counsel for the appellant raised a concern as to whether two of the jurors empanelled for the appellant’s first trial were empanelled for the second trial. The evidence at that stage suggested that because two of the jurors had the same number they were the same person. The matter was subsequently clarified by an affidavit from the officer in charge of Moree Sheriff’s Office. None of the jurors at the second trial formed part of the jury panel for the first trial. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    85 In my opinion the appeal against the convictions should be dismissed. 
     
      
    86 In relation to the Crown appeal against sentence I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    87 HIDDEN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL that the conviction appeal should be dismissed, and substantially with his Honour’s reasons. Ground three has caused me some concern. It is not clear to me that, in the course of his Honour’s lengthy directions about accessorial liability, the term “accused” was always a reference to the appellant rather than his son. However, I am satisfied that the directions, read as a whole, adequately conveyed to the jury the basis upon which the appellant might be found guilty of the second count. 
     
      
    88 As to the Crown appeal against sentence, I agree with the orders proposed by Price J and with his Honour’s reasons. An effective sentence of twelve years with a non-parole period of eight years is substantial but, in the circumstances of this case and in the light of the fact that offences under s 61J of the Crimes Act carry a standard non-parole period of ten years, it is inadequate. I acknowledge the breadth of the discretion of a sentencing judge to determine whether sentences should be served concurrently or cumulatively. However, as Price J has pointed out, partial accumulation of the sentence on the second count was called for in this case and it is his Honour’s failure to do so which has led to the inadequacy of the overall sentence. 
     
      
    89 PRICE J: In relation to the appeal against conviction I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. The Crown also appeals pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed on the respondent in the District Court at Moree on 29 August 2006. The relevant facts are set out in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. It is necessary to restate only some of the essential matters. 
     
      
    90 The respondent was found guilty by a jury of twelve on each of three counts on the indictment. The first count is one of unlawfully causing TE to take an overpowering drug, Diazepam, with intent to enable himself to commit an indictable offence, namely sexual intercourse without consent. The offence being contrary to s 38 of the Crimes Act 1900 attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. 
     
      
    91 The second and third counts are offences of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act. The circumstances of aggravation in each count was that TE was under the age of 16 years. The Crown case in the second count was that the respondent had aided and abetted his 14-year-old son, NB, to have sexual intercourse with the victim whereas it was the respondent who had the sexual intercourse in committing the third offence. An offence contrary to s 61J(1) attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 10 years is prescribed pursuant to s 54A and the Table to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    92 The respondent was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for each offence which consisted of a non-parole period of 8 years commencing on 11 October 2004 and expiring on 10 October 2012 with a balance of term of 4 years expiring on 10 October 2016. A condition of parole is that the respondent accepts the supervision and control of the Probation and Parole Service and obeys all reasonable directions particularly in relation to drug and alcohol counselling. Four offences on a Form 1 were taken into account on sentence on the second count each of which was an offence contrary to the Firearms Act 1996, namely one offence of not keep firearm safely contrary to s 39(1)(A), one offence of possess unregistered firearm contrary to s 36(1), one offence of possess unauthorised firearm contrary to s 7(a)(1) and an offence of possess ammunition without holding a licence contrary to s 65(3). 
     
      
       
      Form 1 matters  
       
      
    93 These offences relate to a stirling model 14.22 calibre bolt action rifle with a mount master scope and man made silencer which was located by police in an unlocked cupboard in the respondent’s bedroom.  
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    94 Evidence of the applicant’s subjective circumstances was before the Judge by way of a pre-sentence report dated 13 December 2005 and a report of a psychologist Dr Nicholas dated 24 May 2006. The respondent did not give evidence during the sentencing hearing. The applicant’s subjective circumstances are taken largely from these reports. 
     
      
    95 The respondent was born on 19 March 1964 and was 40 years old at the time of the commission of the offences. He told Dr Nicholas that he had been a chronic alcoholic, having begun drinking at the age of 14. He was a chronic binge drinker until he was 35 years of age. During this time he abused prohibited drugs, such as heroin and speed. When he was arrested he weighed 135 kilograms and at the time of the interview was 89 to 90 kilograms. He attributed his significant weight loss to an exercise routine and as a result his blood pressure had reduced significantly as had his cholesterol level. He is no longer a diabetic. The respondent had been on a disability pension most of which had been spent on alcohol. Dr Nicholas relates that the respondent on his own admission was gaining benefit from his time in custody and the period in custody had provoked a redefinition of his life style to one that he intends to be pro-social. He opined that the respondent “fully comprehended the highly irresponsible and inappropriate nature of his actions and expressed remorse about those actions”. 
     
      
    96 Mr Mellor, the Probation and Parole officer, in his report states that the respondent had “maintained that the victim had misrepresented her age and claimed she was a consensual participant”. He opined that the respondent “clearly attributed his actions to his alcohol abuse and did not appear to comprehend the inappropriate nature of his actions regardless of the victim’s age”.  
     
      
    97 In his sentencing remarks, his Honour summarised the respondent’s prior criminal history as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender’s prior record discloses that he was first convicted in 1980 for stealing a motor vehicle, thereafter offences of malicious injury, further motor vehicle offences and stealing soon followed. In 1983 he was convicted of receiving and then in 1986 there were offences of offensive behaviour, resist arrest, mid range PCA and offensive behaviour again. He was also convicted of carnal knowledge in that year for which he was placed on a recognisance as he was then nineteen. I do not think that this bears much resemblance to these matters and I take little account of that. In 1987 he was convicted of assault and resist arrest, malicious injury and stealing. His record shows that he was first imprisoned in 1987 for break, enter and steal when he received fifteen months with nine months supervised parole, however I am now advised that in fact under appeal that resulted in a sentence of 150 hours community service order. He maintains he has not been sentenced to imprisonment previously, and that would appear to be correct, whilst there are periods in custody on remand. 
        
       
       
        
        There were other offences of assault that year, further similar type offending following on a fairly regular basis for which he was mostly fined. In 1999 he was convicted and fined for consuming and diverting electricity and for stealing property in a dwelling house. His record therefore is one of fairly continual offending but not for particularly serious matters and not for anything on the scale of these offences. As I have said he appears not to have previously been imprisoned following any conviction.” 
        
       
       
      The Crown Appeal  
       
      
    98 The Crown contends that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate, either individually or as a reflection of the respondent’s total criminality. The Crown has identified what are asserted to be a number of errors made by the Judge. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The failure to impose sentences for two offences under s 61J in accordance with the standard non-parole period provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
       
       
      The Judge was required to separately determine the term of imprisonment appropriate to each s 61J offence having regard to the circumstances of the offence and the circumstances of the respondent. He was obliged to determine whether each s 61J offence should be characterised as being in the mid-range of objective seriousness and to consider if there were other reasons in the matters identified in s 21A of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999 (the Crimes (SP) Act) relating to the offender for departing from the standard non-parole period. His Honour was obliged to consider special circumstances:  
      R v Way 
       (2004) 60 NSWLR 168,  
      MLP v Regina 
       [2006] NSWCCA 271. These issues were not required to be addressed in any particular order:  
      MLP 
       [at 34],  
      R v Moffit 
       (1990) 20 NSWLR 114. Reasons were required to be provided for departing from the standard non-parole period: s 54B(4) Crimes (SP) Act.  
       
      
    99 His Honour was mindful that counts 2 and 3 carry a standard non-parole period of 10 years as he made reference to the standard non-parole period in his remarks on sentence. During the proceedings on sentence both the Crown and counsel for the respondent submitted that the s 61J offences were within the mid-range of objective seriousness of offences of that type. His Honour, however, did not disclose in his reasons whether he characterised the offences as being in the mid-range and it appears that he did not give consideration to making such an assessment. He collectively assessed all of the offences as being “gravely serious” (ROS at 4) which assessment included the first offence for which a standard non-parole period is not prescribed. His Honour’s failure to consider in the case of each s 61J offence whether the offence should be characterised as being in the mid-range of objective seriousness did not accord with the principles established in Way. His Honour imposed non-parole periods for counts 2 and 3 which were eighty per cent of the prescribed standard non-parole periods for these offences.  
     
      
    100 A separate and careful consideration of counts 2 and 3 could not have reasonably led to the characterisation of these offences as falling below the mid-range of objective seriousness. The respondent initiated the sexual assault by his son, which constitutes the second offence. His active encouragement included removing the then helpless TE’s pants and those of NB who was heavily intoxicated. Without the respondent, this offence would not have happened. Although he was to be sentenced as an aider and abettor, the respondent was dominant in the commission of the offence and his culpability was substantially more than that of his 14-year-old son. He then removed his son and commenced having sexual intercourse with the victim himself. It appears that he persisted in the sexual intercourse notwithstanding his victim’s cries that he was hurting her. 101 The sentencing for the second offence included the taking into account of four matters on the Form 1. Each of these matters was an offence contrary to the Firearms Act. The Judge was entitled to take these matters into account so as to impose a longer sentence for count 2 than would otherwise have been imposed had it been the only offence: see Des Rosiers v R [2006] NSWCCA 16, Regina v Stankovic [2006] NSWCCA 229. 
     
      
    102 When sentencing the respondent, his Honour expressly took into account the offences on the Form 1. I am not persuaded that the Judge failed to properly take them into account.  
     
      
    103 There was little in the respondent’s subjective circumstances which justified departing from the standard non-parole period. The mitigating factors identified by the Judge were remorse and the possibility of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    104 The Judge was entitled to have regard to the assessment by Dr Nicholas that the respondent “fully comprehended the highly irresponsible and inappropriate nature of his actions and expressed remorse about those actions”. This assessment was founded on statements made by the respondent to the psychologist.  
     
      
    105 The respondent did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence and the psychologist’s report provided the only evidence of remorse. The Crown submitted that given that the respondent did not give evidence there was little to suggest that his expression of remorse was genuine or that it was worthy of significant weight. The Crown pointed to the unfavourable assessment of the respondent’s remorse in the pre-sentence report. 
     
      
    106 The assessment by the psychologist was more favourable than the opinion expressed in the pre-sentence report. His Honour referred to each of the reports and to the conflicting assessments. Whilst it was a matter for the Judge to decide what weight should have been given to the statements made by the respondent to the psychologist, this Court has emphasised that very considerable caution should be exercised in relying upon them when evidence is not given by the prisoner: see R v Qutami (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 [at 39]. 
     
      
    107 In any event, I am not persuaded that the Judge attached significant weight to the respondent’s statements of remorse when he said (ROS at 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “……….I am prepared to accept that there are now some signs of remorse even though that is somewhat belated, and together with the awareness of his wrongdoing may harbour some prospects of rehabilitation.” 
        
       
      
    108 His Honour’s acceptance of remorse was cautious and restricted. It did not, however, provide a reason for significantly departing from the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    109 The Judge found special circumstances and there is no criticism by the Crown of this finding. A finding of “special circumstances” may of itself provide a sufficient reason for departing from the standard non-parole period.  
     
      
    110 It is apparent, however, that the Judge dealt with the requirements of s 54B(4) of the Crimes (SP) Act in a cursory manner when he said (ROS at 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to the two counts of aggravated sexual assault, I am of the view that the standard non parole period remains relevant even though I propose not to set it in this instant case. In my view the Court should exercise its sentencing discretion in accordance with established sentencing practice by reference to the matters identified in s 3A and 21A of the  
        Sentencing Act. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    111 This statement by the Judge does not constitute an identification of the reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period as is required by s 54B(4). As was said in R v Mills (2005) 154 A Crim R 40 by Wood CJ at CL [at 49]: 
     
      
       
        
        “……..more is expected than mere lip service to the legislation. What is required is a clear identification of the relevant factors, the weight to be given to them, and their role in the structuring of the sentencing order: see  
        R v Walker 
         [2005] NSWCCA 109.” 
        
       
      
    112 Whilst the absence of sufficient reasons does not necessarily guarantee intervention by this Court: see Mills [at 51], the lack of reasons in the present case confirms, to my mind, the Judge’s failure to correctly approach the sentences to be imposed for the two offences contrary to s 61J. This ground of appeal has been established. With respect to his Honour, the Judge failed to separately consider each of the s 61J offences in accordance with the principles established in Way. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The failure to treat as aggravating factors the planning of the offences in relation to each offence and the vulnerability of the victim in relations to counts 1 and 2. 
       
      
    113 The Crown contends that the Judge was wrong when he found in respect of counts 1 and 2 that the “vulnerability of the victim” was not an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (SP) Act.  
     
      
    114 His Honour said (ROS at 7-8): 
     
      
       
        
        “I consider that the premeditation and planning of these offences and the vulnerability of the victim are elements of the objective seriousness of the offences themselves and I do not consider that there any aggravating circumstances pursuant to s 21A which are outside the elements of the offences themselves.” 
        
       
      
    115 It is accepted by the Crown that the vulnerability of the victim due to her age was an element of the offence in count 3. The Crown asserts it was not an element of the offences in counts 1 and 2. This submission overlooks so far as count 2 is concerned that the indictment was amended. The pleaded circumstances of aggravation were changed from the respondent being in company with NB to TE being under the age of 16 years. As a consequence the vulnerability of TE because of her age was an element of the second offence. Her vulnerability was not, however, an element of the first offence and her age made her more susceptible to being administered with an overpowering drug. The vulnerability of TE because she was 14 years old was an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for count 1. 
     
      
    116 His Honour did not ignore the vulnerability of the victim. It was a factor which he clearly took into account as increasing the objective seriousness of the offences. In my view, the distinction that the Judge made between an aggravating circumstance and an element of objective seriousness had no material impact upon the sentences imposed. For this reason, it seems to me that it is unnecessary to consider whether the Judge was in error in finding that the planning of the offences was not an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(n). The Judge found that “the offender carefully set out and planned to drug the victim in order to sexually violate her” (ROS at 5). The respondent’s careful planning was plainly taken into account by the Judge as a factor which increased the objective seriousness of the offences.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The imposition of entirely concurrent sentences.  
       
      
    117 All the sentences imposed by the Judge are to be served concurrently. During the proceedings on sentence, counsel for the accused had conceded that “in respect to the first charge that there would need to be a degree of accumulation” (POS at 4). 
     
      
    118 When sentencing the respondent his Honour said (ROS at 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “The first offence of administering a stupefying drug is a distinct offence to the two matters of aggravated sexual assault, and it is conceded that it would be appropriate that there be some partial accumulation imposed. However, I do consider that all of this offending is part of the one criminal activity and the two sets of offences are so connected in the one enterprise that the sentence imposed should in the circumstances be concurrent”. 
        
       
      
    119 The Crown contends that the offences involved distinct acts of criminality and his Honour erred in concluding that the sentences should be wholly concurrent. The imposition of entirely concurrent sentences, the Crown argues, failed to reflect the criminality involved in the three offences. The respondent submits that the Judge’s conclusion that all of the offending was part of one criminal activity was open to him and the sentences imposed reflect the total criminality.  
     
      
    120 As the Judge was sentencing the respondent for more than one offence, he was obliged to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as questions of totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. The total sentence must fairly and justly reflect the totality of the offender’s conduct: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465.  
     
      
    121 Although there was one victim and a single episode of criminality that does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that concurrent sentences are to be imposed. In the present case, each offence of which the respondent was convicted concerned different conduct. The first offence involved the administering by the respondent of the drug Diazepan to TE so that he could have sexual intercourse with her when she had been rendered helpless. As I have mentioned the second offence involved aiding and abetting his son to have sexual intercourse with the victim whereas in committing the third offence the respondent for his own gratification sexually assaulted her. 
     
      
    122 There were in fact three separate offences committed even though they were all committed as part of the same episode. The concurrency of offences 1 and 3 does not acknowledge the separate harm caused to TE by the administration of the overpowering drug nor does it provide punishment for the respondent from moving on to the next step which was to sexually assault TE. 
     
      
    123 When considering a similar issue, Adams J in R v Ta (2003) 57 NSWLR 444 observed [at 34]: 
     
      
       
        
        “……………… the deterrent effect of a slight accumulation, as proposed by the applicant, would be significantly eroded. Having administered the stupefying drug, the offender would then suffer little more punishment by moving to the next step and actually committing the intended or other sexual assaults.” 
        
       
      
    124 Furthermore, the failure to accumulate the sentences at least partially does not in effect provide any punishment or deterrence for the second offence of which he was a dominant aider and abettor. The total effective sentence of 8 years with a balance of term of 4 years does not, in my view, fairly and justly reflect the totality of the offender’s criminality. With respect, the Judge failed to take into account the differences in conduct the subject of each count and thereby erred in making each sentence concurrent.  
     
      
       
      Discretion 
       
      
    125 The principles relevant to Crown appeals against sentence are well established and are summarised in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42. Considerable restraint is exercised by this Court in intervening in the orders made by the sentencing Judge. Even if error has been shown, this Court has a discretion to refuse to intervene, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that the convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal. Should the Crown appeal be successful, the sentence imposed is to be at the bottom of the permissible range. 
     
      
    126 The respondent contends that the sentences were not manifestly lenient and the sentences imposed were not outside an appropriate range. Should the Court find that the sentences were manifestly lenient, the respondent contends that the discretion not to intervene should be exercised.  
     
      
    127 I am not persuaded, as the Crown contends, that the sentences imposed for counts 2 and 3 were manifestly lenient. Although the Judge did not correctly approach the sentencing task for these offences, it was open to him to depart from the standard non-parole period by finding special circumstances. I am also not of the view that the sentence for count one was outside an appropriate range. 
     
      
    128 The failure by his Honour to accumulate, at least partially one or more of the sentences has resulted in a total effective sentence which is manifestly lenient. Notwithstanding the fact that the respondent has been in custody since 11 October 2004 and the double jeopardy he faces the Court, in my view, should intervene and re-sentence the respondent. I propose that the sentence for count 2 is to be partly accumulated on the sentence for count 1. The substituted sentence reflects, in my opinion, the least sentence that could have been imposed in the District Court. 
     
      
    129 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed 
       
       
      2. The commencement date and the expiration date which were fixed by the Judge in the District Court for count 2 be set aside. 
       
       
      3. In respect of count 2 the non-parole period of 8 years is to commence on 11 October 2006 and is to expire on 10 October 2014. The balance of term is to commence on 11 October 2014 and is to expire on 10 October 2018. 
       
      
    130 The effect of the foregoing is that the total effective sentence of imprisonment imposed on the respondent is a non-parole period of 10 years with a balance of term of 4 years. In accordance with the finding of special circumstances, the balance of term of the sentence exceeds one-third of the non-parole period. 
     
      
    131 The earliest date that the respondent will be eligible for release to parole is 10 October 2014.

    JUDGMENT1 On 20 October 2006 the Local Court at Sutherland, presided over by Magistrate Maugham, purported to hear an allegation against the current appellant in respect of a failure to comply with an order made by the Rockdale Council upon him on 24 October 2005. The order was purportedly made pursuant to s 124 of the Local Government Act 1993. That section provides that: 
     
      
      “A council may  
      order a person 
       to do or refrain from doing a thing specified in Column 1 of the following Table if the circumstances specified opposite it in Column 2 of the Table exist and the person comes within the description opposite it in Column 3 of the Table.” (emphasis supplied) 
      
    2 S628 (1) Local Government Act 1993 provides that: 
     
      
      “ 
      A person who fails to comply with an order given to a person 
       under Pt 2 of Ch 7, that is an order in terms of any of the orders numbers 1, 3, 5 and 7-12 in the Table to section 124, is guilty of an offence.” (emphasis supplied) 
      
    3 There are other subsections of that Act all of which refer to a person who fails to comply with an order.4 The Rockdale Council’s notice pursuant to s124 was addressed to Llaustrus Pty Limited. The notice was sent to that company care of the present appellant. It is argued by the respondent that the applellant would have had notice of the notice. True the appellant may have, but the notice was served upon somebody else, care of him and addressed to someone else care of him. It is not always appropriate to open mail addressed to other people even though it may be addressed care of us.5 No connection has been shown in the evidence that I have seen thus far between the appellant on the one hand and the company to whom the notice was sent on the other. 6 True, it is beyond dispute that the appellant is the occupier of the premises. It is beyond dispute that, had he been served as occupier, the matter could well have proceeded. But he was not served. The owner was served. Unfortunately, of course, it now turns out that the owner, that is the company, was no longer in existence at the time of service. Again, no evidence was led before the magistrate in respect of ownership of the property.7 The notice had provisions not just in terms of obligations to comply, but also vested rights in the person (or company) served. It did not vest rights in the person mentioned on the envelope in the address as ‘care of’. There were in the notice directions about consequences of failure to comply. Those directions were addressed, of course, to the person served, not to the occupier who was merely the vehicle by which the notice would ultimately come, it was thought, to the owner’s attention.8 The case it would seem against the owner, whomever it/he may have been, was strong. What we do not know is whoever was the owner may well have been willing to comply with the order. The conviction is recorded against Mr Le. He may well - had he been served - have approached the owner. It may be he is the owner, I do not know. But what I do know is that the Court Attendance Notice which picked him out as being the person who had been served and failed to comply must have failed ab initio because he was never served. 9 In all the circumstances the proper verdict is one of not guilty. There would have been no power to amend the Court Attendance Notice because the amendment would have constituted a party entirely different to the party served to become the defendant.10 That all being so, it seems to me, as I say, the appropriate verdict is one of not guilty. The conviction appeal will be upheld. All orders and penalties imposed by the learned magistrate will be quashed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 IPP JA : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    2 LATHAM J : This is an appeal under s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 brought by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions against a ruling by Armitage QC ADCJ after a voir dire hearing, resulting in the exclusion of evidence from the Crown case at trial, pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. The trial of the respondent on 96 charges of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage from the Health Insurance Commission was aborted following upon his Honour’s ruling. 
     
      
    3 The charges arose out of a lawful search on 30 October 2001 of the respondent’s medical clinic where she carried out pregnancy terminations, among other services. A Health Insurance Commission investigator found a number of cash receipt books and original cash receipts in waste bins, in and near the recovery room of the clinic. The Crown sought to rely upon the finding of these documents towards proof of the respondent’s knowledge that she was dishonestly receiving money in addition to that to which she was entitled under the Medicare “bulk billing” scheme, established by the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Clth). The respondent’s knowledge in that regard is an essential element of the offence under s 134.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Clth). 
     
      
    4 The respondent successfully argued before the trial judge that the probative value of the evidence of the finding of the documents was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent. In order to appreciate the arguments advanced in this Court, it is necessary to refer to the evidence on the voir dire below and to the trial judge’s findings for the purposes of his ruling. 
     
      
       
      The Proceedings in the District Court 
      
    5 It was common ground that in October 2001 the respondent was a medical practitioner who performed terminations at her clinic at Campsie and that she ‘ bulk billed ‘ for that service as well as charging her patients an additional fee for ‘counselling and theatre’ services supplied as part of the procedure. This fee structure was published prominently in the clinic. Fees were collected from clients in cash at the time the termination was performed and a receipt was issued by the respondent’s staff. The receipt recorded the provision of ‘counselling and theatre’ services.  
     
      
    6 The evidence on the voir dire consisted of a number of receipt books with carbonised pages recording the receipt of cash from patients for ‘counselling and theatre’ services and bundles of original cash receipts. The books and original receipts were found by officers of the Health Insurance Commission on 30 October 2001 upon the execution of a search warrant. They were found in two refuse bins, one a biological waste bin in that part of the clinic described as the recovery room and the other a conventional waste bin found in a utilities room. These rooms were adjacent to each other.  
     
      
    7 Given that the receipt books and the receipts were found with other refuse consisting of wet swabs and dressings of various kinds and well into the cavity of the bins, but that the books were themselves quite dry, it was patently obvious that the books had been put in the bins by someone on the day the warrants were executed, and put there in a deliberate attempt to conceal them.  
     
      
    8 There was no challenge to the admission into evidence of the receipt books and receipts per se. What was sought to be excluded was evidence of the place where they were found and the circumstances in which they were found.  
    9 Evidence was called on the voir dire from members of the respondent’s staff and from officers of the Health Insurance Commission. Their evidence at a previous trial was also tendered. The respondent also gave evidence on the voir dire and was cross examined.  
     
      
    10 In summary, the evidence from the Commission officers established that the respondent had unsupervised access to the recovery area and utilities rooms for some time after she was made aware of their arrival and their desire to speak with her. She could not have been aware, however, at that time, of the fact that the Commission officers had a search warrant and were intending to execute it, as this was not made clear to the receptionist who telephoned the respondent in the procedure room to advise her of their attendance.  
    11 The respondent gave evidence that the used receipt books were kept in a locked cupboard near to, or in, the utilities room. She acknowledged that she had the combination to the lock on the cupboard, as did other members of her staff, and that she would have had the opportunity on the day of the search to dispose of the receipt books in the bins. The respondent denied, however, that she disposed of the books or that she had directed any member of her staff to dispose of them. She said that after the search she asked each member of her staff whether they had disposed of the books or the receipts of their own volition and that no one admitted doing it. She said she could not think of any reason why she, or anyone else, would want to throw the books in the bin. She claimed there was other evidence of her receipt of fees from patients undergoing terminations in the form of a ledger and the receipt book that was in current use at the reception desk at the time of the search. It would appear that while the cash receipt book in current use was seized, the ledger was not located in the search.  
    12 She acknowledged that before the search commenced she read that part of the warrant that nominated the offence to which the warrant referred as, inter alia, “….. the making of false statements in connection with claims for payments under the Health Insurance Act 1973 in respect of …..direct billing Medicare in addition to charging a moiety.”13 She claimed, however, that this part of the warrant was not worded in a way that made sense to her. She said she did not understand that ‘moiety’ meant money. She said she did not understand it to mean that the officers were investigating whether she had been bulk billing in addition to charging a fee in respect of the same procedure. She acknowledged that she had been peer counselled in October 1995 against charging for certain equipment used in circumcision and/or for intravenous drugs used during terminations, in addition to bulk billing for these procedures as this transgressed the Heath Insurance Act, but she did not regard charging for theatre and counselling fees as being in the same category. She asserted a considered belief that she was entitled to charge for counselling and theatre fees and that this practice was commonplace in other medical practices providing the same termination service. She said that she continued charging these fees after 30 October 2001.  
    14 The respondent acknowledged that she was aware that a former partner and colleague, Dr Singh, had lodged a detailed complaint against her with the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) in July 2001 which included, inter alia, an allegation that at least up until June 1999, and at premises from which she practiced at that time, that she was charging a moiety under the guise of counselling fees and then bulk billing, and that the cash she received was not declared for taxation purposes. She said that although she received the Singh letter of complaint under cover of a letter from the HCCC dated 19 September 2001, she did not read the Singh letter at that time and, further, that until the letter was provided to her in the witness box she did not know that it contained the precise allegation that was foundational to the Crown case against her. The HCCC’s letter which invited a detailed response to the Singh letter, inaccurately summarised that allegation as a failure to declare counselling fees for taxation purposes and that the counselling was inadequate. In so far as the letter from the HCCC was concerned, she said she read it through very carefully and while she thought she had commenced the process of responding to it by 30 October 2001, she had not replied in full by that time.  
    15 The respondent acknowledged that cash in an amount of $160,000 was seized from her home when a search warrant was executed later on the 30 October 2001 but claimed that this could be lawfully accounted for. She did not claim to have any fear or concern that she was otherwise exposed to any criminal liability in regard to her taxation affairs, or that she might be so exposed. Ms Zoretic, a nurse in the respondent’s employ, said that at the time of the search she was aware that Dr Singh had made a complaint to the authorities to the effect that the respondent was avoiding paying tax, but was unaware of any other complaint in respect of her fee charging practices.  
     
       
       
    16 In pressing for the tender of the evidence, the Crown contended that the overwhelming inference was that the respondent put the receipt books and original receipts in the bins, and that she did so conscious that they provided compelling evidence of the fact that she was claiming a rebate from Medicare in respect of services for which she was also charging patients a cash fee, knowing this was not permitted. The Crown submitted that in this way the respondent’s conduct displayed a consciousness of guilt on her part of the offences charged and that this significantly enhanced the Crown case.  
     
      
    17 The respondent submitted that the probative value that attached to the circumstances of the finding of the books and the receipts was slight and that it was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. It was submitted that assuming that the respondent did place the receipt books and the receipts in the bins (which she denied) the probative value in the evidence was nevertheless slight because of an available and reasonable alternate hypothesis for her conduct, namely, that she sought to dispose of the material to conceal her exposure to an allegation of tax fraud. The danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent resulted, it was submitted, from her being forced to advance the hypothesis that her conduct should be understood by reason of other uncharged criminal conduct, and having to adduce evidence to support that hypothesis, including the complaint by Dr Singh and the cash found at her home. Regina v Cook (2004) NSWCCA 52 was relied upon in support of both limbs of this argument. It was submitted that in these circumstances the danger of unfair prejudice was substantial and far outweighed the probative value of the evidence which was in any event slight.  
    18 The trial judge excluded the evidence pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act. In assessing the probative value of the evidence his Honour was satisfied that it was not strongly probative of the offences charged. He determined that there was no evidence to support the contention that she was fearful of being prosecuted for charging fees in addition to bulk billing, or that she was even doubtful as to the legality of what she was doing in that regard. He was not satisfied that even after reading the search warrant she would have had any appreciation of the fact that she was acting dishonestly when claiming benefits in addition to charging clients for counselling and theatre. He referred to the publication of her schedule of fees in the waiting area of the clinic, and her charging practices after 30 October 2001 as support for the conclusion that at the date the books and receipts were found in the bin she had no appreciation that what she was doing was wrong.  
     
      
    19 By way of contrast, his Honour found that as at 30 October 2001 the respondent was well aware that charges of tax evasion could be laid against her and, accordingly, that she had a genuine fear of that occurring. He was satisfied that in order to meet the fact that the jury may well find that she placed the receipts and receipt books in the bins she would be compelled to advance her fears about a tax prosecution as an explanation for that conduct. He found that the unfair prejudice that would result would be substantial. He considered it unrealistic that directions to the jury could restore the balance.  
     
      
      The Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    20 Six grounds of appeal are pressed. Grounds 1 and 2 take issue with the trial judge’s assessment of the probative value of the evidence. Grounds 3, 4 and 6 take issue with his determination that the unfair prejudice occasioned by the admission of the evidence outweighed the probative value of that evidence. Ground 5 argues that the trial judge misapplied Edwards v The Queen 178 CLR 193. 
     
      
    21 No issue is taken with the jurisdiction of the Court pursuant to s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The submissions of the Crown and of the respondent in this Court did not differ from those made to the trial judge on the voir dire. The Court was assisted by the fact that the Crown and the respondent were represented by the same senior counsel as appeared below. 
     
      
       
      Section 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
       
      
    22 Section 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act) provides :- 
     
      
       
        
        In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. 
         
        
       
      
    23 Whilst this provision appears in Part 3.11 of the Act, headed “Discretions to Exclude Evidence”, it has been held that the mandatory terms of the section are more consistent with an evaluative judgment, dependent upon “a connected series of findings of law and of fact”, rather than the exercise of a judicial discretion : GK (2001) 125 A Crim R 315 at 333 ; [2001] NSWCCA 413 at [74] ; see also R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 ; [2000] NSWCCA 61 ; ; R v Rima [2003] NSWCCA 405 ; R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142 
     
      
    24 The questions giving rise to that “connected series of findings of law and of fact” were articulated by Sully J in GK as follows :- 
     
      
       
        
        2.1 Is the tendered evidence relevant at all in the sense required by s 55(1) of the Act? If not, then the evidence is in any event inadmissible. 
         
         
        2.2 If the tendered evidence is relevant in that sense, then what is its probative value, as that expression is defined in the Dictionary that forms part of the Act? 
         
         
        2.3 Is there a danger that the tendered evidence, if admitted, will give rise to the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant: that is, to the real risk that the evidence, if admitted, will be misused by the jury in some way that is unfair to the defendant? 
         
         
        2.4 If so, then where does the preponderant weight lie as between, on the one hand that probative value; and on the other hand that danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant? 
         
         
        If the preponderant weight favours the factor of probative value, then s 137 does not require the exclusion of the evidence; and the evidence ought to be admitted unless there is some other proper basis for its exclusion. 
        
       
      
    25 It has not been suggested, nor could it have been, that the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the finding of the documents is not relevant to proof of the charges against the respondent. The focus of this appeal is on the answers to questions 2.2 and 2.3 above. 
     
      
       
      The Assessment of Probative Value in the Crown Case 
       
      
    26 As noted above at [17], the proposition advanced by the respondent in this appeal (the defendant at trial) was that the assessment of the probative value of the evidence, supporting the inference of dishonesty, necessarily takes into account competing inferences that might arise for the jury’s consideration. The argument therefore assumes that the trial judge is entitled to consider interpretations of the evidence other than that advanced by the Crown, and that questions relating to the weight of the evidence sought to be adduced are legitimate factors in assessing probative value. In my opinion, the argument must be rejected for the following reasons.27 The probative value of evidence is “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue”. That bare definition in the Dictionary to the Act must, however, be considered in the context of the provision in which it appears. Section 137 requires the assessment of the probative value of evidence to be adduced by the prosecution, that is, the probative value of that evidence in the Crown case, unqualified by competing constructions or inadequacies that might be advanced by the defendant or contrary evidence that might be led in the defendant’s case. 28 In R v Linard Shamouil (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 ; [2006] NSWCCA 112, the assessment of the probative value of identification evidence was considered by Spigelman CJ for the purposes of determining whether the test posed by s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act was satisfied, and for the purposes of the exercise required by s 137. Counsel for the respondent in Shamouil submitted that s 5F(3A) was not satisfied because the absence of weak identification evidence could not be said to substantially weaken the Crown case. Whilst senior counsel for the respondent in this appeal conceded that the trial judge’s ruling in this case eliminated or substantially weakened the prosecution case for the purposes of s 5F(3A), it is pertinent to refer to this aspect of the Chief Justice’s judgment (with which Simpson J and Adams J agreed). In rejecting the submission, the Chief Justice said at [39] :- 
     
      
       
        
        The issue is similar to that which arises when determining the probative value of evidence in the context of the application of s137 of the  
        Evidence Act, 
         to which I will refer below. The jurisdictional issue posed for this Court under s5F(3A) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        is not intended to involve an inquiry into the weight to be given to the evidence excluded. Questions of weight are for the jury. The section directs attention to “the prosecution’s case”, to be considered as a “case”. This section is not concerned with the weight of the Crown’s evidence. 
        
       
      
     Probative Value and Considerations of Weight, Reliability and Credibility 
     
      
    29 When dealing with probative value in the context of s 137, the Chief Justice noted that, before the introduction of the Evidence Act, the equivalent common law discretion to the exercise required by s 137 (the Christie discretion) did not engage considerations of the reliability of the evidence sought to be excluded. Reference was made to R v Carusi (1997) 92 A Crim R 52 at 65-66, wherein Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Newman J and Ireland J agreed) said :- 
     
      
       
        
        The power of the trial judge to exclude evidence in accordance with the  
        Christie  
        discretion does not permit the judge, in assessing what its probative value is, to determine whether the jury should or should not accept the evidence of the witness upon which the Crown case depends. The trial judge can only exclude the evidence of such a witness where,  
        taken at its highest 
        , its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect; whereas this Court may use its supervisory powers to set aside a verdict where, the issue having been left to the jury, this Court is satisfied – on the whole of the evidence – that the jury ought nevertheless have had a reasonable doubt. (original not in bold) 
        
       
      
    30 Furthermore, the Court in R v Singh-Bal (1997) 92 A Crim R 397 and in R v Yates [2002] NSWCCA 520 adopted this formulation of the discretion following the enactment of s 137. Whereas Carusi was an identification case, Singh-Bal and Yates were not. The former concerned the exclusion of an alleged admission by the accused, while the latter concerned the exclusion of the evidence of a witness who had given three different accounts to police, only one of which was incriminatory of the accused. 
     
      
    31 Spigelman CJ went on to deal with a division of opinion on this issue between Gaudron J on the one hand in Adam v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 96 ; [2001] HCA 57, and McHugh J on the other hand in Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 ; [1999] HCA 37. In Adam, Gaudron J said at [59-60] :- 
     
      
       
        
        The dictionary to the Act defines ""probative value"" to mean ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue"". That definition echoes the substance of s 55(1) of the Act which provides that ""evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding"". It is to be noted that the dictionary definition differs from s 55 in that it is not predicated on the assumption that the evidence will be accepted. 
         
        The omission from the dictionary definition of ""probative value"" of the assumption that the evidence will be accepted is, in my opinion, of no significance. As a practical matter, evidence can rationally affect the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue only if it is accepted. Accordingly, the assumption that it will be accepted must be read into the dictionary definition.  
        
       
      
    32 McHugh J in Papakosmos was of the view that the omission of “if it were accepted” from the Dictionary definition of “probative value” was of significance :- 
     
      
       
        
        The distinction which the Act makes between relevance and probative value also supports the view that relevance is not concerned with reliability. Probative value is defined in the Dictionary of the Act as being ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue."" That assessment, of course, would necessarily involve considerations of reliability. ""Probative value"" is an important consideration in the exercise of the powers conferred by ss135 and 137. An assessment of probative value, however, must always depend on the circumstances of the particular case at hand. (at [86]) 
         
        
       
      
    33 In resolving this tension in favour of the approach taken by Gaudron J, and having regard to a number of decisions in this Court, the Chief Justice said in Shamouil at [60 – 65] :- 
     
      
       
        
        The preponderant body of authority in this Court is in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility are to be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence for purposes of determining questions of admissibility. There is no reason to change that approach. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion, the critical word in this regard is the word  
        could  
        in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely, “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment …”. The focus on  
        capability  
        draws attention to what it is  
        open 
         for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is  
        likely  
        to conclude. Evidence has “probative value”, as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty.  
         
        This conclusion is reinforced by the test that evidence must “rationally affect” the assessment. As Gaudron J emphasised in  
        Adam  
        supra, a “test” of ‘rationality’ also directs attention to capability rather than weight.  
        
       
       
        
        ………………………………………………………………………….. 
        
       
       
        
        To adopt any other approach would be to usurp for a trial judge critical aspects of the traditional role of a jury. In the case of evidence of critical significance, such a ruling by a trial judge would, in substance, be equivalent to directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis that the trial judge was of the view that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. As the High Court said in that different, but not irrelevant, context in  
        Doney v The Queen  
        (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 275, this is not a permissible “basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function”. In my opinion, the same is true if a trial judge can determine the weight of evidence when applying s137.  
         
        This Court should be very slow to conclude that it was the intention of Parliament in enacting the  
        Evidence Act  
        to alter the fundamental relationship between the judge and jury in a criminal trial in the manner suggested. Such a change would occur on each occasion that “probative value” falls to be assessed by the trial judge including: tendency and coincidence evidence (s97(1)(b), s98(1)(b), s101(2)); cross-examination on credit (s103(1)); the comparative weight with misleading, confusing, or time wasting effects (s135(b) and (c)); and the comparative weight with unfair prejudice (s135(a), s137). 
        
       
      
    34 The reference to the “preponderant body of authority” appears to be an acknowledgement of Simpson J’s judgment in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52, in so far as it was interpreted in Shamouil as support for the proposition that there may be limited circumstances in which credibility and reliability will be taken into account when determining probative value. The Chief Justice’s concession in that regard does not however warrant a departure from an unbroken line of authority on this issue in this State. Given the reliance placed upon Cook by the respondent’s counsel on the hearing of this appeal, it is appropriate to examine that decision more closely. 
     
      
    35 In Cook, Simpson J (with whom Ipp JA and Adams J agreed) dealt with a ground of appeal that challenged the admission of evidence of flight in the Crown case, as demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. The accused’s counsel at trial had sought the exclusion of the evidence pursuant to s 137, on the basis that its admission would require the accused to provide other explanations for flight, inconsistent with a consciousness of guilt of the offence at trial (a sexual assault), but revealing to the jury a contravention of an AVO and an assault upon a female for which he received a term of imprisonment. 36 The trial judge in Cook was found to have fallen into error in his approach to s 137. The critical passages of Simpson J’s judgment, set out below in bold type, confirm that her Honour determined that findings of fact, including questions of credibility and reliability (and therefore weight), from the evidence on the voir dire play no part in the assessment of the probative value of evidence sought to be admitted in the Crown case. The credibility and reliability of any explanation proffered by the accused, in order to explain flight or other conduct suggestive of a consciousness of guilt, may however play a role in the balancing exercise, that is, in determining whether unfair prejudice arises out of the nature of the explanation. 
     
      
    37 Her Honour said (at [36] – [37] and [43]) :- 
     
      
       
        
        The probative value of the evidence can be assessed merely by examination of the evidence itself 
        . In this case, that examination inevitably gives rise to a conclusion that the probative value to the Crown case was very high indeed. Within five days of the assault on the complainant, the appellant twice fled when police approached. The inferences available to a jury are obvious.  
         
        The balancing exercise required by s137 cannot, however, be undertaken without an appreciation of any explanation an accused person might seek to advance in order to nullify the adverse inferences that would, absent explanation, arise 
        . That was the purpose of the evidence given by the appellant in the voir dire. The effect of his evidence there was to put before the judge evidence of the response that the appellant would make, if the Crown evidence were admitted. This meant that the evidence of flight could be seen in its complete context. What the appellant told the judge was that his explanation for his flight would necessarily disclose to the jury a prior history of violence towards a female, disregard of the law and contravention of restraining orders serious enough to warrant his incarceration. There was no other way (on the appellant’s case) that he could remove the sting from the flight evidence. But the explanation carried its own, serious, sting – disclosing his history of violence and breach of the law. ……  
        The prejudicial effect of the explanation was what s137 required to be balanced against the probative value the Crown evidence would otherwise have had. 
         That exercise was not explicitly undertaken by the trial judge. The s137 exercise also called for consideration of directions that could be given to the jury in order to ameliorate the impact of the knowledge of the appellant’s prior conduct. 
        
       
       
        
        …………………………………………………………………………. 
        
       
       
        
        I am satisfied that it is not the role of a trial judge in NSW, under the  
        Evidence Act 
        , to make a finding of fact about the actual reasons for flight where such evidence is given on behalf of the Crown. That remains the province of the jury. 
         The role of the judge in NSW, at least post-1995, is merely to determine the relative probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice that might result. In saying this, I do not mean to lay down a blanket rule that, in considering evidence on a voir dire in which the issue is the admissibility of evidence having regard to s137, there is never any room for findings concerning credibility.  
        There will be occasions when an assessment of the credibility of the evidence will be inextricably entwined with the balancing process. That means that particular caution must be exercised to ensure that the balancing exercise is not confused with the assessment of credibility, a task committed to the jury. 
          
        There may, for example, be occasions on which the accused’s response is so preposterous as to give rise to the conclusion that it could be accepted by no reasonable jury. The credibility exercise, in those circumstances, is to determine whether the evidence given by (or on behalf of) the accused is capable of belief by the jury. If it is, then its prejudicial effect must be considered. If it is not, then the balancing exercise may well result in an answer favourable to the Crown. That is essentially because any prejudice arising to an accused from putting a preposterous explanation to the jury would not be unfair prejudice. 
        
       
      
    38 In short, the rationale in Cook is consistent with the established line of authority since Carusi, which holds that the probative value of the evidence sought to be excluded under s 137 is to be assessed by taking the evidence at its highest. I am mindful of the fact that Simpson J was a member of the bench in Shamouil, but a careful reading of her Honour’s judgment in Cook does not, in my opinion, admit of any other interpretation. In circumstances where the evidence is relied upon to found an inference that the accused acted out of a consciousness of guilt, the court must approach the assessment of the probative value of that evidence on the basis that such an inference is capable of acceptance by a jury. Of course, the inference must be one that is clearly available, whether or not the jury ultimately draw that inference.  
     
      
    39 The trial judge expressly found that the probative value of the evidence of the finding of the cash receipt books in the bins was not strongly probative because “if she did hide the receipt books, the overwhelming inference is that she did so because she was afraid of being prosecuted for tax evasion.” (Voir Dire judgment at 15) (It was conceded before the trial judge and before this Court that the jury would in all likelihood conclude that the respondent had placed the receipt books in the bin, despite her denial.) Not only did he make this finding in the absence of any evidence from the respondent that she held such fears, but more importantly, he failed to assess the probative value of that evidence in the prosecution case by having regard, purely and simply, to the inference that the evidence was capable of supporting, namely that the respondent hid the receipt books because she was aware of the unlawful nature of her charging practices. As Simpson J observed in Cook, the probative value of that evidence was to be assessed merely by an examination of the evidence itself.  
     
      
    40 Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the respondent, it was no part of the trial judge’s function in assessing probative value under s 137 to have regard to competing explanations for the respondent’s conduct, other than that upon which the Crown relied, even assuming that an alternative explanation was given by the respondent on the voir dire. The trial judge exceeded the reach of his function and entered into the jury’s domain : R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142 at [36] – [40]. Far from assisting the respondent, Cook exposes the flaw in the argument advanced on this appeal.  
     
      
    41 I would also note that the concession made by senior counsel for the respondent, that the trial judge’s ruling eliminated or substantially weakened the prosecution case, is difficult to reconcile with the submission that the excluded evidence had low probative value, for the reasons set out at par 28 above. 
     
      
    42 The trial judge erred in his approach to the assessment of probative value under s 137. I would uphold grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      The Danger of Unfair Prejudice 
      
     43 The danger of unfair prejudice requires more than the spectre that the evidence will tend towards proof of the Crown case. In Papakosmos, McHugh J said at [91, 92] :- 
     
      
       
        
        Evidence is not unfairly prejudicial merely because it makes it more likely that the defendant will be convicted. In  
        R v BD 
        , Hunt CJ at CL pointed out:  
         
        ""The prejudice to which each of the sections [ss 135, 136 and 137] refers is  
        not 
         that the evidence merely tends to establish the Crown case; it means prejudice which is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way."" (footnote omitted)  
         
        In its Interim Report, the Australian Law Reform Commission explained:  
         
        ""By risk of unfair prejudice is meant the danger that the fact-finder may use the evidence to make a decision on an improper, perhaps emotional, basis, ie on a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the case. Thus evidence that appeals to the fact-finder's sympathies, arouses a sense of horror, provokes an instinct to punish, or triggers other mainsprings of human action may cause the fact-finder to base his decision on something other than the established propositions in the case. Similarly, on hearing the evidence the fact-finder may be satisfied with a lower degree of probability than would otherwise be required.""  
         
        
       
      See also  
      Festa v The Queen 
       (2001) 208 CLR 593 ; [2001] HCA 72, per Gleeson CJ at 599. 
       
      
    44 The unfair prejudice found by the trial judge to be implicit in the introduction of the evidence of the finding of the cash receipt books was said to be of the same character as that discussed in Cook, namely that the respondent would be compelled “to adduce evidence regarding complaints of tax evasion made against her prior to the search and evidence of the $160,000 found in her home.” As to “what directions, if any, [that] could ameliorate the impact of the revelation to the jury of the very real fear she had in relation to charges of tax evasion and the fact that $160,000 in cash was found in her home”, his Honour was of the view that “whatever confidence one may have in the desire of individual jurors to follow directions ….., it is unrealistic to think that any such directions could in any meaningful way restore the balance.” (VD judgment at 15) 
     
      
    45 At the outset, there is a very pertinent distinction to be drawn between Cook and the circumstances of this case. It was never disputed in Cook that the accused fled from police when they attempted to approach him to question him about alleged sexual assaults. The accused in Cook gave evidence on the voir dire that he did so because he was wanted for breach of an AVO that related to a previous offence of violence against a woman, the very type of offence for which he was standing trial. Whilst this explanation was not entirely consistent with what the accused said to police in his interview, it was nonetheless an objectively available interpretation of his behaviour that was not necessarily consistent with his guilt of the offence at trial. It clearly raised the prospect of arousing in the jury a sense of horror or provoking an instinct to punish. 
     
      
    46 The respondent, on the other hand, gave evidence on the voir dire that she did not put the receipt books in the bins, nor did she direct anyone else to do so. On the evidence before the trial judge, there was no dilemma confronting the respondent such as confronted the accused in Cook. The jury did not have to be informed of the fact that the respondent was the subject of unsubstantiated complaints, unrelated to the charges at trial, in order to place the evidence at trial in its complete context.  
     
      
    47 The trial judge was required to evaluate the existence of unfair prejudice on the basis of the evidence on the voir dire. To permit otherwise is to place a trial judge in the wholly unrealistic position of anticipating how an accused’s case might be conducted at trial. The exercise under s 137 is not concerned with the identification of hypothetical forms of unfair prejudice that may or may not materialise during the trial. It is not an advisory ruling. As noted by Sully J in GK , the notion of danger of unfair prejudice imports a real risk, not a speculative one. 
     
      
    48 There was no evidence before his Honour that the respondent expected to be prosecuted for tax evasion, or that she held any fears in that regard. The respondent expressly disavowed any reason for disposing of the cash receipt books. The height of the evidence in relation to purported taxation offences was a letter of complaint by the respondent’s former partner, Dr Singh, to the NSW Medical Board in July 2001. That letter claimed that the respondent was not declaring income for taxation purposes at a period of time before June 1999 at her former clinic, not the premises the subject of the search warrant. The letter was referred to the HCCC, which in turn sought the respondent’s comments in September 2001. An awareness that allegations had been made against her does not equate to a fear of prosecution. No prosecution had been instituted against the respondent for taxation offences. 49 Returning then to the danger of unfair prejudice on the basis of the evidence on the voir dire, no question of alternative explanations for conduct, otherwise indicating a consciousness of guilt, arose, until and unless the jury rejected the respondent’s account that she was not responsible for placing the cash receipt books in the bins. The trial judge would, in the circumstances of this case, be obliged to direct the jury that, if they rejected the respondent’s evidence and found as a fact that she was responsible, the inference of consciousness of guilt could not be drawn unless it was the only available inference in all the circumstances.  
     
      
    50 In any event, it is not correct to say that the respondent would be compelled to introduce evidence of Dr Singh’s letter, the HCCC letter to the respondent and the $160,000 in cash at the respondent’s home, thus giving rise to unfair prejudice. It could not be unfair, albeit it might occasion prejudice to the respondent, because it would amount to no more than a forensic decision by counsel for the respondent, in the circumstances of the trial as it unfolded. Trial counsel are routinely confronted by such forensic decisions, that is, whether to undercut the main plank of the defence case by reliance upon an alternative, but inconsistent case theory.  
     
      
    51 Assuming for present purposes that the respondent admitted that she placed the receipt books in the bins, and that she gave evidence of a fear of prosecution for taxation offences, or that an inference could be drawn to that effect, the credibility of such a claim stood to be assessed on the basis that the search warrant related to offences against the Health Insurance Act 1973 in the period between January 1999 and October 2001. None of the cash receipt books recovered from the bins related to the period pre-June 1999. In short, there was little or no contemporaneity between the timing of the alleged taxation offences and the alleged offences at trial. In those circumstances, had the probative value of the Crown’s evidence been weighed against the risk of unfair prejudice to the respondent, the balance would clearly favour the former. This is precisely the type of outcome foreshadowed by Simpson J in Cook at [43] ; any prejudice occasioned to the respondent by an explanation lacking credibility is less likely to qualify as unfair prejudice. 
     
      
    52 One further point should be made regarding the evidence that $160,000 in cash was found at the respondent’s home by HIC investigators on 30 October 2001. The Crown did not propose to lead that evidence at the respondent’s trial, having accepted that the benign explanation for the cash offered by the respondent at an earlier trial could not be disproved. To the extent that the respondent relied upon that evidence, it could only be relevant to the risk of unfair prejudice if the respondent disavowed the benign explanation previously advanced. 
     
      
    53 It is difficult to understand his Honour’s view of the inability of a jury to comply with a direction, that warned them against the use of evidence of the respondent’s fear of tax evasion charges (assuming evidence or suggestion of such a fear), adverse to the respondent : see Quinlan v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 284. Fear of tax investigation and prosecution would be one of the few experiences capable of being appreciated by a large number of the community from which juries are drawn. Far from operating adversely to the respondent, a jury would readily comprehend the distinction between proof of the charges at trial and conduct by the respondent potentially consistent with the commission of taxation offences. As already noted, directions to this effect would only come into play if the jury found the respondent responsible for putting the receipt books in the bins. 
     
      
    54 The trial judge committed a number of fundamental errors in determining the danger of unfair prejudice. Findings of fact were made that were unsupported by the evidence and, in some instances, against the weight of the evidence. The prejudice identified by his Honour did not arise on the respondent’s case and, to the extent that it might, it was not unfair prejudice. I would uphold grounds 3, 4 and 6 of the appeal. 
     
      
    55 Ground 5 complains that the trial judge misapplied Edwards v The Queen 178 CLR 193, in that his Honour appears to have accepted the submission made by the respondent’s counsel that Edwards, by analogy, dictated the exclusion of the evidence relating to the circumstances under which the receipt books were found. It is not altogether clear on what basis his Honour relied upon Edwards. The only reference to it in the judgment on the voir dire is at pp10 – 12. His Honour sets out a passage in the judgment of the majority at 212-213, including :- 
     
      
       
        
        Whilst in many cases it must be a question for the jury whether a lie was told because the truth was perceived to be inconsistent with innocence or for some other reason, if it was established that there was a deliberate lie in this case about a material matter (and we do not think that it was), the innocent explanation for that lie was so plausible that the lie could not have been probative of guilt. Quite apart from our concerns about the existence of the lie and its materiality, this should have prevented the trial judge from concluding that the telling of the lie was capable of amounting to corroboration of the complainant’s evidence. 
        
       
      
    56 His Honour then goes on to summarise a submission by senior counsel to the effect that if the respondent was found to have lied about the hiding of the receipt books in the bins, that lie could not be probative of guilt because of the innocent, plausible explanation “available on the evidence.” At no point does the trial judge consider the application of Edwards to the evidence sought to be excluded, that is, the finding of the receipt books in the bins, and the significance of the inference relied upon by the Crown. It was the respondent’s conduct in hiding the receipt books (if the jury so found) that, according to the Crown, suggested a consciousness of guilt, not her lie in respect of that conduct. The trial judge simply went on to say that he accepted senior counsel’s submissions, without differentiating between them. 
     
      
    57 Once again, it should be noted that there was no innocent, plausible explanation for concealing the receipt books “available on the evidence.” In so far as senior counsel on the hearing of this appeal submitted that Edwards stands for the principle that “a trial judge may exclude evidence of an accused person’s conduct contended to support an inference of consciousness of guilt where an ‘innocent explanation’ for that conduct is ‘so plausible that the [conduct] could not have been probative of guilt’”, I reject that submission. There is nothing within the judgments in Edwards that supports such a principle. Edwards was concerned with the use to which lies, said to have been told in court by an accused, could be legitimately put by the jury. The admissibility of the evidence of the accused, including his alleged lies, was never in question. 
     
      
    58 Senior counsel went further however, and submitted that Edwards also implicitly stood for the proposition that a trial judge, in assessing the probative value of evidence of an accused person’s conduct contended to support an inference of consciousness of guilt, may consider the plausibility of innocent explanations that arise on the evidence. That proposition is only correct if one substitutes “a jury” for “a trial judge.”  
     
      
    59 I would also uphold ground 5 of the appeal. 
     
      
    60 The orders I propose are :- 
     
      
      1. Appeal allowed 
      
     2. The judgment of Acting Judge Armitage QC of 14 May 2007 is set aside.

      Friday 20 July 2007 
       
       
      2007/1170 - REGINA v MARNIE KRYSTAL SCOWEN 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Marnie Krystal Scowen, you have pleaded guilty and I convict you of the crime of being an accessory after the fact to murder.  
     
      
    2 It is important that I specify with some precision how your culpability for that crime arises and for what facts there must be a reflection in the sentence imposed upon you. 
     
      
    3 In terms of the indictment, you are charged that you did assist, maintain, harbour or receive Wade Stewart knowing that he had murdered Brian Sawtell. In other words the essence of your crime is comprehended in your assistance to Stewart by helping him to delay his apprehension and punishment for the murder which you knew he had committed. It is not charged against you that you were in any way a participant in the killing. 
     
      
    4 I am stressing this because, at the sentencing hearing, the Crown Prosecutor sought to have read victim impact statements prepared by members of the family of the deceased. In your case, they would only be victims in the relevant extended sense if Mr Sawtell had died as a result of the offence committed by you. In fact the applicable Act of Parliament requires that, in order for such statements to be received, the death be not only a result but a direct result of the offence, that is to say, necessarily the offence with which the person before the Court is charged.  
     
      
    5 For reasons which I gave at the time, I rejected the receipt of the statements, but the tender of them in these proceedings implied that it may have been thought that the charge against you to which you have pleaded guilty imposed upon you some responsibility for the death. There is no such assertion, either express or implied. The charge against you, as I have said, is that you rendered assistance to Stewart, whom you knew had committed murder, to flee from authority. 
     
      
    6 I do not in any way seek to minimize the sense of loss which I am sure Mr Sawtell’s family must feel but it should be fully understood by everyone that you are not alleged to bear responsibility for the killing. You bear responsibility for assisting Stewart to avoid prompt apprehension. 
     
      
    7 There is an agreed statement of facts which includes considerable detail of events on the evening before and on the day of the attack on Mr Sawtell. This provides some background which it is not necessary to summarize save to observe that the descriptions of your behaviour do not portray you as an innocent bystander in the verbal and physical confrontations which then took place.  
     
      
    8 However, the culpability for the crime charged against you commences in point of time when you were – and I quote from the agreed facts – “shouting aggressively at the deceased and the occupants of the house”. Contemporaneously Stewart was stabbing Mr Sawtell. You were at the front door at the time and it is not alleged by the prosecution that you saw the stabbing take place. I do infer that you knew something of what had occurred because you and Stewart shortly thereafter ran from the scene which was in Lake Road, Port Macquarie. The critical event took place sometime between 3 and 4 pm on 24 July 2006.  
     
      
    9 As you fled you encountered a man named Berke, who drove you both to Stewart’s brother-in-law’s house, which was elsewhere in Port Macquarie. A number of men were present there. Stewart produced the push knife which he had used. A telephone call was made to a man named Tudehope requesting him to come and drive Stewart out of town. Shortly afterwards another man, Malkovich, arrived and, at Stewart’s request, he took the knife and secreted it in a park. 
     
      
    10 The agreed facts do not suggest that you were present during this activity. 
     
      
    11 Stewart showered and changed his clothes. You were crying and told him that he should not have stabbed Mr Sawtell. Obviously you had learned from some source that he had been stabbed by Stewart. 
     
      
    12 Thereafter you and Stewart were transported from that house to another at Sancroix. At about 5.20 pm, Tudehope arrived and drove you both to Queensland where he left you after being given some money to compensate him for the petrol used. Whilst on the journey travelling north and in the vicinity of Coffs Harbour the occupants of the car including you received news that there had been a death in Port Macquarie as a result of stabbing.  
     
      
    13 In the middle of the day on 25 July you and Stewart arrived at a shop operated by his mother in Nanango, Queensland. Stewart told her that he had killed someone. 
     
      
    14 On the following day 26 July, you and he voluntarily handed yourselves in to Queensland Police at Nanango. During the flight from Port Macquarie to Nanango your mobile phone was used for numerous calls including calls to Tudehope, Stewart’s mother and his brother-in-law. 
     
      
    15 Your relevant assistance to Stewart was as above described and extended during the two days that I have mentioned. 
     
      
    16 There is a wide variation in the possible degrees of moral culpability of persons who commit the offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder. A maximum penalty of twenty five years imprisonment is available. 
     
      
    17 The Crown Prosecutor submitted that your offence, objectively, lay in the mid range of seriousness for all such offences. On the other hand, your counsel submitted that it lay at the lower end of any range. When I come to consider possible reprehensible conduct constituting being an accessory after the fact which can include destruction and falsification of evidence, corroboration of a false alibi and a myriad of other forms of deceit, I am persuaded that your culpability, objectively, for this offence is to be found to lie towards the lower end of any range. The final statement in the agreed facts, that is agreed not only by you but by the prosecution, is that you were, and again I will quote “charged on the basis that by her actions in accompanying the accused Stewart, and through the use of her mobile phone, she provided support to Stewart to assist him to avoid detection and apprehension by the police”. 
     
      
    18 Your criminal misconduct extended over less than two days. On the facts, there could have been little difficulty in detecting Stewart as the perpetrator of the killing and your actions can be seen as more tending towards contributing delay in his apprehension or, as it turned out, his surrender to police. 
     
      
    19 As I have said, there is a wide variation in possible degrees of culpability. This is reflected in some statistics collected by the Judicial Commission. The sample of offences of being an accessory after the fact to murder are small, but of sixteen cases three were sentenced to wholly non custodial terms, one served a term of imprisonment by periodic detention and the balance received sentences of full time imprisonment. The minimum term element of those who received full time imprisonment ranged in a sample of eleven cases between six months and thirty six months. 
     
      
    20 By Friday next you would be in full time custody for an entire twelve months. 
     
      
    21 You were born on 24 July 1986 and will attain the age of twenty one years on Tuesday of next week. You have had some encounter with the scourge of illicit drug consumption which is rife in some sections of our community. Your mother’s evidence, which I accept, suggested that your incarceration has had a rehabilitative effect upon you in that regard. In the past, your family relationships have been poor, due, I consider, to your behaviour which I expect to have been at least in part, drug inspired. Your previous relationship with Stewart has now ended. You have not claimed that you acted because of any pressure brought to bear on you by him but I would infer that the then extant relationship, although it was a dysfunctional one, probably played some part in your commission of the crime to which you have pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    22 You do not have an unblemished prior record but the significant matters on it seem to relate to conflict with your family, which your mother feels is, or at least can be, resolved. 
     
      
    23 It is conceded that you offered your plea of guilty to the offence at the earliest opportunity and you are entitled in law to a reduction of sentence on that account. 
     
      
    24 As your counsel has submitted, correctly in my view, there are matters including your youth and need to validate your rehabilitation which amount to special circumstances so as to vary in your favour the proportion between non- parole period and balance term which is mentioned in the sentencing legislation. I do make a finding to that effect but the conclusion which I have reached in the context of time elapsed requires only a tiny adjustment. Quantification of a discount for your early plea of guilty is not appropriate in this case. 
     
      
    25 Marnie Krystal Scowen, for your crime of being accessory after the fact to the crime of murder committed by Wade Stewart, you are sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of twelve months less three days to date from 26 July 2006 and expiring on 23 July 2007, with a balance term of four months commencing on 24 July 2007.  
     
      
    26 I direct that you be released to parole on 23 July 2007.

    1 JOHNSON J: On 25 July 2007, the thirty-first day of the trial, a note was received from a juror (“the applicant juror”), seeking discharge from the jury.  
     
      
       
      The Present Application 
       
      
    2 The note (MFI 51) stated that the applicant juror had been trading on the Australian share market for some nine months as a day trader and that, since being empanelled on the jury, the applicant juror could “not trade as often as before...so I lose some money"". The note stated that this had upset the applicant juror's husband and had led to quarrelling. The note observed that this state of affairs had given rise to significant emotional suffering and that the applicant juror had experienced ""quite a lot of sleepness nights"" and that this ""distracts [her] focus on the evidence and affects [her] fair judgment on the case"". The applicant juror asks to be excused from the trial.  
     
      
    3 The contents of the note, and the applicant juror's application, have been brought to the attention of counsel and the parties. It was accepted by counsel that sworn evidence from the applicant juror in support of the application was not necessary, and that the Court should accept the factual matters recited in the note. I have approached the application in this way.  
     
      
    4 The Crown opposes the application for discharge. The Accused did not seek the discharge of the applicant juror. The submissions of counsel in this respect are recorded in the transcript (T1481-1488), and need not be repeated in this judgment.  
     
      
       
      Commencement of the Trial 
       
      
    5 This trial commenced on 13 June 2007 with the empanelment of the present jury. The earlier history of the proceedings may be found in my judgment, R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 22) [2007] NSWSC 692 at [13] to [18].  
     
      
    6 The applicant juror made no application on 13 June 2007 to be excused from the jury panel. Section 38 Jury Act 1977 provides for the Sheriff or the Court to excuse a person who has been summoned “for good cause”. The Act does not define this term, but a common reason for persons seeking to be excused from jury service is employment and, in particular, self employment or employment in a small business. In this respect, see Issues Paper 28, New South Wales Law Reform Commission, ""Jury Service"", November 2006, paragraphs 3.19-3.20.  
     
      
    7 The jury panel for this trial was informed by the Sheriff that the trial had a four months estimate. I reminded the panel of this estimate before the empanelment process commenced. A number of persons were excused from the panel for employment-related reasons. As I have noted, the applicant juror made no such application.  
     
      
       
      Applicable Legal Principles 
       
      
    8 The principles which are applicable on an application such as this are clear:  
     
      
       
      (a) s.22  
      Jury Act 1977 
       does not expressly confer upon the Court a power or discretion to discharge an individual juror, however, that is assumed as a common law or implied or inherent power:  
      Wu v The Queen 
       [1999] 199 CLR 99 at 114 [46], 118 [54];  
      R v Radju 
       [2001] 53 NSWLR 471 at 475 [17];  
      Petroulias v The Queen 
       [2007] NSWCCA 134 at [17], [58]; 
       
       
      (b) s.22 relieves the Court of the common law mandatory obligation to discharge the entire jury and permits continuation of the trial with a jury of eleven if the Court so orders:  
      Wu v The Queen 
       at 106 [21], 107 [27], 112 [42], 114 [46];  
      R v Radju 
       at 475 [17]; 
       
       
      (c) there are two separate steps to the process - firstly, whether the juror should be discharged and, if that occurs, whether the trial should continue with a jury of eleven:  
      Wu v The Queen 
       at 103 [8], 107 [26];  
      R v Radju  
      at 475 [18];  
       
       
      (d) there is no closed category of circumstances which may warrant the discharge of a juror during a trial. Usual circumstances involve illness on the part of a juror or some event or revelation which otherwise impacts upon the appropriateness of the juror continuing to serve (such as an event which affects the impartiality of the juror:  
      R v Czajkowski 
       [2002] 137 A Crim R 111).  
       
      
    9 In Wu v The Queen, Gleeson CJ and Hayne J, at 103 [9] observed that the decision to discharge a juror may require consideration of difficult questions of fact and degree. At 103 [6], their Honours observed that the conduct of, or circumstances affecting, a single juror may require that juror's discharge, although that conduct or those circumstances may not affect the other members of the jury or suggest that they cannot perform their task satisfactorily.  
     
      
    10 As Simpson J (Hodgson JA and Barr J agreeing) observed in R v Reardon (2002) 186 FLR 1, at 23 [96], s.22 Jury Act 1977 envisages a very broad power or discretion in relation to the discharge of individual jurors, as reference is made to discharge where a juror is “through illness incapable of continuing to act” but broadens that scope by addition of the words “or for any other reason”. I will return to R v Reardon later in this judgment.  
     
      
       
      Duties and Burdens Arising from Jury Service 
       
      
    11 A jury has now been empanelled in this trial. The point has passed where the applicant juror could have sought to be excused from the panel on employment-related grounds under s.38 of the Act “for good cause”.  
     
      
    12 The purpose of trial by jury is itself an important consideration on an application such as this. The jury in a criminal trial is to consist of twelve persons: s.19 Jury Act 1977. The jury is a body of persons representative of the wider community: Cheatle v The Queen [1993] 177 CLR 541 at 560. The constitutional guarantee of trial by jury in Commonwealth matters exists for the benefit of the community as a whole, as well as for the benefit of the particular accused: Brown v The Queen [1986] 160 CLR 171 at 201. As the New South Wales Law Reform Commission observed in Issues Paper 28, at paragraph 1.42: 
     
      
       
        
        “Jury service is seen as an important point of contact between the court system and the public at large"". 
        
       
      
    13 Citizens who are empanelled as jurors exercise an important function in the criminal justice system. They are judges of the facts. The law requires twelve jurors for a criminal trial (subject to the operation of s.22 Jury Act 1977). A range of experiences and backgrounds in the wider community are drawn together in this way as part of the process whereby a jury judges the facts of the case. Thus, jurors exercise an important duty, on behalf of the community.  
     
      
    14 A measure of hardship is to be expected on the part of those chosen to serve as jurors. If there are particular factors which may impact upon ability to serve, especially related to employment, then application may be made under s.38 to be excused from the panel. The hardships to which jurors are subject include removal from employment, possible stresses on the domestic front and the need to attend on a daily basis until the trial is over. The level of payment to jurors is not great and itself is the subject of further comment by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission: Issues Paper 28, paragraph 9.53 and following.  
     
      
    15 All of these factors, however, form part of the duty of citizens chosen to serve as jurors, being a duty to the community. These hardships are a consequence of the process of trial by jury for serious criminal matters, which is a cornerstone of the criminal justice system.  
     
      
       
      Resolution of Application 
       
      
    16 I return to the present application. At its commencement, the trial was given a four months estimate, which remains the outer limit estimate for the trial. Some fourteen witnesses have given evidence in the Crown case. The fifteenth witness, Mr Chow, is well advanced in cross-examination. The Crown case itself is, in my view, well advanced.  
     
      
    17 The application is based upon financial hardship and associated domestic stress which has flowed from disruption to the applicant juror's work. This consequential stress is said to have affected the applicant juror’s sleep. No medical evidence has been advanced by the applicant juror.  
     
      
    18 In R v Reardon, Simpson J observed at 23 [96] that it may be “that a stated dislike of performing jury service, with no more, would be inadequate to justify the exercise of the discretion” to discharge a juror.19 In R v Reardon, a juror was discharged at an early point in a trial with a three-month estimate. There was material before the trial judge pointing to the detrimental effect which a lengthy period of absence for jury duty would have upon a business in which the juror was employed, together with medical evidence of an illness triggered by stress. A medical certificate was presented (and not challenged) which stated that the juror was unfit to serve as a juror for a two-week period. The juror was discharged by the trial judge, and the Court of Criminal Appeal held that there was no error in the exercise of discretion.  
     
      
    20 In delivering the leading judgment of the Court on this issue, Simpson J at 23-24 [97], made some general observations which are pertinent when an application such as this is made. Her Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Occasionally it will happen that an individual, such as (perhaps) this juror, will confront the system. It is one thing to maintain that it is the duty of every citizen to perform jury duty and it is no doubt tempting, at times, to seek to enforce that principle. But it is equally important never to lose sight of the important function that jurors are called upon to perform. Inherent in that function is a willingness to forgo, or put to one side, personal interest. Where a juror cannot or will not do that, he or she cannot be compelled. Only physical attendance can be compelled; the heart and mind cannot. The reality here was that this juror was not suited to the task, and no amount of compulsion was going to make her turn her mind to the task. Unpalatable as it may be to see the disrespect for the system implicit in the juror's conduct, justice mandated that the juror be released from service in the trial. Any other course would potentially have worked unfairness to one party or another. In my opinion the judge had no alternative other than to act as she did.” 
        
       
      
    21 As I have observed, there was a body of material including medical evidence in R v Reardon, which is not present in this case.  
     
      
    22 I am not unsympathetic to the applicant juror. The starting point, however, must be her duty to the community to serve as a juror. Interruption of employment is a consequence of that duty. Financial hardship flowing from jury service is not uncommon. A level of domestic stress resulting from jury service is also likely to be experienced from time to time.  
     
      
    23 The Crown submitted that I should be mindful of information concerning another juror's condition which may possibly affect that juror in the future (T1482.20). In effect, the Crown submits that I should have an eye to the possibility of a future application in determining whether to discharge the applicant juror: R v Ronen [2005] NSWSC 319 at [11]. I agree that this is a relevant factor in the circumstances of this case.  
     
      
    24 The applicant juror has made an application to the Court to be discharged. I do not propose to accede to the application. The applicant juror will be in a position to inform her partner that she has made application to the Court which has been refused, and that it is necessary for her to continue to fulfil her legal duty to the community through service as a juror. This information may serve to alleviate, to some extent, the pressure on the applicant juror to allow her to attend to her duty as a juror in this trial.  
     
      
    25 I have given careful consideration to the matters raised on this application. Having done so, however, I decline the application by the applicant juror to be discharged from the jury.

       REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: William Andrew McDonald pleads guilty to the murder of Barry Shaw on 27 August 2005. The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period has been prescribed of twenty years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The deceased died as a result of the infliction by the prisoner of multiple knife wounds to the neck and chest. At the time of his death, the deceased lived in Lalor Park. He was 45 years old when he was murdered. 
     
      
    3 It became apparent during the submissions on sentence that the extent of the prisoner’s premeditation to commit the offence was in dispute. The Crown contends that the prisoner’s attack on the deceased involved a significant degree of premeditation whereas the prisoner submits that the Court would find that the intention to do really serious bodily harm or to kill was not formed until after the deceased had taken the knife from the prisoner and had slashed him with it. This occurred, the prisoner contends, after a period of about one hour after he entered the deceased’s home during which time he and the deceased had consumed cannabis. 
     
      
    4 The onus is on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt when the intent to kill or to inflict really serious bodily harm was formed and the extent of his premeditation to commit the offence.  
     
      
    5 As a mitigating factor to be taken into account on sentence, the prisoner contends that the deceased used the knife against him which is an act of provocation in the limited sense provided by s 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Crimes (SP) Act). The Crown contends that the deceased’s movements with the knife were defensive in nature and provocation is “materially non-existent”. 
     
      
    6 The onus is on the prisoner to prove on the balance of probabilities that he was provoked by the victim. 
     
      
    7 Before considering these issues, I propose to detail those facts which are agreed. They are taken from the statement of AGREED FACTS which was tendered by consent.  
     
      
       
      AGREED FACTS  
       
      
    8 Barry Michael Shaw (the deceased), a single man aged 45, resided at……….Lalor Park. The deceased had been a local in [the] Lalor Park area for most of his life. 
     
      
       
      The deceased trained greyhounds, and kept a number of them at the house. The deceased collected knives and spears. He followed Aboriginal culture, making spears with knives. He was in receipt of health benefits. 
       
       
      For some months before 27 August 2005, a friend, Jason Remilton, had also been staying at the deceased’s address. 
       
       
      At around 8.00pm on Saturday 27 August 2005, Jason Remilton returned home to the residence, and discovered the body of the deceased laying on the floor in the loungeroom. The deceased had suffered numerous stab wounds to the neck and upper chest area, front and back, with a large laceration to his throat. Remilton summonsed the help of friends, and police were contacted. A Crime scene was established, and homicide investigation commenced. 
       
       
      On Monday 29 August 2005, a search warrant was executed at 18/7 Iwunda Street Lalor Park, where one Clayton Martin, and the accused, William Andrew McDonald, were living. The accused was not present in the unit when the warrant was executed. A number of blood stained items were seized. Clayton Martin was interviewed by police, twice, on Monday 29 August, about the stabbing of the deceased. His accounts contained a number of inconsistencies. He nominated his flatmate, “Paul” as the person responsible for the death of the deceased. However in further conversation to police he nominated the accused as the person responsible for the death of the deceased. 
       
       
      At about 9am on Tuesday, 30 August 2005, the accused attended the Blacktown methadone clinic. He asked staff to contact police. This was done. Police attended, and the accused said he wanted to talk to them. He was cautioned, and informed that he was under arrest. He was transported to Blacktown police station, and was interviewed, admitting the offence.  
       
       
      When interviewed the accused stated that he had become angry over an assault by the deceased upon his friend, Clayton Martin, a few weeks beforehand. Such assault had never been reported to police. The accused said that he disliked the deceased, and that he (the deceased) had an affinity with knives.  
       
       
      He said that at about 10am on Saturday 27th August 2005, he began drinking beer with Clayton Martin. They had consumed over a carton of beer between them, and upon reaching late afternoon, the accused suggested to Clayton Martin that they pay the deceased a visit. The accused said he wanted an altercation with the deceased. He armed himself with a knife. He said he did not normally carry a knife. 
       
       
      Sometime in the early evening both the accused and Martin walked to the deceased’s address, and arrived when it was dark. The deceased allowed both men into his home. They consumed an amount of cannabis. 
       
       
      The deceased’s mother rang the deceased at about 6.10pm. In the conversation the deceased said there was someone there (at his place). 
       
       
      The accused said that after nearly an hour of being there he pulled out the knife which he had secreted in his tracksuit pants. What then happened was described by the accused in the interview in the following terms: 
       
       
        
        a) [17] He said that’s a mad knife, give us a look at it, and went whoosh, across my leg like that (382). I just went there to show him (the knife) at first, and it spun him out and he went funny. He grabbed it off me and that’s when he went like that (456). He jumped back. He said what’s that fucking for. What are you bringing that up here for. And I showed him and he freaked out and that’s when he slashed me with it (548-552). He cut me leg and I freaked out. It cut my pants. It freaked me out and it scared me. I just reacted (564-574). I took it off him straightaway (382, 559). I just grabbed it straight off him. I grabbed the blade. He didn’t cut me. I just snatched it out of him real quick. He didn’t have a hold of it at all, the first part (586-590). This was in the lounge room (556).  
        
       
       
        
        b) [18] I just went into a frenzy and I knew I’d done something bad by the first hit, by hitting him (729). I went into a stupid frenzy. I hit him in the throat first I think. He fell on the ground, and I fucking jumped on top of him. He tried to wrestle me. He tried to strangle me a bit, and I just got him out of the way and I just went stupid, I just lost it (574-578). 
        
       
       
        
        c) [19] When I hit him first with it, I realised I’d done something bad. He was gargling his blood, trying to talk. I thought I’d gone that far, I may as well keep going (615-617). 
        
       
       
        
        d) [20] After I grabbed the knife I think I spun him around, and I think I hit him in the back of the neck, and I spun him around the other way, and I hit him about three or four times here that I can remember, and then he collapsed onto the ground. We sort of wrestled a bit and he fell on the ground and I just jumped on top of him and just kept going (594-595). I threw Clayton’s jumper on him to shut him up. I didn’t want him to wake Clayton up. He was saying Clay get him off me, get him off me. I know that I hurt him really bad. He was saying stop Bill, stop, and I continued to stab him (600, 607-612).  
        
       
       
        
        e) [21] He stopped breathing, not very long, it was over pretty quick, probably less than a minute (623-624). 
        
       
       
        
        f) [22] When I tossed the (jumper) over his face he had stopped breathing. He was gone. I didn’t want Clayton to see his face, what I’d done. I just grabbed Clayton’s (jumper) and I said come on let’s go mate. I knew that I’d hurt him badly, I just wanted to get Clay out of there (627-633). 
        
       
       
      The accused said that after it became apparent that the victim was deceased, the accused and Martin returned to their Iwunda Street, Lalor Park, address. The accused discarded his tracksuit pants, which were covered in blood. The accused said he could not remember what he did with them. The tracksuit pants have not been recovered. 
       
       
      On Sunday 28 August, 2005 the accused took the knife he had used against the deceased, and threw it in a drain in Boyd Street, Blacktown. Before he threw it away he washed it and cleaned it, as it had blood on it. Following the interview on Tuesday, 30 August 2005, the accused took police to the drain during a walk-through, and police recovered the knife. The knife measured approximately 30 centimetres overall, with a blade length of 19 centimetres. The blade measured 40mm at its widest point near the handle. 
       
       
      On Tuesday 30 August, 2005, shortly after 3.15pm, the accused’s right knee was examined by Dr Stuart Anderson, police medical officer. Dr Anderson noted two parallel and partly overlapping linear lesions with scab formation, one 3 cm and the other 1 cm in length both with scab formation. Above this was a discontinuous series of lesions, totalling about 1cm in length with scab formation, roughly parallel to and partly overlapping with the previous lesions. The knee was photographed shortly after 4.30pm. 
       
       
      In Dr Anderson’s opinion the wound complex was consistent with abrasions and bruising at the time in question and was consistent with being caused by a hard, sharp object, and appeared to result from a scraping force. 
       
       
      Following a post-mortem examination, the pathologist, Dr Langlois, determined the cause of death as knife wounds of neck and chest. Dr Langlois reported: 
       
      
     a) A mimimum of 15 stab wounds to the neck and chest; b) Four wounds cut into bone, which would have required  
     
      
       
        
        substantial force; 
        
       
      
     c) Two further wounds which were typical of defence injuries; d) The longest recordable wound track length was 21 cm, from  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          the back to the front of the chest, consistent with the length of the blade of the knife recovered from the drain. 
          
         
        
       
      
     Dr Langlois attributed death to: 
     
      
       
        
        a) Two wounds (9 & 10) which entered the chest from the front, and cut the aorta; 
         
        b) One wound (5) which cut the left carotid artery and the left jugular vein, the wound being a cut drawn across the neck; 
         
        c) Two wounds (1 and 2) which cut into the voice (sic) and windpipe; 
        
       
      
     d) One wound (19) which cut the left lung; e) One further wound (6), which may have cut the left lung. 
     
      
       
      Did the attack on the deceased involve a significant degree of pre-meditation? 
       
      
    9 The Crown points to the origin of the attack upon the deceased being an incident some weeks beforehand when the deceased had apparently assaulted Clayton Martin, the prisoner’s friend. The prisoner had armed himself with a 30cm knife late in the afternoon of the day of the offence, with the intention, the Crown submits, of having an altercation with the deceased. He knew that the deceased had an affinity with knives and he told police that he did not normally carry a knife. In these circumstances, the Crown argues that the prisoner must have been aware that any physical altercation was likely to lead to at least very serious injury to one, if not both, of the men. After arriving at the deceased’s premises, he waited for nearly an hour before pulling out the knife which had been hidden in his track suit pants. The only available inference, the Crown contends, is that the deceased was taken by surprise when the prisoner pulled out the knife and the suggestion that the prisoner “showed” the deceased the knife should not be accepted. The only available inference is that the prisoner confronted  the deceased with the knife.  
     
      
    10 Mr Smith, counsel for the prisoner, contends that the prisoner “showed” the deceased the knife not in a confrontational fashion which is consistent with his admissions to the police. Mr Smith points out that the information provided by the prisoner to police that he did not normally carry a knife is inconsistent with his criminal record and what he told Dr Westmore. The Crown has not excluded as a reasonable possibility what the prisoner says, Mr Smith argues, as to the production of the knife and the court could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was a confrontation with the knife.  
     
      
    11 It is evident that the prior relationship between the prisoner and the deceased whom he had come to know through Clayton Martin (Clayton) had not been harmonious. He had been to the deceased’s house on one prior occasion during which the deceased was ‘smart’ to Clayton and the prisoner ended up saying ‘lets go’. According to the prisoner, the deceased had visited Clayton’s house where he was living probably a dozen times and had been present at most of those visits. In relation to two of these visits, the prisoner recounted in the electronic record of interview (ERISP) that a dog had been put onto Clayton and himself by the deceased which had resulted in a physical altercation between the prisoner and the deceased. On another occasion the deceased called them “fucking dogs” by which the prisoner understood him to mean they were informers.  
     
      
    12 Some two weeks before the murder, Clayton told the prisoner that the deceased had assaulted him and had shown him bruises. The prisoner told police that he was “really dirty” on the deceased because of the assault on Clayton and that he disliked him. On the day of the murder he had consumed a large amount of alcohol and was intoxicated. It was his suggestion that he and Clayton visit the deceased as he wanted an altercation with him. He was angry when he turned up at the deceased’s home (Q/A 410). 
     
      
    13 In the ERISP he said he did not normally carry a knife whereas he told Dr Westmore when asked why he had taken the knife with him: 
     
      
       
        
        “I’ve always had a knife because I’ve been in prison, being in protection you have to carry a knife because you can always have an altercation with someone outside”: see Exhibit B, document 10 at p 2.  
        
       
      
    14 Although the prisoner’s claim that he always had a knife gains some support from his prior criminal history which discloses three convictions for the offence of carrying a cutting weapon, in my view, he was being disingenuous in the statement he made to the psychiatrist. The prisoner detailed in the ERISP how he obtained the knife which he used in the murder. He told police that it was one of some twenty knives which he had stolen about two weeks before to exchange for “pot”. I reject the contention that the prisoner was in possession of the knife on the night of the murder as he always carried a knife. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he deliberately armed himself with the knife before he went to the deceased’s home.  
     
      
    15 When asked by police “What did you have the knife in your pocket for”, the prisoner replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “……….I don’t know, I just went there to show him  
        at first 
         and I don’t know, he just, it spun him out and he went funny, you know, in a way. And he grabbed it off me and that’s when he went like that”(emphasis added). (see Q/A 456) 
        
       
       
      It is plainly untrue that the prisoner just went to the deceased’s home to show him the knife. He went there to have an altercation with the deceased with whom he was angry.  
       
      
    16 The prisoner further told police that he pulled the knife out as he “just wanted to show him. I said……you know, this is my knife, you know what I mean?” (see Q/A 550). 
     
      
    17 There appears to be no good reason for the deceased to have reacted in the way the prisoner claims should the knife have been produced merely for it to be shown to him. The deceased was not unfamiliar with knives.  
     
      
    18 Mr Smith submitted that the deceased’s reaction may have been as a result of a bipolar disorder of which some evidence is provided by the statement of Tracie Anne Shaw, the deceased’s sister. Ms Shaw recounts in her statement that the deceased was diagnosed as a manic depressive when he was in his early twenties for which condition he was taking medication. He would get very angry, become irrational, sometimes be on a high and then in the next second would cry. However, the deceased would know when he was getting hyped up or stressed out and would try and get help on his own.  
     
      
    19 I do not accept that the prisoner, who was angry with the deceased and had gone to his home to have an altercation with him whilst armed with a knife concealed within his clothing, produced the knife merely to show it to him. I reject the submission made on behalf of the prisoner. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has excluded as a rational inference that the prisoner produced the knife merely to show it to the deceased. I am not however satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner pulled out the knife with the intention to kill or to inflict really serious bodily harm. 
     
      
    20 The prisoner was asked (Q/A 409): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you want to seek an altercation with Barry about the  
         
          
          assault upon Clayton?  
          
         
        
       
      
     A I did yeah, I did but not like how it went” (emphasis added)  
     
      
     And 
     
      
       “Q …..did you go there with the purpose of stabbing him? 
       
      
     A No, not at first I didn’t” (emphasis added) (Q/A 618).  
     
      
    21 He had also told police that he just went there to show the deceased the knife at first. The only rational inference to be drawn beyond reasonable doubt from all the circumstances is that the prisoner produced the knife with the intention of frightening the deceased which changed when the knife was grabbed from him. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner confronted the deceased with the knife to frighten him.  
     
      
      Was the deceased provoked? 
       
      
    22 During the ERISP, the prisoner told police that upon producing the knife, the deceased grabbed it off him and slashed him with it across his knee. He snatched it back “real quick” by grabbing it by the blade. The prisoner submits that the deceased’s use of the knife against him is an act of provocation in mitigation of the murder. 
     
      
    23 I find on the probabilities that after the prisoner produced the knife there was a struggle during which the deceased had possession of it for a short time. The wound on the anteromedial aspect of the prisoner’s knee examined by Dr Anderson on 30 August 2005 was caused by contact with the knife after the deceased had taken possession of it.  
     
      
    24 During the proceedings on sentence, the features of this wound assumed significance because of the prisoner’s description of being “slashed” by the deceased with the knife and evidence was given by Dr Anderson and Dr Duflou. The prisoner had demonstrated during the ERISP the knife being brought down in what was described by Dr Duflou as “almost in an arc type arrangement”. 
     
      
    25 Both Dr Anderson and Dr Duflou expressed an opinion that the three lesions were consistent with abrasions. In his report, Dr Anderson opined that for a knife to cause these wounds “it would seem more likely that the tip or point of the knife was used to scrape the skin, rather than the blade cutting the skin.” Dr Anderson could not see how one motion with the knife could explain the three individual abrasions because of their partly overlapping and parallel features. He was of the opinion that it could have been two but probably three motions. He acknowledged that in a struggle there are all sorts of complicated movements and the wearing of tracksuit pants did complicate things but even with these complicating factors had “difficulty visualising how these components of this wound could be caused by one slashing motion”. Dr Duflou expressed the view that there were three separate options two of which involved more than a single motion. He opined that the three lesions could have been caused by “a single movement with associated movement of the knee while the weapon is brought against the knee”. 
     
      
    26 The prisoner’s injury consisted of two parallel and partly overlapping linear lesions both with scab formation above which were a discontinuous series of lesions with scab formation roughly parallel and partly overlapping the lesions below. The partly overlapping and parallel features of these lesions and their abrasive nature make it improbable, in my view, that the lesions resulted from the prisoner being slashed with a knife. It is more probable that they were caused by the knife being scraped across the prisoner’s knee during the struggle for the knife.  
     
      
    27 Both the prisoner and Clayton were invited by the deceased into his home although their arrival was unexpected. They consumed marihuana together and there is nothing that suggests that the deceased bore the prisoner ill will on that night. The deceased had no reason to slash the prisoner with a knife. I do not accept on the probabilities that he did so as a result of a bipolar disorder.  
     
      
    28 I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the deceased slashed the prisoner with the knife. The deceased, I conclude, grabbed the knife when he was suddenly confronted with it by the prisoner and the prisoner’s wound occurred during the brief struggle that followed. I find on the probabilities, as the Crown contends, that the deceased’s movements with the knife for the short time he had it in his possession were defensive in nature. It follows that I am not satisfied that the prisoner was provoked by the deceased.  
     
      
    29 The attack upon the deceased when the prisoner regained possession of the knife was horrifying. He stabbed the deceased a minimum of 15 times to the neck and chest. Such force was used that four wounds cut into bone. The deceased’s left carotid artery, left jugular vein, windpipe, left lung and aorta were cut in a frenzied attack. The deceased’s pleas for the prisoner to stop were ignored. When he first hit the deceased with the knife, the prisoner knew he had done something bad. When asked by police (ERISP Q/A 617): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Why did you continue stabbing him if he was in a lot of pain? 
        
       
       
       
      The prisoner replied: 
       
       
       
        
         “I don’t know, I just thought, I don’t know, I thought I’d gone that far I may as well keep going.” 
        
       
      
    30 Although the prisoner denied that he meant to kill the deceased (ERISP Q/A 620), the only rational inference to be drawn from all the circumstances beyond reasonable doubt is that the intention to kill was formed following the struggle with the deceased over the knife.  
     
      
    31 As this is an offence to which a standard non-parole period applies, it is necessary to consider where the offence committed by the prisoner lies on the range of objective seriousness of the offence of murder although a plea of guilty has been entered: see R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at [18], R v Simon [2005] NSWCCA 123 at [30].  
     
      
    32 It is a factor in mitigation that the murder was not planned. The prisoner’s premeditation was confined to showing the knife to the deceased to frighten him. The position changed unexpectedly when the deceased grabbed the knife. The intention to kill was not formed until the prisoner regained possession of the weapon. The lack of planning is a consideration, in my opinion, which places the offence slightly below the mid-range of objective seriousness. The horrific attack which then followed significantly increases, to my mind, the objective seriousness of the offence. The attack upon the deceased was extremely violent and hideous wounds were inflicted. The prisoner knew that he had seriously hurt the deceased yet persisted in the attack disregarding the deceased’s pleas. I conclude that the offence is to be characterised in the upper half of the middle range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    33 The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A person sentenced to imprisonment for life is to serve that sentence for the term of his natural life: s 19A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 19A(3) provides that nothing in s 19A affects the operation of s 21(1) of the Crimes (SP) Act (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life).  
     
      
    34 Section 61(1) of the Crimes (SP) Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.” 
        
       
      
    35 The primary focus of s 61(1) is an assessment of how extreme the prisoner’s culpability is: see R v Merritt 146 A Crim R 309 at [52]. Although the offence is very serious, the prisoner’s level of culpability is not such that his crime falls within the worst category of the offence of murder.  
     
      
    36 The Crown invites me to find that the prisoner has not expressed remorse for his conduct and the death of the deceased. Whilst there has been no explicit statement of remorse for the murder, it is apparent from the answers given during the ERISP that the prisoner recognised what he did was wrong and expressed some regret for his conduct. I take into account the prisoner’s co-operation with the police and his plea of guilty as evidencing contrition for the offence.  
     
      
    37 The prisoner pleaded guilty on 7 May 2007 on which date his trial had been listed to commence. The court had been advised during the preceding week that a plea was to be entered and a jury panel was not required. The expense of a trial estimated to take three weeks and the emotional stress and inconvenience likely to have been experienced by the deceased’s family, friends and witnesses has been avoided. A plea entered at such a late stage usually attracts a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea at the lower end of the range of 10-25 per cent. 
     
      
    38 The delay in the present case has been to an extent explained by Mr Velcic’s affidavit. I accept that difficulties experienced in obtaining psychiatric opinions caused delay in obtaining the prisoner’s instructions. 
     
      
    39 On 30 August 2005, the prisoner handed himself in to police and made extensive admissions during the ERISP. He took police to the drain where the knife was found. The prisoner’s early disclosure was plainly of use to police and enhanced the Crown case against him.  
     
      
    40 The prisoner is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian effect of his plea and for his contrition which I assess at twenty per cent.  
     
      
       
      
    41 The prisoner has an unattractive criminal history. There are convictions for many offences of dishonesty which I do not propose to detail. There are also convictions for possession of drugs, carrying cutting weapons, malicious damage and the possession of an unlicensed pistol. On many occasions terms of imprisonment have been imposed. Offences involving violence for which he has been sentenced to imprisonment are: assault (May 1983), maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm (December 1989) and robbery (August 1996). Having regard to this extensive record, I give more weight to considerations of personal deterrence and the protection of the community than otherwise would be the case: see R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; R v M.A.K, R v M.S.K [2006] NSWCCA 381. 
     
      
    42 An aggravating factor is at the time of the murder the prisoner was subject to three bonds under s 9 of the Crimes (SP) Act. He was placed on these bonds for 3 years on 16 May 2003 for the offences of possession of implements to enter a conveyance, shoplifting and carrying a cutting weapon upon apprehension. A condition of each bond was that he was to accept the supervision of the probation and parole service. It is significant that one of the offences for which he had been placed on a bond involved the carrying of a cutting weapon. The prisoner abused his conditional liberty by stabbing the deceased to death with a knife. The commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been regarded as a factor of aggravation requiring the passing of a deterrent sentence: see for example Regina v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [40-42] and R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 at [48]. 
     
      
    43 The murder was committed after the prisoner had consumed a large amount of alcohol. He went to the deceased’s home whilst he was intoxicated and then smoked marihuana. The prisoner had a history of alcohol and substance abuse. His intoxication was not out of character for him. The three bonds to which he was subject included the condition that he accept drug and alcohol counselling. In these circumstances, the prisoner’s intoxication is not a mitigating factor although it provides some explanation as to why the offence occurred.  
     
      
    44 The prisoner was born on 24 March 1965 and is 42 years of age. He was 40 years old at the time of the murder. As the prisoner did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence, his subjective circumstances are taken from the histories given to Dr Westmore and Dr Nielssen. He is the only child to his parents union and his mother was fourteen when he was born. He does not know his father. He has two half siblings from his mother’s second relationship and who he said suffer some type of schizophrenia. He claimed that his stepfather who died when he was thirteen used to bash him. The prisoner was educated to year 8 and has only basic literary skills. He was frequently expelled or suspended from school and was placed in juvenile facilities. He escaped from Mt Penang to Queensland where he lived until apprehended. The prisoner started smoking cannabis at the age of thirteen and later used other drugs mainly heroin. He has a work history limited to short periods in casual employment. Due to his frequent periods of imprisonment, he told Dr Westmore that he had become “institutionalised”. Dr Westmore thought he was of below average intelligence and had probably suffered periods of depression in his past, probably from his childhood years. His psychiatric diagnosis included alcohol and substance abuse. When in the community, he said he would drink alcohol on a daily basis. Following his release from custody on 17 December 2004, he was becoming intoxicated on a daily basis and was abusing minor tranquillisers and Rivotril. He currently takes methadone. The prisoner reported an extended period of nocturnal enuresis which lasted into his early twenties. Dr Westmore observes that this is a most unusual history and suggests significant psychological disturbances when the prisoner was a boy, adolescent and young adult. For nocturnal enuresis to extend into early adulthood, Dr Westmore states is very unusual. His frequent incarcerations and his own observations about probable institutionalisation are all matters, Dr Westmore states, which will need to be carefully considered when he is eventually provided with some counselling and rehabilitation. He was, Dr Westmore opines, probably a very disadvantaged child and that early disadvantage has impacted very adversely on his subsequent personality development and the later life style he adopted.  
     
      
    45 Dr Nielssen expressed the opinion that the prisoner has a severe substance abuse disorder and was intoxicated with alcohol at the time of the offence. He estimated his intelligence to be in the lower part of the normal range.  
     
      
    46 I accept that the prisoner’s personal circumstances have been difficult and disadvantaged. It appears, however, that he has done little in the past to assist in his own rehabilitation. His failure to take advantage of the drug, alcohol and psychiatric counselling opportunities which have been previously available to him as conditions of release on parole or on a bond and his history of re-offending lead me to conclude that his prospects of rehabilitation are poor.  
     
      
    47 A victim impact statement was read to the court by Ms Tracie Shaw. The contents of the statement cannot be used by me to increase the prisoner’s sentence. I acknowledge the grief and distress by the deceased’s family and express on the community’s behalf its sympathy and compassion for them.  
     
      
    48 The prisoner has been in custody for the offence since 30 August 2005. Accordingly the sentence will commence on that date. 
     
      
    49 The appropriate, undiscounted starting point of the overall sentence, I conclude, is 30 years. The overall sentence is reduced by 20 per cent to 24 years.  
     
      
    50 Mr Smith contends that the community interest in the prisoner’s rehabilitation and the need to acquire social skills through programs available within the correctional system can be advanced by finding special circumstances. There are no positive signs in the case of the prisoner which show that if allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful, and not merely an optimistic hope: see R v Carter [2003] NSWCCA 243. I do not consider that “special circumstances” exist which justify the balance of the term of the sentence exceeding one-third of the non-parole period. 
     
      
    51 William Andrew McDonald for the murder of Barry Shaw, I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 years which is to commence on 30 August 2005 and is to expire on 29 August 2023. I set a balance of term of 6 years which is to commence on 30 August 2023 and will expire on 29 August 2029. 
     
      
    52 You will be eligible to be released on parole on 29 August 2023.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed on him by Judge Hughes in the District Court on 16 October 2006 following his plea of guilty to a charge of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon (a knife), an offence against s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, which section prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. Hughes DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for two years and seven months commencing on 17 September 2006 with a non-parole period of one year and four months, which will expire on 16 January 2008. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    2 The offence was committed on 19 November 2005. On that day, at about 11.55am, in a shopping centre at Castle Hill, the applicant approached a male, Kieran Glenzendorf, who was using an automatic teller machine. The applicant placed his arm around Mr Glenzendorf’s shoulder, leaned towards him, and demanded that Mr Glenzendorf give the applicant the money he had just withdrawn from the ATM. Mr Glenzendorf declined. The applicant reached into the front pocket of the jumper he was wearing and again demanded the money. This time he told Mr Glenzendorf that he had a knife. Mr Glenzendorf took hold of the applicant and pushed him against a wall. The applicant attempted to gain access to the knife. 
     
      
    3 As it happened, Mr Glenzendorf was a police officer who was, in plain clothes, on duty in the shopping centre. He was accompanied by a partner, Senior Constable Sharon Brown. Senior Constable Brown came to Mr Glenzendorf’s assistance and prevented the applicant from gaining access to the knife. Mr Glenzendorf identified himself as a police officer. The applicant replied:  
     
      
       
        
        “It is just a joke, I thought I knew you”. 
        
       
      
    4 Another male person approached from nearby, apparently to assist the applicant. He attempted to secure the applicant’s release. He failed, and made his own escape.  
     
      
    5 The applicant did in fact have a knife in the front pocket of his clothing, which Mr Glenzendorf was able to confiscate.  
     
      
    6 The applicant was arrested and taken to Castle Hill Police Station. He was interviewed. He gave an account of his actions. He told police that he had travelled by train and bus from Kingswood to Castle Hill with a male person whom he had met the night before and whom he identified only as “Ape”. He said that he thought Mr Glenzendorf was a mate of his called Justin, whom he knew from Mount Druitt TAFE, and that Justin had bragged about robbing people at ATM’s. Hence, when he saw who he thought was Justin at an ATM, and in order to “give Justin some of his own medicine”, he approached him and demanded the money. It was only after being subdued by the police officers that he realised his mistake and that Mr Glenzendorf was not his friend Justin. He said that he had borrowed the knife from “Ape” in order to scare Justin. 
     
      
    7 In a statement to police on 8 September 2006 the applicant gave a different account. He said that on 19 November 2005 he and a number of other men had gathered at a home in which a person whom he named lived. That person was a person from whom the applicant purchased cannabis. He said that that person stated his intention of committing a robbery at Castle Hill, and intimidating the applicant into participating. The person threatened violence to the applicant if he did not join in. He said that he then travelled in a car with “Ape Boy” and “Rebel” to Castle Hill where they walked around for a while, looking for a victim. He maintained the story that he thought he saw a friend and decided to play a joke on him. He declined to elaborate on this. (The statement of 8 September was not itself in evidence. A paraphrase of its contents was contained in Exhibit C, an affidavit outlining assistance given by the applicant to police.) 
     
      
    8 The applicant said that he returned to the person’s house the following day to purchase more cannabis, when there was more discussion by that person about additional robberies, and more intimidating behaviour by him. 
     
      
    9 In evidence on the sentencing proceedings the applicant gave a different account again. He acknowledged that the version he had given in the interview was false. When asked why he had given this false account, he answered: 
     
      
       
        
        “Basically because I got told when I answered that that if I did not do it I would have got beaten up and when I got done if I told the cops I was going there to do it because I would have got beaten up because [the person] was going to do, they would have gone back to [the person] he would have got in trouble for it and got blamed for and then I would have got beaten up anyway and either way I would have got my head kicked in.” 
        
       
      
    10 He reiterated the name of the person whom he had named, who he said used to be his drug dealer. 
     
      
    11 He said that the two people with whom he had travelled to Castle Hill were basically that person’s second in charge and that if he had not done as he was directed all three of them would have beaten him up. 
     
      
    12 He said that in the September statement he had maintained the story that he thought Mr Glenzendorf was a friend and he had intended to play a joke on him because: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was still sort of buying off [the person] and the cops were still hard on [the person] to get him done.” 
        
       
       
      He feared that identifying that person would only worsen his own position, for which he held the person responsible.  
       
      
    13 He was by then willing to give evidence against the person, and to help the police “as much as I can”. His attitude in this respect had changed dramatically because he recognised how significantly his conduct had affected his own life. 
     
      
    14 In cross-examination he said that, when it was initially suggested that he go to Castle Hill, he refused but that the person said to him: 
     
      
       
        
        “You go frigging now or I am going to smash your head in.” 
        
       
       
      He said the person threatened him with “a two pound axe and a baseball bat”. 
       
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    15 The applicant was born on 9 July 1987. He was therefore just eighteen at the time of the offence. He had no prior criminal record. Besides his own evidence, there were before the sentencing judge a Pre-Sentence Report and a report of Ms Katie Seidler, a psychologist. These disclosed a somewhat troubled childhood and adolescence. His parents divorced when he was about five years of age. At about six years of age he was diagnosed as suffering from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and at nine years from Tourette’s syndrome. He used medication for these conditions for some years, but abandoned medication at 16 years of age. He has also been diagnosed as suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; this diagnosis appears to have been made when he was about seven years of age. 
     
      
    16 There is some history of mental illness on both sides of his family; his maternal grandmother suffered from schizophrenia, and other relatives from depression. His paternal uncles have suffered bi-polar disorder and some (unidentified) psychosis. 
     
      
    17 Ms Seidler considered that the applicant would require ongoing psychiatric/psychological care and treatment to manage his conditions. 
     
      
    18 The Probation and Parole Officer who prepared the Pre-Sentence Report described him as “an immature and somewhat naïve young man”. While his family appeared to be close and supportive, he was living in somewhat isolated circumstances because his mother had moved, with her current husband (who is not the applicant’s father) to Tasmania in 2004. He had used cannabis from the age of about 15, and his use escalated after his mother’s relocation to Tasmania. He acknowledged to Ms Seidler that he was addicted to this drug. He has also used alcohol to excess, having begun drinking at the age of 10, with disastrous results, which caused him to abstain until the age of 16. Thereafter he had periods of binge drinking. He has also experimented with amphetamines. 
     
      
    19 He told Ms Seidler that, at the time of the offence, he had been intoxicated and under the influence of cannabis, after consuming alcohol and cannabis for some hours. She reported that he told her that he was groomed into the criminal activity by others who had placed some pressure on him, although he initiated the robbery with little provocation or encouragement. Ms Seidler said that the applicant expressed appropriate remorse and regret for his actions and demonstrated what appeared to her to be genuine empathy for Mr Glenzendorf. 
     
      
    20 Ms Seidler also took a history of auditory hallucinations which began when the applicant was approximately eight years of age and, in the context of his family history, considered that this ought to be closely monitored. 
     
      
    21 Of some significance is the applicant’s attitude to the offence as expressed to the Probation and Parole Officer. She reported that the applicant said that he regretted his action but had been threatened by his drug dealer to undertake the robbery under threat of being assaulted himself. She thought he appeared to hold remorse “in relation to the consequences to himself”. She added: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Legge stated that he felt he should have been disciplined by the officer and let go. He also stated that while he felt sorry for the officer, he would have felt more sorry had the victim not been a copper.” 
        
       
       
      That attitude was not so evident in the report of Ms Seidler, who said: 
       
       
        
        “31. Mr Legge expressed appropriate remorse and regret for his actions and demonstrated what appeared to be genuine empathy for the victim. Even though the victim was a police officer, he acknowledged that his behaviour could have been frightening and may have also caused some harm.” 
        
       
      
    22 In his evidence the applicant essentially confirmed what had been contained in these reports. He explained his attitude to the victim of the offence, as expressed in the Pre-Sentence Report by saying that police officers were accustomed to dealing with such situations and were unlikely to be as vulnerable as other citizens to the kind of conduct to which Mr Glenzendorf had been exposed. 
     
      
       
      The Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    23 Hughes DCJ recounted the facts, drawing upon an agreed statement of facts that had been put before him. The following passages from the Remarks on Sentence are, having regard to the grounds of the application, particularly relevant: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Hall [counsel for the applicant] in an eloquent submission on sentences, took me to the Henry guideline case and believes this was a case in which the Henry guidelines appear. In the Henry case, it was clear that except for exceptional circumstances, an offence such as this one or like offences, a custodial sentence is usual and except for exceptional circumstances, the custodial sentence should be something in the range of three to five years. 
         
         
        … I was and I think it is conceded that this was a planned and organised criminal activity and it was. According to the offender Eli planned and organised this activity to occur, that they would go to Castle Hill to rob someone for the purpose of gaining money. 
         
         
        He was in fear of Eli and that if he did not do what Eli said then he was frightened of being bashed up but as the Crown properly said this criminal enterprise Eli was not there. He was back at the original place where they slept the night, he could have left the scene and even as the Crown suggested go to his mother in Tasmania if he was so frightened of Eli. That story is one in which it is not an excuse for the criminal activity which the offender indulged himself in. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        As I said this crime can only result in a custodial sentence. It is not something even given the circumstances of the offender one could avoid it. The Henry guidelines is three to five years, even that, given that the maximum penalty according to the statute is 20 years, three to five years puts it in the lowest quarter anyway of objective criminality.” 
        
       
       
      (The reference to “Henry” was a reference to the guideline judgment of this court in  
      R v Henry 
       [1999] NSWCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346.) 
       
      
    24 His Honour noted the applicant’s previous good character and concluded that it was likely that he would not re-offend and that his prospects of rehabilitation were good. He stated his intention of reducing the sentence to be imposed by a total of 35 percent, made up of 15 percent in recognition of the early plea of guilty and 20 percent in respect of assistance to the authorities. 
     
      
    25 He found, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“Sentencing Procedure Act”), that special circumstances existed justifying departure from the ratio there contained between the total sentence and the non-parole period. He proceeded to impose the sentence I have mentioned. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of the application 
       
      
    26 Four grounds of the application were advanced. They were framed as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “1. The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the evidence given by the applicant of duress. 
         
         
        2. The sentencing judge misconceived and misapplied the guideline judgment in Henry. 
         
         
        3. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the offence was aggravated by virtue of being a ‘planned and organised criminal activity’. 
         
         
        4. The sentence is manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 1: duress 
       
      Ground 3: planned and organised criminal activity 
       
      
    27 I will deal firstly with grounds one and ground three together. 
     
      
    28 In support of the first ground counsel who appeared for the applicant argued that the evidence amounted to a compelling case that he was acting under duress and that this ought to have been treated as a substantially mitigating feature. 
     
      
    29 S 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act sets out matters to be taken into account by a sentencing court, either as aggravating factors (subs (2)), or as mitigating factors (subs (3)). S 21A(3)(d) requires that, where an offender is acting under duress, a sentencing court take this into account as a mitigating factor. Far from doing so, counsel argued, his Honour took the duress into account as an aggravating factor, perceiving it as establishing that the offence was part of a planned and organised criminal activity. Where that is established, s 21A(2)(n) requires that it be taken into account as an aggravating factor. This, indeed, is what the judge did. He expressly stated that the offence was part of a planned and organised criminal activity. 
     
      
    30 To the contrary, the Crown argued that the sentencing remarks ought to be read as containing a rejection of the applicant’s evidence of the circumstances in which he had come to commit the offence. Although no specific passage, or conclusion of fact, in the Remarks on Sentence was, in the written submissions, identified as so doing, counsel confirmed that the reference was to that passage in the Remarks in which his Honour considered the possibility of the applicant leaving the scene or going to Tasmania as the foundation of the submission. 
     
      
    31 Counsel for the Crown also expressly drew on the statement of 8 September 2006 as lending support to his contention that his Honour rejected the applicant’s account of duress. I do not so read the statement: the paraphrase of the statement in Exhibit C attributes to the applicant an explicit assertion that the person to whom I have referred had “intimidated” the applicant into going to Castle Hill threatening to “bitch-slap” him and “kick his arse”.  
     
      
    32 What his Honour did not do was make an express finding of fact about what the applicant alleged in terms of the pressure and intimidation under which he was placed to secure his participation. However, in my opinion, it is reasonable to infer that he accepted the applicant’s evidence in this respect. If he had not done so, then there was no evidence that the offence was part of a planned and organised criminal activity. The comment on other causes of action available to the applicant was not a rejection of the applicant’s evidence about what had happened but a proposed alternative that would have been available to him to meet the intimidation. In this respect it should be noted that the comment overlooks the evidence of the applicant’s financial position which was that he had three dollars in cash on him when he was arrested and ten dollars in the bank. 
     
      
    33 I think there is substance in these submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant. If his evidence were not accepted as truthful, then there was no basis on which to make a finding that the offence was part of a planned and organised criminal activity. But if his evidence were accepted, then it was evidence that the applicant was under some level of duress, or at least intimidation. His Honour did not make any finding about the applicant’s credibility but there is no reason to think that he did not accept the evidence given by the applicant. I would also add that the evidence about the presence of the second man, who disappeared shortly after trying to rescue the applicant, would support the applicant’s account in this respect. In those circumstances the error asserted on behalf of the applicant rebounded doubly upon him: he was denied the benefit of a mitigating circumstance for which express statutory recognition is given; and he was treated as though the facts giving rise to that circumstance aggravated his offence and exposed him to a more severe penalty. 
     
      
    34 No doubt the offence was planned; but, on the applicant’s evidence, he was not involved in the planning and was not responsible for it. That evidence was not rejected. S 21A(2)(n) was not, in my opinion, intended to be used to aggravate an offence where the offender being sentenced was not involved in, or part of, the planning and organisation. 
     
      
    35 In my opinion each of grounds one and three is made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2:  
      R v Henry  
      [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 
       
      
    36 In Henry this court, in a five judge bench, promulgated a guideline in respect of sentencing for offences against s 97 of the Crimes Act 1900. It identified a common category of cases, having the following features: 
     
      
        
       
        
        “(i) young offender with no or little criminal history;  
         
         (ii) weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury;  
         
         (iii) limited degree of planning;  
         
         (iv) limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof;  
         
         (v) victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver;  
         
         (vi) small amount taken;  
         
         (vii) plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.”  
        
       
      
    37 Leaving aside the question of planning, with which I have already dealt, each of these, except the vulnerable position of the victim, here applies. The applicant’s case fits comfortably into the Henry profile. 
     
      
    38 In the circumstances described, the guideline sentence promulgated is of a full term of between four and five years. Also relevant to a determination of the gravity of such an offence are the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) nature of the weapon; 
         
         (ii) vulnerability of the victim; 
         
         (iii) position on a scale of impulsiveness/planning; 
         
         (iv) intensity of threat, or actual use, of force; 
         
         (v) number of offenders; 
         
         (vi) amount taken; 
         
         (vii) effect on victim(s).” 
        
       
       
      These are in addition to: 
       
       
        
        “… factors which may arise in any case, for example, youth, offender’s criminal record, cooperation with authorities, guilty plea in the absence of a strong case, rehabilitation efforts, offence committed whilst on bail etc …” 
        
       
       
      To the extent that these circumstances are relevant in this case, except for the nature of the weapon, all significantly favour the applicant. 
       
      
    39 On behalf of the applicant it was contended that three errors are discernible in the passages I have extracted. The first is his Honour’s perception that, before a court could depart from the guideline, it was necessary that the applicant demonstrate exceptional circumstances.  
     
      
    40 Guideline judgments, and subsequent judgments that apply them, have repeatedly stressed that the guideline promulgated is not prescriptive. In R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, the first formally recognised guideline judgment to be delivered in this jurisdiction, Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, guideline judgments should now be recognised in New South Wales as having a useful role to play in ensuring that an appropriate balance exists between the broad discretion that must be retained to ensure that justice is done in each individual case, on the one hand, and the desirability of consistency in sentencing and the maintenance of public confidence in sentences actually imposed, and in the judiciary as a whole, on the other. 
         
         
        Such guidelines are intended to be indicative only 
        . They are not intended to be applied to every case as if they were rules binding on sentencing judges. Decisions of appellate courts on sentencing are not to be treated as binding precedents. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        In accordance with this approach, guideline judgments perform a limited role. Nevertheless, in my opinion, such judgments will provide a useful statement of principle to assist trial judges to ensure consistency of sentencing with respect to particular kinds of offences.  
        I reiterate that such guidelines are not binding in a formal sense 
        . They represent a relevant indicator, much as trial judges have always regarded statutory maximum penalties as an indicator.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      Statements to similar effect have been made in many subsequent cases. 
       
      
    41 In my opinion, the passages extracted from the Remarks on Sentence demonstrate that the sentencing judge misunderstood the effect of the guideline judgment in Henry. Perhaps that is founded upon a misunderstanding of what, in the following paragraph in Jurisic, Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The critical difference between judicial guidelines and statutory guidelines — whether minimum penalties or a grid system — is the flexibility of the former.  
        There is provision for the special or exceptional case 
        . There is recognition that sentencing must serve the objective of rehabilitation, as well as the objectives of denunciation and deterrence. A trial judge can respond appropriately to all the circumstances of a particular case.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    42 It would be wrong to elevate the reference to “exceptional case” in this paragraph to a principle that, before a sentencing judge departs from the guideline, exceptional circumstances have to be demonstrated. That is not what his Honour said and it is not how what he said should be interpreted. 
     
      
    43 In Henry Spigelman CJ quoted from the decision of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Roberts (1994) 73 A Crim R 306 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court has always made it clear that armed robbery is to be regarded as an offence of the utmost gravity which, except in the most exceptional circumstances, must carry a full-time custodial sentence.” 
        
       
      
    44 It is one thing to say that “exceptional circumstances” need to be demonstrated before it would be appropriate to impose any sentence other than a custodial sentence in respect of a particular offence, in this case, an offence against s 97. It is another thing altogether to say that exceptional circumstances must be demonstrated before a sentence of less than the guideline promulgated in Henry may be imposed in respect of such an offence. The former proposition is supported by authority. The latter is not, and is wrong. 
     
      
    45 Hughes DCJ appears to have considered that exceptional circumstances had to be demonstrated in both respects – in order to impose a non-custodial sentence, and in order to depart from the sentencing range of four to five years. The former proposition is correct, the latter is not. Roberts and Henry are authority for the former; they are not authority for the latter. In this respect error is demonstrated. Indeed, the Crown conceded as much. 
     
      
    46 The second error postulated on this aspect of the Remarks on Sentence is that the judgment in Henry “presupposed a crime relatively low in the hierarchy of seriousness for armed robbery offences”.  
     
      
    47 I must confess that I find it difficult to understand what his Honour meant in the fourth of the passages I have extracted. It may be that, as contended on behalf of the applicant, he was saying that, because the guideline of “three to five years” (sic) is “in the lowest quarter” of the maximum sentence of 20 years, such offences are “relatively low in the hierarchy”. In any event, given the circumstances of the present offence, I would accept that the applicant’s offence was, in the overall scheme of offences against s 97, “relatively low in the hierarchy”.  
     
      
    48 The third error postulated is the failure to recognise that Henry allows for a non-custodial sentence “where exceptional circumstances are shown”. See R v Black and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121. I have already extracted the passage from Henry which supports that proposition. 
     
      
    49 I do not, however, accept that it has been demonstrated that his Honour was in error in considering that, only in an exceptional case, will a non-custodial sentence be imposed in respect of an offence against s 97. Nor do I accept that this was necessarily such an exceptional case.  
     
      
    50 It was, in my opinion, open to his Honour to consider a non-custodial sentence; but this is far from a case where such a sentencing option was the only option available. 
     
      
    51 Notwithstanding the concession that the error in the approach to Henry has been demonstrated, counsel for the Crown argued that other errors in the approach unduly favoured the applicant. For example, he allowed a discount of 15 percent by reference to the plea of guilty. As has been pointed out, the guideline judgment in Henry takes into account a plea of guilty. The additional reduction amounted to double counting. 
     
      
    52 Counsel also argued that the discount of 20 percent referable to assistance to authorities was “inapposite” having regard to the terms of Exhibit C and the requirements of s 23 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 
     
      
    53 The position adopted by the Crown in this respect was that the applicant had failed to establish, pursuant to the terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, that a sentence “… less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed …”. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: manifestly excessive 
       
      
    54 In support of this ground it was pointed out that the applicant was a young man of just 18 years of age, socially isolated, and with no criminal record at the time of the offence. By his cooperation he had done as much as he could to remedy the harm that he had done.  
     
      
    55 There are important mitigating circumstances and I think that the Remarks on Sentence do demonstrate that inadequate attention was given to them. These are important. 
     
      
    56 Given the errors that I have identified already, I am of the view that this court ought to grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, quash the sentence and re-sentence the applicant. Against that possibility the court received additional evidence, in the form of affidavits affirmed by the applicant’s solicitor and by the applicant himself. The affidavit of the applicant’s solicitor annexes documentary material derived from the NSW Department of Corrective Services, outlining the applicant’s conduct whilst in custody. This is, except for one matter, universally favourable. The one matter concerns a caution given in relation to some behaviour, but which was considered to be explained by his Tourette’s Syndrome. The applicant’s affidavit gives more detail of his custodial circumstances and, as I read it, is encouraging as to his prospects of rehabilitation. It also sets out circumstances of his custody that establish that he is serving his sentence in harsher conditions than would be the case if he did not suffer from the mental illnesses that he does. I would also take into account the applicant’s trilogy of mental illnesses. There was some evidence that they had a causal connection with his offending. His family history is also a matter to be taken into account. In all these circumstances I propose that the sentence be set aside and the applicant be re-sentenced. I would not interfere with the head sentence. I would reduce the non-parole period to ten months expiring on 16 July 2007. The applicant would be entitled to immediate release. 
     
      
    57 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      (3) The sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
       
      (4) The applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for two years and seven months commencing on 17 September 2006 and expiring on 16 April 2009 with a non-parole period of ten months, expiring on 16 July 2007. 
       
       
      (5) Direct that the applicant be released forthwith. 
       
      
    58 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree and would add only a few observations with respect to his Honour’s error in applying the guideline judgment as if it could only be departed from in exceptional circumstances. This, as Simpson J has noted, is quite inconsistent with the basis or the guideline judgment as outlined in Jurisic at the paragraphs to which her Honour has referred. It is also inconsistent with the extended treatment of the nature of the guideline in Henry itself, particularly at paragraphs 12 through to 42. Subsequently in the case of R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 this Court affirmed the basic nature of the guidelines as a check, a guide or an indicator or as a sounding board (see at [112]–[116]. Further Whyte contains a detailed analysis of the inter-relationship, in the context of formulating and applying the guideline, between the principle of individualised justice and the principle of consistency (at [143]–[189]). 
     
      
    59 The manner in which his Honour appears to have applied the guideline would, if it were valid, constitute an impermissible confinement of the exercise of the sentencing discretion. His Honour appears to have proceeded on that basis. The authorities in this Court make it quite clear that a guideline is not a tramline. 
     
      
    60 I agree with the orders proposed by Simpson J. 
     
      
    61 HARRISON J: I also agree with the orders proposed by Simpson J. 
     
      
    62 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the court are as indicated.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: By letter dated 9 January 2007, the applicant, Graham Patrick Higgins, makes an application under s 474D of the Crimes Act 1900 (repealed) for an inquiry and review of his conviction and the sentence imposed upon him on 6 March 2006 following a trial in the District Court of New South Wales at Lismore before his Honour Black DCJ and a jury for one count of “fraudulently omitting to account” contrary to s 178A of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
       
      The new statutory scheme for review 
       
      
    2 On 23 February 2007, Part 13A (ss 474B-474N) of the Crimes Act was repealed and re-enacted as Part 7 (ss 76-88) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Applications that have not been finally determined before the repeal of Part 13A are taken to be applications under the corresponding provisions of Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act: cl 13, Schedule 1. The current application must therefore be determined pursuant to Part 7 of that Act. See also Application of Antoun El Hani [2007] NSWSC 330, per Johnson J at pars 2 to 4.  
     
      
    3 The relevant sections of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act (“the Act”) are reproduced below: 
     
      
       
        
        “78 Applications to Supreme Court 
         
        (1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.  
         
        (2) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister. 
         
         
        79 Consideration of applications 
         
        (1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion: 
         
          
          (a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or 
           
          (b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the  
          Criminal Appeal Act  
          1912. 
          
         
        (2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case. 
         
        (3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if: 
         
         (a) it appears that the matter: 
         
          
           
            
            (i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or 
             
            (ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or 
             
            (iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or 
             
            (iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and 
            
           
          (b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action. 
          
         
        (3A) The Supreme Court may defer consideration of an application under section 78 if: 
         
          
          (a) the time within which an appeal may be made against the conviction or sentence (including an application for leave to appeal) is yet to expire, or  
           
          (b) the conviction or sentence is the subject of appeal proceedings (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) that are yet to be finally determined, or 
           
          (c) the application fails to disclose sufficient information to enable the conviction or sentence to be properly considered. 
          
         
        (4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application. 
         
        (5) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).” 
        
       
      
    4 There is no material difference between the new and old provisions. The legislation reaffirms the administrative nature of an application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence. It involves the Court exercising an administrative decision-making power. The Court may consider written submissions made by the Crown in determining an application: s 79(4). See also Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 48-50; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] 214 CLR 318 at 362 par 124. 
     
      
    5 Section 79(2) provides that the test to be applied in considering whether to recommend the holding of an inquiry is whether there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case. The reported decisions that considered the old legislation permitted the holding of an inquiry where the material causes the person considering the matter any unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand: see Application of Antoun El Hani [2007] NSWSC 330 at par 6; Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 48.  
     
      
       
      History of proceedings 
       
      
    6 The applicant was convicted and sentenced on 6 March 2006 in the District Court of New South Wales at Lismore, before his Honour Judge Black DCJ and a jury, for one count of “fraudulently omitting to account”, contrary to s 178A of the Crimes Act. On 6 April 2006, his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months with a balance of the term of 1 year and 3 months.  
     
      
    7 A Crown appeal against the sentence was dismissed (R v Higgins [2006] NSWCCA 326). The applicant’s appeal against conviction was also dismissed (Higgins v R [2007] NSWCCA 56). He did not seek leave to appeal against sentence. There is currently no application filed for special leave to appeal to the High Court from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     
      
    8 The applicant relied on two grounds in his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal:  
     
      
       
        
        (1) The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence an interview between the appellant and Commonwealth Bank investigators that occurred on 8 September 2003 and an interview between the appellant and police that occurred on 18 November 2003; and 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The trial judge erred in his direction to the jury regarding circumstantial evidence. 
        
       
      
    9 As to the first ground of appeal, it was submitted that the bank interview should have been excluded pursuant to s 84 of the Evidence Act 1995 on the basis that the applicant participated in it under the influence of oppressive conduct of senior bank staff and the investigators, or subject to the threat of oppressive conduct on the part of either the bank or its investigators.10 Hoeben J (Sully and Bell JJ agreeing) accepted that s 84 does not require the isolation of a single reason or a single incident of misconduct provoking the confession, since there may be a number of factors working together (citing R v Zhang [2000] NSWSC 1099, per Simpson J). They also accepted that the concept of oppression should not be limited to physical or threatened physical force but can encompass mental and psychological pressure. They were, however, satisfied that there was nothing in the conduct of the bank or its officers that could amount to “oppressive conduct”.11 It was further submitted that the bank interview should have been excluded pursuant to s 90 of the Evidence Act. It was submitted that the relevant unfairness was the use of the bank interview by the prosecution in criminal proceedings as the appellant had only been told that the interview “could be used in the bank’s deliberations”.12 Hoeben J considered that the appellant’s adoption of the bank interview when he was interviewed by police was decisive in disposing of the first ground of appeal. On that occasion the appellant was given a full caution and in fact spoke to his solicitor before participating in the interview. Hoeben J observed (at par 39): 
     
      
       
        
        “In the course of that interview he suggested to the interviewing officers that there was no point in them asking him further questions about how Mrs Loder’s cheque was dealt with since he had already been comprehensively questioned on that subject by the bank investigators. He told the interviewing police officers that he accepted that the interview with the bank was correct and he did not wish to alter the content. The interviewing officers gave him the opportunity of re-reading his bank interview and again he adopted it as accurate.” 
        
       
      
    13 In relation to the second ground of appeal, it was submitted that the directions of the trial judge lacked the detail and emphasis required in the circumstances of the case such as to appropriately direct the jury as to the relevant law to be applied to the facts as the jury might find them. In particular, it was submitted that the trial judge did not make it clear that in a circumstantial case the onus of proof is on the Crown and, as such, any inference or conclusion sought to be drawn by the Crown from the facts must be a conclusion reached by the jury beyond reasonable doubt, and that any such conclusion must be the only reasonable explanation or inference to be drawn from those facts.14 Counsel for the applicant at trial did not seek redirections on this or any other aspect of the summing up. Consequently, on appeal, rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1912 applied. The Court was not persuaded that there was error in the directions as to circumstantial evidence and, furthermore, the Court considered that it was entitled to conclude that his Honour’s directions considered in context were accepted by counsel in the trial as not revealing error. Leave to rely upon the second ground of appeal was refused. 
     
      
    15 The present application does not seek to re-agitate either ground of appeal. What is significant, however, is that the applicant was represented by counsel on the appeal (and I assume in the identification and preparation of the grounds of appeal) and that no issue was raised as to the adequacy of the police investigation and no ground of appeal based on fresh evidence was advanced. By contrast, through his counsel at the trial, the applicant challenged both the sufficiency and the impartiality of the investigation by both the bank and the police, and highlighted for the jury’s consideration what was said to be the flawed system of document management in the bank’s internal systems. While I do not regard these matters as of themselves justifying my refusing to consider the application at all pursuant to s 79(3)(a) of the Act, they are relevant to the determination of the application for an inquiry into the conviction for reasons which I will return to later in this judgment.  
     
      
    16 On the other hand, since there was no application for leave to appeal against sentence, I am satisfied pursuant to s 79(3)(a)(ii) that I should refuse to consider further that part of the application that concerns sentence. 
     
      
      The Crown case in summary 
      
    17 The Crown’s case against the applicant at trial was that Mrs Doreen Loder, a customer of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) at Tweed City, the branch where the applicant was the Branch Manager, had instructed the applicant to invest the proceeds of a cheque in her favour in the sum of $78,303.08. The Crown case was that the applicant did not follow these instructions and that he negotiated the cheque and ultimately used the proceeds for his own purposes in breach of s 178A of the Crimes Act. The elements of that offence are that the accused collected or received money upon terms that required him to, inter alia, account for the whole and/or part of that money to any person and that he fraudulently misappropriated, to his own use, the whole or any part of that money. 
     
      
    18 It was not in contest that in September 2001 Mrs Loder received a trust account cheque drawn on the National Australia Bank (NAB) (Murwillumbah Branch) representing the proceeds of sale of a unit she owned in a retirement village. Furthermore, it was not in contest that the trust account cheque was in the sum of $78,303.08 and that it was presented for payment at the Tweed Heads branch of the CBA on 3 October 2001 when eight bank cheques in the amount of $8600 were issued together with an amount of cash. It was also not in issue that these cheques were in turn presented for payment at the Tweed Heads branch of the CBA and that in each case the cheques were negotiated for cash. 
     
      
      The applicant’s case in summary 
       
      
    19 The applicant’s case at trial was that he had initially received the cheque from Mrs Loder at the retirement village where she was a resident on 2 October 2001 with instructions to invest the money in a term deposit for 12 months, but that he received a telephone call from Mrs Loder on the following day advising the applicant that she did not wish to go ahead with the investment. The applicant claimed he returned the cheque to her by again attending on her at the retirement village for that purpose. He said that he requested Mrs Loder return the receipt that he had given to her the previous day but that she was unable to find it. The applicant’s case was that the cheque was then delivered to the bank by a third person, endorsed by Mrs Loder and together with written instructions from her to pay the proceeds of the cheque to eight people by way of eight bank cheques in given amounts and to provide the balance in cash. He claimed he followed these instructions and that he gave the bank cheques to this same person together with the cash. He further claims that from time to time over a four-week period he authorised the cashing of these same cheques when the eight payees presented the cheques for payment. He gave evidence that the payees made arrangements with him in advance of them attending the bank so that he could authorise the cashing of the cheques. 
     
      
      The evidence at trial 
       
      
    20 Mrs Loder died at Tweed Heads on 17 February 2002. Mr Gordon Salier, a solicitor and the husband of Mrs Loder’s niece, sought a grant of probate as solicitor acting for the executor of her will. Probate was granted on 10 March 2004. Mr Salier also received Mrs Loder’s possessions from Therese Hawkey (Mrs Loder’s general Power of Attorney). Amongst Mrs Loder’s possessions, Mr Salier found a receipt dated 3 October 2001 issued by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) for $78,303.08 recording the fact that the amount of $78,303.08 was to be placed on a 12-month deposit at 4.35 per cent interest per annum (Exhibit C). The receipt bears the applicant’s signature.21 Shortly after Mrs Loder’s death, in a letter dated 26 February 2002 (Exhibit D), Mr Salier requested payment for funeral expenses from one of Mrs Loder’s accounts. Mr Salier further requested that the bank itemise all of her assets and liabilities. In a letter dated 5 March 2002 (Exhibit E), the applicant confirmed that the funeral accounts had been paid and that the CBA would forward a Certificate of Balance to assist Mr Salier with his application for a grant of probate. 
     
      
    22 On 25 March 2002, the Deceased’s Estates section of the CBA provided Mr Salier an itemised list of Mrs Loder’s assets and liabilities (Exhibit G). In an unsigned letter dated 5 June 2002 (Exhibit H) and addressed to the Deceased’s Estates section of the CBA, Mr Salier referred to what he regarded as errors in this account of Mrs Loder’s assets. Firstly, he noted that an amount invested on 2 February 2001, itemised as $19,000, was in fact $26,000 (this discrepancy is not relevant to Mr Higgins’ charge). Mr Salier also noted that the $78,303.08 deposit, the subject of the receipt found in Mrs Loder’s possessions was not included in the account of assets. Mr Salier supplied a copy of the receipt.  
     
      
    23 Ms Jennifer Ann Kelly, manager of the Deceased’s Estates section, requested her staff investigate the matter (Exhibit T). In a fax to Ms Kelly, dated 14 June 2002 (Exhibit U), the applicant explained that the interim receipt was issued by him but that Mrs Doreen Loder later changed her mind about the investment. In her evidence at trial, Ms Kelly stated that she telephoned the applicant to confirm his account of events. Ms Kelly made contemporaneous notes of this conversation on the fax dated 14 June 2002 (Exhibit U). 
     
      
    24 Ms Kelly then wrote to Mr Salier on 18 June 2002 (Exhibit K) and advised that the bank was unable to identify an investment of $78,303.08. The letter also reports that as a result of inquiries made by the bank, the applicant’s account was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “…called to see Mrs Loder at the nursing home after work and she gave him a cheque to invest in a Term Deposit. Mr Higgins issued an interim receipt for the amount however Mrs Loder contacted Mr Higgins the next day prior to the investment being processed and advised she did not wish to go ahead with the investment. The cheque was returned to Mrs Loder.  
        Mr Higgins has no further knowledge of how the cheque may have been negotiated 
        ” (emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    25 In a letter to Mr Salier dated 3 July 2002 (Exhibit L), the applicant claimed that he could not recall the full details of the circumstances surrounding the issue of the receipt, and that when Mrs Loder indicated that she had changed her mind regarding the term deposit investment she was unable to locate the receipt. He also claimed no recall of any details regarding the cheque or whether and in what circumstances it had been negotiated.  
     
      
    26 The Crown case was that this was a false account and, moreover, that his inability to recall in July 2002 the transactions recalled in detail some months later was because he was hopeful at that time that the executor would not press the bank for recovery of the proceeds of the cheque and that in this way his criminal conduct would not be revealed. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    27 Mr Salier, however, did persist in his inquiries of the applicant and in a letter dated 13 September 2002 (Exhibit M), he drew attention to the fact that the amount of $78,303.08 represented the net proceeds of sale of the unit in the Terranora Retirement Village, that Messrs Hynes & McCormack acted for her in the sale, that they had provided her with a trust account cheque in the sum of $78,303.08 and that it was presented for payment through the CBA. Mr Salier provided the applicant with a copy of the cheque endorsed by Mrs Loder and date stamped by the CBA. Mr Salier correctly noted that it appeared that the cheque could not have been returned to Mrs Loder, as the applicant contended, because the cheque was clearly presented for payment. He observed that if another cheque were drawn by the Commonwealth Bank by way of refunding Mrs Loder then it would be expected that the bank would have relevant details of that transaction and would be in a position to identify whether the cheque presented for payment was a replacement cheque. 
     
      
    28 In a letter dated 17 September 2002 (Exhibit N), the applicant assured Mr Salier that a request had been made for details of the transaction from the CBA’s record centre and that the information would be forwarded once it was at hand. Notably, Exhibit M did not trip the applicant’s memory of the course of his dealing with Mrs Loder’s cheque, his receipt of her detailed written instructions via the agency of a third person and the manner in which he discharged those instructions. 
     
      
    29 In a letter dated 14 October 2002 (Exhibit O), Mr Salier expressed concern about the delay in receiving the information he sought and the fact that it was delaying the issue of the grant of probate.  
     
      
    30 By letter dated 16 October 2002 (Exhibit P), the applicant confirmed that the cheque was negotiated at the Tweed City Branch and advised for the first time that the proceeds were dispersed by way of eight bank cheques, each valued at $8600, to nominated payees with $9459.88 paid in cash, and the remaining $43.20 paid as bank fees. The applicant stated in this letter that he now recalled Mrs Loder’s instructions to disperse the funds in this manner and that she endorsed the reverse side of the trust account cheque in his presence.31 In a letter dated 28 October 2002 (Exhibit Q), Mr Salier reported that his wife (Mrs Loder’s niece) had considered the names in which the cheques were drawn and could offer no explanation as to who they were or their relationship with her aunt, including the putative payees T Loder and D Loder who might reasonably be thought to be relatives of Mrs Loder. The payee noted as “J Parker” was known to Mrs Loder’s Power of Attorney but upon enquiry, that person said that they did not receive or present a cheque for payment. Mr Salier also expressed the view that given Mrs Loder’s age and circumstances, she would have no need for $9459.99 in cash and that no significant amount of cash was located on her death. 
     
      
    32 In a letter dated 1 November 2002 (Exhibit R), the applicant stated that another request for further information from the CBA’s record centre had been made. In a further letter dated 19 November 2002 (Exhibit S), he confirmed that the bank cheques were presented by the named payees but advised that National Privacy Principles and industry privacy codes restricted him from providing personal details of the payees. In his record of interview he conceded that he did not seek confirmation from the bank’s Head Office that the bank should adopt this position. 
     
      
    Cashing of bank cheques 
     
      
    33 The following are the names of the various payees: B Hickey, M Smidt, T Loder, D Loder, D Brown, J Parker, A Bennett and P Wilson. Notably, each has a single initial only preceding the surname. The evidence at trial established that the applicant issued one bank cheque in the name of B Hickey and that Ms Terese Dalzell, a bank teller, was directed by the applicant to issue the remaining seven bank cheques. All bank cheques were valued at $8600. After the bank cheques were prepared, Ms Dalzell gave the seven cheques she had drawn to the applicant who claimed that he then passed them on to the payees through the agency of the same third person who claimed to be acting on Mrs Loder’s behalf. In his evidence the applicant said (T365/34-50): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So what’s occurred is that Ms Dalzell, the teller… 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. … Has prepared the bank cheques? 
         
        A. Correct. 
         
         
        Q. What happens then? 
         
        A. The bank cheques were returned and handed to the person that had bought in the letter of authority. Terese handed me back the letter of authority and the – there was a cash amount, I believe it was over $9000 was placed in an envelope from Terese, and that was also handed to the person that had presented the cheque. 
         
         
        Q. What happened next? 
         
        A. That person left the branch and that was the end of that transaction at that point.” 
        
       
      
    34 The applicant was unable to supply any information that might have enabled this person to be identified. He was unable to specify whether the person was a male or a female. The letter of authority was not located. He claimed no knowledge of any of the payees. In addition, neither Mrs Loder’s carers, family members or her Power of Attorney knew of any person to whom she might have entrusted the task of having the cheque negotiated under her written instructions. 
     
      
    35 Under cross-examination the applicant explained the dispersal of cheques on 3 October 2001 in the following way (T445/44-T446/2): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Well the question was this, you allowed in essence, $78,000 worth of cash to walk out that door in the hand of someone you’d never seen before? 
         
        A. Not someone, nine different people, there’s a difference, big difference. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yeah sorry, my fault, going back to when the cheques were issued to this person or given to this person? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s what you allowed to happen isn’t it? 
         
        A. I allowed $9,000 odd cash to walk out that door and I allowed eight bank cheques issued to different people for $8,600, that’s what left the door that day.” 
        
       
      
    36 And later (T447/41-46): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you take these cheques, did you turn them over and did you sign them on the back purporting to be the signature of the payees? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, no I have never signed the back of any of those cheques.  
        What I did with those cheques was to hand them over to your third person and the cheques left the office.”  
        (emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    37 The Branch Telling Systems transaction documents (or BTS documents) indicate that the eight bank cheques were issued on 3 October 2001. Mrs Dalzell gave evidence that the applicant informed her that the purchaser of the bank cheques was Mrs Loder and that the payees were people who had worked for Mrs Loder. The applicant disputes this aspect of Mrs Dalzell’s evidence. Nevertheless, her evidence was available to the jury and, if accepted, it might have been used by them as evidence of the efforts to which the applicant went to give verisimilitude to the fraudulent scheme which he had designed to obtain access to the funds represented by the cheque. 
     
      
    38 Ms Dalzell also gave evidence at trial as to the procedure for the issue of bank cheques. She informed the court that bank tellers sold bank cheques to customers of the bank by either drawing money from their existing CBA account(s) or by the tender of cash. The top portion of a bank cheque is the receipt for the purchaser. The bottom portion is the bank cheque drawn in favour of a nominated payee. A carbonised document, described as the credit portion, is located underneath the bank cheque and this is where the teller usually writes the details of the purchaser (such as account number or name). After the bank cheque is sold to the purchaser/customer, the credit portion is sent to the bank’s operation centre in Sydney. Under normal circumstances a bank cheque cannot be cashed, but is deposited to the payee’s account. If a customer wishes to cash a bank cheque, the branch manager must give the teller his/her approval. As I have noted, in respect of each of the eight bank cheques purportedly drawn on Mrs Loder’s instructions, the applicant was the source of approval for the cashing of the cheque. 
     
      
    39 The evidence at trial showed that various tellers cashed the eight bank cheques as follows: 
     
      
      (i) Mrs Lee Marree Plant cashed the J Parker bank cheque in the amount of $8600 (Exhibit CC) on 4 October 2001 at 11:36 am (see BTS doc, Exhibit PP). Mrs Plant stated in her evidence (T172/24-39): 
       
        
        “Q. Just indicate what you mean by when the cheque was presented? 
         
        A. Well Graham has brought the cheque to me and just said, “Can we cash this?” and that’s – I don’t recall handing the money or anything like that, or what I would’ve given out but I just – I do recall sort of having a – Jeff Parker and no, it was, no, and that was it, the conversation – it wasn’t actually a conversation but it was just you know, that was a person who came to my mind when I saw the J Parker. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you said something to the accused who’d brought you the cheque? 
         
        A. Yeah I just said, “Oh, Jeff Parker”, and that was you know, no, it was left at that, nothing more was said about it.” 
         
        
       
      (ii) Ms Danielle Joanne Williams (lead teller) cashed the D Brown bank cheque in the amount of $8600 (Exhibit BB) on 5 October 2001 at 12:33 pm (see BTS doc, Exhibit MM). 
       
       
      (iii) Ms Kim Maree Dixon cashed the M Smidt bank cheque in the amount of $8600 (Exhibit Y) on 8 October 2001 at 12:39 pm (see also BTS doc, Exhibit WW). 
       
       
      (iv) Ms Danielle Joanne Williams also cashed the T Loder and D Loder bank cheques, both in the amount of $8600 (Exhibits Z and AA respectively) on 12 October 2001 at 3:47 pm (see BTS doc, Exhibit LL). 
       
       
      (v) Mrs Ann Marion Kirkman cashed the B Hickey bank cheque in the amount of $8600 (Exhibit X) on 16 October 2001 at 2:26 pm (see also BTS doc, Exhibit JJ). (This cheque is of particular significance in the Crown case as it bears an endorsement that resembles the name of the applicant). 
       
       
      (vi) Mr Darryl Craig Manning cashed the P Wilson bank cheque in the amount of $8600 (Exhibit EE) on 25 October 2001 at 3:31 pm (see BTS doc, Exhibit QQ). 
       
       
      (vii) Mr Craig Turner cashed the A Bennett cheque in the amount of $8600 but was unable to be contacted for the purposes of the trial. The Crown relied on BTS document, Exhibit AAA, to verify this. 
        
      (The applicant draws attention to Mr Turner’s unavailability as a matter of significance in his application. I will consider that matter later in this judgment). 
       
      
    40 It is of considerable importance, and of considerable weight, in the Crown case that it appears that none of the eight payees presented themselves to the tellers but that the applicant arranged for the cashing of the bank cheques effectively on their behalf. 
     
      
    41 At trial, the Crown called a Mr Robert Bruce Hickey, a Mr Clive Anthony Bennett and a Mrs Marlene Smidt. They all gave evidence that they never received a bank cheque for $8600. In addition, the Crown read a statement by a Mr John Parker in which he also denied receiving a cheque. 
     
      
       
      Bank Authority Files 
       
      
    42 Mr William van Beurden, a fraud investigator with the CBA, gave evidence that Mrs Loder’s Authorities File (Exhibit FFF) contained her general power of attorney in favour of Therese Hawkey, but that it did not contain any written instructions for the issue of eight bank cheques each in the sum of $8600 and a sum of cash. He gave evidence that he would have expected to see documentation in the file supporting transactions of this kind, and that its absence was all the more surprising when the applicant claimed to have received Mrs Loder’s written instructions to disperse the proceeds of the trust account cheque in a particular way. In a record of interview conducted by CBA investigators, the applicant claimed that Mrs Loder’s instructions were in her “special file” and that such a file may have been transferred to old records. 
     
      
    43 Mr Van Beurden gave evidence that he had not heard of “special files” but conceded that such files may exist as “pending files” or files pertaining to specific accounts such as loan accounts. In any event, neither the special file, pending file nor the applicant’s diary was found at Wacol’s Record Centre in Queensland (old storage). In cross-examination, Mr Van Beurden accepted that he had not personally conducted a search at Wacol and that he was unable to comment on the standard of record-keeping at Wacol. 
     
      
    44 Mr Evan Griffith Davis gave evidence in relation to the procedure adopted by the bank for the disposal of old records. He stated in his evidence that documents described as “authorities” would be filed in “Authority Files”. According to the evidence of Ms Jo-Ann Francis Stamm, the retention period for such files was seven years. She gave further evidence that the retention period for Manager’s Diaries was also seven years and that these diaries were used by Managers to record clients’ instructions and arrangements pertaining to the operation of their accounts. Notably, the applicant’s diary could not be found. 
     
      
       
      Enrichment of the applicant 
       
      
    45 The Crown led detailed evidence of the applicant’s enrichment at about the time of the cashing of the bank cheques. It was submitted that this added weight to the Crown case as an additional item of circumstantial evidence.46 On 5 October 2001, Ms Anje Lee Craft issued a pink staff cheque to the applicant valued at $1800 (Exhibit RR) (see BTS doc, Exhibit SS). On 22 October 2001, she issued two cheques valued at $1900 (Exhibit TT) and $1855 (Exhibit UU) both drawn to a “B Stead” in favour of “Awning Designs”. The BTS document (Exhibit VV) for these transactions indicate the imposition of a $5.40 bank fee that would not be charged to staff members. However, the BTS document also shows that these cheques were issued at 8:50 am when regular customers would not have had access to the bank. Mrs Bertha Stead, who was called to give evidence for the Crown, stated that she had not purchased cheques in favour of Awning Designs. She gave evidence, however, that she once lived at the address recorded on the credit portions of the bank cheques and that the applicant lived next door. 
     
      
    47 The Crown also called Mr Karsten Wulf who traded as “Awning Designs”. He gave evidence that he entered into a contract on 12 October 2001 to construct a patio roof for the applicant. He provided a quote on 5 October 2001. The terms of the contract required the applicant to pay a $1800 deposit at the time of signing, $1900 upon arrival of all materials, and $1850 upon practical completion. The applicant tendered bank cheques in these amounts. 
     
      
    48 Also on 5 October 2001, the applicant deposited $3000 cash into an account in the name of his brother, Neil Higgins. The Crown called Mr Neil Higgins who stated that he had requested a loan from the applicant in order that he and his wife could start a bistro business at the Dungog RSL Club. The applicant gave an entirely different explanation for this transaction in his record of interview, claiming that his wife had come to the bank with 30 $100 notes. 
     
      
    49 On 12 October 2001, the applicant purchased a cheque for $800 in favour of Virtual Communities (no fee was charged). 
     
      
    50 On 16 October 2001, Ms Kirkman issued a bank cheque to a “Bob Hickey” for $8000 in favour of Dicksons Ltd (see cheque and BTS doc, Exhibit KK). In cross-examination, it was put to Ms Kirkman that she may have incorrectly recorded the name Bob Hickey instead of the applicant’s name. However, she stated that if a staff member had asked for a bank cheque she would have added a staff number next to the name of the purchaser. 
     
      
    51 The Crown called Ms Elizabeth Winters, the branch manager of a company called Ord Minnett Ltd, formerly Dixons Ltd (Dicksons Ltd). She confirmed that the applicant opened an account under his name on 18 October 2001. She gave further evidence that on that date he purchased 1000 Telstra shares and 20,000 Austair shares for a total cost of $10,338.40 and that he paid using a cheque for $8000 and $2317.77 in cash. The outstanding balance of $20.63 was paid on 24 October 2001. Ms Winters gave evidence that she had no record of any transactions with a Bob Hickey. 
     
      
    52 The applicant could not provide an explanation for the cheque being purchased under the name of Bob Hickey. In his evidence he stated the following (T375/33): 
     
      
       
        
        “A. Well the only thing we can say with any certainty is that it’s not my handwriting that’s recorded it and I haven’t instructed any other officer to record those details. I know from looking at the cheque that the issuing officer was Anne Kirkman. Anne was a teller on probation at that time. I know she did indicate that she was off probation at that time but she wasn’t. Her error rate was particularly high at that point. I think she simply must’ve got confused because…” (T375). 
         
        
       
      
    53 It also transpires from the evidence that 14 minutes before Ms Kirkman issued the bank cheque in favour of Dicksons Ltd, she had cashed the B Hickey bank cheque.54 The Crown also called the applicant’s mother who had apparently given the applicant $25,000 in August 2000 in the form of an inheritance cheque. Mrs Higgins had asked her son to take care of the money until she needed it from time to time. 
     
      
       
      The present application 
       
      
    55 A substantial amount of material has been received from the applicant in support of his application. A great deal of it was repetitive. Submissions were also sought and received from the Crown Solicitor’s Office. The applicant’s submissions in support of his application are dealt with as they appear under each heading in his application. The submissions often do not correspond to the headings under which they appear.Inadequate investigation56 The applicant’s first submission is that the NSW Police did not conduct an independent investigation, but uncritically adopted the investigation by the bank contained in the record of interview with the applicant on 8 September 2003. In support of this submission, the applicant cites a CBA Fraud File Report in which Mr Van Beurden states: “Investigating Police from Tweed Heads will attend Group Security on 29/09/03 and will accept our formal complaint regarding Mr Higgins’ processing of the cheque.” This aspect of the applicant’s grievance was addressed by Hoeben J in the applicant’s appeal to the CCA (at par 39): 
     
      
       
        
        “What is decisive in my opinion is the adoption by the appellant of the bank interview when he was interviewed by the police on 18 November 2003. On that occasion the appellant was given a full caution. He spoke to his solicitor before participating in the police interview. In the course of that interview he suggested to the interviewing officers that there was no point in them asking him further questions about how Mrs Loder’s cheque was dealt with since he had already been comprehensively questioned on that subject by the bank investigators. He told the interviewing police officers that he accepted that the interview with the bank was correct and he did not wish to alter the content. The interviewing officers gave him the opportunity of re-reading his bank interview and again he adopted it as accurate.” 
         
        
       
      
    57 The applicant next takes issue with the fact that he was never fully questioned about his investments outside the CBA. To the extent that these matters are material to the question of enrichment, it is my view that they were sufficiently addressed in the CBA record of interview and summarised in a report compiled by Mr Van Beurden, dated 11 September 2003. They were the subject of evidence at trial. It was for the applicant to fully instruct his counsel on all matter material to his defence. There is no suggestion that counsel was other than fully briefed and that he vigorously and ably conducted the applicant’s trial. 
     
      
    58 The applicant submits that residents and staff at the retirement village were never fully questioned. For example, the applicant draws attention to the fact that people who may have escorted Mrs Loder from the retirement village to the funeral of her sister, Margaret Loder, at Tweed Heads on 3 October 2001, may have persuaded her to not go ahead with the investment. The applicant complains that these people were never questioned. The applicant also draws my attention to two named visitors received by Mrs Loder after the applicant collected the cheque from her on 2 October 2001. The applicant submits that these people were never questioned and that they may have assisted in supporting his contention that Mrs Loder changed her mind in relation to the investment after he attended on her. I am not persuaded that this has any material bearing on the application. The investigators are not charged with the responsibility of pursuing every conceivable avenue that may be productive of support for the defence case. The applicant does not explain what, if any, steps he took to make contact with the two named individuals or why he failed to make inquiries that he thought may advance his case.59 The applicant submits that investigators did not conduct a thorough search of CBA bank records stored at Wacol Record Centre in Queensland. He submits that were a full and proper search to have been undertaken, the critical letter of instruction and his diarised notes of his communication with Mrs Loder and notes of his vetting of the personal details of the payees and/or any documents of identification, would or should have been found. An email sent by Cheryl Small to Barry Howe (Area Manager), dated 18 July 2003 states that, “I have checked files (there doesn’t appear to be the full year in the box) and requested Wacol to check some other boxes we sent in June but we have been unable to locate any information other than a letter from a solicitor advising us of the death of one of the beneficiaries.” This email was tendered by the applicant’s counsel at trial and became Exhibit 5.60 The applicant submits that investigators did not intend to conduct a thorough search of CBA records held at Wacol Record Centre in Queensland. This is supported by an email sent by Julie Benfer (Group Investigations of CBA) to Barry Howe (Area Manager of CBA) dated 18 September 2001 in which it is stated: “It is not our intention to do a search of Wacol however you may have some ideas of what else should be covered or reviewed to try and locate this file.” Another email sent by Angelique Rodway to William van Beurden dated 13 October 2003 states that, “To search the 51 boxes held at Wacol will cost $45 per hour”. The applicant submits that this search was not conducted.61 If there was a failure by investigating authorities to conduct a full and proper search for documentary evidence that is regrettable but, in my view, not fatal to the Crown’s case. Neither does it raise doubts or questions as to the conviction. The Crown’s case was that there never were documents of the kind the applicant contends. Furthermore, the jury were entitled to give little weight to this aspect of the defence case in circumstances where the accused’s account of his conduct in dealing with the unidentified person who first produced the endorsed cheque for processing with the letter of instruction and then later his dealings with each of the eight payees was, at the very least, irregular and his explanations unpersuasive. 
     
      
    62 The applicant also complains that the search for the payees of the eight bank cheques was inadequate. In his letter to Mr Bruce Barbour (NSW Ombudsman), the applicant states that a concerted investigation for the payees would have included searches of the electoral roll, Centrelink records, RTA records, Medicare records, Australian Tax Office records, on-line telephone records, Terranora Valley Nursing Home records and “family searches”. The evidence of Detective Don Townley: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you make general inquiries as to the existence of M Smidts? 
         
        A. Just through the phone book for that area, the Tweed Gold Coast phone book, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And were you able to locate any in the phone book? 
         
        A. None with the exact spelling Smidt I don’t believe. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you did speak to a Marlene Smidt? 
         
        A. Yes I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And she had the spelling Smidt is that so? 
         
        A. Yes she did.” 
        
       
      
    63 The applicant submits that there are several listings in phone books for the name “Smidt”. In his application the applicant included copies from various white pages sources: Lismore District (36 listings); Gold Coast (two listings in 2002/2003 and three listings in 2003/2004). Copies were also included for listings of the surname “Loder”. This, however, ignores the fact that persons with the same surname and initial of the payees and who were known or affiliated with Mrs Loder were called at trial. They all denied receiving a cheque. 
     
      
    64 The applicant also takes issue with the fact that investigators did not question Craig Turner, described by the applicant as the most experienced teller involved in the cheque transactions. I note that Mr Turner was only responsible for cashing the A Bennett cheque, which the Crown confirmed by reference to BTS document (Exhibit AAA). It is not at all clear what evidence Mr Turner might have given that would advance the applicant’s case since it is his case that he dealt with each of the payees in the way I have described, a feature of the case which renders the Crown case strong to the point of overwhelming. Not only did the payees all want their cheques cashed (as distinct from the cheques being deposited to their accounts) but they each approached the applicant directly, seemingly by pre-arrangement, rather than presenting at a teller, in circumstances where it is unclear how they would have known that authorisation from the Branch Manager was required. In each case the applicant authorised the cheques to be cashed without knowing the payee previously. He claimed that he satisfied himself as to the identity of the payees but he could provide no details as to how he did this and neither his diary nor any notes were available. It was for this reason that none of the tellers were asked in cross-examination to try to recall the payee or even to confirm that the payee was referred by them to the applicant.65 The final matter that the applicant draws attention to is the endorsement on the back of the B Hickey cheque. He contends that the signature seems to have been altered to look like “Higgins” rather than “Hickey” and that the cheque was not in this state during initial investigations performed by the CBA. It was the Crown case that the applicant mistakenly endorsed the cheque in his surname and that he has overwritten Hickey, both to disguise his mistake and to avoid the consequence of the cashing of the cheque having to be abandoned. 
     
      
    66 The investigators, Mr Van Beurden and Mr David Tuohey, conceded under cross-examination that they did not refer to the altered signature in the CBA record of interview. Parts of the transcript are reproduced below: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Van Beurden under cross-examination 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Sir, again please if you’d turn to page 81 of the interview, question 606, now is this your question? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. This question is again a question in relation to exhibit X, is it not? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And to the endorsement on the reverse of the cheque? 
         
        A. Yes 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say to him “Because that writing is quite clear even over the carbonised area”? 
         
        A. Question 606. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes? 
         
        A. Yep, yes.” 
        
       
       
        
        Mr David Tuohey under cross-examination 
        
       
       
        
        “Q. Now please have a look at question 606, you’ll note that there Mr Van Beurden indicates “That writing is quite clear even over the carbonised area”. Now Mr Van Beurden appears to be specifically directing Mr Higgins’ attention to the cheque and the signature? 
         
        A. Yes 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He describes the writing as “quite clear’ doesn’t he? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that a description which you would attach to the signature on the reverse as shown in exhibit X? 
         
        A. Well the writing itself is clear in terms of the ink taking up on the paper but the signature itself obviously looks confused. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you notice that at the time? 
         
        A. I don’t recall seeing the cheque during the interview.” 
        
       
      
    67 Not only was this issue fully argued at trial by counsel for the applicant (doubtless acutely conscious of the Crown’s reliance on it as adding considerable weight to the Crown case) but the matter was also dealt with in the applicant’s own evidence. He went so far as to imply that the cheque had been altered by the Crown Prosecutor or someone in the Crown’s employ to corruptly advance the Crown case against him. He claimed that when a Mr B Hickey presented with the cheque for payment in October 2001, the signature compared with documents bearing his signature and thereby qualified as proof of identity. This issue was the subject of quite intense questioning. The jury ultimately had their attention drawn to the fact that the overwritten signature appeared on a photocopy of the cheque in March 2003, some months before the bank interview. 
     
      
    68 I am not satisfied that any of these matters, whether alone or in combination, raise a doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt or leave me with any sense of disquiet as to the appropriateness of the verdict.  
     
      
      Inaccurate and inconsistent evidence produced at trial 
      
    69 The applicant submits that several initial witnesses who were called at trial gave inaccurate and inconsistent evidence. At the outset it should be emphasised that the purported inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the evidence of the critical witnesses were dealt with at trial by defence counsel both in his cross-examination of crown witnesses and in his address to the jury. Moreover, it was not submitted on appeal that these matters were such as to render the verdict unsafe or unsatisfactory.70 The evidence of Ann Kirkman was scrutinised and heavily criticised by the applicant. Ms Kirkman was the bank teller who cashed the B Hickey bank cheque. Later that day she recorded B Hickey’s name as the purchaser of a bank cheque that the applicant says he purchased in favour of Dicksons Ltd. The transcript reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I’d suggest to you it’s possible you’ve incorrectly recorded the name Bob Hickey as the purchaser of the $8,000 bank cheque? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeah again I don’t remember the transaction, it’s possible but I don’t think I would’ve because I would’ve written a number, a staff number if it was different.” 
        
       
      
    71 In her evidence, Ms Kirkman accepted that telling errors do occur. The applicant’s case was that a B Hickey cashed a bank cheque for $8600 and the applicant purchased a bank cheque in favour of Dicksons Ltd for $8000. The Crown’s case was that the applicant cashed the bank cheque for $8600 and used these funds to purchase a bank cheque in favour of Dicksons Ltd for $8000. Having regard to all the evidence in the trial, including the applicant’s evidence and his cross-examination, the jury were entitled to prefer the evidence of the bank teller and to reject the applicant’s version. In my view, this transaction is compelling evidence of the applicant’s guilt. 72 The applicant also criticises the evidence of Mrs Marlene Smidt. The applicant submits that Mrs Smidt falsely stated in her evidence that she had a falling out with Mrs Loder a few months before she died over a missing “nightie”. Mrs Hawkey gave evidence that the falling out was two months after Mrs Loder had moved into the nursing home in 1999. The applicant submits that this is relevant since the Marlene Smidt who was called at trial is unlikely to have received a cheque from Mrs Loder in circumstances where the two had had a falling out before 3 October 2001 when, he contends, Mrs Loder made a list of beneficiaries to the cheque. The applicant’s case is that there may be another M Smidt who received the bank cheque.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
      Evidence not produced at trial 
      
    73 The applicant complains that bank statements confirming that his mother gave him $25,000 and a solicitor’s letter confirming the source of the funds were never produced. Mrs Higgins was in fact called at trial and gave evidence. Her letter was tendered as Exhibit 6. 
     
      
       
      Fresh evidence 
       
      
    74 The applicant submits that since the conclusion of the trial, fresh evidence has emerged. Most of these issues have already been dealt with and include the fact that Craig Turner, the Zwemmers and people present at Mrs Loder’s funeral were never questioned. 75 The applicant further submits that the print media described the person who presented the cheque as the “mystery woman” and that details were provided to police. He complains that these details were never adduced as evidence at trial. It is difficult to see the basis for the press reporting the gender of the “mysterious” third person since, on the evidence, the only person to have had any dealings with this person was the applicant and he could not recall whether the person was a man or a woman. The applicant does not identify the source of his belief that her details were known to the police.76 The applicant also complains that telephone records of reverse charge phone calls on the CBA Tweed City Branch of Doreen Loder’s phone lines were never obtained. This is, in my view, an effort to deal with the fact that there was no record of Mrs Loder having telephoned the bank on 3 October 2001 wherein he said that her instructions were countermanded. I am not persuaded that the absence of these records is material.77 The applicant submits that further tests are able to be made on the suspect signature found on the reverse side of the B Hickey cheque. The applicant believes that the signature is not in the same state now as it was on 16 October 2001 when he had authorised the cheque to be cashed. This has already been referred to and the assertion that further tests are possible is unsupported by detail. The handwriting evidence was professionally presented by the Crown at trial and the subject of cross-examination. I note again the significance of this evidence in the Crown case.78 The applicant submits that records may be obtained from Wacol Record Centre in Queensland that would indicate which documents have been checked by investigators. This has also been referred to. I simply note, by way of observation, that it was open to the applicant to issue subpoenas for production of this material at trial. The fact that this was not done is not explained. 
     
      
      Determination of the application 
      
    79 The determinative question in this application is whether, having regard to the criticism the applicant makes of the investigation by the CBA and NSW Police and other matters outlined above, there is any doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt. In my view, the strength of the Crown case ameliorates any suggestions that the manner in which the investigation was conducted was defective. In any event, I am not satisfied that these complaints have any substance.80 The evidence at trial establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was in the optimum position to fraudulently endorse Mrs Loder’s bank cheque and to negotiate it by instructing a bank officer to draw the eight cheques and provide the remainder in cash. The circumstances surrounding the cashing of each bank cheque have already been outlined and provide ample further support for the jury’s verdict.81 The strength of the Crown’s circumstantial case against the applicant was considerable. I do not entertain any doubts or questions as to the applicant’s guilt.82 The application is dismissed.

    JUDGMENTIntroduction1 HIS HONOUR: At the close of the Crown case against all three accused applications were made on behalf of two of them that I direct verdicts of acquittal. It was said on behalf of both Mr Campbell and Mr Baka that, taking the Crown case at its highest, the Crown could not prove an essential element of the offences with which they had been charged. The applications were based on submissions regarding the presumption to be found in s307.14 Criminal Code Act (Cth) 1995 (the Code). The jury in this matter are to return to court at 2.00 p.m. today and so I will give judgment immediately in order that the jurors’ journeys have not been wasted.2 Ordinarily there would be two distinct phases to the consideration of this matter. The first concerns a finding of law as to whether the Crown is entitled to take advantage of the presumption where, as here, the two relevant accused are charged as aiders and abettors. The second phase is whether, even if the Crown is not so entitled, these cases are fit to go to the jury. 3 However, in this case, the Crown concedes that if it is not entitled to take advantage of the presumption in the cases of Mr Campbell and Mr Baka, then verdicts of acquittal in relation to them should be directed.4 Much of the Crown case is not in dispute. What follows is a short summary of the evidence led in the Crown case in order that the decision I have to make regarding whether there is a case fit to go to the jury for Mr Campbell and Mr Baka can be put in its proper context.The Facts5 Mrs Belinda Campbell ran a furniture retail business. She obtained her stock from Indonesia. It was thus necessary for her to periodically import shipping container loads of furniture and household goods for resale.6 On 17 June 2006 a container of furniture was delivered to Mrs Campbell’s business premises. It had been imported into Australia from Indonesia. By the time it was delivered the authorities had a well organised operation in place involving surveillance of that container, as well as Mrs Campbell and Mr Campbell. They had been alerted to the presence of things other than the furniture in the container when the container was X-rayed and an anomaly found.7 At one end, the end furthest from the doors to the container, the X-ray revealed the presence of items which were not furniture or household goods. Further investigations of that anomaly revealed that, as well as furniture and household goods, the container had within it many boxes of Sudafed and Actifed tablets. These tablets contained pseudoephedrine which is a border controlled precursor. The evidence established that pseudoephedrine was a very much sought after drug by those who wish to produce methylamphetamine or methylamphetamine hydrochloride.8 In those circumstances a controlled delivery proceeded, with many officers from both the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Federal Police performing surveillance duties. What they observed was that after the container was delivered to Mrs Campbell’s business premises, Mr and Mrs Campbell, and others, began to remove some or all of the furniture and household items from the container. By the time they had finished on the day the container was delivered the packages containing the Sudafed and Actifed tablets had not been removed. They remained in place in the container until Mr Baka arrived, together with another man, in a truck the following day. With Mr Campbell and the other man, Mr Baka removed the boxes of Sudafed and Actifed tablets from the container, put them in the truck and drove away. Mr Baka was arrested shortly after, as were Mr and Mrs Campbell. The Relevant Statutory Provisions9 Mrs Campbell is facing trial for an offence under s307.11 of the Code. It is in the following terms:307.11 Importing and Exporting Commercial Quantities of Border Controlled Precursors 
     
      
      (1) a person commits an offence if: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) the person imports or exports a substance; and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) either or both of the following apply: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (i)the person intends to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug; 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (ii)the person believes that another person intends to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug; and 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) the substance is a border controlled precursor, and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (d) the quantity imported or exported is a commercial quantity. 
         
        
       
      
    10 There is no dispute that as far as Mrs Campbell is concerned the Crown is entitled to rely on the provisions of s307.14 which provides for a presumption in relation to one aspect of what the Crown has to prove for the offence under s307.11. Section 307.14 is in the following terms:307.14 Presumption for Importing and Exporting Border Controlled Precursors 
     
      
      (1)For the purposes of proving an offence against this Subdivision, if: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) a person has imported or exported a substance; and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) a law of the Commonwealth required the import or export to be authorised (however described); and  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) the import or export was not so authorised; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      the person is taken to have imported or exported the substance with the intention of using some or all of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug. 
      
     
     
      
      (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the person proves that he or she did not have that intention 
      
     
     
      
      (3) For the purposes of proving an offence against this Subdivision, if: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) a person has imported or exported a substance; and  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) the law of the Commonwealth required the import or export to be authorised (however described): and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) the import or export was not so authorised; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      the person is taken to have imported or exported the substance believing that another person intends to use some or all of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug. 
      
     
     
      
      (4) Subsection (3) does not apply if the person proves that he or she did not have that belief. 
      
    11 As I mentioned, there is no dispute that s 307.14 applies to the case involving Mrs Campbell. What is in dispute, and the issue of law that I have to resolve, is whether that presumption also applies to the case of those charged as aiders and abettors such as Mr Campbell and Mr Baka? Aiders and abettors are dealt with in the Code in s11.2 in the following terms: Complicity and common purpose 
     
      
      (1) A person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence by an other person is taken to have committed that offence and is punishable accordingly. 
      
     
     
      
      (2) For the person to be guilty: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) the person’s conduct must have in fact aided, abetted, counselled or procured the commission of the offence by the other person; and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) the offence must have been committed by the other person. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (3) For that person to be guilty, the person must have intended that: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) his or her conduct would aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of any offence (including its fault elements) of the type the other person committed; or 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) his or her conduct would aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of an offence and have been reckless about the commission of the offence (including its fault elements) that the other person in fact committed. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (3A) Subsection (3) has effect subject to subsection (6) 
      
     
     
      
      (4) A person cannot be found guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of an offence if, before the offence was committed, the person: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) terminated his or her involvement 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) took all reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the offence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (5) A person may be found guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of an offence even if the principal offender has not been prosecuted or has not been found guilty. 
      
     
     
      
      (6) Any special liability provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of that offence. 
      
     
     
      
      (7) If the trier of fact is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a person either 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) is guilty of a particular offence otherwise than because of the operation of subsection (1); 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) is guilty of that offence because of the operation of subsection (1);  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      but is not able to determine which, the trier of fact may nonetheless find the person guilty of that offence.  
      
    12 The “special liability provision” phrase as it is used in s6 is defined in the Code dictionary. The definition appears later in this judgment.Does The Rebuttable Presumption Apply To Aiders And Abettors?13 Before turning to the legislation in some detail, I will note immediately a curiosity which would arise if, as the Crown has submitted, it is entitled to rely on the presumption in the case of an aider and abettor. It is to be emphasised that the presumption in s307.14 is a rebuttable presumption. That is, Mrs Campbell will not be found guilty under s307.11 if she proves, on the balance of probabilities, that she did not have the requisite belief or intention. (The Crown case is not that Mrs Campbell intended to manufacture controlled drug but that she believed that others would. For this reason I will refer only to Mrs Campbell’s belief rather than her intentions in the rest of this judgment.)14 Assume that an alleged aider and abettor was facing trial alone. Assume that this was because Mrs Campbell was dead. How then would the aider and abettor overcome the presumption in s307.14?15 Even if there was overwhelming evidence to establish that Mrs Campbell did not believe that the substance she imported was to be used to manufacture a controlled drug, an alleged aider and abettor could not take advantage of that evidence because “the person” referred to in subs 307.14(4) is not him but Mrs Campbell. The Crown has an argument, which I will discuss later, that “the person” could be the aider and abettor facing trial. For reasons I will give later I reject that argument. 16 This raises the distinct but very uncomfortable possibility of Mr Baka or Mr Campbell being convicted of being an aider and abettor to an offence committed by Mrs Campbell where, if Mrs Campbell was facing trial, she would not be so convicted. Both the common law and the Code (see s11.2(2)(b)) suggest that such a result should only come about if the legislation clearly requires it. In my view not only does the legislation not clearly require that result but it clearly requires the opposite. There are a number of reasons for that conclusion. The Precision Of The Definition Of ""Special Liability Provision""17 Section 11.2(6) provides that 
     
      
       
      “any special liability provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of that offence.” 
      
    18 It is the Crown’s argument that the reverse onus provision in s307.14 is a special liability provision and so the reverse onus provision applies to aiders and abettors. 19 The term special liability provision is defined in the dictionary to the code. The definition is – 
     
      
      (a) A provision that provides that absolute liability applies to one or more (but not all) of the physical elements of an offence: or 
       
      (b) A provision that provides that, in a prosecution for an offence, it is not necessary to prove that the defendant knew a particular thing: or 
       
      (c) A provision that provides that, in a prosecution for an offence, it is not necessary to prove that the defendant knew or believed a particular thing. 
      
    20 Paragraph (a) of the definition can be put to one side immediately. Absolute liability is not at issue here. The first thing to notice about the definition is the very curious but precise wording of paras (b) and(c). Para (b) refers to the situation where it is not necessary to prove that the defendant “knew” a particular thing. Para (c) does not refer to the situation where the defendant “believed” a particular thing. It refers instead to the situation where it is not necessary to prove that the defendant “knew or believed” a particular thing. Thus, to make the point obvious, the concept of it being not necessary to prove that the defendant “knew” something appears in both paras (b) and (c). 21 What is the explanation for such precise but, at first blush, curious drafting? The obvious answer is that the definition of “special liability provision” applies only to those provisions which refer precisely to situations where it would be otherwise necessary to prove that the defendant “knew” something or he “knew or believed” something. 22 Compare the concept to be found in s307.14. It does not deal with either of those states of mind. It does not deal with the state of mind of knowledge and it does not deal with the state of mind of knowledge or belief. It deals only with the state of mind of belief. Lest it be thought that this is an overly precise distinction to draw, it is to be noted that the definition of special liability provision is itself very precisely drawn.23 So the first reason that I have decided that the Crown cannot take advantage of the reverse onus provision in s307.14 is that that provision is not a “special liability provision” within the meaning of that term as defined in the dictionary. Thus s11.2(6) does not apply s307.14 to the case of an aider and abettor.24 The Crown suggested that I should read the phrase “knew or believed” in para (c) of the definition disjunctively. He pointed out that the concept of knowledge or belief as raised in para (c) of the definition of special liability provision was far from widespread in the code. The Crown pointed to s132.1(2A) as being the only place, apart from the intoxication provisions in part 8.4, where the phrase words “knew or believed” appear. However an examination of that provision, that is s132.1(2A), is instructive and in fact, in my view, supports an argument put by Mr Bromwich who appeared for Mr Campbell which was adopted by Mr Steel who appeared for Mr Baka. It is to be noted that the s132.1(2A) provides that it is not necessary to prove knowledge or belief that the property received belonged to a Commonwealth entity. 25 The narrowness of this provision supports the point Mr Bromwich makes about the use to which special liability provisions are to be put: They are designed to facilitate proof of subsidiary elements which are necessary to ground Commonwealth jurisdiction. The fact that the words “knew or believed” appear in a provision relating to the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth supports Mr Bromwich’s submission that special liability provisions do not include those provisions which have a much wider purpose such as s307.14.The Absence Of The Concept Of Intention26 The next reason for finding that the Crown is not entitled to take advantage of the reverse onus provision also requires close examination of the Code. As I mentioned above s307.11, the section which creates the offence, has within it (as one of two alternatives) an element that the person who imports a substance intends to use it to manufacture a controlled drug (although the Crown does not suggest that Mrs Campbell was going to manufacture the drug herself, the fact that the section covers the situation where the person does intend to do that is relevant to determining the legal issue that I am currently considering.) 27 Having established the importance of an intention to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug for the purposes of the offence let me turn to what the definition of “special liability provisions” says about the concept of intention. It says nothing about that concept. The specific concept of intention is not picked up as any part of the definition of “special liability provision”. It is unlikely in the extreme that the legislature would have intended that the special liability provision would have covered the case of an aider and abettor where the Crown is relying on the importer’s belief, but not where the Crown was relying on the importer’s intention. Such an anomaly would be glaring, yet such an anomaly is unavoidable if the reverse onus provision applies to aiders and abettors through s11.2(6). The Crown responded to this argument by attempting to explain to me why the legislature would allow reverse onus to apply where what was at issue was the principal’s belief but not where what was at issue was the principal’s intention. But I was unable to discern any rational reason why that would be the case. 28 Mr Bromwich referred to two different sources of extrinsic material as an aid to the interpretation of the definition of special liability provision. The first was a document entitled the Commonwealth Criminal Code, A Guide for Practitioners, published by the Commonwealth Attorney General’s Department in March 2002. It was prepared by Mr Ian Leader-Elliott who was heavily involved in the work of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee in its efforts to create a new criminal code.29 At p 263 of the document the guide notes,  
     
      
       
      “Special liability provisions have only one purpose in the code. They relieve the prosecution from the need to prove fault with respect to the elements of the offence which establish Commonwealth jurisdiction.”  
      
    30 Those last words are important says Mr Bromwich. In the course of his submissions Mr Bromwich referred to such offences, and as I have noted the Crown referred me to another. One can understand why a reverse onus provision would be necessary in such circumstances. The reverse onus is not necessary in the present case to establish Commonwealth jurisdiction and thus, according to the author of the guide, the definition of “special liability provision” does not apply.31 The other pieces of extrinsic material referred to by Mr Bromwich in support of his submissions were the supplementary explanatory memorandum and the revised explanatory memorandum to the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Bill 2000, that being the Bill, which became the Act, which introduced s 11.2(6) and the concept of the special liability provision.32 Both memoranda suggest that the special liability provision will not be necessary where what is concerned is a “subsidiary element”. It is hard to describe the element of belief that the substance is to be used to manufacture a drug as a “subsidiary element”.33 Further, the supplementary explanatory memorandum gives an example as to where the special liability provision would operate. Para 9 reads:  
     
      
      “It is also proposed that the definition of ‘special liability provision’ include those special provisions which provide that it is not necessary to prove the defendant knew or believed a particular thing. An example of this is proposed in s141.1(2) which concerns bribery. It provides it is not necessary to prove that the defendant knew the official bribe was a Commonwealth public official. The amendments will mean it will not be necessary to prove knowledge about the Commonwealth characteristic of the public official providing the defendant was attempting to bribe a public official of some kind.” 
      
    34 This example is consistent with the view expressed as to the purpose of the concept of a special liability provision in the guide prepared by Mr Leader-Elliott.Conclusion Regarding The Application Of S307.14 To Aiders And Abettors35 I consider that s11.2(6) and the accompanying definition of “special liability provision” should be read according to their terms and not beyond their terms. It is clear that they have been drafted very carefully and that their function is to facilitate the prosecution of people where there would be significant problems of proof. But that is not the present case. There are no significant problems of proving a person’s belief when that belief concerns whether pseudoephedrine or some other precursor is to be used to make methylamphetamine or some other drug. 36 It may make it easier for the prosecution to convict aiders and abettors if the provisions I have been discussing were interpreted as the Crown wants me to, but that can hardly justify the uncomfortable and perhaps even bizarre result which would come about on a trial of an aider and abettor if the person said to be the principal offender were not available or compellable to rebut the presumption in s307(14). 37 In response to the suggestion that an aider and an abettor would have difficulty overcoming the presumption in s307.14 where the principal offender was dead, (the example I raised earlier in this judgment), the Crown said that the special liability provision definition applied such that an alleged aider and abettor was able to prove the belief the principal - that is, the Crown submission was that the relevant provision should be interpreted so that the reference to “the person” in s307.14(4) would be in the example I am discussing, the aider and abettor. 38 However there are two things to be said about that argument. Firstly, the interpretation advanced by the Crown is an uncomfortable one given the words which follow the words “the person”. Subs(4) reads in full, “Subs 3 does not apply if the person proves that he or she did not have that belief” (emphasis added). If the Crown’s argument is correct “the person” is the aider and abettor but “he or she” is the principal. That does a lot of violence to the grammar of subs (4).39 The second thing to say about the Crown’s argument on this aspect is that whilst using the special liability provision to give the aider and abettor the ability to prove the principal’s belief may go some way to alleviate the problems faced by the aider and abettor at trial, it does not overcome the practical problems of proving a person’s belief where that person is not available, perhaps through death, to give that evidence himself or herself. It is likely in fact that the aider and abettor would not even know that such evidence was available.40 The Crown accurately identified a concerned lingering behind this entire argument, namely the concern that those who were not truly morally culpable would be convicted of an offence carrying a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. The Crown pointed out that the fault elements applying to aiders and abettors would prevent those with no moral culpability being convicted. I accept that submission as far as it goes but I remain concerned that the Crown’s argument would allow an aider and abettor to be convicted when the principal should be acquitted.41 There may be no strict legal barrier to that occurring of course but the undesirability of that outcome is a matter which I have taken into account. 42 It is one thing to say that it is appropriate that those who believe that they are assisting someone who is committing a crime should themselves be found guilty of a crime, but it is another to say that a person who aids a person who is himself or herself not committing a crime, in the mistaken belief that the person is committing a crime, should be convicted and sent to gaol for a period of up to twenty-five years.43 The concept of criminal liability for an aider and abettor is sometimes included under the broader concept of derivative liability. I am satisfied that the Crown’s argument would allow an aider and abettor to be convicted of a crime despite his or her liability having no other crime from which it could be derived.44 For these reasons I am satisfied that the Crown is not entitled to take advantage of the presumption in s 307.14 against a person charged as an aider and abettor s307.11. 45 I am satisfied that in such a case the Crown needs to prove and prove beyond reasonable doubt of course that the alleged principal intended to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug or believe that another person intended to use any substance to manufacture a controlled drug. If the Crown is unable to do so then the alleged aider and abettor must be acquitted. 46 As I mentioned earlier the Crown quite properly conceded that there was no case to go to the jury if it cannot rely on s307.14. 47 For the reasons that I have given above I propose to direct the jury to acquit Mr Campbell and Mr Baka.

   SOLICITORS:  
   Ms Harris for the NSW DPPMr North for the appellant  
   
   
    
    
    
   
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
   
    
    
     
      
        
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      1. The question in this case is how I should deal with an offender who has an alcohol problem and who is attempting to combat that alcohol problem but committed the serious offence of assaulting a police officer.  
       
       
      2. The offender is Patricia Ann Fuller. She was dealt with by a Local Court magistrate for two offences. One was ‘obstructing a police officer in the execution of duty’ and the other was ‘assaulting an officer in the execution of duty’. In respect of the first offence she was fined $400 by the learned magistrate and in respect of the second offence she was imprisoned for two months to commence on 12 June 2007. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Mr North, is there an appeal from the ‘wilfully obstruct officer’? 
       
       
      NORTH: No your Honour. 
       
       
      3. The appeal to this court is from the conviction for assaulting a police officer in the execution of duty. The police facts are these and are contained in exhibit A. Ms Fuller was at a hotel on 4 April 2007 at Coopernook. She was there with her de facto Shane Miller. There was some incident which prompted Ms Fuller to call the police in respect of Mr Miller but when the police arrived and determined that they should arrest Mr Miller, Ms Fuller had changed her mind about the desirability of Mr Miller being arrested. She held onto Mr Miller preventing the police from taking him away. She stood between Mr Miller and the police at one stage. As the police were trying to remove Mr Miller from Ms Fuller’s hold she at one stage swung around and started to punch into the chest and face of one of the police officers, Senior Constable Murray. She continued to punch him in the body area until she was arrested. She herself was placed in the rear of the police vehicle. 
       
       
      4. As I have said for this offence the learned magistrate imposed upon her a term of full time imprisonment for two months. I can well understand the magistrate’s imposition of a period of full time custody. That, in my opinion, was a sentence which was in the available range for this reason. Both the Court of Criminal Appeal and Parliament have emphasised the importance of sentencing courts imposing sentences which will support police officers in performing their duties. Police officers are sworn to protect members of the community and by the nature of their jobs are obliged to place themselves in circumstances where they are particularly vulnerable. They do that on behalf of the community in general and in order to protect specific members of the community from violence.  
       
       
      5. Parliament by enacting s21A of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
        
      included as one of the aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining a sentence for an offence the fact that the victim was a police officer.  
       
       
      6. This is a classic example of a police officer who sustained a physical assault upon his person as a result of his efforts to perform his duty. Ironically in this case it was the offender, Ms Fuller, who had originally summonsed the police to deal with Mr Miller.  
       
       
      7. Ms Fuller’s criminal history is before me. She has remained free of involvement with the law for close to ten years. In 1998 she was fined and placed on a bond for assaults and she breached that bond in 1999. Between 1999 and being sentenced for these offences she has not been in trouble. She has convictions extending back to 1992 for assault and driving matters but until now has not been sent to full-time gaol. She has had a series of bonds, at least two of which she has breached.  
       
       
      8. There is a pre-sentence report before me which refers to the fact that Ms Fuller had been drinking on the occasion in question which probably affected her behaviour. The pre-sentence report noted that at the time of interview Ms Fuller was unconcerned by her current drinking levels and did not feel that she would benefit from intervention. The pre-sentence report is dated 5 June 2007. In fact, from the bar table Mr North, who appears for Ms Fuller, tells me that she has not had anything to drink since the date of this offence, namely 4 April 2007.  
       
       
      9. There does appear to be an inconsistency which I have not drawn to Mr North’s attention to or asked him to comment on or get instructions on, so I will give Ms Fuller here the benefit of the doubt and proceed upon the basis that she has not been drinking since April 2007. In any event, if it is the case that she had ceased drinking on or after 5 June 2007, that indicates a period of some two months of being alcohol free. 
       
       
      10. Mr North’s submission is this on behalf of his client. He acknowledges that alcohol is a problem but that she has not been in trouble with the law for some time. She would therefore benefit, he says, from a bond accompanied by supervision to encourage her to adhere to her commendable efforts to abstain from drinking. 
       
       
      11. Ms Harris for the Crown agrees that alcohol is clearly the problem which needs to be focused upon in this case.  
       
       
      12. I am concerned about weighing a number of competing factors in sentencing Ms Fuller. One is the seriousness of this offence and the clear need or duty which I have to reflect in sentence the desirability of protecting police from being assaulted in the course of discharging responsibilities on behalf of the whole community. A second factor is to encourage Ms Fuller in the rehabilitation which she has already commenced. A third is to acknowledge her criminal record to date which indicates that she has been the beneficiary of a number of bonds, some of which she appears to have breached. 
       
       
      13. I should have added in referring to the pre-sentence report that the option of periodic detention is not available because the facility is too far away for a person reliant on public transport, as Ms Fuller is. 
       
       
      14. A number of sentencing options were canvassed by the legal representatives in response to my questioning. Three options were discussed, another bond, a suspended sentence or a community service order.  
       
       
      15. I regard another bond as an inadequate form of punishment for two reasons. One, it does not reflect the seriousness of the offence and the desirability of protecting the police. The second reason is that Ms Fuller has been the beneficiary of a bond before but has offended again and therefore needs to be subjected to a more serious penalty.  
       
       
      16. As for a community service order, whereas that would be an appropriate form of punishment and more serious than penalties she has received so far, it does not permit me to order a supervision for Ms Fuller which would support her in her rehabilitation.  
       
       
      17. The third option of suspending the sentence combines both the reflection of the seriousness of the offence and the ability to provide for supervision. 
       
       
      18. I will proceed to making formal orders shortly, but what I propose to do is to allow the appeal and to set aside the orders of the magistrate and to substitute for them an order that Ms Fuller be subject to a suspended sentence of two months with supervision. Before proclaiming those orders I should record that I regard a sentence of imprisonment as an appropriate penalty in this case for the reasons which I indicated earlier, and I regard an appropriate term as being two months. But I also consider it desirable, in Ms Fuller’s case, to suspend the execution of the whole of the sentence for its duration and to subject her to a bond. 
       
       
      19. Accordingly the formal orders which I make pursuant to s20(2) of the  
      Crimes Appeal and Review Act 2001 
       are that I set aside the sentence imposed by the learned magistrate. I impose a sentence of imprisonment on Ms Fuller for a term of two months. I suspend the execution of the whole of the sentence for the period of two months and I direct that Ms Fuller be released from custody on condition that she enters into a good behaviour bond for a term of two months. 
       
       
      NORTH: I’ll just indicate, your Honour, she has spent no time in custody at this point in time. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Just say that again? 
       
       
      NORTH: She hasn’t spent any time in custody so any date would go from today. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: I date the sentence from today 7 August 2007. And so the two months will expire on 6 October 2007. 
       
      NORTH: That is under Section 12, your Honour. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: It is a Section 12 bond, but I have to explain things, I think. I make it a condition of the bond that Ms Fuller participate in such programs as may be recommended by the Probation and Parole Service to assist her in alcohol rehabilitation. 
       
       
      20. Now Ms Fuller, I have now finished the formal orders. I have decided to allow your appeal. I hope you understood what I was saying. The magistrate gave you two months. I am also giving you two months but I am suspending that. Now you are going to be on a good behaviour bond. And I understand from what Mr North says that you have tried to stay off the alcohol for the last few months and I think that is very commendable and should be encouraged. Now that is why I have given you a bond. And you have got to be of good behaviour, no more offending.  
       
       
      21. Now, you have had eight years since 1999 without getting into trouble, so that has been very good so far. So you need to continue with that. But if you do breach the bond and you come back before the court, which you will if you breach the bond, you have really got to convince the court that there are good reasons why I should not send you to gaol for two months full time. You have got to show that it was a trivial breach or there are good reasons. So I am giving you a chance but, as you have heard me say, the courts are - it is their job to protect the police in the execution of their duty when they are doing their job because they are the people who have to put themselves on the line for us. And if I do not impose serious sentences there then the police are going to feel completely unprotected. So that is why I have given you a sentence as serious as I have, but on the other hand I want to encourage your rehabilitation which is why I have suspended it. Do you understand that?  
       
       
      22. The sentence commences today and finishes on 6 October 2007, and it is suspended. And you need to go to the registry to sign for that.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Mr Blaikie, the sentences I propose to impose on you are as follows. In relation to the offences committed in 2004 I propose to date those sentences, I have given you the benefit of a couple of days I must confess on the time spent in custody, from 1 May 2005, that takes into account, in my view, all presentence custody plus a few odd days. I propose to sentence you in relation to the first count, that is possession of housebreaking implements, to sixteen months imprisonment. That involves a ten per cent discount. In relation to the offence of enter land with intent to steal I propose to sentence you to two years eight months imprisonment. That represents a ten per cent discount. Those two sentences will be concurrent one with the other, and dated from 1 May 2005. 2 In relation to the matter to which you pleaded last year, the break and enter with intent, carrying with it a maximum penalty of ten years, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, I sentence you to three years imprisonment. That sentence will date from 1 May 2006. It will be partially, therefore, accumulative upon the other sentences. 3 In relation to the matter that you were found guilty of at trial, count one, the break, enter and steal, I propose to sentence you to four years imprisonment. That will date from 1 May 2007. 4 In relation to count two I propose to sentence you to two years imprisonment. That will date from 1 May 2007. In respect of the sentence of four years I propose to fix a non-parole period of two years and that will expire, on my calculation, on 30 April 2009. 5 Thus the effective sentence will be six years with a non-parole period of four years. That involves a finding of special circumstances by reason of the accumulation of sentences and also a recognition of a need, notwithstanding some reservations, for a slightly extended period of supervision to assist you to adjust to community living. You take a seat and I will give my reasons for--6 OFFENDER: May I say this, your Honour, I’d rather you not give me the non-parole period because the Parole Board will not release me to parole.7 HIS HONOUR: I can’t do anything about that, Mr Blaikie, and if that be the case well that will be a matter for the Parole Board. But I certainly will not deny you a non-parole period on the basis that you believe that you will be refused parole.8 OFFENDER: Well they’ve said it before, your Honour, so. Am I permitted to appeal against that and ask for a straight sentence?9 HIS HONOUR: Your rights of appeal are entirely a matter for you. I can’t give you any advice in relation to that. Just take a seat and I will give my reasons, thank you.10 John Arthur Blaikie appears today for sentence in relation to a number of offences, some of which he has pleaded guilty to before me, two of which he was found guilty of by a jury. I propose to try and deal with the offences in chronological order if I may. 11 The first offences in time are offences committed on 28 May 2004. They were committed at Epping and the first count on the indictment involves an offence of having in his possession, without lawful excuse, implements capable of housebreaking, namely a number of screwdrivers. That offence carries a maximum penalty of seven years. The second offence is an offence, again committed at Epping, of the prisoner entering upon land, namely 20 Victoria Street, Epping with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely larceny, in a building upon that land, namely the dwelling house of Hsiu Chu Tsai. I am told by the Crown that that offence carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment.12 The second offence in time requires me to take into account, further, a matter on a Form 1. I shall do so in accordance with the approach approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the guideline judgment in relation to Form 1 matters, particularly the observations of the learned Chief Justice in that judgment. This offence, committed on 27 April 2005 at Pennant Hills in the State of New South Wales, was one of breaking and entering a dwelling house at Pennant Hills with intent to commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely larceny. That offence was one which carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. The offence on the Form 1, of receiving stolen property, was committed at Cherrybrook on the same date and it involved the prisoner being in possession of a quantity of Indonesian currency and jewellery, the property of a person by the name of Kristie Hanias, the prisoner knowing that the property was stolen. Ordinarily the offence of receiving stolen property carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. Of course matters on a Form 1, as the Chief Justice explained in the guideline judgment, have less salience in the sentencing process but they are relevant to the assessment of the appropriate penalty for the principal offence. A matter on a Form 1 may have the effect of changing the relevant or appropriate penalty for the principal offence and, in fact, increasing it in the appropriate case. 13 The two offences for which the prisoner was found guilty by a jury in a trial conducted before me, firstly, the offence of breaking, entering and stealing committed on 14 September 2005 at Northmead and an offence of the same date of having in his possession housebreaking implements, namely screwdrivers. The breaking entering and stealing matter carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.14 I point out, in relation to the matters with which I am now concerned, that the offence of 27 April 2005 and the matter on the Form 1 were committed when the offender was on bail in relation to the offences committed in May 2004 and when the offender was also subject to a suspended sentence pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act imposed by her Honour Judge Tupman on 6 August 2004. The term of imprisonment which was suspended was twenty months, which would have expired, at least in terms of the period fixed by her Honour without any revocation of the good behaviour bond, on 5 April 2006. 15 The offences committed in September 2005 were committed when the offender was on bail, as I understand it, both in relation to the offences of 2004 and the offence of April 2005 and, of course, were committed when the offender was subject to a suspended sentence to which I have just referred.16 None of the offences, as I understand it, have a standard non-parole period.17 The facts in relation to the matters are set out firstly in an agreed statement of facts covering the offences of 2004 and the offences of April 2005 on indictment and on the Form 1. I do not propose to go through those agreed facts in detail. I note the dispute by the prisoner in relation to either the facts or the implications of some of the facts. One matter in particular, raised by the prisoner, is not disputed by the Crown at all and that is that the cash in his pocket and the mobile phone in his pocket were his property and I draw no inference adverse to the prisoner in relation to his possession of those items.18 On 28 May 2004 a man by the name of Wu returned to his address at Epping and as he entered the driveway he saw the prisoner in the rear yard of his premises and he spoke to him and then chased him. Police were called after the offender had been initially restrained and the offender was placed under arrest. Items of property were found upon him, including the screwdrivers giving rise to the charge on the indictment. There were various pieces of paper with a number of addresses written upon them and the Crown, I assume, would allege that these addresses were in some way concerned with the accused’s either (to use a colloquialism) “casing” premises or identifying premises for future offences. In the context of the charges brought against the accused I cannot be satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt. Ultimately, although there is some suspicion about the various pieces of paper referred to in the facts, those matters, in my view, are not matters that warrant consideration in the sentencing of the offender in relation to these offences.19 With regard to the offence on indictment of 27 April 2005 the offender was seen in the vicinity of premises in Pennant Hills by a police officer. Police were notified. The prisoner was seen by other police and chased and eventually arrested. Various items were seen to be thrown by him into the bush. Again he was in possession of a mobile phone, about which no issue was raised by the Crown, and a piece of paper with particulars of what would appear to be phone numbers. The prisoner disputes that the phone numbers on the piece of paper were in fact written by him. Ultimately, in the circumstances of this matter, I draw no conclusion adverse to the prisoner in relation to that piece of paper.20 Police attended upon premises at Pennant Hills that are identified in the indictment and the owners of the property, when notified, discovered that a flyscreen had been removed and an unlocked window pushed open and various items were strewn in the house, but nothing had been stolen. The offender was interviewed by police and gave what could be called an exculpatory account and claimed, in effect, that he had been apprehended by police when he was innocently going about his business. His plea of guilty indicates otherwise. When the police arrested the offender the motor vehicle that was related to him, or connected to him, was searched and a number of items of property were found including $3,500 of Indonesia rupee and items of jewellery. The items that were found in the car, particularised in the facts, were related to property at Cherrybrook that had been broken into during 27 April 2005 and the owners of the property found that a loungeroom window had been jemmied open. The items of property identified by the victims as being missing included 40,000 Indonesian rupee and various items of the jewellery itemised in the court attendance notice. 21 The offender was interviewed about the Cherrybrook matter on 6 May 2005. He denied ever being to the premises and when asked about items of jewellery relevant to the premises in his car he said he did not remember them being in the car and he did not have them in his car at any time, which clearly could not have been true.22 With regard to the matter for which he was found guilty by a jury, these offences are concerned with the breaking and entering of a dwelling house of Tharsen and Rajratman Santhagunanathan situated at 15 Russell Street, Northmead where was stolen a laptop computer, two watches, a mobile phone and a quantity of Australia coins and foreign currency, the property of the victims. The offender was found guilty by a jury of having in his possession, without lawful excuse, implements capable of housebreaking, namely screwdrivers, at the time of his arrest.23 The facts of these offences are quite straight forward as the evidence before the jury demonstrated. His counsel, in my view, did everything he could within ethical limits to represent the interests of his client, but the verdicts of guilty were inevitable. In my view, the Crown case against the prisoner was overwhelming and the matters raised in criticism of the Crown case were without merit.24 In this matter police were conducting a surveillance operation upon the prisoner. Quite a number of surveillance officers were involved. There was a belief widely held within the Eastwood Local Area Command and elsewhere that the prisoner was a person involving himself in domestic breaking and entering and stealing matters. By reason of his criminal history and his modus operandi he was known as a thief and many unflattering intelligence reports about him were circulated within relevant Local Area Commands in the area near where he lived, although these documents of course were not before the jury in as much detail as brought to my attention. Many of the background matters to the surveillance I summarised in a judgment I gave on 19 October 2006. 25 At about 10am the prisoner left his home at Carlingford and thereinafter was followed by various surveillance police to Russell Street where he arrived some time after 10.25am. Whilst in Russell Street he was the subject of surveillance, some of which evidence I excluded because of the confidential operational character of it, but that surveillance confirmed his presence in the street and his control of what was ultimately discovered to be the stolen property. In Russell Street he had broken into the home of the victims and stole the property particularised. The modus operandi was that of a professional thief. The breaking into this house presented to him no great difficulty. He carried stolen property to the motor vehicle and left Russell Street at about 10.16 am, driving to the Parramatta CBD area. Despite gaps in the surveillance it can be fairly said that the mosaic of evidence clearly established the movements of the prisoner consistent with him having the opportunity to have committed the offence. 26 He parked near the Parramatta CBD and was subject to various types of surveillance whilst he was on foot. He visited a police station apparently to report. He went to a foreign money exchange shop for a period of time. A number of photographs were taken of him during this period. He returned to his motor vehicle, as I understood the evidence, close to midday and thereinafter, by arrangement with the Highway Patrol, he was followed and then pursued to a point where he was stopped just on the northern fringe of Parramatta, or just beyond it. This pursuit and the search of his motor vehicle was the subject of some video recording. The prisoner was found by police to be in possession of property later identified to have been stolen from Russell Street, as well as the screwdrivers. One might have thought on the basis of recent possession alone the case against him as being the offender so far as the breaking, entering and stealing was completely overwhelming. The additional evidence of the prisoner’s movements made it more so.27 The prisoner has a very lengthy criminal history indeed. Today is his birthday. He is sixty-three years of age, being born on 10 August 1944. He first appeared in the Children’s Court in 1958. He then appeared at Bowral Children’s Court a short time later consistent with the account he has given to me of the Mittagong Boys Home. I must say in passing, that through my experience with the Royal Commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, I am well aware of matters relating to the mistreatment of people in juvenile custody at Mittagong, at Mount Penang as it was, and even worse still at the Tamworth Boys Home. What the offender has said to me about being sent on a life of crime, as it has turned out, by the experiences of being convicted of offences that were relatively minor and being institutionalised and then being brutalised at subsequent places, I can readily accept. Tamworth Boys Home, which I do not believe the prisoner was sent to, was a brutal institution that would have found pride of place in penal colonies around New South Wales in the early eighteenth century. 28 Be that as it may, acknowledging the prisoner’s embarkation on a life of crime in circumstances where it may well be that the first crimes he committed were crimes of need rather than greed, the offender thereinafter committed, over a lengthy period of time, a large number of offences. In fact, I note an appearance at the Tamworth Children’s Court in 1961. It may well be that he was in that particular institution to which I refer. Eventually, as he got older, he found his way into adult gaols. His first appearance at what was then the Sydney Quarter Sessions in April 1963 when he would have been, on my calculation, eighteen years, involved two motor vehicle larcenies for which he was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment. He also had convictions in 1965 in the Quarter Sessions, as it then was, break and enter with intent to steal and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. I do note in that regard, however, that in May 1964 at least one judge sought to sever the Gordian Knot by placing him on a bond, as I would describe it, for a period of five years in relation to offences of larcenies of motor vehicles and being found at night with housebreaking implements in his possession. He was ordered to undertake psychiatric treatment and the like. But, as his record reveals, within a short period of time he was back before the courts charged with crimes of dishonesty. I point out in passing that that appearance in 1964 also related to three counts of breaking, entering and stealing.29 Thereinafter, it becomes a depressing merry-go-round of appearances in court, terms of imprisonment for offences of either breaking, entering and stealing, receiving stolen property, housebreaking implements and possession and the like. Over the next twenty years through to the beginning of this century there are many, many such convictions, various terms of imprisonment, many involving non-parole periods which must have generously recognised the need for professional assistance for the prisoner, even in a time when the need to find special circumstances did not exist. 30 Of course his record is not solely confined to many offences of dishonesty. He was convicted in the Central Criminal Court in 1975 of rape and sentenced to ten years penal servitude with what I calculate to be a non-parole period of four years and to undergo psychiatric treatment. In fairness that conviction is now over thirty years old, and apart from some matters of assaulting police I find no other offences of violence in his record. But it could not be said that his record is free of such matters. 31 Once released from custody, allowing for the fact that whilst serving that term of imprisonment he was further sentenced in the Sydney District Court for breaking, entering and stealing and related matters for which he received an accumulative sentence, the prisoner was again convicted in 1984 of seven counts of breaking, entering and stealing for which he received a total sentence of five years with a non-parole period of eighteen months. Thereinafter the convictions, as I have earlier indicated, continued. I appreciate, of course, that in the 1980’s the sentencing regime was very different now. Many of these sentences would have been subject to remissions and other discounts that no longer apply. 32 The prisoner, notwithstanding this appalling criminal history, came back before the Sydney District Court having just completed a sentence of six years with a three year non-parole period on a steal from a dwelling house and was given the benefit of a two year recognizance to be of good behaviour by his Honour Judge Sinclair. However, having said that, in 1995, again convicted of break, enter and stealing, the prisoner was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. In fact his Honour the Chief Judge sentenced him to three years imprisonment for one count of breaking, entering and stealing, fixing a minimum term of eighteen months, hence making a finding of special circumstances. At about the same time he was dealt with by Judge Flannery who sentenced him to three years imprisonment, again making a finding of special circumstances, and so it goes on. 33 Ultimately, to bring the matter up to a more contemporary position, bearing in mind in 1996 he was again sentenced to over four years imprisonment for a number of breaking, entering and stealing matters, the prisoner came back before her Honour Judge Tupman for offences committed in 2002 and was given that twenty month sentence for breaking, entering and stealing, suspended pursuant to s 12. There was a further offence of breaking, entering and stealing for which her Honour gave him a sentence of six months suspended pursuant to s 12. That sentence would have expired very shortly after the 2005 offences.34 The criminal history, of course, is one that does not entitle him to any leniency and to quote the words of the majority in Veen (No 2), it in its terms reflects upon the need, as an antecedent criminal history may do from time to time, to place greater emphasis upon matters of personal deterrence and retribution than might otherwise be the case. The appropriate approach to a criminal history such as that has been discussed in a number of authorities, including the decision of Shankley, a decision of Justice Howie in 2003. I am prepared in this particular matter, again with some hesitation, to conclude that I should not find that his criminal history is itself an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A but that it is to be treated in the manner discussed in the majority judgment in Veen (No 2) as relevant in the two ways identified in that judgment (at p 477).35 In relation to the prisoner’s background, I have a great deal of material in different reports setting out his personal history. To be frank, much of his personal history, so far as his childhood and other matters are concerned is now so remote from the current time and is in the between time so punctuated by offending behaviour as to be of little importance for current sentencing proceedings. I have acknowledged, in fairness, the circumstances of him first coming into custody and the beginning of the process of institutionalisation which clearly exists. That institutionalisation is reflected in the claim of the prisoner, which may have some truth in it, that he is prepared to commit offences in order to distract police from seeking to pursue him in relation to more serious matters than those with which he is charged. Certainly, notwithstanding some reservations about this current term of imprisonment, the prospect of going to gaol over many years has had no deterrent effect upon him and in reality holds for him no fears save for the fears he must have as an older man in what is, as we all know, a very dangerous environment for those who are unable to defend themselves. 36 Insofar as his background is concerned, however, I note that he grew up in circumstances of some deprivation. He lost contact with his father at an early time. His mother was deserted. He had a violent stepfather and ended up living with a grandmother and was living in poor circumstances, financially and emotionally, when as a child he first offended. He has some contact with half siblings as a result of subsequent relationships that his mother had. He, however, could fairly be described as having a very unhappy childhood. He has very little education but he is, as his counsel says, an intelligent man and it seems to me that even if one were to take the view that there is an element of, without being disrespectful, humbug in his rationale for his offending behaviour, he clearly has insight into the matter. He certainly has the capacity to be able to provide, if not exculpatory accounts for his behaviour, at least what appear to be, from his perspective, plausible explanations for the conduct in which he has been engaged over many years. Of course, he cannot escape the disadvantages of a poor education, in fact a significantly deprived formal education. He, as I understand the evidence, was married for a period of time but that relationship broke down reasonably quickly. There was a son of that relationship, twelve months after the marriage commenced, in about 1973. His wife apparently disappeared with the child, despite the prisoner having joint custody of the child. However, when the boy was seventeen years of age he came to live with his father and apparently the prisoner and his son are on good terms and they have maintained contact. They have lived together and it would appear that his son, as well as a person described as an old friend, are the only true support structures the prisoner has outside of custody. 37 I note the prisoner would wish to return to the premises in Carlingford, from which he was followed in September 2005, on his release from custody. Those premises which are rented are being looked after for him. The prisoner, apart from his spouse, has not had many serious relationships. I certainly do not know the circumstances of the rape that he was convicted of and I note that offence, at least so far as conviction was concerned, arose a couple of years after he was married. One might say small wonder that his wife left him in those circumstances and one might wonder, in the context of this criminal history and this chronology, what advantage joint custody would have been to him when he was in fact in gaol for a reasonably lengthy period of time. 38 The prisoner, at one stage in the late 1990’s, I note from some of the material, conducted a business in relation to either clothing manufacture or sale and apparently that was reasonably successful. It is a little hard to work out from his very lengthy criminal history what time of his life he has been at large to pursue such endeavours. There does appear to be some break in his institutional presence in the late 1990’s consistent with that claim. 39 This lengthy criminal history means of course that he has had extensive contact with the Probation and Parole Service, although it states that the first record of him being supervised is in fact in 1987 notwithstanding the fact his criminal history goes back to 1958. Given his criminal history, even allowing for the fact that he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment at a time when no non-parole periods could be fixed, I have difficulty understanding how this could be so. The sentence imposed in relation to the rape matter reflects a non-parole period of four years and even allowing for the accumulative sentences subsequently fixed by the District Court he must have been subject to some sort of parole supervision. This assertion by the Probation and Parole Service must be put down to a lack of completeness of their records. Be that as it may, he has been the subject of a number of presentence reports and numerous parole reports. He has been breached in relation to recognizances to be of good behaviour. He has been referred to the Parole Board and has had the Parole Board take no action in relation to alleged breaches and then go to gaol in relation to other matters, then be given parole again. 40 A breach of parole report was prepared in 2000 recommending a revocation of the parole order and the parole order was revoked in May 2001. His parole was revoked again in May 2000 but reinstated apparently two or three weeks later when new facts came to light. His criminal history shows breaches of probation supervision or breaches of the benefit of conditional liberty on a number of occasions, including occasions that I have identified in relation to these charges. It appears that her Honour Judge Tupman was persuaded to impose suspended sentences in August 2004 because of the perceived need for the prisoner to attend counselling at Macquarie University to received counselling in relation to matters concerning his cognitive behaviour. This cognitive behavioural therapy was specially targeted at reducing Mr Blaikie’s offending behaviour. Clearly, it was without success. I have heard Mr Blaikie give evidence about this matter. He says that he did attend upon this program but either it failed or he failed to adhere to the assistance or he terminated the program because of what he claimed to be the harassment of him by the police. Certainly he was a target for the police. He may have seen that as harassment, but unfortunately the approach that he takes, that being “harassed” by the police he feels stress and thus he feels the need to commit offences, if it is the truth, unfortunately provides no excuse for the offending behaviour with which I am concerned. 41 The prisoner has said to me that he has spent about thirty years in custody. I have not done the arithmetic but that may well be right. He is a person who would appear to be no difficulty to those in custody and I note positive reports of his behaviour from correctional officers. I think in fairness to him he is regarded as a person of the ‘old school’ and he claims a certain standard of ethical behaviour in relation to the commission of his offences which might appear hypocritical, but may also be reflected in the fact that he targets premises where he would endeavour to avoid contact with people. Obviously this is a modus operandi which is designed to avoid detection but it is to his credit, with the exception of that very serious matter in the Central Criminal Court, that his offences of breaking, entering and stealing are not accompanied by acts of violence, vandalism of an extreme nature, or gratuitous damage to persons or property that appear to be more common in offences of this type. 42 The Probation and Parole Service refers to a number of reports that have been prepared in relation to him and to be truthful, late in the day, I have to acknowledge that I have been somewhat buried by what could be called a suffocating number of documents involving historical records, particularly of psychological and psychiatric examination of the prisoner. I will endeavour to give this material as much justice as I can. 43 It appears from the material available to me, firstly, that the prisoner has clear physiological evidence of frontal lobe damage and there is some damage to his cervical spine. He has a history of head injury. He had a significant head injury in 1964 in a motor vehicle accident. In 1984 he fell down a cliff face sustaining a loss of consciousness and injuries to the left side of his head and clavicle. There is a suggestion of a head injury in 1991. He has been examined with CT scanning and other medical imagining. He has been looked at by neurologists, psychologists and psychiatrists. The frontal lobe damage claim I believe is irrefutable. However, it is to be borne in mind that these tests have been largely undertaken from 2002 onwards, albeit there is the report of 1991 confirming the fall down the cliff in 1984. Certainly there is no evidence before me that the 1964 injury in any way has contributed to his offending behaviour up until, for example, 1994 or 2000. In fact the evidence is overwhelmingly I think, with the sole exception of the opinion of Professor Susan Hayes, that whilst there are frontal lobe anomalies they are not of a severity and sufficient magnitude to explain what is called his compulsive stealing, from which precisely he suffers. 44 I appreciate Dr Hayes, a very eminent clinical psychologist, believes that at the time she wrote a report in 2002 and again in 2003 that the prisoner’s offending behaviour is 
     
      
      “related to his organic brain damage and specifically to his inability to plan and organise effectively and the discrepancy between what he says and what he actually does.” 
      
    45 I have difficulty understanding that analysis in a number of ways. Firstly, it seems to me, with respect, that in some respects from the material I have about these offences the prisoner is a person who seems to be able to organise and plan effectively. She says that because of stress he tends to fall back into previous patterns of behaviour even though these patterns of behaviour are irrational and maladaptive. There is a claim the prisoner makes that, as I have said earlier, stress causes him to commit these crimes. In my view, that could not be regarded relevantly as a mitigating factor. She noted that he was not a dangerous or violent man but said that his offending behaviour was related to, if not directly caused by, a “diagnosable psychiatric disorder” namely “organic brain damage”. She said that he was at risk if he received a custodial sentence. I assume the content of her report and related reports were of some significance in the assessment made of the matter by her Honour Judge Tupman. I do not want to be taken to criticise her Honour, because, to be frank, there comes a time sometimes when again one tries to sever the Gordian Knot of offending by taking a novel approach, even after many years of offending behaviour. 46 This brings me to two further reports of more recent origin. There are the psychologists’ reports of June 2004 from the Macquarie University Psychology Clinic. These reports apparently were available for her Honour Judge Tupman and these reports were obviously designed to assist her Honour or some other judge in sentencing the offender for two outstanding charges of breaking, entering and stealing. They contain much the same history as I have outlined. They concluded that the prisoner was in effect institutionalised, saying that he was “brought up in the criminal justice system. His upbringing has impacted upon his behaviour, whilst his grandparents instilled traditional values of respect and other positive matters, and his offending was a source of shame and disappointment he reacted to what he regarded as slights and injustices”, and that is much the tenor of his evidence before me that his current predicaments are in some respect caused by injustices heaped upon him by investigating police. The prisoner is said to be institutionalised and was a person who identified with the custodial system because of the fact that it provided him some structural support missing elsewhere in his life. This report stated that he had responded well to treatment given him up to that time, of the character available from the Macquarie University, and recommended that he continue with that treatment, which he did for a period of time, but ultimately unsuccessfully notwithstanding the excuses he has given.47 The most up to date report I have is the report of Dr Greenberg which is prepared on the basis of a claim by the prisoner, in a letter that he wrote directly to me that I passed on to the authorities for obvious reasons, that he was unfit to be tried. He was actually found fit to be tried. The report of Dr Greenberg was primarily designed to address those issues. It noted past reports from Justice Health that variously described the prisoner as “a sociopath without regard for consequences”, a person having a “sociopathic personality disorder” and who had been diagnosed by Dr Thomas Oldtree Clark in 1995 whilst in custody as having “obsessive compulsive personality disorder” with “obsessive traits mixed with avoidant behaviour”. All of those diagnoses might describe the prisoner’s conduct over a period of time. Ultimately, Dr Greenberg came to the conclusion that whilst there were mild cognitive changes there was nothing that represented an explanation for the prisoner not understanding the proceedings. In fact, the psychiatrist found that the prisoner was in fact fit to be tried and there was no mental illness disorder. He said in his report that the primary diagnosis was that of a man with significant antisocial personality disorder. This had been exhibited throughout his adult life and was well entrenched. He reflected upon the history of head injury in 1984 and in 1991-1992 but he concluded whilst he does have some difficulties with memory and recall, his attention and concentration were adequate. He was orientated in time. He said that only with formal neuropsychological testing could subtle cognitive deficits be detected.48 Dr Westmore’s report, attached to the Probation and Parole Service report from April 2004, again I assume that was before her Honour Judge Tupman, came to the conclusion, on all the material available, including access to Professor Hayes’ report and a number of psychological reports that have been provided to me, that the prisoner was a person who suffered from an ‘adult antisocial behaviour disorder’. This is not a specific psychiatric disorder. He said it was a term used to describe “professional criminals”. He said it was a descriptive term. Individuals who participate in a repetitive offending pattern are extremely complex from the psychological perspective and each individual is different in terms of how and why they engaged in repeated antisocial behaviour. With regards to Dr Clark’s diagnosis he suggested the prisoner may be an obsessional man with some rigid views about certain topics or issues as was reflected in his evidence before me. However, he would need more information. As for the organic brain disorder, whilst he said it was there he agreed that the organic brain changes are not in and of themselves sufficient to explain his long history of offending behaviour, noting the opinion of Professor Hayes. As to a provisional or problematic diagnosis of kleptomania, he said there needed to be further exploration of that matter. In relation to his antisocial personality disorder, he noted his behavioural patterns had not reduced or modified. He noted the prisoner had told him then, in 2004, that he was too old for this type of behaviour. He noted that most people with antisocial personality disorders have either stopped or significantly reduced their criminal activities by the time they reach this man’s age. In reflecting upon the matter in summary he concluded whilst the prisoner had genuine concerns about his own behaviour and whilst repeated imprisonments did not appear to have acted as a deterrent for him he was unable to indicate to the Court, at that time, what his prognosis was from a forensic prospective. It was possible that he could return to some type of gainful employment but his lengthy incarcerations had obviously impacted upon his social development. He thought that he could benefit from treatment and he noted that the prisoner had developed “ethics” in relation to his offending behaviour and these observations of him and his claims in these regards were supportive of the opinion that he engages in “adult antisocial behaviour”. He said that a further custodial sentence will not significantly alter his behaviour but he noted his anxiety about further imprisonment. Ultimately, from a psychiatric or psychological perspective, the truth of the matter is that there are obviously significant psychological issues at play here. They are matters that are very difficult to treat and may never be amenable to treatment. It is also to be borne in mind that the evidence does not establish any causal link between his psychology and the offending behaviour such as to warrant consideration of the principles set out at Engert v R ((1995) 84 A Crim R 67) and other cases where it has been held that a mental disability or condition may have the effect of diminishing the need to place emphasis on general deterrence. In this matter, in any event, even if that were true, there would still be the need to give greater weight to matters of personal deterrence given the difficulty in treating the condition.49 In sentencing the offender I am required, according to Pearce v The Queen, to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and give proper consideration to issues of concurrency and accumulation to reflect the totality of the criminality. These matters are discussed at [45] of that decision at (1998) 194 CLR 610. I am mindful of what was said about the issue of the appropriate concurrency of sentencing when sentencing persons to terms of imprisonment in the decision of Hammoud. In this particular matter, of course, I am concerned not to double dip, bearing in mind a number of offences were committed whilst on bail for other offences and these are aggravating factors. There is a separation, however, in the criminality of the offences committed at various times in 2004 and 2005 and in my view there is a need to partially accumulate those sentences to reflect the fact that the offences in question are at various times different acts of the criminality. 50 In relation to this matter I have determined that there are “special circumstances” that arise in relation to the last of the sentences I will impose. The special circumstances firstly are the fact that sentences will be partly accumulative upon one another and this of course has been long recognised as a special circumstance warranting an adjustment of the relevant non-parole period. I have determined on the totality of the material, notwithstanding the failure of the prisoner to take advantage of the cognitive therapy he received in 2004 and 2005, to make a slight adjustment of the non-parole period in relation to the last sentence in time to recognise the fact that the prisoner, with his long history of institutionalisation, will need professional assistance to adjust to community living and will clearly need, in my view, direct supervision to undertake the therapies that the prisoner has told me that he would wish to pursue on his release from custody. His counsel sought special circumstances. His solicitor, after his counsel left court a little while ago, raised the issue of his experience with prisoners with lengthy criminal history being given an opportunity, notwithstanding the fact that they had spent many years in gaol for different types of offending. I note in relation to this issue that Justice Wood, in the judgment of R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 (at pps 120-121), raised the very point that a finding of special circumstances might be made in relation to young offenders to assist them to rehabilitate themselves on release from custody. That finding may also be appropriate for offenders with long criminal histories, spending significant time in custody, who will be released from custody to find a changed world. 51 In my view, adjusting the non-parole period to enable the prisoner to have a two year period of supervision recognises, ultimately, the community advantage, if it can be achieved, in assisting the prisoner. There is, of course, I think, strong evidence to suggest the prisoner’s capacity to avoid offending will only cease when he is physically too old to offend or when he dies, which is a very sad state of affairs. 52 I have had regard, I should hasten to say, to the Crown’s written submissions and, of course, Mr Conomos’ written submissions. I am required to backdate the sentences to take into account all relevant terms of custody. On the figures provided to me by the learned Crown prosecutor the periods of custody, other than the continuous custody the prisoner has been in since 15 September 2005, on the Crown’s calculation a total of four months and on my calculation eleven days or thereabouts. I have determined that I should start the sentences, in the circumstances, from 1 May, which might give the prisoner the benefit of two or three days extra but then again there may have been two or three days lost through police custody. I do not think it makes a great deal of difference. 53 I should hasten to say, in the Crown’s submissions, putting aside the fact that s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act has somewhat overtaken in many respects the matters discussed by Justice Grove in Ponfield, that there are features of the offence of breaking, entering and stealing or related offences discussed in Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435, being aggravating factors, that arise in this particular matter. There is no doubt the prisoner is, if not a sophisticated, certainly a professional housebreaker. I would imagine very few premises present him with a challenge. He may obviously choose premises that are not protected by security such as alarms and the like, but the evidence before me reveals very much the ease with which he was able to gain access to relevant properties. This aspect of the matter is recognised in Ponfield as a matter that reflects upon the seriousness of the offence. Some of the other features arising out of Ponfield I will deal with under s 21A. It is correct to say in the context of that guideline judgment that a prior record of like offences, in the way that it was discussed in Veen (No 2), is able to explain the offending behaviour for sentence. 54 In relation to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the matter is visited by several aggravating factors, in my view, in relation to the offences committed in April 2005 and September 2005. The most significant aggravating factor arising out of s 21A(2) is that the offences were committed whilst the prisoner was subject to conditional liberty. He was on bail and subject to the bond ordered by her Honour. Of course, the various offences have different characteristics, some of which do not involve factors such as the extent of loss or injury. For example housebreaking implements in his possession, cannot have that particular aggravating factor but the offence of breaking, entering and stealing in September 2005 is an offence that has the aggravating factor that the loss of property to the victims was potentially substantial. Then again the property was recovered. Ultimately loss or damage is not a relevant aggravating factor.55 In relation to the offending in question and particularly the offence in September 2005, in my view, it was a planned offence, in that the offender was prepared and ready to break into particular domestic premises that would accord with his modus operandi. The extent to which he had undertaken enquiry to choose this particular property I do not know, but the evidence is overwhelming that when he was followed by the police that he was looking for a particular area of Sydney where he could find domestic premises which were unattended and used his skills to break into them. 56 The other offences involving entering properties or breaking into properties to which he has pleaded guilty have much the same hallmarks. 57 With regard to mitigating factors, there are very few. Indeed, some of the charges of course do not involve substantial loss, either because the property was recovered or alternatively it is not a feature of the cases in any event. In fairness to the prisoner, whilst he forced entry to the premises that he entered, as particularised, there was little damage done. There is certainly no suggestion of vandalising premises.58 In relation to any other mitigating factors, I take into account the plea of guilty, where it was entered in relation to those charges, as a mitigating factor as provided for by s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I note in relation to the plea of guilty in passing that the prisoner is entitled to the discount that arises from the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty in accordance with the guidline judgment of Thomson and Houlton. 59 In relation to the offences of 2004 those pleas were entered very late, in fact entered today. The prisoner will receive a ten per cent discount in relation to those matters. 60 In relation to the offence committed in April 2005 the plea was entered at an earlier stage but after the prisoner had been committed for trial. In my view the appropriate discount for that offence is fifteen percent upon the otherwise appropriate sentence. Of course there can be no discount for those offences to which he pleaded not guilty. The fact that any aggravating or mitigating factor is relevant and known to the court does not require the court to increase or reduce the sentence for the offence. 61 I note in relation to this matter there is little in the way of contrition or remorse. There is inherently in the plea of guilty some element of remorse and contrition but there has been, whilst the prisoner has expressed regret for his conduct, little evidence in my view of real remorse for the effect upon victims. The prisoner has from time to time said to various interviewers that he regrets his actions and he feels sorry for the victims, but I note these historical assertions have been followed by further crimes which have involved violation of the privacy of individuals which the prisoner, it seems to me, does not concern himself about in a real and meaningful way.62 The Crown has drawn to my attention the decision of Harris. That is a recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal concerned with offences of a like nature committed in 2006. The sentences imposed by the learned Judge at first instance were the subject of a Crown appeal. The appeal was allowed and the various sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Hughes were increased. I bear in mind of course sentences of the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to like offences provide guidance to this Court but there are no judgments of such a character that are binding precedents. I have taken into account that judgment and its effect as providing some guidance. But every case needs to be determined on its own facts.63 One last matter, in fairness to the prisoner, in his favour. I have taken into account the various documents relating to his involvement with the Rural Fire Service. I assume this is involvement when he was serving a sentence at Cessnock Gaol. There seems to be a connection between him and the gaol and the Rural Fire Service. It seems as though he made a conscientious and meaningful contribution to the Fire Service with suggestions in relation to its activities. It shows that he is a man with intelligence and the capacity to make a contribution in a constructive way to the community. The problem is this constructive contribution to the community has occurred on so few occasions. I also note that he has undertaken some courses whilst in custody. Given his age and his employment history however, it seems to me little prospect of him, on release from custody, finding his way into the workforce.64 Thus the orders I make in relation to these matters are as follows, if you don’t mind standing up please, Mr Blaikie, allowing for the discounts that I have given you in relation to the relevant charges in respect of the two offences committed in May 2004 in respect of count one, that is the housebreaking implements offence, you are convicted. You are sentenced to sixteen months imprisonment to date from 1 May 2005. That term of imprisonment will expire, on my calculation, on 31 August 2005. 65 With regard to count two on that particular indictment, you are convicted. You are sentenced to two years and eight months imprisonment. That sentence, too, will date from 1 May 2005 and on my calculation that will expire on 31 December 2007.66 In relation to the matter on the indictment committed on 27 April 2007, this is the break and enter with intent to steal, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, you are convicted. You are sentenced to three years imprisonment. That will date from 1 May 2006 and that sentence will expire on 30 April 2009. 67 In relation to the offence of breaking, entering and stealing committed on 14 September 2005, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of two years. That will date from 1 May 2007 and expire on 30 April 2009. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of two years and that will expire on 30 April 2011. 68 In relation to the second count on that indictment the offence of having in your possession implements cable of housebreaking you are convicted. You are sentenced to two years imprisonment. That sentence will date from 1 May 2007 and expire on 30 April 2009. 69 Your release to parole will be a matter for the Parole Board but when you are released to parole you will be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. I note that you have asked me not to fix a non-parole period. I decline your request. You should understand of course that if I decline to fix a non-parole period it would not in anyway affect the sentence of imprisonment I would impose upon you. It would not mean that I would impose a lesser term of imprisonment and the sentence of four years in relation to the first count on the indictment. Ultimately, the sentence I impose involves a total term of imprisonment of six years with a non-parole period of four years that will date from 1 May 2005 and it will expire on 30 April 2009. Just take a seat please, Mr Blaikie. 70 Madam Crown, are there any technical matters?71 CINQUE: No, your Honour.72 HIS HONOUR: Sir, are there any technical matters?73 SPEAKER: No, your Honour.74 HIS HONOUR: Do you understand the sentence, Mr Blaikie?75 OFFENDER: I do, your Honour, and if I may I intend to appeal against the parole period because I do not want parole.76 HIS HONOUR: My advice to you would be not to say too much because everything you are saying at the moment is being recorded and will be for the benefit of the Court of Criminal Appeal, but as to appealing, that is--77 OFFENDER: I understand that, your Honour, that’s why I’m saying it.78 HIS HONOUR: That is entirely your right.79 OFFENDER: Because I know the Parole Board, they will not give me parole. It’s ..(not transcribable).. It’s fruitless putting me up for parole because I know what’s going to happen.80 HIS HONOUR: It might be that other people might agree with that and they might find, or take the view if not find that my finding of special circumstances was inappropriate in the circumstances, but--81 OFFENDER: Everybody else that has a drug problem, the whole problem, I’ve said it before, it’s speaking for them. Idiots like myself it is nothing but junk, so I will appeal and I also raise in your submissions that you’ve made factual errors such as I was not on bail in April 05 from 04. I was not on a six months suspended sentence in April 05--82 HIS HONOUR: Mr Blaikie, you were subject to a 20 month suspended sentence that was imposed in August 2004.83 OFFENDER: Yes, I was and--84 HIS HONOUR: That was imposed apparently on 31 August 2004.85 OFFENDER: 16 August 19--86 HIS HONOUR: In terms of the six months suspended sentence I will correct my judgment. That is an error on my part. I miscalculated it in the heat of the moment.87 OFFENDER: That finished 1 March 05 your Honour.88 HIS HONOUR: But do you think it makes a difference with the greatest of respect to you that one of those suspended sentences had expired?89 OFFENDER: Because--90 HIS HONOUR: No seriously, Mr Blaikie.91 OFFENDER: No, yeah, but the criminality of it is I did not break that suspended sentence. I was not on bail from 04. That’s all I’m trying to say your Honour.92 HIS HONOUR: Mr Blaikie, you tell me--93 OFFENDER: Your Honour, I don’t understand--94 HIS HONOUR: You tell me, Mr Blaikie, as a matter of academic interest how you could be arrested in May 2004 and not be sentenced in relation to the matter and not be on bail in relation to the matter in 2005?95 OFFENDER: Sorry, I--.96 HIS HONOUR: It doesn’t matter, thank you.97 OFFENDER: What I can’t understand is that the parole period you’ve give me today, your Honour, for the break and enter offence which I was found guilty for starts this year. By the time that comes up I’ve done three years eight months.98 HIS HONOUR: Mr Blaikie has drawn to my attention that there was one factual error in my judgment which is absolutely correct. The six month term of imprisonment suspended by her Honour Judge Tupman had in fact expired by the time that Mr Blaikie committed the offences in 2005 but it is a matter that makes no difference to my ultimate findings.

    SENTENCE1. Ronald Ian Lennox was arraigned before me today on a charge that on 5 September 2006 at Bulahdelah he possessed a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine. Exhibit A tendered by the Crown was a set of facts.2. Briefly, Mr Lennox was driving a semi-trailer north on the Pacific Highway at 90 to 100 kilometres an hour on a straight section. The prime mover and the trailer left the road and climbed an embankment and rolled over. Fortunately Mr Lennox was not injured - and fortunately - nor were other road users. The semi-trailer was extensively damaged. Police arrived and spoke with him. He passed a breathalyser test, but the police noticed that he was unsteady on his feet and that his eyes were dilated and he seemed to be vague. They took him to a hospital where a blood and urine sample were obtained. They found some items in the cabin which contained syringes, white powder and crystalline substance. Certain parts of those items were found to contain amphetamine and the total amount of amphetamine, including dextrose, which was some of the other substance, came to more than 26 grams.3. Mr Lennox has a criminal record. It is mostly for traffic offences, with two exceptions, namely an assault which occurred in 1995 and an offence of goods in custody which occurred ten years later in 2005.4. Mr Golding, who appeared for Mr Lennox, called his client. The offence occurred on 5 September 2006. Mr Lennox had been using amphetamine for a while, for some 12 months. He was a professional truck driver, travelling interstate between Sydney and Brisbane. He used about a gram of amphetamines daily in his coffee in order to stay awake, because he had a tight schedule of runs. 5. His personal circumstances at the time were such that his mother had died a few weeks beforehand, which left him significantly affected. She had died from heart failure, following a period of illness. He returned to work the day before the offence. He has always been a driver. He has a daughter who is about to turn 13. Since birth she has had cerebral palsy. She is about to have significant surgery on 18 September this year. By tragic coincidence, Mr Lennox’s father died on 15 October 2006, only a couple of months after his mother died. He has had no drugs since his arrest and is prepared to undertake urine analysis in order to demonstrate that. He feels a lot better being off the drugs. He appreciates the danger to himself and others from driving a truck under the influence of amphetamines. He is presently re-employed as an interstate truck driver.6. Cross-examined by Mr Holles for the Crown, he acknowledged the risk he was taking and the impact which his death or disability would have on the life of his disabled daughter. 7. Part of Mr Golding’s case were a number of references. One was from his former partner, the mother of his daughter Kyla. She has since remarried and said that she and her husband hold Mr Lennox in the highest regard and respect. He is always available to help and takes a significant role in caring for his daughter. He has always been a devoted father. There is also a reference from R J Cocco, who also indicates that he is a devoted father, a trustworthy friend and companion. There is a note from his employer, Easter Group Pty Limited, who indicates that he is an honest and enthusiastic employee in every respect. It acknowledges the charges. It indicates also that he is a loyal, trustworthy and reliable person. 8. Mr Golding has been frank in what he is seeking, which is an order under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which enables me to impose a bond instead of imprisonment. He draws my attention to mitigating factors under s 21A(3) of that Act, in particular his client’s plea of guilty and his character and lack of a serious record.9. As I observed during his submissions, in my opinion his record does not entitle me to conclude that he has an unblemished character because it includes an offence of assault and an offence of having goods in custody. The first concerns violence, the second concerns honesty, but there is only one count of each and they are relatively minor and so, in my opinion, I can regard Mr Lennox to have a fairly good character. I accept, which is supported by the evidence, that his daughter figures very prominently in his life. I also accept that he is unlikely to re-offend. I accept Mr Lennox’s evidence that he is no longer on drugs and that he has learnt his lesson, as Mr Golding put it.10. The circumstance of this particular offence unhappily coincided with the recent death of his mother and the responsibility of sharing the burden of his disabled daughter. It was clear from the circumstances of the offence, as indicated by the fact that the Crown were prepared to accept a plea of guilty to this offence, that the drugs in Mr Lennox’s possession were for his own use.11. I must be aware that I am not sentencing Mr Lennox for driving under the influence of these drugs. It is obviously a frightening prospect for members of the community that a truck driver, pulling a semi-trailer, might be driving under the influence of a very significant quantity of amphetamines. But he was sentenced in respect of driving under the influence of drugs in the Local Court at Forster on 5 September 2006. So what is relevant for me is not to be punishing Mr Lennox for that kind of driving. But it is relevant for me to take into account, in the circumstances of his offending, that the purpose of his possession of the drugs was to keep him awake whilst he was working.12. I have decided to accept Mr Golding’s submission. This is the first drug offence of which Mr Lennox has been convicted. Hopefully it will be the last. As I have said I am confident that it will be and that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. In the circumstances it seems to be to be appropriate to deal with this matter by way of a bond. I propose to stipulate supervision and that he subject himself to urine analysis as and when required. The condition of the bond will deal with specific deterrence, so far as Mr Lennox’s drug usage is concerned and I regard the circumstances of the case as such that the sentence will also serve as a general deterrence.13. Okay, stand up Mr Lennox. Mr Lennox, instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment on you, I make an order directing you to enter into a good behaviour bond for two years. I make it a condition of the bond that you will appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during that bond. I make it a further condition that during the term of the bond you will be of good behaviour. I make it a further condition that you be supervised by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service and that you subject yourself to whatever tests that officer or officers may require to check whether you have been using prohibited drugs. Any other order Mr Holles?HOLLES: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Or condition, Mr Golding?GOLDING: Thank you your Honour.14. Mr Lennox you have heard what I said. You have got a bond for two years. I am hoping this is a one-off offence. It sounds as though you are back on the right track. Now because you have been under a bond - I am just not sure if you have had a bond before - you have got to stay out of trouble for those two years. You will have to report to the Probation and Parole Service so they can arrange supervision. I have made it a specific term that they can test you, probably by urinalysis and that is because it is important that you stay of those drugs.15. Mr Lennox, if you breach the bond you can be called to appear before the Court again and the Court can revoke the bond and you can be re-sentenced and range of sentences is open again so that you may be subjected to a more serious penalty than the one I have imposed. So it is very important that you stick to the bond and remain of good behaviour. Now gentlemen there is usually a condition about reporting.GOLDING: Your Honour, to give effect to your Honour’s order, would your Honour direct that he report to the Probation and Parole Office at Penrith by the close of business this Friday?HIS HONOUR: This Friday? Does that leave enough time?GOLDING: Excuse me your Honour?HIS HONOUR: Yes. Yes.GOLDING: Penrith your Honour.16. Okay. In addition I order that Mr Lennox report to the Probation and Parole Office at Penrith on or before Friday 17 August 2007. Do you understand that Mr Lennox?OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Anything else Mr Crown?HOLLES: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Mr Golding?GOLDING: Thank you your Honour, no.HIS HONOUR: All right. That is finished. You can come out of the dock Mr - you will need to go into the Registry but Mr Golding will tell you about that.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant was sentenced in the District Court on a charge of ongoing supply of cocaine contrary to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The maximum penalty prescribed for that offence is relevantly 20 years imprisonment. He had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and adhered to that plea before Judge Marien (the Judge). He was sentenced on 27 October 2006 to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3½ years and a balance of term of 2½ years. The sentence dated from 26 October 2006 and he is eligible to be released to parole on 25 April 2010. 
     
      
    3 The applicant initially relied upon two grounds of appeal, but the first was abandoned at the hearing of the application. The remaining ground is that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    4 The facts can be stated briefly. The applicant was subject to a police undercover operation whereby he supplied cocaine on three occasions between the 27 July and 12 August 2005. The supplies took place in Double Bay on 28 July, 4 August and 11 August. On each occasion the same procedure was adopted. The undercover officer contacted the applicant and arranged to purchase an ounce of cocaine at a price of $7,500. The officer attended a coffee shop in a hotel and spoke to the applicant. He left and returned a short time later. He then placed a package into the officer’s handbag and removed an envelope containing the money. The first supply involved 29.8 grams of cocaine with a purity of 49 per cent, the second involved 28.7 grams with a purity of 47 per cent and the third 28.4 grams with a purity of 27 per cent. 
     
      
    5 The applicant had told a psychiatrist who prepared a report for the sentencing proceedings that he had agreed to place a person who wanted to purchase cocaine in contact with a supplier he knew. He was willing to assist in the supply of the drug for a reward of $250 on each occasion. He said that he had never been involved in drug dealing and committed the offences as a favour to a friend and to obtain money to renew his security licence in order to obtain work. The applicant had given a similar account to the officer preparing a pre-sentence report and in a statement to police, 
     
      
    6 The applicant was aged 47 years at the time of offending and had no prior criminal record. A pre-sentence report revealed that the applicant was born in Pakistan. He married in 1980 but divorced his wife in 1987. He came to Australia in 1998 with his four children and his former wife. A son aged 17 was killed in a motor vehicle accident in 2001. Thereafter the applicant left the family home to live by himself but remained in daily contact with his surviving children. After coming to Australia the applicant worked in various positions but had been receiving Centrelink benefits since 2002 because he was suffering from depression as a result of the death of his son. He has never used illegal drugs. The officer preparing the report did not believe that there was any problem that needed to be addressed by supervision or assistance from the Service. 
     
      
    7 There was in evidence a report from the applicant’s treating psychiatrist. The applicant reported that since the death of his son he had been depressed and unable to work. His security licence expired in July 2004 and he did not at that time renew it. He reapplied for the licence in May 2005 but found that he had to undergo a course in order to obtain his licence that was to cost him $900. He did not have the money and hence agreed to assist in the supply of the drugs. The applicant had first seen the psychiatrist on 7 November 2005 after he had been charged with the drug offence and because he was again depressed. The psychiatrist was of the opinion that he was at risk of further depressive episodes if he were to receive a full-time custodial sentence. 
     
      
    8 The Judge, relying upon what was stated by me, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL, in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92, determined that the appropriate discount to give for both the utilitarian value of the plea and assistance was 40 per cent. There was no evidence that the applicant would serve his sentence more harshly by reason of the assistance he proffered. With respect that was an overly generous discount. Although the applicant agreed to give evidence against persons who were involved in the supply to the undercover officer, there was no suggestion that any person was likely to be prosecuted based upon the information supplied by the applicant. The Judge accepted that what the applicant told police was of little more than intelligence value at the time of sentence and in my view that is how the matter ought to have been assessed at the date of sentence, that is more than 12 months after the applicant had been arrested. 
     
      
    9 If there were a need to re-sentence the applicant, I could not award him a discount of that magnitude. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the Court should deal with this issue by simply considering the sentence imposed upon the applicant in light of the plea of guilty and the assistance given and determine whether it was excessive. That is the way in which I intend to determine the fate of the application. 
     
      
    10 The Judge treated the matter as one of above mid-range of seriousness for an offence falling within s 25A principally because of the following facts: the amount of drug involved overall; the role of the applicant in setting up the transactions; the fact that the offences were committed through greed; and that at the time of the offending the applicant had recovered from his depressive illness caused by the death of his child. It was submitted on the part of the applicant that this was an over-estimation of the seriousness of the offending and that the Judge must have relied too much on the amount of drug and exaggerated the applicant’s involvement in the supplies. 
     
      
    11 As the Judge pointed out, it is unusual to find an offence under s 25A involving such a large amount of drug. The offence was enacted to target dealers who were involved in the ongoing supply of drugs for profit where the amounts supplied on any particular occasion were small and any one instance of supply did not fairly represent the involvement of the supplier in the distribution of drugs: see R v Smiraldo (2000) 112 A Crim R 47. Although the amount of the drug is not the only relevant factor in sentencing for this offence, or any offence of supplying drugs for that matter, it remains a significant factor: Smith v R [2007] NSWCCA 138 at [53]. It may well be the case that the seriousness of this type of offence will not be diminished simply because the overall amount of drug supplied is small. But it does not follow that the amount of drug supplied is an irrelevant matter in determining the seriousness of the particular offence. 
     
      
    12 I have cautioned before about placing too much reliance on what was said about the relevance of the amount of the drug in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 in relation to a State offence where the seriousness of the offence is not based upon the purity of the drug: see Truong v R [2006] NSWCCA 318. See also R v Sciberras (2006) 165 A Crim R 532 at [41]. There will clearly be cases where the amount of the drug supplied is determinate of the sentence. The amount of the drug supplied was very significant in this case because the applicant knew that he was involved in the supply of an ounce of the drug on each occasion. In my opinion that was an important fact in determining the seriousness of the crime committed by the applicant in the range of criminal activity that could be encompassed by the section. 
     
      
    13 It was well open to the Judge to find that the applicant was “highly instrumental in setting up the various meetings where the drug supplies occurred”. He arranged the meetings with the officer on his mobile telephone. The applicant may not have been at the top of the organizational tree in this business of supplying drugs but he was not in the position of a mere courier of the drug or a runner. Nor was he a street dealer. There may have been no person under him in the organisation in which he was involved, but that is because he was supplying on behalf of a wholesaler of the drug. It would have been obvious to the applicant by the amount sold and the frequency of the sales that the officer was purporting to be a trafficker who would on-supply the drug received. 
     
      
    14 It has been made clear that a person who is to be sentenced for an offence under s 25A can expect to receive a more severe sentence than a person who falls to be sentenced for the same conduct under s 25 of the Act, not the least because the maximum penalty is greater than for an offence of supply simpliciter: R v CBK [2002] NSWCCA 457 at [57]. The amount here supplied was 86.9 grams overall. The indictable quantity for cocaine is 5 grams. Each of the offences, if charged as a separate supply, would have been dealt with in the District Court and the applicant have been liable to a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years. I do not mean by this observation to suggest that some comparison should be made between the sentence imposed for an offence under s 25A and what would have been imposed had the applicant been before the court for three offences of supply arising from the one course of conduct. I am simply observing that, unlike the vast majority of cases prosecuted under this section, each of the supplies was itself a significant criminal act warranting a significant sentence. 
     
      
    15 I appreciate that the applicant had a strong subjective case arising from his good character but taking into account the level of his involvement in the offences, his knowledge of the amount of drugs being supplied, the nature of the drug and the fact that he was acting purely for profit, there was little mitigation in his subjective circumstances. It may be the case that there is a risk that he will serve some part of his sentence while suffering acute depression, but it is difficult to feel sympathetic when this disorder is a direct result of his involvement in such serious criminal conduct. His previous depressive illness was in remission and there is no suggestion, as the Judge rightly pointed out, that he was suffering from any mental abnormality at the time of the offending. 
     
      
    16 It has been held by this Court that a sentencing judge’s assessment of where in a range of criminal conduct encompassed by an offence a particular instance of offending stands is a matter of fact upon which minds might reasonably differ. Generally this Court would not interfere in that assessment unless it was clearly erroneous: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282. Here the assessment was supported by adequate reasons: cf Dang v R [2005] NSWCCA 430. 
     
      
    17 The only matter that causes me to hesitate about accepting the Judge’s finding that the offence was above midrange of seriousness was that there were only three occasions when the supply took place. The number of supplies is clearly a relevant factor in accessing the criminality of the offender under s 25A as is any material that suggests that the supplies were not isolated incidents. But this is not a case where there was to be a limited number of supplies to the undercover police officer and it is clear, even on the applicant’s account given to police, that she was considered to be an ongoing customer. When she complained of the quality of the last supply, the applicant accused the supplier of debasing its quality and suggested that she should receive some sort of a refund. He clearly saw her as his client and was concerned to look after her interests. 
     
      
    18 The applicant’s account was that he was only to receive $250 per supply even though the amount of drug supplied on each occasion was worth $7,500. The Judge indicated that he was loath to accept this assertion, especially as it was not supported by evidence from the applicant. In my opinion little weight should be given to the amount of reward received by an offender for his participation in serious criminal activity. If accepted, the fact that a person was to receive little recompense might reveal something of the offender’s status in the organisation and the nature of his role in the ongoing business. But beyond that I do not consider that it is a matter of mitigation that a person is prepared to involve himself in serious criminal activity for little reward, particularly where the consequence of his actions is to significantly assist in the dissemination of large quantity of drugs into the community. 
     
      
    19 In my opinion it was open to the Judge to come to the conclusion that he did. In any event I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed, however it was derived was manifestly excessive. I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Howie J. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes and with his reasons. I wish only to add the following observations, reflecting the route by which I have arrived at the same conclusions. 
     
      
    2 The appellants, brothers, and a third brother, were arraigned on an indictment, the first count of which was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between about 1 September 2003 and about 14 October 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other and with [Z] and diverse other persons to deal with money to the value of $1,000,000 or more where there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime and where the [appellant and another man] were reckless as to the fact that there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime contrary to s 11.5(1) and sub-s 400.3(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      A second count was in identical terms except for the dates specified. 
      
    3 After a lengthy trial the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of each count against each appellant. They were unable to agree in relation to the third accused.4 The appellants now appeal against the convictions. The sole ground of appeal in each case is expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellants were tried and convicted of an offence not otherwise known to law.” 
        
       
      
    5 Howie J has outlined the facts alleged by the Crown. I shall restate only what is necessary for an understanding of my reasons. But very briefly, what the Crown alleged was this.  
     
      
    6 The two appellants operated a money exchange business known as Exchange Point. In 2003 an Israeli national now to be referred to as “Z” flew to Australia and took possession of more than $2 million dollars in cash. He delivered it, in batches, to the appellants at their business premises. The appellants then arranged for the money to be collected by Sadiq Habiburahman. In transferring the money to him they knew and intended that he would deposit it, over a period of months ending in May 2004, and in portions each of which would be less than $10,000, into various bank accounts. By breaking the money up in that way, legislation requiring that “significant cash transactions” (defined as transactions involving the transfer of currency of not less than $10,000 in value) be reported to Australian Government authorities, would be avoided. So doing, however, constituted an offence against s 31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (“the FTR Act”). This, in a nutshell, constituted the offence the subject of the first charge of conspiracy. The offence the subject of the second charge of conspiracy was intended to have been committed in a virtually identical fashion, between March and July 2004. Police intervened and arrested the participants before the plan could be brought to completion. 
     
      
    7 In order to appreciate the issues raised on the appeal, and these reasons, it is necessary to understand the structure and approach of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (“the Code”). This has been comprehensively set out in the judgment of Howie J and I do not propose to repeat what his Honour has said. A particularly useful analysis of the Code is to be found in that part of the judgment of Bell J in R v Saengsai-Or [2004] NSWCCA 108; 61 NSWLR 135 that is extracted in the judgment of Howie J. 
     
      
    8 The charges of conspiracy were brought under s 11.5 of the Code. That section relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “11.5 Conspiracy 
         
        (1) A person who conspires with another person to commit an offence punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months, or by a fine of 200 penalty units or more, is guilty of the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence to which the conspiracy relates had been committed. 
          
         
        (2)  
        For the person to be guilty:  
         
          
          (a) the person must have entered into an agreement with one or more other persons; and 
           
          (b) the person and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement; and 
           
          (c) the person or at least one other party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement. 
          
         
        …” 
        
       
      
    9 Thus, where a person is charged under the Code with conspiracy, the Crown must, by s 11.5(2)(b), prove, inter alia, that the person charged and at least one other party to the agreement alleged intended that an offence (punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months) would be committed pursuant to the agreement. It is of some significance that s 11.5(2)(b) (in contrast to s 11.5(1)) is framed in the passive voice; it is not necessary that the physical acts that make up the offence are intended to be or will be committed by any particular person. In particular, it is not necessary that they are intended to be, or will be, committed by any of the conspirators. Two people may, for example, agree to arrange the importation of prohibited drugs by using an unwitting agent, who is wholly unaware that he is carrying the drugs. (In that event, by reason of the doctrine that used to be known as mens rea, and is now, by Div 5 of Pt 2.2 of the Code, known as the “fault element” of the offence, unless the agent can be shown to have been reckless (see s 307.1), no offence will have been committed by that person, but the offence of importing will have been committed by the conspirators themselves.) What is essential to the offence of conspiracy is an agreement, and an intention, that an offence (punishable as set out in sub-s (1)) will be committed. It probably is necessary that it is intended that those acts will be carried out at the behest of the conspirators. 
     
      
    10 The offence the Crown alleged was the subject of the agreement it attributed to the appellants was the offence shortly known as money laundering. Money laundering is made an offence by Pt 10.2 of the Code. S 400.3 (which is part of Pt 10.2) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        400.3 Dealing in proceeds of crime etc - money or property worth $1,000,000 or more 
         
        (1)  
        A person is guilty of an offence if:  
         
          
          (a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
           
          (b) either:  
           
           (i) the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or 
            
           (ii) the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 
           
          (c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more. 
          
         
        Penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years, or 1500 penalty units, or both. 
         
        (2)  
        A person is guilty of an offence if:  
         
          
          (a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
           
          (b) either:  
           
           (i) the money or property is proceeds of crime; or 
            
           (ii) there is a risk that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 
           
          (c) the person is reckless as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime or the fact that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (as the case requires); and 
           
          (d) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more. 
          
         
        Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 years, or 720 penalty units, or both. 
         
        (3)  
        A person is guilty of an offence if:  
         
          
          (a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
           
          (b) either:  
           
           (i) the money or property is proceeds of crime; or 
            
           (ii) there is a risk that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 
           
          (c) the person is negligent as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime or the fact that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (as the case requires); and 
           
          (d) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more. 
          
         
        Penalty: Imprisonment for 5 years, or 300 penalty units, or both. 
         
        (4)  
        Absolute liability applies to paragraphs (1)(c), (2)(d) and (3)(d).” 
          
        
       
      
    11 S 400.3 appears to provide for three separate offences of money laundering where the value of the money or property involved is $1,000,000 or more. (Other sections of Pt 10.2 deal with money laundering in smaller amounts but it is unnecessary to take up time on these.) In fact, s 400.3, properly analysed, creates six different offences, in pairs, graded in descending order of seriousness. The level of seriousness depends upon what is alleged by the Crown to have been the state of mind of the person accused. Common to all offences is dealing with money or other property which either is the proceeds of crime or which it is intended will (sub-s (1)), or which might (sub-ss (2) and (3)) become, an instrument of crime.  
     
      
    12 The six separate offences are: 
     
      
       
      Sub-s (1): 
       
        
         
        (1) an offence of dealing in money/property to the requisite value that is, and is believed by the person accused to be, the proceeds of crime; 
         
         
        (2) an offence of dealing in money/property to the requisite value that is intended by the person accused to become an instrument of crime; 
         
        
       
      Sub-s (2): 
       
        
         
        (3) an offence of dealing in money/property to the requisite value that is the proceeds of crime where the person accused is reckless as to the fact that it is the proceeds of crime; 
         
         
        (4) an offence of dealing in money/property to the requisite value where there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime and the person accused is reckless as to the fact of that risk; 
        
       
       
      Sub-s (3): 
       
        
         
        (5) an offence of dealing in money/property to the requisite value that is the proceeds of crime where the person is negligent as to the fact that it is the proceeds of crime; 
         
         
        (6) an offence of dealing in money/property to the requisite value where there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime and the person accused is negligent as to the fact of that risk. 
        
       
      
    13 By s 400.1(1), “proceeds of crime” is defined as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… any money or other property that is derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence).” 
        
       
      
    14 An “instrument of crime” is defined in s 400.1(1) as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [money or property that] is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence).” 
        
       
       
      I will henceforth refer only to the offence as an indictable offence, without unncessarily complicating this judgment by reference to the qualification that follows in the definition. 
       
      
    15 The distinguishing feature between the first and second offence in each pair is temporal: the first is an offence where an indictable offence has already been committed, yielding the money or property as proceeds; the second is an offence where an indictable offence is envisaged or contemplated in the future. 
     
      
    16 The offences alleged to be the subject of the conspiracy with which the appellants were charged were of the fourth variety, as provided for by s 400.3(2). An offence of such a kind is established where the Crown proves:  
     
      
    · that the person accused deals with money or other property; and  
     
      
    · that there is a risk that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and  
     
      
    · that the person accused is reckless as to that risk. 
     
      
    17 For the purposes of this judgment, it is not necessary to pay any further attention to offences constituted by dealing in proceeds of crime (that is, crime already committed); nor to those in which the state of mind of the person accused is said to be intention or negligence. These reasons are confined to a consideration of a charge that an accused deals in money or property as to which there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (ie will be used in, or to facilitate, the commission of a crime), and that the person accused is reckless as to that risk; nor is it necessary to be further concerned with the concept of “dealing in money”; it was accepted in the trial by the appellants that, by receiving the money from Z, they were, for the purposes of the section, dealing in money. 
     
      
    18 The offence of money laundering is, for relevant purposes, committed when money or property is received by a person with the relevant state of mind. Although an offence of conspiracy to money laundering may be committed where the arrangement is that some other person will receive the money or property, that is not what was here planned. The physical acts constituting money laundering were to be committed (and in fact were committed) by the appellants themselves. The fact that the physical acts said to constitute the proposed or intended offence of money laundering were, in this case, the physical acts of the appellants themselves removes one potential complication. 
     
      
    19 As set out above, by s 400.3 of the Code, the fault (mental) element of the offence of money laundering may be intention, recklessness, or negligence. That state of mind must be shown to exist at the time of the “dealing” alleged. An allegation of conspiracy to commit that offence where the fault element alleged is recklessness raises this question: whose state of mind is relevant for the purpose of determining recklessness? I am of the view that that person is the person who performs the physical acts that constitute the crime against s 400.3(2). That is: where A and B agree that an offence will be committed (at their behest) against s 400.3(2) by C, it is C’s state of mind that must be shown to be reckless: that is, reckless as to the fact that there is a risk that the money or property will be used in or to facilitate, the commission of a crime. The state of mind of the conspirators must (because of s 11.5(2)(b)), be intention – ie intention to agree that an offence against s 400.3(2) will be committed; and that offence may be constituted by the fault (mental) element of recklessness. But, because in this case it was alleged that the physical acts of the appellants in receiving the money constituted the physical element of the offence of money laundering, it is not necessary to consider the state of mind of any other person.  
     
      
    20 But the manner in which the offences (of conspiracy) were pleaded and particularised produces this somewhat odd result: the appellants were charged with (intentionally) agreeing to commit an offence the fault element of which was recklessness – ie they agreed to deal in money, reckless as to whether the money would be used in, or to facilitate, the commission of a crime. 
     
      
    21 Such a proposition is conceptually difficult to grasp. Logic, or a rational use of English language, would suggest that that cannot be done. But such resistance to the proposition fades when regard is had to the definition in the Code of “recklessness”, which gives the word an extended meaning. 
     
      
    22 “Recklessness” is defined in s 5.4 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1)  
        A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if:  
         
          
          (a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and 
           
          (b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 
          
         
        (2)  
        A person is reckless with respect to a result if:  
         
          
          (a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and 
           
          (b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 
          
         
        (3)  
        The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact. 
         
        (4)  
        If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element.” 
        
       
       
      The references in sub-ss (1) and (2), respectively, to “a circumstance” and “a result” are references to s 4.1 of the  
      Code 
      , by which the “physical elements” of offences are defined as: 
       
       
        
        “(a) conduct; or 
         
         
         (b) a result of conduct; or 
         
         
         (c) a circumstance in which conduct, or a result of conduct, occurs” 
        
       
       
      In the circumstances of the present case, the provisions of sub-s (4), permitting recklessness to be proved by proof, not only of recklessness, but also of intention or knowledge, are of significance. I will return to this. 
       
      
    23 Recklessness, as I have already mentioned, was the state of mind necessary for the commission of the offence the object of the conspiracy – what I might call the subsidiary offence. The recklessness to which the indictment adverted was recklessness as to a circumstance in which conduct that constituted the s 400.3(2) offence was said to have occurred – the circumstance being the existence of a risk that the money would be used in, or to facilitate, the commission of a crime. If the appellants had been charged with the substantive offence of money laundering, by s 5.4(1)(a) the Crown therefore would have had to prove that each appellant was aware that there was a substantial risk that that circumstance existed or would (in the future) exist. But the appellants were not charged with the substantive offence of money laundering: they were charged with conspiracy to money launder. The agreement the subject of the conspiracy necessarily predated the anticipated money laundering. To prove the conspiracy the Crown had to prove that the appellants agreed to commit an offence aware of the relevant circumstance. Where (as here) the circumstance is, itself, the existence of a risk, putting the language of s 400.3(2)(c) together with that of s 5.4(2)(a) produces a result that, at first glance, might appear odd, but which is not in reality, (for reasons which will appear) untoward. The result is this: the Crown had to prove that the appellants intentionally agreed that each would deal with money in the future, and that, at that future time each appellant would be aware that there then would be a substantial risk that there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime (ie would be used in, or to facilitate, the commission of an indictable offence), and (by sub-para (b)) that, having regard to the circumstances known to him, it was unjustifiable to take that risk. That is conceptually unacceptable. But it emerges only from the unextended meaning of “recklessness”. To prove recklessness, by reason of s 5.4(4) the Crown could also prove either that the appellants intended or knew that the money would become an instrument of crime. That is, in fact, what the Crown here set out to do. 
     
      
    24 The concept of “instrument of crime” in s 400.3 introduces into the conspiracy offence here in question a second tier of inchoate crime – the money laundering offence is, for relevant purposes, committed where a second crime is in contemplation. Conspiracy consists of an agreement to commit a criminal act (or an agreement that a criminal act will be committed); where the criminal act alleged to be the subject of the agreement is money laundering, the Crown must also prove that the person accused has in contemplation a second crime. That is because money laundering is, by definition, committed where another crime is envisaged – and is not committed unless some other crime is in contemplation (or has been committed). 
     
      
    25 The second crime in question in this case was said to be a crime against s 31 of the FTR Act. The objects of the FTR Act are set out in s 4 thereof, and include facilitating the administration and enforcement of taxation laws, and the enforcement of laws of the Commonwealth and of the Territories. The FTR Act requires, on the part of various identified entities, such as banks and financial institutions, reporting, to the Director of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (“AUSTRAC”), of “significant cash transactions”. “Significant cash transactions” are transactions involving the transfer of currency of not less than $10,000 in value. By corollary, cash transactions of less than $10,000 are not required to be reported – they are “non-reportable cash transactions”. 
     
      
    26 S 31 of the FTR Act creates an offence of being a party to two or more non-reportable cash transactions where, for any of a variety of reasons set out in the section, it would be reasonable to conclude that the transactions were conducted in that manner for the sole or dominant purpose of avoiding the provisions of the FTR Act. This was the crime of which there was, on the Crown case, a risk of being committed or facilitated by the depositing of the money by Sadiq Habiburahman. Such transactions are commonly referred to as “structured transactions”. Alternatively, the Crown proposed that the crime of which there was a risk was a crime of tax evasion. 
     
      
    27 It is not necessary, in order to prove the existence of a risk that money or property will become an instrument of crime, for the Crown to establish a risk that a particular offence will be committed in relation to the money or property (or a risk that a particular person will commit an offence in relation to the money or property: s 400.13(2) specifically so provides. Notwithstanding that, the Crown case was built upon the proposition that there was a risk that the money with which the appellants dealt would become an instrument of crime by being used in structured transactions in order to avoid the provisions of the FTR Act (or, alternatively, that the money would be used in the commission of a tax evasion offence); and, indeed, that this was what the appellants intended. 
     
      
    28 Thus, incorporating the various provisions to which I have referred, the charges in the indictment may be expressed more simply. The allegation made by the Crown was that the appellants conspired with each other, with Z, and with others, to commit the offence of money laundering. Specifically, the Crown alleged that they did this by arranging that Sadiq Habiburahman, on each of a number of occasions, deposit a sum of less than $10,000, totalling about $2 million, in order to, and in a way that would, avoid the provisions of the FTR Act. It is inherent in the manner in which the charges were framed, and the sub-section under which they were brought, that the Crown was alleging that the appellants were reckless as to the fact that there was a risk that the money deposited would be used in the commission of, or to facilitate, the commission of that crime or in the commission of a tax evasion offence. Bearing in mind the provisions of sub-ss 5.4(2) and (4), it was open to the Crown to prove recklessness either by proving that the appellants were aware that there was a substantial risk that the money would be used in that way, and that, having regard to the circumstances known to them, it was unjustifiable to take that risk OR that they either intended or knew that the money would be used in that way. Although it was not necessary that the Crown prove that the appellants (or either of them) themselves physically dealt with the money, it was admitted by them that, in receiving the money from Z, they did so. (As indicated above, the Crown case was, in fact, that the appellants both knew and intended that the money would be used in that way.)  
     
      
    29 The manner in which the only ground of appeal is framed may not clearly expose its intent. Put simply, it is that it is not open to the Crown to charge, or prove, a conspiracy to commit a crime of which the fault element (or mental state) is recklessness. 
     
      
    30 The appellants’ submissions included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “4.4 … It is contended that a conspiracy under the Code is only committed where the offence the subject of the confederates agreement is intentionally, rather than recklessly, in contemplation and hence intention is the fault element in relation to the physical element of the offence of conspiracy. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        5.7 The contention that a conspiracy under s 11.5 can only be committed where the fault element involves intention flows from a consideration of the following matters: 
         
         
        5.7.1 The statutory prescription that the confederates ‘must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement’ (s 11.5(2)(b)). As a matter of the ordinary meaning of the word ‘intended’ one can hardly be said to intend something to happen when one is reckless as to whether it will happen or not. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        5.7.5 … an additional reason for contending that conspiracy under the Code requires proof of intention under s 5.2 flows from consideration of the fact that no physical element or fault element for a physical element is specified in s 11.5. It is submitted that the gist of the physical element of the conspiracy consists in conduct and that that the fault element for the physical element of conspiracy is intention …”  
        
       
      
    31 These paragraphs from the written submissions, particularly that in 5.7.1, expose the flaw in the argument. 
     
      
    32 It may, for the purposes of the argument, be accepted (as contended in para 5.7.5) that the fault element in respect of the offence of conspiracy is intention. That is beside the point. That intention is the intention to enter the agreement the subject of the conspiracy. It was never suggested by the Crown that the appellants were reckless in that respect, or that recklessness had anything to do with their entry into the agreement alleged against them. On behalf of the appellants heavy reliance was placed upon the provisions of s 11.5(2)(b), requiring, for proof of the offence of conspiracy, proof that at least two individuals intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to their agreement. That is a different intention. There is no reason why that intention does not extend to an intention that an offence against s 400.3(2) would be committed – that is, an offence constituted by dealing in money/property where there existed a risk that the money/property would become an instrument of crime, and where the person who committed that crime would be reckless as to the fact of that risk – that is, would be aware of a substantial risk that the money would be used in structured transactions, avoiding the provisions of the FTR Act (or tax evasion), and that, having regard to the circumstances known, it is unjustifiable to take that risk; or knew or intended that it would be so used. 
     
      
    33 The argument advanced on behalf of the appellants wholly fails to take into account the extended definition of “recklessness” contained in s 5.4(4). Where recklessness may be proved by intention or knowledge, any colour of validity that might otherwise be given to the argument disappears altogether. And both knowledge and intention were what the Crown here set out to prove. 
     
      
    34 The flaw in the appellants’ argument is in failing to identify who the Crown alleged was (or would have been) “reckless” and to what aspect of the facts alleged the recklessness attaches. The appellants’ argument attributes recklessness to themselves, in the formation of, or entry into, the criminal agreement. I accept that recklessness is insufficient for that. But that is not the correct analysis. It is not recklessness as to the agreement that is in question; it is agreement (intentionally entered into) that an offence will be committed that might, inter alia, be done with a reckless state of mind. The recklessness attaches, not to the formation of, or the entry into, the agreement, but to the offence that is to be committed pursuant to the agreement.  
     
      
    35 For these reasons, I agree with Howie J that the appeals against conviction ought to be dismissed. I agree, for the reasons given by his Honour, with the orders he proposes in relation to the Crown appeals against sentence. 
     
      
    36 HOWIE J: The appellants, who are brothers, and a third brother stood trial jointly in the District Court before Judge Woods QC (the Judge) and a jury on two offences of conspiring to deal with money as an instrument of crime of a value of $1,000,000 or more. These are offences contrary to provisions of the Criminal Code (Cth) (the Code) and each carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years. After a lengthy trial the jury convicted the appellants on both counts but were unable to agree in relation to the co-accused Abdul Jaleel Mohamed Ansari (Jaleel Ansari). 
     
      
    37 The appellants were both sentenced on each offence to imprisonment for 4 years to be served concurrently with an overall non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months. They are eligible for release to parole on 17 May 2009. They have appealed against their convictions. The Crown has appealed against the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    38 There is a single ground of appeal against conviction asserting that the offences charged were unknown to law. In effect the appellants’ contention is that it is not possible under the provisions of the Code to charge a conspiracy to commit an offence that has as one of its fault elements recklessness. As the conspiracy alleged was to commit an offence contrary to s 400.3(2) of the Code, which has a fault element of recklessness in respect of a physical element of circumstance, the appellants assert that the charge was bad. 
     
      
    39 To determine the validity of this ground it is not necessary to consider the evidence led in the Crown case in any detail. The Court has not been provided with a transcript of the evidence given at the trial. But in order to understand the argument it is necessary to briefly state the facts. Without intending any disrespect to the appellants but for ease in recounting the facts, I shall refer to the appellant Abdul Azees Mohamed Ansari as Azees and Hajamaideen Mohamed Ansari as Haja. 
     
      
    40 The first count on the indictment was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Between about 1 September 2003 and about 14 October 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other and with [Z] and diverse other persons to deal with money to the value of $1,000,000 or more where there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime and where the said Abdul Jaleel Mohamed Ansari, Abdul Azees Mohamed Ansari and Hajamaideen Mohamed Ansari were reckless as to the fact that there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime contrary to section 11.5(1) and subsection 400.3(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995. 
        
       
       
      The second count in the indictment was in the same terms except that the date specified for the offence was “between about 22 March 2004 and about 29 July 2004”. 
       
      
    41 Evidence was given in the Crown case by an alleged co-offender. He had previously pleaded guilty to a substantive offence of the nature of that alleged in the conspiracy against the appellants in the second count in the indictment, that is an offence of money laundering in June 2004. Judge Graham sentenced him for that offence and an offence in relation to his possession of a large amount of drugs. The Crown appealed against his sentences and this Court considered them in R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342. I will need to return to that judgment later in considering the Crown appeal. In order to continue his anonymity, although I doubt that it is still required, I will refer to him as “Z” throughout this judgment. 
     
      
       
        
        The facts 
        
       
      
    42 The appellants were directors of a money exchange business in Sydney known as Exchange Point Pty Limited (Exchange Point). The first count concerned the dealing by the appellants with over $2 million in cash delivered to them by Z in October 2003. 
     
      
    43 Z gave evidence that his nephew and other associates in Romania recruited him in mid-2003 to travel to Australia for the purpose of dealing with money in which they had an interest. He arrived in Australia on 3 October 2003. He received instructions by phone from Romania and in consequence went to an apartment in Bondi. There he took possession of cash exceeding $2 million from the back of a floor safe located in that apartment. Over a ten-day period he personally delivered this cash to the appellants at Exchange Point. Z then hired a removalist and had the safe transported to a warehouse storage facility. He departed Sydney on 14 October 2003. 
     
      
    44 Within two days of Z's departure the appellants arranged for an associate, Sadiq Habiburahman, to attend at Exchange Point for the purposes of depositing the money received by them from Z into various bank accounts. He did this over a period of several months, depositing the money in sums of less than $10,000. Between 16 October 2003 and 13 May 2004 he banked a total of $1,952,107 on behalf of the respondents. 
     
      
    45 The second count related to a second visit to Sydney by Z in June 2004. However, prior to that visit police had been lawfully intercepting phone conversations between the appellants and Jaleel Ansari in France from October 2003. These involved Jaleel’s contact with an unidentified female named “Usha”. In January 2004 there were e-mails sent by the appellant Azees to Usha making arrangements for her to meet with Jaleel. Two intercepted telephone calls in January have Usha telling Azees that she was “sending somebody again in the future”. 
     
      
    46 Z returned to Australia on 23 June 2004. He attended once more at Exchange Point where a listening device was in place. He was recorded speaking to both appellants. During the conversation Azees asked Z, “Any idea how much?” to which Z replied, “Two, maybe three”. He indicated that it would take longer this time. 
     
      
    47 Z gave evidence at the trial that he understood that he would be delivering between $2 million and $3 million to the appellants as he had done in October 2003. However Z and the appellants were arrested before Z could obtain the money which apparently was to come from the sale of drugs. 
     
      
    48 The appellants were originally charged with the two conspiracy offences and a further 73 charges contrary to s 400.3(2) arising from the same facts. The trial judge severed the substantive offences from the indictment for the conspiracy offences. Following the Crown’s opening the appellants made an application to the trial judge to dismiss the conspiracy charges in the interests of justice pursuant to s 11.5(6) of the Code. The judge rejected the application. They made a similar application at the end of the Crown case but it was again refused. 
     
      
       
        
        The legislation 
        
       
      
    49 In order to appreciate the appellants’ argument it is necessary to have an understanding of that part of the Code dealing with criminal responsibility. This is found in Chapter 2. This is the fundamental part of the Code that sets out the structure and interpretation of offences created or operating under its provisions. This section of the Code was considered in some detail by this Court in R v Saengsai-Or [2004] NSWCCA 108; 61 NSWLR 135. 
     
      
    50 The important provisions of Chapter 2 were summarised as follows by Bell J: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [37] The general principles of criminal responsibility in the Criminal Code do not adopt the common law concepts of actus reus and mens rea. Instead the Criminal Code defines criminal responsibility in terms of proof of the physical elements and fault elements of an offence. The physical elements of an offence may be conduct, a result of conduct and a circumstance in which conduct, or a result of conduct, occurs: s 4.1.  
         
         
        [38] Under the Criminal Code the fault elements of an offence may be intention, knowledge, recklessness and negligence: s 5.1 (additional fault elements may be specified for the physical elements of a given offence).  
         
         
        [39] The Criminal Code provides that a person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct: s 5.2(1).  
         
         
        [40] The fault element of knowledge requires proof of actual knowledge; a person has knowledge of a circumstance or a result if he or she is aware that it exists or that it will exist in the ordinary course of events: s 5.3. 
         
         
        [41] Recklessness with respect to a circumstance requires proof that the person is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist and having regard to the circumstances that are known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk: s 5.4(1).  
         
         
        [42] An offence consists of physical and fault elements. Liability for the commission of an offence is dependent upon proof of each physical element of the offence together with proof of the fault element that is applicable to each physical element. An offence may comprise more than one physical element and different fault elements may apply to each physical element: s 3.1 (provision is made for the law creating an offence to specify that there is no fault element for one or more of the physical elements of the offence). In the absence of specification of the fault element (or specification that there is no fault element) for a physical element the Criminal Code makes provision for default fault elements: s 5.6.  
         
         
        [43] Intention is the default fault element for a physical element that consists only of conduct: s 5.6(1). Recklessness is the default fault element for a physical element that consists of a circumstance or a result: s 5.6(2). 
        
       
      
    51 The appellants were charged with conspiracy to commit an offence under s 400.3(2) of the Code. Section 400.3(2) relevantly provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        400.3 Dealing in proceeds of crime etc.—money or property worth $1,000,000 or more 
         
         
         (2) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
         
          
           (a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
          
         
         (b) either: 
         
          
           
            
             (i) the money or property is proceeds of crime; or 
             
             (ii) there is a risk that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 
            
           
           (c) the person is reckless as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime or the fact that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (as the case requires); and 
           
           (d) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more. 
          
         
         
          
          Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 years, or 720 penalty units, or both. 
          
         
        
       
       …………. 
       
        
         
          
          (4) Absolute liability applies to paragraphs (1)(c), (2)(d) and (3)(d). 
          
         
        
       
      
    52 An “instrument of crime” is defined in s 400.1 of the Code as: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “..money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence).” 
        
       
      
    53 There is a somewhat complicated definition of “deals with money or other property” applying to the provision contained in s 400.2. It is unnecessary to set it out because the appellants made admissions at the trial that in effect accepted that their conduct in relation to the money received from Z came within the ambit of that section. The money was an “instrument of crime” in that Sadiq Habiburahman was to deposit it in various accounts by a series of structured transactions in order to avoid the reporting provisions of the Financial Transactions Reports Act (Cth). It was the Crown case that the money to be received from Z on the visit was to be dealt with in the same manner. 
     
      
    54 At the outset of the trial each of the conspiracies alleged was an agreement between the appellants and others that an offence would be committed by dealing with the money where there was a risk it would be used as an instrument of crime in that it would be deposited by a series of structured transactions in breach of the Financial Transactions Reports Act the appellants being reckless as to that risk. As the trial progressed the particulars of each of the charges were broadened, for reasons that are not presently relevant, to include an allegation that there was a risk that the money received, or to be received, from Z would become an instrument of crime because it was dealt with by structured transactions or for tax evasion. 
     
      
    55 The elements of the offence under s 400.3(2) that it was alleged that the appellants conspired to commit are therefore: the appellants agreed (a) to deal with money (b) to the value of $1 million or more (c) where there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime and (d) where they were reckless as to that risk. Applying the provisions of Chapter 2 of the Code to these elements: (a) above is a physical element of conduct, and (b), and (c) are physical elements of circumstance. The fault element for physical element (a) is intention by reason of s 5.6(1). Absolute liability applies to the circumstance in (b) by reason of s 400.3(4). It was therefore not necessary for the Crown to prove that either of the appellants knew of the value of the money. The fault element for physical element (c) is contained in element (d). It should be noted that even had (d) not existed, the default element for a physical element of circumstance is recklessness under s 5.6(2). 
     
      
    56 The offence of conspiracy to commit an offence is set out in s 11.5 of the Code. It is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        11.5 Conspiracy 
         
         
         (1) A person who conspires with another person to commit an offence punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months, or by a fine of 200 penalty units or more, is guilty of the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence to which the conspiracy relates had been committed. 
         
        Note: Penalty units are defined in section 4AA of the  
        Crimes Act 1914 
        . 
         
         
         (2) For the person to be guilty: 
         
          
           (a) the person must have entered into an agreement with one or more other persons; and 
           
           (b) the person and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement; and 
           
           (c) the person or at least one other party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement. 
          
         
         
         (2A) Subsection (2) has effect subject to subsection (7A). 
         
         
         (3) A person may be found guilty of conspiracy to commit an offence even if: 
         
          
           (a) committing the offence is impossible; or 
           
           (b) the only other party to the agreement is a body corporate; or 
           
           (c) each other party to the agreement is at least one of the following: 
           
            
             (i) a person who is not criminally responsible; 
             
             (ii) a person for whose benefit or protection the offence exists; or 
            
           
           (d) subject to paragraph (4)(a), all other parties to the agreement have been acquitted of the conspiracy. 
          
         
         
         (4) A person cannot be found guilty of conspiracy to commit an offence if: 
         
          
           (a) all other parties to the agreement have been acquitted of the conspiracy and a finding of guilt would be inconsistent with their acquittal; or 
           
           (b) he or she is a person for whose benefit or protection the offence exists. 
          
         
         
         (5) A person cannot be found guilty of conspiracy to commit an offence if, before the commission of an overt act pursuant to the agreement, the person: 
         
          
           (a) withdrew from the agreement; and 
           
           (b) took all reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the offence. 
          
         
         
        (6) A court may dismiss a charge of conspiracy if it thinks that the interests of justice require it to do so. 
         
         
         (7) Any defences, procedures, limitations or qualifying provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence. 
         
         
         (7A) Any special liability provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence. 
         
         
         (8) Proceedings for an offence of conspiracy must not be commenced without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, a person may be arrested for, charged with, or remanded in custody or on bail in connection with, an offence of conspiracy before the necessary consent has been given. 
        
       
      
    57 A question arose at the hearing of the appeal as to the characterisation of the provisions of s 11.5(2). It is unnecessary for the resolution of the present appeal to determine whether, as counsel suggested, they are elements of the offence of conspiracy. They were treated as such by Jacobson J in United States of America v Griffiths [2004] FCA 879. That decision was upheld in Griffiths v United States of America [2005] FCAFC 34. In neither decision was any consideration given to how the provisions of Chapter 2 of the Code would operate on the provisions of subsection 2. For example, if these are elements of the offence, is each of the matters set out in that subsection a physical element of conduct, result or circumstance and what would be the relevant fault element applying? However these are matters that need not be further addressed here. 
     
      
       
        
        The fault element of conspiracy under the Code 
        
       
      
    58 The only issue to be resolved is whether there is a limit upon the applicability of the law of conspiracy to Federal offences in addition to that specified in s 11.5(1). That subsection itself limits the operation of the offence of conspiracy to those offences that are “punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months, or by a fine of 200 penalty units or more”. Further, the section contains restrictions on the operation of the offence in subsections 2, 4 and 5, however those restrictions might be described. On its face it may appear curious that Parliament would not have specified all the limits on the operation of the offence in s 11.5, particularly as it is a relatively modern provision found in a code and was the result of a considerable amount of public debate upon the recommendations made by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee (“MCCOC”). 
     
      
    59 Nevertheless the argument is based upon common law principles. It focuses on the words in s 11.5(2)(b) underlined below: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (b) the person and at least one other party to the agreement  
        must have intended 
         that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement; 
        
       
       
      The argument is that this section indicates that Parliament intended to adopt the Common Law requirement that a person could not enter into a conspiracy recklessly. Reference is made on behalf of the appellants to the definition of “intention” in s 5.2 of the Code, to the definition of “intention” in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, to a “fundamental rule of construction” that words used in a code should be construed as having the same meaning, to texts concerned with the offence of conspiracy at Common Law and to the commentary upon Chapter 2 of the Code in  
      Commonwealth Criminal Code – A Guide for Practitioners 
       by Ian Leader-Elliott and published under the auspices of the Commonwealth Attorney General's Department in 2002 (“the Guide”). 
       
      
    60 It is clear that the provision in s 11.5(2)(b) is aimed at replicating the Common Law requirement that there had to be an actual agreement between at least two persons to commit a crime. If one of the persons was merely pretending to make such an agreement with no intention of carrying it out, such as entrapment by a police informer, there was no offence of conspiracy: R v Kotish (1948) 93 CCC 138 and see Peters v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 493 per McHugh J at [62]. This was the stated purpose of the provision as set out in the MCCOC Final Report on Chapter 2 of the Model Code December 1992 at p 101. 
     
      
    61 It was established at Common Law that the offence of conspiracy was only made out where it was the intention of at least two persons entering into the agreement that an offence be committed, a mere expectation that the offence would take place was insufficient: R v Trudgeon (1988) 39 A Crim R 252. In my opinion even without the existence of s 11.5(2)(b) the same requirement would apply to the offence in s 11.5(1). Further at Common Law a person could not enter into an agreement recklessly as there had to be an intention to agree: R v Lessard (1982) 10 CCC (3d) 61. 
     
      
    62 When considering any offence to which the Code applies it is necessary to consider how many physical elements are contained in the offence. This is because under the Code, generally speaking, any offence is made up of physical elements each with an accompanying fault element: see s 3.1(1). Therefore it is necessary to enquire as to how many physical elements are contained in the statement of the offence in s 11.5(1). 
     
      
    63 In my opinion there is only one physical element in the offence as stated in s 11.5(1). The physical element is encompassed in the words “conspires to commit an offence”. It is impossible to comprehend two people forming an agreement unless the subject matter of the agreement is known. A composite element of an offence has been recognised in offences to which the Code applies: see Lee v R [2007] NSWCCA 71 at [7]. The subject matter of the prohibited agreement under s 11.5(1) is an intention to commit an offence of the kind described in the section. Therefore s 11.5(1) contains a single physical element of conduct being to enter into the proscribed agreement. There is no fault element stated in s 11.5(1), therefore, applying s 5.6(1), the default fault element for a physical element of conduct is intention. Applying the definition of “intention” in s 5.2(1) of the Code, the person must mean to enter into such an agreement. 
     
      
    64 This is precisely what MCCOC intended. At p 101 of the Final Report on Chapter 2 the Committee wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        405.1 Fault elements 
         
         
        The Committee agreed that intention was required and that recklessness would not suffice. This is in accordance with the proposals of the Gibbs Committee,(s.7D(1)(c)), and the common law (Gerakiteys (1983) 153 CLR 317). The concept of recklessness is foreign to an offence based wholly on agreement.1 
         
         
        
       
      The relevant footnote stated: 
       
        
         
        This proposal is also in accord with Gillies, “Secondary Offences and Conspiracy” (1991) 15 Crim LJ 157 at 164, and the following common law authorities: O’Brien (1954) 110 CCC 1; Freeman (1985) 3 NSWLR 303; Nirta (1983) 51 ALR 53; it is contrary to s.48(2) English Draft Code and s.321(2)(b) Crimes Act (Vic). 
        
       
      
    65 In the Guide (which is accessible from the web page for the Model Criminal Code which can be found under the heading “Crime Prevention and Enforcement” on the Australian Government Attorney General Department site at www.ag.gov.au) at 279 Ian Leader Elliot describes the physical element in the offence set out in s 11.5 as “entry into an agreement” that act being accompanied by “an ulterior intention” that an offence will be committed. Although this view may differ slightly from my analysis of the section, the same result generally follows in terms of the applicable fault element for the offence. However, there is a suggestion, at least in footnote 341 on page 791, that it might be sufficient to make out the offence if each of the conspirators acted with recklessness, as that term is defined under the Code, of the other’s intention to commit a crime. This seems to me to be contrary to s 11.5(2)(b) as set out above and a departure from the Common Law to which no reference is made in the MCCOC final report. It is unnecessary to decide the question but I doubt that such a reading extending criminal liability for the offence of conspiracy is correct and will disregard it for the present argument. 
     
      
    66 Thus the offence of conspiracy under the Code is similar to that at Common Law. Both under the Code and at Common Law two or more persons must mean to enter into an agreement that an offence would be committed by themselves or some other person. The differences between the Code offence and the offence at Common Law are that, firstly, under the Code it is not an offence to enter into an agreement to commit a lawful act by unlawful means and, secondly, it is not an offence under the Code to agree to commit a crime for which the maximum penalty is less than that stated in the section. It should also be noted that under the Code it is not sufficient to support a conviction of a conspiracy offence that there has only been an agreement entered into by the parties: there must also be an overt act committed by at least one person toward the achievement of the object of the agreement. 
     
      
    67 Much of the argument before this Court was concerned with whether it was an offence known at law to enter into an agreement being reckless whether an offence would be committed as a result of that agreement. In my opinion there can be no doubt that such an offence was not known to the Common Law nor is it an offence under s 11.5. As I have indicated, that result has nothing to do with the existence of s 11.5(2)(b). It follows simply from applying the provisions of Chapter 2 of the Code to the offence as set out in s 11.5(1). But this conclusion does not resolve the real issue raised by this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
        
        Conspiracy to commit a reckless crime 
        
       
      (a) Common Law  
      
    68 The question posed by the offences with which the applicants were charged is not whether a person could conspire to commit an offence by entering into an agreement being reckless whether an offence would be committed. Nor is the question whether there can be a reckless agreement to commit an offence. As I have indicated the answer to both questions at Common Law and under the Code is “No”. Rather the question raised is, can a person conspire to commit an offence the mental element of which is recklessness? 
     
      
    69 There is authority, to which neither party referred the Court, concerned with a related question under the Common Law. In Churchill v Walton [1967] 1 All ER 497 the House of Lords was concerned with a conspiracy to commit an offence contrary to s 202(2) under the Customs and Excise Act 1952 (UK), an offence of absolute liability relating to the use of fuel for which payment of tax had not been made. The jury convicted the accused of the conspiracy but it was evident from their acquittal of a charge of conspiracy to cheat and defraud that they must not have been satisfied that he knew that tax had not been paid on the fuel. The question was whether he ought to have been convicted of the conspiracy offence even though he did not know all of the facts that made his acts criminal. The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. 
     
      
    70 Viscount Dilhorne gave the main judgment. His Lordship noted that the substantive offence under the Customs and Excise Act was an offence of absolute liability so that it was enough to make out the offence that the fuel was used. It was not necessary to prove that the user knew that its use was contrary to law. The trial judge directed the jury that the agreement charged was to use the fuel that had not been taxed and it did not involve “any proof of dishonest intent or knowledge that such use would cheat the revenue….”. Viscount Dilhorne (at 500) explained the relevant elements of the offence of conspiracy as they related to the facts of the case before the House as follows:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “As has often been said, the offence of conspiracy is the making of an agreement to do an unlawful act. It is the character and content of the agreement that matters, and the accused's knowledge of what in fact has been done is relevant if it throws light on that. Proof of a conspiracy in most cases depends on inferences to be drawn from the conduct of the parties. Proof that fuel, on which the rebate has been allowed and no repayment had been made, had been used by a number of persons acting together in a number of road vehicles could lead to the inference being drawn that they were parties to an agreement to use such fuel and so to do an unlawful act and were, therefore, guilty of conspiracy. The jury were not in this case invited either by the prosecution or the judge to consider whether such an inference could properly be drawn. They were told that it sufficed to establish guilt if such fuel was in fact so used and the accused was a party to an arrangement to use gas oil in road vehicles. The use of gas oil in road vehicles contravenes s 200(2) only if a rebate has been allowed on it and the amount of the rebate has not been refunded. An agreement to use in road vehicles gas oil on which a rebate has been allowed is not, therefore, per se an agreement to do an unlawful act, but it will be an agreement to do an unlawful act if the object of the agreement is so to use gas oil in respect of which no repayment has been made. An agreement which is not to do an unlawful act will not be converted into an agreement to do an unlawful act by the fact that, unknown to the accused, gas oil is used in respect of which the required repayment has not been made. If the appellant had been a party to an agreement to use fuel in road vehicles in contravention of s 200(2), he must have known that that would happen. The conclusion that such fuel was so used without his knowledge leads to the conclusion that he was not a party to an agreement to do an unlawful act.” 
        
       
      
    71 The Court of Criminal Appeal, having dismissed the appeal, certified the following question “whether mens rea was an essential ingredient in conspiracy to commit the absolute offence charged in the count on which the appellant was convicted, and, if so, what knowledge of the facts and/or law on the part of the appellant must be established to prove the charge”. In reference to this question, his Lordship stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In answer to the question posed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in this case, I would say that mens rea is only an essential ingredient in conspiracy insofar as there must be an intention to be a party to an agreement to do an unlawful act; that knowledge of the law on the part of the accused is immaterial, and that knowledge of the facts is only material insofar as such knowledge throws a light on what was agreed. In cases of this kind, it is desirable to avoid the use of the phrase “mens rea”, which is capable of different meanings, and to concentrate on the terms or effect of the agreement made by the alleged conspirators. The question is “What did they agree to do?” If what they agreed to do was, on the facts known to them, an unlawful act, they are guilty of conspiracy and cannot excuse themselves by saying that, owing to their ignorance of the law, they did not realise that such an act was a crime. If, on the facts known to them, what they agreed to do was lawful, they are not rendered artificially guilty by the existence of other facts, not known to them, giving a different and criminal quality to the act agreed on.” 
        
       
      
    72 Viscount Dilhorne was of the opinion that as to the issue raised in the appeal the law was the same for conspiracy as it was where the charge was one of aiding and abetting. His Lordship referred with approval to the following statement by Lord Goddard in Johnson v Youden [1950] 1 KB 544 at 546: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Before a person can be convicted of aiding and abetting the commission of an offence, he must at least know the essential matters which constitute that offence. He need not actually know that an offence has been committed, because he may not know that the facts constitute an offence and ignorance of the law is not a defence. If a person knows all the facts and is assisting another person to do certain things, and it turns out that the doing of those things constitutes an offence, the person who is assisting is guilty of aiding and abetting that offence, because to allow him to say, 'I knew of all those facts but I did not know that an offence was committed', would be allowing him to set up ignorance of the law as a defence.” 
        
       
      
    73 Churchill v Walton was applied in Kamara v Director of Public Prosecutions [1973] 1 All ER 1242 where at 1252 Lord Hailsham stated a number of propositions that he thought to be uncontroversial and one of which was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “………mens rea is an essential ingredient in the crime of conspiracy. This mens rea consists in the intention to execute the illegal elements in the conduct contemplated by the agreement, in the knowledge of those facts which render the conduct illegal (cf Churchill v Walton)”. 
        
       
      
    74 Johnson v Youden was considered and applied by the High Court in Giorgianni v The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 473, a case concerned with the proof of an offence of aiding and abetting a strict liability offence of culpable driving. In the course of the joint judgment of Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ their Honour’s wrote (at 506) (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “For the purposes of many offences it may be true to say that if an act is done with foresight of its probable consequences, there is sufficient intent in law even if such intent may more properly be described as a form of recklessness. 
         There are, however, offences in which it is not possible to speak of recklessness as constituting a sufficient intent. Attempt is one and conspiracy is another. 
         And we think the offences of aiding and abetting and counselling and procuring are others. Those offences require intentional participation in a crime by lending assistance or encouragement. They do not, of course, require knowledge of the law and it is necessary to distinguish between knowledge of or belief in the existence of facts which constitute a criminal offence and knowledge or belief that those facts are made a criminal offence under the law. The necessary intent is absent if the person alleged to be a secondary participant does not know or believe that what he is assisting or encouraging is something which goes to make up the facts which constitute the commission of the relevant criminal offence. He need not recognize the criminal offence as such, but his participation must be intentionally aimed at the commission of the acts which constitute it. It is not sufficient if his knowledge or belief extends only to the possibility or even probability that the acts which he is assisting or encouraging are such, whether he realizes it or not, as to constitute the factual ingredients of a crime. If that were sufficient, a person might be guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of an offence which formed no part of his design. Intent is required and it is an intent which must be based upon knowledge or belief of the necessary facts.” 
         
        
       
      
    75 Giorgianni was applied to a statutory offence of conspiracy to supply drugs in Western Australia v Marchesi [2005] WASCA 133; (2005) WAR 359 where Steytler P. stated at [17]:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “The guilty mind required for the offence of conspiracy comprises both an intention to agree upon the commission of the unlawful act and knowledge of the facts and circumstances which disclose its unlawful nature. Each conspirator must intend that the unlawful act be committed: Giorgianni v R (1985) 156 CLR 473 at 506, per Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ.” 
        
       
      
    76 The situation at Common Law, therefore, is that there is no impediment to a person being charged with a conspiracy to commit an offence that is one of strict or absolute liability. However, in order to be guilty of the conspiracy to commit such an offence the person must agree to commit an act that is unlawful. The person does not have to know that the act is unlawful but needs to know all the facts that make the act unlawful. If a person can conspire to commit a crime for which no mens rea is necessary, there seems to be no good reason why a person could not conspire to commit a crime of which the mental element is recklessness. 
     
      
       
      (b) The Code 
      
    77 So far I have been referring to the Common Law position, but it seems to me that it should be taken to be the position under the Code. This is because it is obvious that it was the intention of MCOCC and the Legislature, which adopted its recommendations, that the offence of conspiracy under the Code was to have a more limited application than the offence at Common Law yet was otherwise to reflect the position at Common Law so far as the mental element of the offence was concerned. 
     
      
    78 In any event it seems that to hold otherwise would be inconsistent with the requirement of s 11.5(2)(b) that the accused and at least one other person “have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement”. The accused must intend that conduct will be carried out that amounts to a criminal offence and he cannot have that intention if he does not know all the facts that would make the intended conduct an offence. It is not enough that he intends that conduct will be carried out that it so happens and by reason of facts of which he is unaware is criminal. 
     
      
    79 The appellants relied upon the provisions of the Code concerned with ancillary liability by way of aiding and abetting. These provisions are found in s 11.2 of the Code. Section 11.2(1) provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1) A person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence by another person is taken to have committed that offence and is punishable accordingly. 
        
       
       
      Section 11.2(3) relevantly provides: 
       
        
        (3) For the person to be guilty, the person must have intended that: 
         
          
          (a) his or her conduct would aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of any offence (including its fault elements) of the type the other person committed; or……….. 
          
         
        
       
      
    80 These provisions accord with the Common Law principles as to aiding and abetting. Because the accused must have intended to assist the commission of the offence by the principal, the accused must have known of all the facts that would make the conduct that he was assisting a criminal offence. Recklessness as to the existence of facts is not sufficient: R v Choi (Pong Su) (Ruling No 12) [2005] VSC 32. This reading of s 11.2 is both consistent with the Common Law and would be consistent with the approach to conspiracy under the Code that I favour. 
     
      
    81 There is one further matter that should be noted. A strict application of the Common Law to the Code offence of conspiracy would have resulted in the prosecution having to prove knowledge on the part of a conspirator of all facts that made the intended conduct an offence including those facts that would amount to an element of an offence to which absolute liability applied. This would be a direct application of the decision in Churchill v Walton. 
     
      
    82 As has been noted, the element of s 400.3(2)(d), that the value of the money was more than $1 million, was one to which absolute liability applied by reason of s 400.3(4). Notwithstanding that the Crown would not have to prove that the accused knew the value of the money exceeded $1 million in proving an offence under that section, it would have to prove that knowledge on a charge of conspiracy to commit that offence by application of the Common Law. However s 11.5(7A) provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Any special liability provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence. 
         
        
       
      A “special liability provision” is defined in the Dictionary of the Code as: 
       
        
         
        (a) a provision that provides that absolute liability applies to one or more (but not all) of the physical elements of an offence; or  
         
         
        (b) a provision that provides that, in a prosecution for an offence, it is not necessary to prove that the defendant knew a particular thing; or  
         
         
        (c) a provision that provides that, in a prosecution for an offence, it is not necessary to prove that the defendant knew or believed a particular thing. 
        
       
      
    83 Therefore (a) of the definition applies to the provision under s 400.3(4). On a charge of conspiracy under the Code, contrary to the Common Law, the prosecution is not required to prove that the accused knew of a fact to which absolute liability applies. Therefore in the present case the Crown did not have to prove that the appellants knew of the value of the money. 
     
      
    84 In my view the type of provision found in s 11.5(7A), and which is also found in the provisions dealing with attempt and incitement, support the argument that the Common Law applies to conspiracy to the extent that there is not a contrary express provision in the Code. Section 11.5(7A) was obviously inserted to ensure that in this respect the Common Law would not apply. If, however, there is an element to which strict liability applies, that is where there is no fault element but the defence of mistake of fact is applicable, see s 6.1, the Common Law would apply and the Crown would have to prove knowledge of that fact by a conspirator. 
     
      
    85 Generally speaking the issue that is raised in respect of conspiracy to commit an offence to which recklessness applies is one of proof of the guilty knowledge of the conspirator rather than the validity of the charge. A charge is not bad at common law on its face just because it alleges a conspiracy to commit a strict or absolute liability offence or an offence that could be committed recklessly. It would be rare for the statement of the offence to show on its face that the allegation was one that relied upon the accused’s being reckless as to a fact that was an element of the offence to which the conspiracy related. It should become apparent if particulars were required to be given indicating how it was alleged by the prosecution that the accused had agreed to commit the offence that is the subject of the conspiracy. Unless the prosecution was alleging that the accused had sufficient knowledge of the facts making the conduct agreed upon a criminal offence, it could not succeed on the charge of conspiracy. 
     
      
    86 If at the end of the Crown case there was evidence proving the requisite knowledge then the trial judge would be required to direct the jury that, before they could convict the accused of the conspiracy alleged, they must find beyond reasonable doubt that he had the knowledge of facts that made the intended conduct an offence and hence the conspiracy a criminal one. 
     
      
    87 In my opinion the conspiracy alleged in each of the charges was not bad at law. There is nothing in the Code that indicates that a person cannot conspire to commit an offence of which the mental element is recklessness and there is no reason otherwise to impose such a restriction on the offence. There are two reasons for reaching that conclusion. Firstly the agreement entered into may be that another person will carry out the conduct. Provided that the conspirators know of all the facts that would make the conduct of the third party criminal, it would not matter that the person carrying out the conduct was committing an offence by acting recklessly. 
     
      
    88 Secondly recklessness under the Code can be proved by both intention and knowledge. Section 5.4(4) provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (4) If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element. 
        
       
       
      Therefore, if the conspirators intended that they would carry out the conduct knowing all the facts that made that conduct criminal it would not matter that the offence arising from that conduct was one for which the fault element was recklessness. 
       
      
    89 It is the second reason that applies in the present case. Provided that the Crown was intending to prove as against the appellants that they knew that there was a risk that the money they dealt with would become an instrument of crime, that is that they knew of all the facts that made their dealing with the money criminal conduct, there was no impediment to the prosecution proving the offences charged. 
     
      
       
        
        The trial 
        
       
      
    90 It will be recalled that the Crown alleged that there were at least four persons involved in the conspiracy; Z, Abdul Jaleel Mohamed Ansari, and the appellants. Z delivered cash to the appellants who, according to the Crown case, had the money deposited in sums of less than $10,000 by Sadiq Habiburahman. 
     
      
    91 In opening the case to the jury the Crown prosecutor explained “structured cash transactions” and then said (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        In each of these conspiracy charges the Crown alleges that the three accused agreed with each other and [Z.] and others to deal with money to the value of one million dollars or more where there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime. That's not all that's alleged. But amongst the allegations is, firstly, in late 2003, secondly around mid-2004, [there was] a conspiracy to deal with money to the value of a million dollars or more where there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime. It sounds complicated, and I’ll endeavour to make it less so. But just on what is the Crown really setting out to prove about this dealing with money of a million dollars or more where there was a risk it would become an instrument of crime. The Crown alleges that the circumstances in particulars in which money of a million dollars or more was in fact delivered to two of the Ansaris, that’s Azees and Haja, at a money exchange business in Sussex Street Sydney which they ran called Exchange Point. The circumstances of the delivery of that money objectively are enough that there's more to place (sic) the largest question mark over the transaction that was going on, whatever it was, in terms of what was the intended use of that money. I will be coming in a little more detail to that. But that part of the Crown case importantly involves evidence from [Z.] who presently is in prison in custody in New South Wales in relation to, amongst other things, to that matter. 
         
         
        What occurred in the period of about 10 days or so leading up to the middle of October 2003 was that [Z.] handed over to Azees and Haja at the money exchange business, Exchange Point in Sussex Street Sydney, large amounts of cash. The Crown expects he will tell you that his estimation was that it was over two million dollars, somewhere around 2 to 2.2 million dollars.  
        And the circumstances in which he came to Australia, got his hands on the money, met Azees and Haja and handed the money over, alone are enough to establish beyond reasonable doubt that, however it would come about, there was a risk that that money once in the hands of Azees and Haja would become an instrument of crime 
        . 
         
         
        The evidence is somewhat more specific on the Crown case about what did happen to some or all of that money. [Z.] came to Sydney from Israel for a short period of time in October 2003. Got cash money, handed it over to Azees and Haja, and flew out of Australia on 14 October 2003 going back to Israel via Hong Kong. The Crown says that the next day, 15 October 2003, in effect Azees and Haja commenced a series of structured cash deposits at various branches of various banks in Sydney and these went on for a period of months. In order to physically get the parcels of cash, which were the subject of the structured deposits into the bank branches they used a friend, Sadiq Habiburahman, who is not on trial, to go to the bank with bank deposit slips with account names and numbers on them, and amounts written on them all under $10,000 corresponding to parcels of cash which were put into the bank accounts. 
         
         
        Now the Crown says that on the part of Azees and Haja those structured cash deposits meant that the cash they had got from whatever source it came from, but inferentially at least in part from [Z.]. But from whatever source Azees and Haja got cash, if they used it, and on the Crown allegation they did in structured cash deposits, they did so making the use unlawful. That is contrary to the legislation about the Austrack reporting obligation.  
        So that when they received cash from [Z.], by way of illustration, and when the day after [Z.] left Australia, cash was used for many structured deposits, there is a connection between the two events that will ultimately enable you members of the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that, when they got that cash off [Z.] there was a risk that it would become an instrument of crime, because it was going to be used in the way that it was used, that is for structured cash deposits. It comes down to this. You receive money, approximate to your receipt you do something with it, that's unlawful use of the money. The question is on that scenario when you receive the money knowing what you're going to do with it, if you're going to do something unlawful with it, then, when you receive it, there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime. 
         Now that's in very brief compass, that aspect of each of the conspiracy charges and I put it very briefly in the context of the first charge, because [Z.] on the Crown case came to and gave Azees and Haja two million dollars plus. Then immediately after he left considerable structuring of cash occurred out of the Exchange Point business from Azees and Haja through the assistance that they arranged of Mr Sadiq Habiburahman putting the cash in the bank accounts. 
         
         
        Now the Crown says that in addition to having received the money in the circumstances in which they received it, so far as concerns Azees and Haja, there was a risk that it would become an instrument of crime. In addition to that the Crown says that they were reckless as to the fact that there was such a risk. That is they were reckless as to fact that the money would become an instrument of crime. 
         The Crown will be relying upon in respect of the first conspiracy, the same body of evidence which includes evidence of substantial structuring, in relevant terms contemporaneous, whether the receipt of that two million dollars or so cash from [Z.] in October 2003.  
        Now you may be asking yourselves, well if the Crown has evidence that it says Azees and Haja did with money that [Z.] gave them, why beat about the bush with the charge that talks about a risk and a charge of talks about being reckless, and the Crown seems to be saying well Azees and Haja got the money knowing full well what was going to happen to it and that's what they did with it. That's in part to the extent that its of any relevan[ce] related to the position of the third gentleman on trial before you Jaleel Ansari. 
         
         
        At the relevant time we are talking in 2003 to 2004, Azees and Haja lived and worked in Sydney. They had each been in Sydney for some years, had been running the Exchange Point money exchange business in Sussex Street Sydney for some years. But Mr Jaleel Ansari was not living in Sydney. Was not working here. Had no money exchange business here and never has had on the evidence the money exchange business in Sydney. Mr Jaleel Ansari in this period and some years beforehand had been living in France, and although the specific place in the scheme of things may not be crucial, the Crown evidence will we expect establish that he was living and working in Paris. I won’t say Paris France as our American cousins sometimes do, because you know the one I mean. But there were some communications relevant to the first charge of conspiracy between Jaleel Ansari and his two brothers and the period of the first conspiracy which the Crown proposes to call evidence of and put before you in due course.  
        The Crown says that these communications will establish knowledge and participation by Mr Jaleel Ansari in the first conspiracy. But because he was not living and working here at the time, the Crown is unable to allege against him that he necessarily had all of the knowledge of Azees and Haja in relation to cash money transactions in Australia. 
        
       
      
    92 It is clear from the portions of the prosecutor’s address underlined above, that the Crown allegation in relation to the appellants did not rely upon their being reckless to the risk of the money becoming an instrument of crime. Rather it was the fact that they received the money intending to launder it by deposits of less than $10,000 that the Crown said created the risk. The charge was in terms of recklessness because the Crown saw a difficulty in proving that Jaleel Ansari had the knowledge or intention that the money would be the subject of structured cash transactions. 
     
      
    93 The Court does not have the addresses of counsel in the appeal books. But it is clear from a number of issues that were raised, especially at the conclusion of the Crown case, that the Crown was maintaining in relation to the appellants that it would prove that they were reckless as to the risk of the money being an instrument of crime because the appellants intended that it would be used as an instrument of crime. The Crown was alleging that they had knowledge that the money with which they dealt, in the first count, or with which they were to deal, in the second count, was at risk of being used as an instrument of crime because they knew it was money that would be used in the commission of crime or to facilitate crime. 
     
      
    94 At the conclusion of the Crown case a submission was made that the trial judge should dismiss the charge under s 11.5(6) of the Code. The submission was that it was in the interests of justice to do so because the trial was rendered unfair by the manner in which the Crown was attempting to prove the charges. The Judge dismissed the application. In the course of giving reasons he considered the extent to which the Crown could prove that, when receiving the money, the appellants were aware that there was a risk that it could be an instrument of crime. It is clear from his judgment that the Crown was asserting that the risk that the money would become an instrument of crime arose when the money came into the possession of the appellants. They were creating the risk and, therefore, they must have known of the risk because of their intention to deal with the money unlawfully. In effect the Crown was submitting that the money was at risk of being an instrument of crime because the appellants intended to commit a “structuring offence” in relation to it, as the Crown had opened, or because they knew that it would be used to evade taxation and hence they were committing an offence by dealing with the money for that purpose. 
     
      
       
        
        The summing up 
        
       
      
    95 The Judge gave the jury extensive written directions detailing the elements of the offences in both counts on the indictment. In relation to “instrument of crime” the written directions included the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The law says that money may also be an ""instrument of crime"" if used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence. In this case, the allegation is that the money was received from [Z] by the accused and that there was a risk that the money could be used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, either: 
         
         
         (a) an indictable offence of deliberately avoiding the reporting provisions relating to cash transactions (sometimes referred to in a shorthand fashion as a ""structuring"" offence), or, 
         
         
         (b) an indictable offence of deliberately evading Australian taxation laws.” 
        
       
      
    96 In relation to ""reckless"", the written directions included the following (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Here the Crown has to prove that the accused was  
        reckless 
         as to the fact that the money received from [Z.] would become an ""instrument of crime"". The focus here is on the accused's awareness - his conscious realisation of a risk. 
         
         
        To prove recklessness, the Crown must prove that the accused was aware of a substantial risk that the money would become an ""instrument of crime"" in either of the two ways I have described,  
        and 
        , that having regard to the circumstances known to the accused, it was unjustifiable to take that risk. 
         
         
        As a matter of law, it would be sufficient proof of such ""recklessness"" if the accused actually  
        intended  
        to run the risk or 
         knew of 
         the risk. This is what the Crown alleges here. 
        
       
      
    97 The summing up was in accordance with the written directions but of course amplified them. In relation to what was referred to as “element 7”, being “where they were reckless as the fact that there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime” the summing up included the following (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Now in the present case, I repeat, to prove recklessness the Crown must prove that the accused was aware of a substantial risk that the money would become an instrument of crime in either of the two ways I have described. As well, it has to prove that having regard to the circumstances known to the accused it was unjustifiable to take the risk. In the present case the accused have said that it has not been proved that the money was in fact given to them at Exchange Point but even if it was the Crown had not proved that they were actually aware of the risk. 
         
         
        As a matter of law it would be sufficient proof of such recklessness if the accused actually intended to run the risk or knew of the risk and intended to run it. This is what the Crown alleges here. The Crown says that the accused well knew that the money when they received it was at risk of being used in a structuring offence or deliberately to evade Australian taxation laws. 
         The defence says that you would not accept that that awareness was proved. 
        
       
      
    98 In relation to the term ""unjustifiable risk"" the Judge directed the jury:  
     
      
       
        
         
        As I have said, the Crown must prove that the alleged risk taking occurred and that it was, having regard to the circumstances known to the accused, ""unjustifiable"". The Crown case has been presented on the basis that the conduct of the accused was at all times deliberate and conscious, undertaking the full knowledge that what they were doing was secretive and in breach of the laws of the kind set out in this indictment. 
        
       
       
      A little later the Judge stated: 
       
        
         
        ""Recklessness as to risk"" is a key issue in this case. In the conduct of this trial much attention has been directed to whether the accused was in October 2003 and again in June 2004 conscious of a risk that the money would be used in a structuring type offence. The Crown asked you to infer, mainly from their long experience in the money-exchange business and from the various letters and communications with Austrac that the accused well and truly understood at all relevant times that all deposits of cash over $10,000 had to be reported to Austrac - and the next part is important - and correspondingly that it was criminally prohibited to artificially divide up large sums of cash into amounts less than $10,000 with a view to escaping the reporting requirements. It is the latter part which is particularly in dispute in this case. 
        
       
       
        
        Determination of appeal against conviction 
        
       
      
    99 I am of the opinion that, notwithstanding that the conspiracy alleged was to commit an offence of which an element was recklessness, it does not follow that the charge was bad or unknown to law. There is nothing at Common Law or under the Code that prevents the Crown from alleging a conspiracy to commit an offence that might be committed recklessly. The question is whether the Crown allegation is that the accused entered into an agreement intending to commit an unlawful act of the type proscribed. In the words of Viscount Dilhorne the question is, “What did they agree to do?” 
     
      
    100 The Crown was alleging that the appellants agreed to deal with money received or to be received from Z knowing that it was to be used as an instrument of crime, either because it was to be laundered by a “structuring” offence or to evade taxation. The charges were couched in terms of recklessness because the Crown was concerned that it could not prove the requisite knowledge or intention on the part of the appellants’ brother. But the Crown case was left to the jury on the same basis for each of the accused with the Crown undertaking to prove more than mere recklessness. 
     
      
    101 The Crown case was placed before the jury on the basis that the appellants knew of each of the facts that made their dealing with the money from Z, or their intended dealing in the second count, to be a crime coming within the scope of s 11.5(1). They intentionally agreed that the crime alleged would be committed for the purposes of s 11.5(2)(b). They agreed to commit an offence under s 400.3(2). It may also be the case that, on the facts that they knew and having regard to their intention in dealing with the money, they agreed to commit acts that amounted to a more serious offence under s 400.3(1). But that fact cannot affect their liability for the offence with which they were charged. It does not matter what offence they thought they were committing or might have been committing, it is enough that they agreed to commit certain acts with a certain state of mind and a knowledge of the existence of facts that amounted to a conspiracy to commit the offence charged. 
     
      
    102 In my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
        
      The Crown Appeal 
       
        
      Background 
      
    103 By reason of s 11.5(1) of the Code the appellants were liable to punishment as if the offence to which the conspiracy related had been committed. The penalty for an offence contrary to s 400.3(2) of the Code is relevantly imprisonment for 12 years. 
     
      
    104 As has already been noted, the appellants were sentenced on each count to imprisonment for 4 years. The sentence for the first count commenced on 18 August 2006 and that for the second count on 18 February 2007. As against the total head sentence of 4 years and 6 months there is an overall non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months to expire on 17 May 2009, the date upon which the appellants are eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    105 The appellants were sentenced on 10 November 2006 and the Crown appealed by notice dated 6 December 2006. 
     
      
    106 Judge Graham sentenced the co-offender Z for his part in the second conspiracy of which the appellants were convicted. He had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a substantive offence contrary to s 400.3(2) (“the money laundering offence”). He also offered assistance to the authorities including giving evidence against the appellants. He was sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years. That sentence was to be served concurrently with a sentence for an offence of having in his possession a prohibited import being not less than a commercial quantity of MDMA (“the drug offence”). For that offence he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years 2 months with an overall non-parole period of 2 years 7 months. The sentences dated from 28 June 2004 and Z was eligible for release to parole on 27 January 2007. 
     
      
    107 The Crown appealed against the alleged inadequacy of those sentences. By majority this Court allowed the Crown appeal: see R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342. In the exercise of its discretion the Court did not interfere with the sentence for the money laundering offence but increased the sentence for the drug offence to imprisonment for 8 years to commence on 28 June 2005 with a non-parole period of 4 years. As a result Z is eligible to be released to parole on 27 June 2009. 
     
      
       
        
        The facts for sentence 
        
       
      
    108 When sentencing the appellants, the Judge found that Z was a courier “for a very substantial drug dealing organisation which sold drugs into Australia from Europe” and that as a result large sums of money were acquired in Australia that were couriered to places such as Exchange Point for the purpose of having the money laundered. The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “There was no evidence that these offenders, the Ansari brothers, Haja and Azees, knew that Z was involved in drug dealing or that the cash money he moved from Bondi to Exchange Point was a result of drug dealing, nor is there any evidence that they were aware of any other aspect of that operation……….. I deduce that the purpose of using Z. for this exercise was in order to keep apart the various human components of the drug business, thus better to protect the controllers of the business from somebody knowing too much about it. This, I deduce, is the reason why - quite deliberately - these offenders were not caught ""in the loop"", so to speak, about the drug dealing business.” 
        
       
      
    109 The Judge stated that he was not sure precisely how much money was involved in the amount transmitted by Z to the appellants but concluded that it was ""cash money to the value of somewhat more than one million dollars"". The Judge found that the appellants were receiving cash money from other sources in order to avoid paying Australian tax. He held that part of the scheme conducted by the appellants was that they arranged for an associate to make multiple deposits into various bank accounts of less than $10,000 in order to avoid the reporting provisions of the Financial Transactions Reports Act. The Judge noted that Z had left Sydney two days before the deposits had commenced. 
     
      
    110 The sentencing judge stated that Z had returned in June 2004 in order to carry out a similar transaction as had occurred the year before. However Z became involved in receiving drugs that had been imported and was arrested on the 28th June 2004. The appellants were arrested the next day. The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The Crown case was conducted on the basis that count 1 on the indictment was a conspiracy relating to the actual delivery of cash by Z in early October 2003 and that count 2 related to the abortive conspiracy of mid-2004. Each charge is a conspiracy, and therefore it is irrelevant legally in the second matter that the substantive offence was not consummated; it was nipped in the bud by police work.” 
        
       
      
    111 The Judge then turned to the provisions of s 16A of the Crimes Act (Cth) and noted the applicable maximum penalty. He also observed the ""necessity to impose a penalty which will provide a component of general deterrence"". His Honour then stated (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “This ""money laundering"" legislation is recent. It reflects a concern on the part of Parliament and therefore the community that this conduct should be stamped out.  
        The particular offence charged provides a maximum penalty of twelve years but I note that the most serious of the money laundering offences attracts twenty-five years. This does not fall into that category. It involves a component mental culpability of recklessness, combined of course with a component of conspiracy 
        .” 
        
       
      
    112 It should be noted that so far as the underlined portion of this quote is concerned it was irrelevant that the offences before his Honour did not fall into the worst category of an offence of money laundering which carried a greater maximum penalty. It was hardly a matter of mitigation that the appellants had not committed a more serious offence. It was necessary for the Judge to consider the seriousness of the offences with which he was concerned, that is offences that had as their mental element recklessness and, therefore, carried a lesser maximum penalty than if the Crown had charged the appellants with conspiring to commit an offence for which the mental element was intention. 
     
      
    113 As to the role played by the appellants, the Judge stated; 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Both offenders were principals in each conspiracy and, in my view, equally culpable. It has been submitted for Haja Ansari that he is the younger brother and therefore the more likely to be led or influenced, but, for present purposes, I do not accept this. Both played important roles, both worked almost full time in the shop, both were active and their substantial involvement in the facts of this case was on the whole much the same although, obviously, one did one thing and one did another. Relevantly, their personal circumstances are much the same as well.” 
        
       
      
    114 The Judge referred to that part of his summing up where he had directed the jury as to the circumstances in which they could find that the money dealt with by the appellants might become an “instrument of crime” and in particular that it could facilitate a structuring offence or tax evasion. The Judge then held: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…….. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the three following things: 1) That the offenders had the requisite state of mind in relation to a structuring offence or offences to the extent of more than $1 million, that being money being delivered by ""Z.""; 2) That the offenders had the requisite state of mind in relation to criminality evading Australian taxation laws to the extent of more than $1 million, that being money delivered by the man ""Z."". The third matter about which I am satisfied follows from a conclusion that these two things overlap. And similarly satisfied that each of the offenders had the requisite state of mind as described in 1) and 2), which I just mentioned, at the same time in relation to the same money being money delivered by the man ""Z.""; that is, each was relevantly reckless as to the structuring offences being committed and relevantly reckless as to the avoidance of taxation. Further, to clarify it, the conspiracy in each case related to that recklessness………….” 
        
       
       
        
      The respondents’ subjective circumstances 
      
    115 The respondent Haja was born on 12 May 1967 so that he was 39 at the date of sentencing. He had no prior convictions. He was born in India and migrated to Singapore before coming to Australia. His father was a successful businessman. On arrival in Australia the respondent gained employment in a semi-skilled factory position and then as a chef. In 1999 he and his brother opened their own financial company dealing in foreign exchange. The respondent has been married for four years. There was little in the pre-sentence report or the psychological report tendered on his behalf relevant to sentencing. 
     
      
    116 The respondent Azees was born on 24 July 1963 making him 43 years at the date of sentence. He was born in India, leaving at the age of 18 when he moved to Singapore with his family. He is the eldest in the family and has been married for seven years with two children aged six and two. In 1994 he gained employment in the foreign exchange business with a local finance company and opened a business with his brother in 1999. There was nothing in the presentence report or psychological report tendered in his case of significant relevance to his sentencing. Both he and his brother continued to deny having done anything wrong. 
     
      
    117 There were a number of certificates and testimonials placed before the sentencing judge referrable to each of the appellants. 
     
      
       
        
        The legislation 
        
       
      
    118 Division 400 of Part 10.2 of the Code is entitled “Money laundering”. For the purposes of the Division the term “instrument of crime” is defined in this way; “money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence)”. There is also a definition of “proceeds of crime” being “any money or other property that is derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence)”. There is a wide meaning given to the term “dealing with money or other property” in s 400.2. It includes receiving or disposing of the money, importing it into or exporting it out of Australia and engaging “in a banking transaction relating to money or other property”. 
     
      
    119 The offences within the Division, therefore, apply to a large range of activity in relation to money or other property to be used in connection with, or arising from, serious crime. Not only is there a very wide ambit in relation to the conduct caught by the offences but there is also a substantial range of criminal activity to which the money or property could relate, being limited in effect to an indictable offence of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory. The offences are not concerned only with the source of the money or property that is dealt with but also its ultimate use. The offences cover money obtained illegally or to be used for illegal purposes or dealt with in a manner that is illegal. 
     
      
    120 With offences that are so wide ranging in their scope it becomes somewhat difficult to imagine an offence falling within the worst category of its kind against which any particular offence can be measured. It might be thought that dealing with money that is to be used for the purposes of terrorism might be within the class of the most serious offences encompassed by the sections in the Division. But it is perhaps not so difficult to conceive of offences that will form the bulk of conduct falling within the scope of the Division that would come before the criminal courts. The most obvious will relate to money obtained as a result of drug activity and that is being dealt with in order to make it more difficult to track or identify as the proceeds of a particular crime. It may also be money that has been legitimately earned but is to be dealt with in such a way as to disguise its source in order, for example, to defraud the taxation office. 
     
      
    121 But frequently it will be impossible for the authorities to identify the origins of the funds or what is ultimately to be the use made of them, yet it can be shown that the manner of dealing with them was a breach of the law, such as to avoid the mandatory reporting conditions under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act. It may be the case that the persons dealing with the money do not know its source or ultimate destination and do not care provided they are being paid for rendering a service. 
     
      
    122 The legislation itself has attempted to structure offences to give some guidance as to the seriousness of the conduct by reference to the applicable maximum penalty for each offence. The scheme is that the greater the sum of money involved, the more serious the offence. But the legislation also takes into account the mental state of the offender, so that an offence involving the intentional dealing with proceeds of crime or instruments of crime is more serious than one where the state of mind is recklessness as to the criminal nature of the property. Therefore s 400.3(1), where the amount involved is more than a million dollars and where the offender believes that the property is the proceeds of crime or intends that it will become an instrument of crime, provides for the most serious of the money laundering offences carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and/or 1500 penalty units. 
     
      
    123 It is likely that an offender before the court for sentencing for an offence within the Division will be a person facilitating the laundering of the money or actually involved in that process, rather than the owner of the money or the beneficiary of the laundering. The prosecution may not be able to show that the offender knew of the source of the money or its ultimate destination. In Assafiri v R [2007] NSWCCA 159 an analogy was drawn between money laundering offences and drug importations in that both types of offences usually reveal a hierarchy of persons involved in the conduct who have different roles to play and different gains to be made from the commission of the crime. The most important consideration in sentencing an offender for an offence under this Division will be to consider what the offender did, because there may be little or no evidence before the court as to the organisation behind the offence, the source of the funds or the ultimate use to made of them: see R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [19]. 
     
      
    124 However according to normal sentencing principles, if the Crown wants to submit that the particular offence is aggravated by a circumstance that makes it more serious than objectively it would appear to be from the bare conduct of the offender, for example because the money with which the offender dealt was known by him to be intended to support terrorism, then the Crown should prove that fact beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if the offender seeks to mitigate the seriousness of the apparent conduct by some fact, for example that the offender believed the funds were to be used for a humanitarian purpose, then it would fall to the offender to prove that fact on the balance of probabilities. Where however the accused denies the offence or there is no evidence as to his state of knowledge of the source of the funds, the purpose of dealing with the funds or their ultimate destination, the Court must simply deal with the matter on the objective facts as proved by the evidence. That was the case here. The Judge was not required to find facts that were most favourable to the appellants. 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown submissions 
        
       
      
    125 The Crown noted the exceptional nature of Crown appeals and the principles upon which this Court determines such an appeal including its wide discretion whether to intervene and to what degree. The Crown in its written submissions set out the well known passage from R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70] where Wood CJ at CL summarised the relevant principles. It is unnecessary to set them out yet again. 
     
      
    126 The Crown submitted that the sentences were manifestly inadequate and created “an inconsistency in sentencing standards, to the extent that this Court should intervene in order to maintain adequate standards of punishment for offences of this nature”. In particular the Crown complained that the sentences: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) fail adequately to reflect the criminality of the offending, that is, the nature of the offending and the absence of contrition on the part of the respondents; 
         
         
        (b) fail properly to take into account the decision of the Court in R v Z resulting in ""unjustifiable disparity"" between the sentence of Z and that imposed on the respondents; and 
         
         
        (c) fail adequately to reflect the element of general deterrence and the legislative intent of Parliament recognizing the seriousness of such offences. 
        
       
      
    127 In respect of (a) above the Crown complained of the passage to which I have already made reference where the sentencing judge observed that the appellants had not been charged with the most serious offence. In effect the Crown argued, relying on the passage from the remarks that I have already referred to and underlined, that the Judge erred by mitigating the seriousness of the offence by taking into account that the appellants’ culpability was reduced because they were merely reckless. However, recklessness was the designated fault element of the offence that the appellants had agreed to commit. 
     
      
    128 In respect of (b) the Crown submitted that the Judge was too dismissive of the relevance of the sentence imposed upon Z because of his comment that “the man Z was sentenced largely for his involvement with drugs, a circumstance in contrast with that of the present offenders”. The Crown contended that the sentence imposed upon the appellants had resulted in an unjustified disparity with the sentence imposed upon Z. 
     
      
    129 In respect of (c) the Crown submitted that, notwithstanding remarks made by the Judge noting the importance of general deterrence, the sentences imposed did not reflect that element sufficiently or at all. 
     
      
       
       
        
        Determination 
        
       
      
    130 In my opinion the sentences separately and in combination are manifestly inadequate to a very significant degree. As against a maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment and having regard to the nature of the appellants’ criminality, the sentences do not properly reflect the objective seriousness of the offences. 
     
      
    131 I have noted the Judge’s error in apparently mitigating the appellants’ culpability on the basis that their offences were not in the worst category of offending of its type and that they were only reckless as to the unlawful use to be made of the money with which they dealt or intended to deal. Although the Crown actually proved that the appellants knew that the money was at risk of becoming an instrument of crime because the appellants intended to deal with it unlawfully, they could only be sentenced on the basis of recklessness otherwise there would have been a breach of the principle in De Simoni as intention and knowledge were elements of the more serious offence under s 400.3(1). But the Judge had to assess the criminality of the conduct of the appellants having regard to the offence with which they were charged and in my opinion that criminality was very high. 
     
      
    132 The Judge with respect correctly identified the appellants as principals in the scheme to launder the money they received, or were to receive, from Z. They were at the very heart of the conspiracies alleged. But more than that they were intelligent professionals who were engaged in an apparently legitimate finance business used as a cover for dealing with money reckless as to unlawful use to which it might be put, and no doubt relying upon their expertise and business connections to commit their offences. Regardless of what they knew about the source of the money or its ultimate destination, their conduct involved a substantial degree of criminality within the scope of the section. It was obvious that the offences were committed by the appellants for profit and apparently motivated by greed. 
     
      
    133 The first offence was a conspiracy that was put into effect and accomplished its purpose. The conspiracy contemplated probably more than 100 offences contrary to s 31 of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act even if only a million dollars was involved. Each offence under that Act carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. Even if the criminality was aimed in some way at evading taxation, their criminality was more than would be involved in a single offence of tax evasion and, as the Judge noted, some of the offences of tax evasion carried a higher penalty than the offence with which the appellants were charged. A court is entitled to take into account the actual conduct committed under the conspiracy and is not limited merely to a consideration of the agreement entered into: Savvas v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 1. 
     
      
    134 The second conspiracy did not achieve its purposes but only because of police intervention. But, contrary to the view apparently adopted by the Judge, that fact afforded little mitigation of the seriousness of the appellants’ criminality as the gravamen of the offence is the nature of the conduct that the parties have agreed to carry out: R v Warby (1982) 9 A Crim R 349. This is especially so in this case considering that the appellants knew the amount of money that the conspiracy involved, having been told by Z that it was “2 or 3” millions of dollars. Further there is a difference between a situation where the offender has withdrawn from the conspiracy and one where his participation has been frustrated by events beyond his control. 
     
      
    135 In relation to the structure of the sentences to be imposed for the two offences, the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “There are two separate conspiracies, separated in time by a number of months, and it would be inappropriate to sentence concurrently. I will accumulate part of the sentence for the second matter after the lapse of six months of the first sentence. Otherwise, I set the head sentence for each count at the same level. I do so even though the second offence was not substantially consummated, a fact which might ordinarily give rise to a lesser penalty for that. However in the present case that mitigatory fact is negated, as I said, by the consideration that the events giving rise to the first count occurred at a point when each offender was a person of prior good character. The evidence in this trial has revealed that at the time of the second offence, no such claim to prior good character is effective.” 
        
       
      
    136 As I have already noted, there was little mitigation in the circumstances of this case in the fact that the second offence was not consummated. Further, although the appellants had good character at the time of the first offence, that fact was of little significance. No doubt it was because the appellants were of good character that they were able to carry out the financial business that provided the opportunity to commit the offences for which they were being sentenced. 
     
      
    137 In my opinion as against a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years a sentence of 4 years for each offence failed to a very significant degree to reflect the objective seriousness of the criminal activity in which the appellants were involved. The increase in the overall sentence of six months to reflect the additional criminality of the second offence, which, although related through the involvement of Z, was a completely separate act of serious offending, was also manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    138 The Judge in my opinion gave insufficient weight to the sentence imposed upon Z. He paid scant regard to what this Court had said about the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon him because of his view of the significance of Z’s involvement with drugs. Yet Z was charged with only one offence relating to money laundering and was merely to be the courier of the money to the appellants’ business. He was to have had no other role in the second conspiracy for which the appellants were to be sentenced. He was not charged in respect of the first conspiracy. Further he pleaded guilty and gave assistance earning him a considerable discount of the otherwise appropriate sentence. In addition his culpability was mitigated by his mental disorder and the fact that he was to serve his sentence in harsh conditions by reason of his former service in the Israeli army. 
     
      
    139 This Court described the role of Z as being “pivotal” and “a well trusted intermediary”, yet he was obviously less culpable than the appellants who were, as I have said, at the very heart of the conspiracy. It was they who were to actually deal with the money in a way that was going to “wash” it in order to conceal its identity, its source and its ultimate destination. It might be the case, as the Judge noted, that knowledge that the money or property being dealt with was the proceeds of drug trafficking would be an aggravating factor. Yet it could not in my opinion be accorded such significance in the sentencing of Z so as to override a consideration of what he was to do as part of the conspiracy. Contrary to the view expressed by the Judge, a knowledge of the source of the funds as the proceeds of drug trafficking cannot alone justify a sentence at the top of the scale regardless of the actual conduct of the offender. 
     
      
    140 In any event the lack of knowledge on the part of the appellants as to the source of the funds cannot be given too much weight. There is no suggestion that they inquired as to the origins of the money they received, or were to receive, from Z and were misled as to the true position. They did not inquire about the source of the money because either they did not care or they did not wish to know. 
     
      
    141 The notional starting sentence for Z determined by Judge Graham was five years before discount for the plea and assistance. This was held by this Court to be inadequate to reflect his criminality notwithstanding any mitigation as a result of his psychiatric condition: see [2006] NSWCCA 342 at [33] per Beazley JA, with whom I agreed. The majority of the Court thought that the notional head sentence for Z should have been 7 years before the application of discounts. 
     
      
    142 A consideration of the sentence imposed upon Z, and more particularly the notional starting sentence, for the purpose of this appeal is not undertaken in order to achieve parity between the appellants and Z. That is not the purpose of a Crown appeal. But a sentence imposed upon a co-offender can reveal that a miscarriage of the sentencing discretion must have occurred in respect of a respondent to a Crown appeal. In this case, however, there was in my opinion a clear error in the Judge failing to have sufficient regard to what this Court said in relation to the sentence of Z by dismissing its relevance because of Z’s knowledge of the source of the funds. This was a failure by the Judge to understand the seriousness with which this Court considered the conduct in which Z and the appellants were involved and the guidance it provided as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the appellants who, in my opinion, were clearly more culpable than Z. 
     
      
    143 It was argued on behalf of the appellants that the Judge was more able to determine the criminality of Z as compared with the appellants than was Judge Graham, who sentenced Z. It was argued that Judge Woods had a better opportunity to observe Z when he gave evidence in the trial than did Judge Graham, because Z had pleaded guilty before him. With respect that argument is completely misconceived. The jury must have believed Z in order to convict the appellants. Judge Woods made no assessment of the criminality of Z as compared with the appellants, yet determined that the appellants were the principals. On any view Z could not have been described as a principal and was not so described by this Court or by Judge Graham or by Judge Woods. 
     
      
    144 The appellant relied upon other sentences imposed upon persons charged with substantive offences under s 400.3. One was a sentence imposed in the District Court for the more serious offence under s 400.3(1) involving $3 million. There, after a discount for a plea and assistance, a sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months was imposed. On its face that sentence appears manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    145 But it is not necessary to consider other sentences imposed in the District Court. This Court authoritatively set the benchmark for the sentence for the appellants by determining the appropriate sentence for Z. This Court is to be consistent with its own judgments rather than those of District Court judges that appear on their face to be conflicting with this Court’s assessment of the seriousness of such conduct and the appropriate penalty to be imposed. 
     
      
    146 It is unnecessary to consider the third complaint made by the Crown because I have already determined that the sentences imposed upon the appellants were manifestly inadequate as a result of errors made by the Judge. But it must be said that, having regard to the conduct of the appellants, the sentences imposed do not appear to reflect what the Judge said about the policy behind the provisions and the importance of general deterrence. 
     
      
    147 In my opinion, notwithstanding the discretion residing in the sentencing judge and the respect that is to be paid to its exercise, the sentences imposed upon the appellants were so unreasonable that this Court must consider intervening. This being a Crown appeal, the principle of double jeopardy is to be considered. But in my opinion the sentences are so inadequate that this Court should resentence the appellants. However, the sentences imposed should be less than ought to have been imposed by the trial judge. 
     
      
    148 In my opinion it is appropriate, because this is a Crown appeal, to impose upon the appellants the same sentence as this Court concluded should have been the notional starting point in the case of Z notwithstanding his lesser criminality. That is a sentence of 7 years for each offence even though a sentence of at least 9 years would have been appropriate at first instance. There should be an accumulation between the two sentences of two years to mark the total criminality involved in the two offences given that they were related by reason of the involvement of Z in each. There should be an overall non-parole period of 60 per cent of the head sentence. 
     
      
       
       
      
    149 Therefore I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
         
         
        2. The Crown appeal is allowed in respect of both appellants and the sentences imposed in the District Court quashed 
         
         
        3. In lieu each of the appellants is sentenced as follows: 
         
         
          
          (a) Count 1: imprisonment for 7 years to date from 18 August 2006 and to expire on 17 August 2013. 
          
         
         
          
          (b) Count 2: imprisonment for 7 years to date from 18 August 2008 and to expire on 17 August 2015. 
          
         
         
          
          (c) There is to be a non-parole period of 5 years 5 months to date from 18 August 2006 and to expire on 17 January 2012, the date upon which the appellants are eligible to be released to parole.

     Judgment 
      
      
     
     
      
      Non publication order. The Court has made the following orders: 
       
      1. that there be no publication of the name of the appellant or of any matter that would identify him; 
       
      2. that the appellant be referred to in any record of these proceedings as “RA”; 
       
      3. that the name of the complainant, and any material apt to identify the complainant, not be published. 
       
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant has been charged with one count of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years. A question has arisen at his trial as to whether the record of an interview with the complainant is admissible in evidence. The offence allegedly occurred in August 2003 when the complainant was aged five years and three months. She is now aged nine years.  
     
      
    2 The complainant was interviewed at the time of the alleged offence and a sound recording was made. The Crown now seeks to tender the recording as the complainant’s evidence in chief pursuant to s 9(1) of the Evidence (Children) Act 1997. Before the trial judge defence counsel objected to the tender. It was submitted that before the interview could be admitted the trial judge must be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time she gave the interview, the complainant was competent to give evidence. This submission was maintained in this Court. 
     
      
    3 Before the trial judge and in this Court the Crown submitted that the competence of the complainant to give evidence was only required to be considered at the time she was called to give evidence at the trial. The Crown submitted that the court was not required to consider whether the complainant was competent at the time she gave the interview. 
     
      
    4 For reasons which I have set out below the trial judge determined that the complainant’s interview was admissible in the proceedings. His Honour was however, persuaded that the question of when the competence of the complainant was required to be determined was an issue which justified consideration by this Court and accordingly indicated that he was prepared to provide a certificate pursuant to s 5F(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Although his Honour made his decision on 23 May 2007 his certificate was only provided on the morning of the hearing and it would appear that when he signed the certificate he did not have access to his original judgment. Three grounds were included in the certificate being: 
     
      
       
      “1. I erred in holding that the complainant was competent to give evidence in the form of a recording of a previous representation. 
       
       
      2. I erred in holding that the defence had the onus on the balance of probabilities of proving lack of capacity. 
       
       
      3. I erred in not addressing the tests in both s 13(1) and s 13(2)  
      Evidence Act  
      1995.” 
       
      
    5 These grounds go beyond those which his Honour originally contemplated would justify consideration by this Court. In fact ground 2 misstates his Honour’s finding with respect to the correct approach to the question of onus. 
     
      
    6 When delivering his reasons his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question is fairly raised because the child was only five at the time of making the recording and because there are a number of unclear answers in the course of her communication with the police officer, particularly on the subject of whether she understood the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie. Mr Nash argues that the burden of proof that she is incompetent does not lie with him, but his raising the issue means that the court has to satisfy itself of her competence. I think there is force in what he says. He cites the Victorian decision in  
        Kane v Anor  
        reported in 1993 68 A Crim R which in turn picks up the Victorian Full Court decision of  
        Lyons  
        (1899) 15 Victoria Law Reports 15, which say that 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘counsel for an accused does not have the right to ask questions of a witness concerning that witness’ competence.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        And that earlier report refers to a practice which I think I have observed in this State. It is open to counsel to suggest to the judge questions which might be asked of a witness when examining, in terms of the witness’ competence. But no right to cross-examine exists in either counsel, and it is for the court to satisfy itself as to this question. 
        
       
       
        
        To that extent I suppose it is analogous to a fitness to plead hearing. The burden does not lie on either party, but the court has to be satisfied on the ultimate question. The difference in this case being that there is a presumption that she is competent, and that presumption has to be dislodged by proof on the balance of probabilities. It will return to that later. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not express any view about her competence now, because I have not yet heard from her. If it be necessary to determine her competence, or rather to determine whether she has been proved to be incompetent at the time of making the recording in 2003, I would express myself to be on this evidence, at this stage, unpersuaded. 
        
       
       
        
        True it is, that she gives some answers which are difficult to understand, until one looks at the questions which are asked, the hypotheses which were put to her, and so on. The police officer put the child, bearing in mind that she is five and he is a figure of authority, in an impossible position in asking her whether she could agree that her mother was telling lies in certain circumstances, and so on. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not regard her answers in the recorded interview as demonstrating that she did not have an understanding of the difference between truth and a lie, so that I would not be persuaded she has been proved to be incompetent at the time of making the recording. As I said that is a tentative view, it maybe that there is further evidence which could be called in respect of this question, and so on but, at this stage, I would not be satisfied that she has been proved to be incompetent. 
        
       
       
        
        It is likely in my view, of course, that assuming she is judged to be competent to give sworn or unsworn evidence at this time, that any question arising as to the validity of the recorded interview made in 2003 could be resolved by her adopting that recording now, but it seems to me the question posed by the accused is an important one, bearing in mind that this evidence formulated four years or more ago will become her evidence at the time of the trial. 
        
       
       
        
        At this stage, on both bases, on the preliminary question of her competence, I would rule in favour of the crown. Maybe the time to determine the question is now, but even if I be wrong on that and that competence back in 2003 is an issue, I would not be satisfied on this evidence that she has been proven to be incompetent, and on either basis therefore, I would admit the recording.” 
        
       
      
    7 From his Honour’s reasons the following is evident: 
     
      
       
      1. His Honour did not hold that the defence had the onus of proving lack of capacity of the complainant. 
       
       
      2. Although his Honour did not express a concluded view about the matter he was inclined to the view that the competence of the complainant was only required to be assessed at the time she gave evidence. Notwithstanding this view, his Honour considered the evidence before him in relation to the interview and concluded that on the balance of probabilities, he was not satisfied that the statutory presumption that she was competent to give evidence had been displaced. 
       
       
      3. Because the necessary evidence was not before him his Honour expressed no view as to whether the complainant was competent to give evidence at the trial. 
       
      
    8 In these circumstances it is unnecessary for this court to resolve the question of whether the competence of a witness whose prior interview is tendered must be determined at the time the interview is given. Resolution of that question will require careful consideration of s 13 of the Evidence Act together with s 9 of the Evidence (Children) Act 1997. My tentative view is that the competence of the witness is only required to be determined at the time that person is called to give evidence. If competent the recording of the interview made in accordance with s 9 will be admissible in evidence, subject to s 15 of that Act. That section provides that “if it is satisfied that it is not in the interests of justice for the child’s evidence to be given by a recording” the court may make an order to that effect (s 15(2)). If, notwithstanding s 15 the recording of the interview is admitted into evidence the weight to be given to it may vary depending upon the age of the witness and other matters relevant to the truthfulness and reliability of their evidence revealed by the interview and any cross-examination of the witness. 
     
      
    9 With respect to the issue of competence s 12 of the Evidence Act indicates that except as otherwise provided by the Act every person is competent to give evidence. Section 13 of the Act provides for the resolution of any question as to the competence of a witness. Section 13(5) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that a person is not incompetent because of this section.” 
        
       
      
    10 Subsection (7) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the purposes of determining a question under this section the Court may inform itself as it thinks fit.” 
        
       
      
    11 The meaning of these subsections is plain. A person is presumed to be competent unless the contrary is proved. Any question of competence may be raised by the defence and the inquiry contemplated by subs (7) may be undertaken. Neither the defence nor the prosecution carries an onus. It is for the court to determine whether it is satisfied that there is proof that a person is incompetent. That question must be determined on the balance of probabilities s 142(1). Although reference was made to reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission and the common law (R v Yacoob (1981) 92 Cr App R 313 and R v T (1998) 102 A Crim R 222) the issue must be determined having regard to the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act: see R v Ellis (2003) 58 NSWLR 700. 
     
      
    12 It is apparent from his Honour’s reasons that he has approached the resolution of the question of the complainant’s competence in accordance with the requirements of the section. No error has been revealed.  
     
      
    13 Although it was apparent when the matter was heard by the trial judge that an appeal would be made to this Court it was not filed within time. An explanation for the delay has not been provided although there is nothing to suggest that the applicant himself was at fault. 
     
      
    14 In these circumstances I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with James J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Quang Duc Nguyen appealed against his conviction for supplying not less than a commercial quantity of heroin. 
     
      
    3 At his trial the appellant had been indicted on two charges, namely supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin (count 1 in the indictment) and conspiring to import not less than a trafficable quantity of cocaine (count 2 in the indictment). 
     
      
    4 The jury found the appellant not guilty of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin but guilty of the lesser offence, which was left to the jury as an alternative, of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of heroin. Under the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act the commercial quantity applicable to heroin is 250 grams and the large commercial quantity applicable to heroin is 1 kilogram. 
     
      
    5 The jury found the appellant guilty of the offence charged in the second count in the indictment and no appeal was brought by the appellant against his conviction on that count. 
     
      
    6 No application was made by the appellant for leave to appeal against either of the sentences which were imposed on him for the offences of which he had been found guilty. 
     
      
    7 At the trial the Crown case against the appellant on the first count in the indictment consisted of:- 
     
      
       
      1. Evidence of documents found during the execution of a search warrant at premises in Pyrmont, which connected the appellant with the premises. 
       
       
      2. Evidence of objects found at the premises in Pyrmont being a set of electronic scales with traces of heroin as well as cocaine and three plastic bags containing a total amount of 15 grams of heroin. 
       
       
      3. Evidence of what was said in a large number of lawfully intercepted telephone conversations (approximately seventy) between the appellant and other persons. 
       
       
      4. Evidence by a police officer Det Sgt Luc Nguyen, who was a native Vietnamese speaker and who had had considerable experience in investigating the supplying of prohibited drugs, that the intercepted telephone conversations, while not, on the literal ordinary meaning of the words spoken, relating to the supplying of drugs, had been conducted in a kind of code or cryptic language and did really relate to the supplying of heroin and no other drug, and in many cases to specific amounts of heroin. 
       
       
      5. Schedules prepared by Sgt Nguyen. In Sch A, which became exhibit 68 in the trial, literal English translations were given of Vietnamese words which, on the Crown case, were commonly used by Vietnamese drug dealers to refer to particular quantities of heroin, ranging from .2 of a gram to 1 kilogram. In Sch B, which became exhibit 69 in the trial, Vietnamese words or English translations of Vietnamese words were given, which, on the Crown case, were used by Vietnamese drug dealers to refer to the drug heroin and particular quantities of heroin. In Sch G, which became exhibit 73 in the trial, Vietnamese words were given which, on the Crown case, were all words used by Vietnamese drug dealers to refer to money generally or to particular amounts of money. 
       
      
    8 At the trial it was not disputed by the appellant that he had been a party to all, or virtually all, of the approximately seventy telephone conversations or that the literal translations which had been made into English of the conversations, which had been conducted in the Vietnamese language, were accurate literal translations. Nor was it disputed that the conversations had been conducted in a kind of code and that many of them did relate to drug transactions. However, it was asserted by the appellant in evidence he gave at the trial that those conversations which related to drugs related to the supply of drugs other than heroin and to smaller quantities than the Crown alleged. 
     
      
    9 The grounds of appeal against conviction were:- 
     
      
       
      1. The trial judge erred in admitting opinion evidence from Sgt Luc Nguyen 
       
       
      2. The trial judge erred in admitting opinion evidence from Sgt Luc Nguyen in the form of drug code tables 
       
       
      3. The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury regarding how they were to approach the opinion evidence of Sgt Luc Nguyen 
       
       
      4. The trial judge erred in failing to direct or warn the jury regarding the caution that needed to be taken when evaluating the evidence given in relation to each separate count on the indictment 
       
      
    10 I will now proceed to consider each of the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      1. 
        
      The trial judge erred in admitting opinion evidence from Sgt Luc Nguyen 
       
      
    11 Although there is no copy of the statement in the appeal papers, it can be inferred from other documents, copies of which are included in the appeal papers, that Sgt Nguyen made a first statement, in which he set out literal translations into English of each of the intercepted telephone conversations and then added opinions he had formed about what certain words and expressions used in the conversations really meant and opinions he had formed about what the parties to the conversations were really doing or intending to do. 
     
      
    12 A document described as a statement of facts, a copy of which is in the appeal papers, was prepared. This document incorporated the literal translations into English of the intercepted telephone conversations and Sgt Nguyen’s opinions about the real meanings of words and expressions used in the conversations and about the real nature of the conduct of the parties to the conversations. Sgt Nguyen’s opinions were placed within brackets in the statement of facts. 
     
      
    13 Sgt Nguyen then made a further statement which he commenced making on 19 May 2004, a copy of which is in the appeal papers. 
     
      
    14 It is apparent from the statement of facts and Sgt Nguyen’s further statement that Sgt Nguyen’s command of English is less than perfect. In quoting parts of the statement of facts or the further statement I will quote the parts verbatim, without attempting to correct Sgt Nguyen’s English. 
     
      
    15 In his further statement Sgt Nguyen set out his qualifications and experience, including that he had been a member of the New South Wales police service for almost twenty years, that he had been involved in the investigation of drug dealing and organised crime by persons of South East Asian nationality since 1994 and that he had on hundreds of occasions listened to recordings of conversations relating to the supply of prohibited drugs. He had become extremely familiar with “drug related terminology, drug related prices and the methods of operation” of drug dealers. 
     
      
    16 In his statement Sgt Nguyen then set out what he asserted were the most common quantities in which heroin is sold and some of the more popular terms used by drug dealers in referring to each of these quantities. This part of Sgt Nguyen’s statement was in similar terms to Sch B (exhibit 69). 
     
      
    17 Sgt Nguyen then said in his statement that he had been shown the statement of facts and that the information in the statement of facts was the same as the information contained in his earlier statement. Sgt Nguyen then proceeded to deal with each of the intercepted conversations. These parts of his statement were in the same terms as the statement of facts, and hence his earlier statement, except that he sometimes added further opinions he had formed and in respect of some of the conversations he nominated a specific quantity of heroin as being the quantity of heroin the parties to the conversation were discussing. 
     
      
    18 At the trial counsel for the appellant did not object to certain parts of the evidence proposed to be given by Sgt Nguyen, as set out in his statements, including evidence of the literal translations into English of the intercepted conversations. However, objection was taken to Sgt Nguyen giving evidence of the opinions he had formed, although it is unclear whether the objection extended to evidence of all of the opinions Sgt Nguyen had formed. 
     
      
    19 A voir dire inquiry was held in which the statement of facts, but neither of the statements by Sgt Nguyen, was placed before the trial judge. No oral evidence was given in the voir dire inquiry by Sgt Nguyen or by any other witness. 
     
      
    20 After the hearing of the voir dire inquiry had concluded, the trial judge delivered a judgment containing his rulings. In his judgment the trial judge said in part that there had been no challenge to Sgt Nguyen’s expertise; that Sgt Nguyen could give evidence that among drug dealers certain words, not ordinarily used to describe drugs, are used to describe drugs, in the hope of preventing other persons who happen to hear what is said knowing what the speakers are talking about; that Sgt Nguyen could give evidence “as to the meaning of words and expressions recognised as argot of the drug trade”; and that Sgt Nguyen could give evidence about what prices and quantities of drugs were being discussed. However, the trial judge held that “it is impermissible to give evidence of what a person means when he uses certain words and phrases, that is a witness cannot give evidence of what is in the mind of the person who is speaking or speculate as to what he is meaning”. 
     
      
    21 His Honour then proceeded to apply his general rulings to each of the intercepted conversations as set out in the statement of facts. The rulings made by his Honour with respect to the first six of the conversations were typical of the rulings made by his Honour and I will now set out the relevant paragraphs of the statement of facts and then the corresponding parts of his Honour’s judgment. 
     
      
       
      Statement of Facts 
       
       
        
        “5. At 21:04 on 18 June 2003, during a telephone conversation between Quang (the appellant) and a Vietnamese male person named Thanh, Thanh said, ‘Hello, hello, have you finished charging the battery yet?’ Quang said, ‘Uh..I have’. Thanh said, ‘Since you’ve finished charging the battery, I’m coming over, otherwise I’ll get sick, you know.’ Quang said, ‘Er..who?’ Thanh said, ‘Me.’ Quang said, ‘Why?’ If you didn’t charge the battery, I’d get sick, you know.’ Quang said, ‘Oh really?’ [ 
        The term ‘charging the battery’ used in this conversation refers to preparing the heroin 
        .] 
        
       
       
        
        6. At 14:12 on 19 June 2003, during a telephone conversation between the accused Quang and a Vietnamese male person named Thanh, Thanh said, ‘Yeah, I came up to recover the money from that fuckin’ bitch.’ Quang said, ‘Oh did you?’ Thanh said, ‘Yes.’ Quang said, ‘ind.’ Thanh said, ‘The ten dong man, you know’. Quang said, ‘Really?’ [ 
        The term ‘dong’ used in this conversation refers to one thousand dollars. 
        ] 
        
       
       
        
        7. At 14:31 on 21 June 2003, during a telephone conversation between the accused Quang and a Vietnamese male person named Thanh, Thanh said, ‘Uh how much did you say you had your fridge repaired the other day?’ Quang said, ‘Uh..’ Thanh said, ‘Cause a friend of mine’s just got one fridge that broke down.’ Quang said, ‘Leave it till the afternoon when I get back, leave it till the afternoon when I get back then I’ll have a look, yeah’. Thanh said, ‘The sooner the better, alright?’ Quang said, ‘Okay okay okay.’ Thanh said, ‘Okay bye’ [ 
        The term ‘fridge’ used in this conversation refers to an ounce (28g) of heroin and that the accused Quang agreed to check it when he got back home. 
        ] 
        
       
       
        
        8. At 16:03 on 21 June 2003, during a telephone conversation between the accused Quang and a Vietnamese male person named Quy/Qui, Quang said, ‘Yeah, brother Quy, it’s me Quang.’ Quy said, ‘Mm I know.’ Quang said, ‘Mm well any news brother?’ Quy said, ‘No news as yet.’ Quang said, ‘No news as yet?’ Quy said, ‘Mm.’ Quang said, ‘Okay, let me know straight away when you’ve got any news, alright?’ Quy said, ‘Mm mm.’ [ 
        Quang was anxious about when Qui/Quy would want to purchase heroin from him 
        ] 
        
       
       
        
        9. At 16.34 on 21 June 2003, during a telephone conversation between the accused Quang and a Vietnamese male person named Hung, Hung said, ‘Yeah, listen brother, have you got any good looking girl that you can introduce me?’ Quang said, ‘Who’s this?’ Hung said, ‘It’s Hung, it’s Hung, It’s Hung.’ Quang said, ‘Uh yes yes.’ Hung said, ‘Mm I’ll see you tonight, alright?’ And please let me have a look at the photo if you’ve got one ind’ Quang said, “Okay okay okay okay.’ [ 
        The terms ‘good looking girl’ and ‘photo’ used in this conversation refers to heroin with good quality and sample of heroin respectively and that the accused Quang agreed to meet with Hung for the purpose of supplying heroin. 
        ] 
        
       
       
        
        10. At 20:08 on 21 June 2003, during a telephone conversation between the accused Quang and a Vietnamese male person, Quang said, ‘Yes, chief, can check this you?’ Male said, ‘Mm.’ Quang said, ‘Um…chief…how much did it cost you er…to have…the fridge repaired the other day?’ [ 
        The term ‘fridge’ used in this part of the conversation refers to half-unit (350g) of heroin 
        ] Male said, ‘Said the other day that they probably fixed it for eighty (80) dong a day, you know.’ [ 
        The term ‘eighty dong’ used in this part of the conversation refer to eighty thousand dollars, which is the price for half-unit of heroin 
        ] Quang said, ‘No, I am talking about the kind of Chinese fridge, not a Japanese one, you know.’ The terms ‘Chinese one’ and Japanese one’ used in this part of the conversation refer to heroin of not-so-good quality and heroin of good quality respectively. And when Male said, ‘The Chinese one?’ Quang said, ‘Yes’ Male said, ‘That’s it. They said (ind) eight dong per day. (ind) said they charge higher fees for the labour, remember?’ Quang said, ‘Nuh, I thought the labour fee for is seventy-five (75) dong, yeah?’ [ 
        The term ‘labour fee’ used in this part of the conversation refer to the price of half-unit of heroin. 
        ] Male said, ‘..the catalogue, you know.’ [ 
        The term ‘catalogue’ used in this part of the conversation refers to sample of heroin. 
        ] Quang said, ‘Alright. Still keep their catalogue, yeah? That means um…the labour charged for repairing is eight or seventy-five?’ Male said, ‘Eighty.’ Quang said, ‘Eighty for labour fee?’ Male said, ‘Mm.’ Quang said, ‘I said seventy five, didn’t I?’ Male said, ‘Yeah, you yourself said seventy-five chief.’ Quang said, ‘Okay okay.’ Male said, ‘Mm” Quang said, ‘Alright then, chief can you organise for me to meet the thingo, alright? Organise me…’ Male said, ‘to see the ruler, yeah?’ Quang said, ‘Yes yes look at the book…’ Male said, ‘ind’ Quang said, ..to see how it looks.’ Male said, ‘Mm.’ [ 
        The terms ‘the ruler’ and ‘the book’ used in this part of the conversation refer to the sample of heroin and that the accused Quang would want to have the sample of heroin in order to decide whether to purchase half-unit of heroin for the purpose to supply to VU Tien Hung. VU Tien Hung and VU Van Phu were later charged by police in relation to supplying 793 gm of heroin”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    22 The corresponding parts of his Honour’s judgment were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The first par in that statement is par 5.  
        
       
       
        
        The proposed evidence is an explanation of the term ‘charging the battery’. In my view that is permissible evidence as expert evidence of the argot of the drug trade. 
        
       
       
        
        Paragraph 6. In my view the explanation of the term ‘dong’ is permissible evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Paragraph 7. An explanation of the term ‘fridge’ in my view is permissible. But as to what the accused then agreed to do is not expert evidence in this context so the question in my view is one of fact for the jury. Those are the words that the ‘accused Quang agreed to check it when he got back home’. 
        
       
       
        
        Paragraph 8. The statement is ‘Quang was anxious about when Qui/Quy would want to purchase heroin from him’. In my view it is not expert evidence but speculation and a question of fact for the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        Paragraph 9. The evidence as to the meaning of terms ‘good looking girl’ and ‘photo’ in my view is properly expert evidence, but the words ‘the accused agreed to meet with Hung for the purposes of supplying heroin’ in my view is not expert evidence but a question of fact for the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        Paragraph 10. The opinion evidence as to the explanation of the meaning of certain words as to the weights and values in my view is legitimately expert evidence in this context and is allowed. But the words ‘and that the accused Quang would want to have the sample of heroin in order to decide whether to purchase half a unit of heroin for the purpose of supply to Vu Tien Hung. Vu Tien Hung and Vu Van Phu were later charged by police in relation to supplying 793 grams of heroin’ in my view are findings of facts and not expert evidence.” 
        
       
      
    23 After the trial judge had given his judgment in the voir dire inquiry Sgt Nguyen gave evidence in the trial. From time to time while Sgt Nguyen was giving evidence counsel for the appellant at the trial made further objections, either in effect renewing his earlier objections or contending that the evidence the witness was giving was going beyond what the trial judge had ruled would be permissible evidence. 
     
      
    24 The evidence given by Sgt Nguyen with respect to the first few conversations was typical of his evidence generally and I will now quote or summarise some of that evidence. 
     
      
    25 Conversation at 21.04 on 18 June 2003 (statement of facts par 5) 
     
      
       
      Sgt Nguyen gave evidence:- 
       
       
        
        “A. In my opinion the words ‘charging the battery’ in this conversation is not actually the battery itself. It is not a real battery. It is the code used by Tan so I believe the word using in the conversation is referring to drugs which I believe is heroin, that is what he is referring to, preparing the heroin, yes.” 
         
         … 
         
        “I’d get sick that is in my opinion, my understanding is, I don’t have any heroin so can you prepare some for me so I can sell or whatever”. 
        
       
      
    26 Conversation at 14.12 on 19 June 2003 (statement of facts par 6) 
     
      
       
      Sgt Nguyen gave evidence:- 
       
       
        
        “The ‘Ten Dong Man, you know’ in my opinion in this regard is conversation refer to ten thousand dong when it is referred to – if my understanding this, it should be ten thousand dong, it refers to ten thousand Australian dollars. That would mean ten thousand dong mean” 
        . 
        
       
      
    27 Conversation at 14.31 on 21 June 2003 (statement of facts par 7) 
     
      
       
      Sgt Nguyen gave evidence that the word “fridge” was a reference to heroin. 
       
      
    28 Conversation at 16.03 on 21 June 2003 (statement of facts par 8) 
     
      
       
      In accordance with the ruling made by the trial judge, Sgt Nguyen did not give any evidence of any opinion concerning this conversation. 
       
      
    29 Conversation at 16.34 on 21 June 2003 (statement of facts par 9) 
     
      
       
      Sgt Nguyen gave evidence that:- 
       
       
        
        “’any good looking girl’….is refers to the good quality of heroin… and the word ‘photo’ is referred to ‘sample….of heroin’” 
        
       
      
    30 Conversation at 20.08 on 21 June 2003 (statement of facts par 10) 
     
      
       
      Sgt Nguyen gave evidence:- 
       
       
        
        “A. The ‘fridge’ used in this conversation I am of opinion that it refers to drugs and this drug I believe is heroin. That what it refer to. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to tell us anything about the quantity? 
         
        A. The other thing here when you say ’80, 80 dong’, I am of opinion that the ’80 dong’ here is refer to 80 thousand. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s 80 thousand Australian dollars? 
         
        A. That’s correct sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How does that relate to heroin? 
         
        A. That is the price for the half as unit of heroin at the time, that is, 250 grams is 80 thousand dong”. 
        
       
       
      Sgt Nguyen gave further evidence:- 
       
       
        
        “In my opinion the word ‘catalogue’ used in this conversation is sample. That’s how I understand it”. 
        
       
      
    31 Further evidence given at the trial by Sgt Nguyen about words or expressions used in other conversations included:- 
     
      
       
      Conversation at 16.31 on 23 June 2003 – “I am of the “opinion” that the word ‘go eat out at restaurant’ refers to supply heroin”. 
       
       
      Conversation at 19.02 on 27 June 2003 – “the word ‘car’ used in this conversation, I am of the opinion that it refers to …. half a unit of heroin which is 350 grams”. 
       
       
      Conversation at 19.32 on 30 June 2003 – “’a bowl of pho’ (literally a kind of Vietnamese soup)…In this particular conversation …. Is an ounce of heroin”. 
       
       
      Conversation at 22.19 on 2 July 2003 – “the word ‘thingo’… in this telephone conversation I am of opinion that it refers to …. drugs… heroin”. 
       
       
      Conversation at 21.01 on 6 July 2003 – “in my opinion, these ‘two big girls, kids’ is referring to a full unit. A full unit is 700 grams of heroin”. 
       
       
      Conversation at 4.07 on 29 August 2003 – “… ‘thingo’ in this conversation, I think, in my opinion is referring to money”. 
       
       
      Conversation at 19.24 on 9 September 2003 – “I have the opinion that ‘one exact hour’ referred to in this conversation is referring to half a unit of heroin, which is 350 grams”. 
       
       
      Conversation at 15.37 on 11 September 2003 – “In this conversation the word ‘clothes’ I’m of the opinion that the word ‘clothes’ here is referring to heroin”. 
       
      
    32 On this appeal counsel for the appellant did not dispute that Sgt Nguyen could properly give some evidence which would have been based on his specialised knowledge. It was not disputed that Sgt Nguyen could give evidence that persons engaged in drug dealings often speak to each other in a kind of code or cryptic language, in which words and expressions which do not ordinarily refer to drugs are used by the speakers to refer to drugs. He could also give evidence that certain particular words and expressions, which do not ordinarily refer to drugs, are commonly used by drug dealers to refer to drugs.  
     
      
    33 However, it was submitted by counsel for the appellant, Sgt Nguyen could not give evidence that, in his opinion, particular words and expressions used in an intercepted conversation were in fact being used by the speakers to refer to drugs. Such an opinion could only have been formed by Sgt Nguyen on a basis which included other facts, apart from the mere use of the word or expression. For example, an opinion that the word “fridge” as used in a conversation was being used to mean heroin could not have been formed by Sgt Nguyen, simply on the basis of the use of the word “fridge”, because, as is obvious, there will be many conversations in which the word “fridge” has its ordinary literal meaning, that is “refrigerator”.  
     
      
    34 A conclusion that in a particular conversation the word “fridge” meant heroin could have been formed, only if there were other facts, apart from the use of the word “fridge” in the conversation, supporting a conclusion that the parties to the conversation were talking about heroin, for example, other facts police had gathered about the parties to the conversation indicating that the parties to the conversation were engaged in supplying heroin. However, in such circumstances, an opinion that the word “fridge” meant heroin would not be based wholly or substantially on the witness’s specialised knowledge and hence would not be admissible under s 79 of the Evidence Act. Furthermore, the other facts on which Sgt Nguyen’s opinion was based were not identified in his evidence and Sgt Nguyen had not disclosed any process of reasoning by which he had arrived at his opinion. Insofar as the further facts on which Sgt Nguyen had based his opinions were elicited in cross-examination, this confirmed that his opinions were not based wholly or substantially on his specialised knowledge. 
     
      
    35 In its written submissions the Crown, while opposing the allowing of the appeal against conviction, accepted that Sgt Nguyen should not have given evidence in the form in which he had and that it had become evident at the trial, particularly in cross-examination of Sgt Nguyen, that Sgt Nguyen had, at least in part, inappropriately allowed other information he had received to form part of the basis for his opinions. 
     
      
    36 On the hearing of the appeal the Court was referred to a number of cases, including R v David and Gugea (unreported NSWCCA 10 October 1995), R v Huynh (unreported NSWCCA 13 May 1996), R v Lam (2002) 135 A Crim R 302 and Keller v R [2006] NSWCCA 204. 
     
      
    37 In David & Gugea, a case to which the Evidence Act 1995 did not apply, the evidence against each of the appellants, who had been charged with offences of supplying drugs, consisted mainly of conversations which had been recorded through telephone intercepts or listening devices. The conversations were in the Romanian language and literal translations into English had been made, the accuracy of which was not disputed. It was the Crown case that the conversations related to the supply of heroin. The appellants made unsworn statements at the trial denying that the conversations related to the supply of heroin and asserting that the conversations related to the purchase of gold and brandy and the supply of women for prostitution.  
     
      
    38 According to the ordinary literal meaning of the words used in the conversations, the conversations did not relate to the supply of drugs. However, evidence was given at the trial by a police officer (Sgt Drury) and an analyst and interpreter with the New South Wales Crimes Commission (Mrs Kandic) in which they expressed the opinion that the subject matter of the recorded conversations was in fact the supply of heroin. 
     
      
    39 In its judgment the Court of Criminal Appeal concentrated on the evidence given at the trial by Sgt Drury. The Court held that Sgt Drury, by virtue of his experience in drug law enforcement, was qualified to give expert evidence about the drug trade, notwithstanding that he relied not only on his personal experience but also, to some extent, on hearsay material. The Court continued :- 
     
      
       
        
        “He was entitled as an expert to give evidence that persons trafficking in illicit drugs never (or almost never) refer to drugs directly, even by the names such as ‘speed’ or ‘crack’ by which they are often known; rather, that illicit drug traffickers usually speak in a disguised manner (or in a code) in order to avoid anyone overhearing them becoming aware that they are discussing such activities, and (where relevant) as to the particular codes often adopted (the argot). None of that was in dispute in these appeals. What was in dispute was whether Sgt Drury was entitled to go further and give evidence that, in his expert opinion, the subject matter of these particular recorded conversations was  
        in fact 
         the supply of heroin”. 
        
       
      
    40 The Court concluded that, provided the witness explained how he had reached his opinion, an expert such as Sgt Drury would be entitled to give evidence that the conversations could be referring to the supply of heroin. However, he would not be entitled to give evidence that the conversations in fact referred to the supply of heroin. One objection to evidence being given in such a form was that it was liable to so influence a jury “that they would not trouble to make up their own minds”. 
     
      
    41 As the evidence given by each of the witnesses was in the form of an opinion that the subject matter of the recorded conversations was in fact the supply of heroin, the appeal against conviction was allowed. 
     
      
    42 David & Gugea was distinguished in Huynh, which was another case to which the Evidence Act did not apply. In Huynh the evidence against the appellant, who was charged with conspiring to supply heroin, included tape recordings of conversations. In the conversations the speakers sometimes specifically referred to heroin by name. At other times in the conversations language not literally referring to heroin was used but in contexts where there was discussion about prices, values at wholesale or street level, measurements and quantities and the mixing or diluting of the primary substance which was for sale. 
     
      
    43 In Huynh two witnesses with long experience in the investigation of drug trafficking (an officer of the Independent Commission against Corruption in Hong Kong and a police officer) gave evidence for the Crown, including evidence that in their opinions in particular parts of the conversations the parties were in fact talking about heroin. 
     
      
    44 The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the evidence of the expert witnesses was admissible and dismissed the appeal against conviction. The Court distinguished David & Gugea on the grounds that in David & Gugea there had not been, as there had been in Huynh, “all the background material, including the discussion of weights, measures, quantities and the like and specific discussion of drug dealing and heroin… here the evidence, apart from the opinion evidence, showed that the appellant was a dealer in heroin”. 
     
      
    45 In Lam Sgt Drury, the same witness who had given evidence in David & Gugea, gave expert evidence about what the Crown alleged were coded drug conversations. It would appear that, subject to one exception which was not the subject of any objection, Sgt Drury gave evidence in the form that certain words and expressions used in the conversations were consistent with, and could be references to, illicit drug dealing and not in the form that words and expressions used in the conversations did not in fact have their literal meanings and in fact referred to illicit drug dealing. 
     
      
    46 No objection was taken by counsel for Lam at the trial to any of the evidence given by Sgt Drury and the Court of Criminal Appeal disposed of the relevant ground of appeal against conviction by applying r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 
     
      
    47 The Evidence Act applied to the proceedings in Lam. Levine J, who gave the leading judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal, referred to, and would appear to have accepted, a submission by the Crown that the legal position stated in David & Gugea continued to apply after the coming into force of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    48 The appeal to this Court in Keller was heard and determined after the trial of the appellant in the present appeal, so that the trial judge in the present proceedings did not have the benefit of having this Court’s judgment in Keller. 
     
      
    49 In Keller the Crown alleged that Keller had agreed to purchase cocaine from a man named Purdie. The Crown case against Keller was largely based on intercepted telephone conversations between Keller and Purdie, which the Crown alleged were concerned with the making of arrangements between Keller and Purdie for the supply of cocaine. The appellant gave evidence at the trial in which he asserted that the conversations between himself and Purdie were about the purchase of a motor vehicle and had nothing to do with the supply of cocaine.  
     
      
    50 At the trial an Australian Federal Police officer named Smith, who had had training and experience in the investigation of drug offences, gave evidence in the Crown case of opinions he had formed about the meaning of various words used in the intercepted conversations between Keller and Purdie. The evidence Mr Smith gave included evidence to the effect that certain words and expressions used in the conversations were in fact references to drugs. That the witness’s evidence in the trial was given in this form was somewhat surprising, because in a statement by him which was the principal evidence in a voir dire inquiry held to determine the admissibility of his evidence, he had confined himself to expressing opinions that words used in the conversations were “consistent with” being references to drugs.  
     
      
    51 The leading judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Keller was given by Studdert J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed. 
     
      
    52 In par 23 of his judgment Studdert J said, in part, that counsel for the appellant had conceded, in Studdert J’s view correctly, that “if the witness had limited himself to expressions of opinions as to the consistency of the language used being referable to a drug dealing, the appellant would have no complaint”. However, as Studdert J observed (at par 33 of his judgment) the witness had failed to distinguish “between an expression of opinion that something spoken was consistent with being a reference to drugs and asserting that something was a reference to drugs”. 
     
      
    53 In par 29 of his judgment Studdert J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “29 It seems to me that in a situation such as occurred in the present case where a witness is expressing evidence that the speaker was talking about drugs, it is necessary that there be a manifest foundation for the evidence, namely: 
        
       
       
        
        (i) that it should be made apparent that the opinion expressed ‘is wholly or substantially based’ upon the expert training, study or experience of the witness: s 79 (of the  
        Evidence Act): 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) that the reasoning process of the witness should be sufficiently exposed to enable an evaluation as to how the witness used his expertise in reaching his opinion”. 
        
       
      
    54 With regard to (ii), Studdert J referred (at par 31 of his judgment) to the frequently quoted passage in the judgment of Heydon JA (as his Honour then was) in Makita (Australia) Pty Limited v Sprowles (2001 52 NSWLR 705 at 744 (85). 
     
      
    55 In his judgment Studdert J discussed David & Gugea and Huynh and concluded that “the differing outcomes in David & Gugea and Huynh highlight the necessity for a close consideration of the circumstances of the particular case” (at par 42). 
     
      
    56 In par 42 of his judgment Studdert J concluded that the requirements for admissibility which he had earlier stated in par 29 of the judgment were not satisfied. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “….I do not consider it has been shown that the opinions expressed by the witness were wholly or substantially based upon his specialised knowledge. Further, I do not consider that the reasoning process of the witness has been sufficiently exposed to establish how his conclusion was based upon his specialised knowledge, if such be the case…”. 
        
       
      
    57 Consequently, the evidence from Mr Smith was held not to be admissible as evidence of opinions based on specialised knowledge under s 79 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    58 Studdert J added that, even if the evidence had been admissible under s 79, the evidence should have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act, because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. There was a real risk that the jury would be distracted from making its own assessment of the evidence of the conversations by the evidence of the police officer of his opinions that the conversations were about drugs and, as the reasoning process of the police officer in forming his opinions had not been properly disclosed, the jury were not in a position properly to assess the validity of the police officer’s opinions. 
     
      
    59 After this consideration of the authorities to which the Court was referred, I turn to a consideration of the circumstances of the present appeal.  
     
      
    60 As is apparent from the parts I have quoted, the evidence of Sgt Nguyen about the meanings of words and expressions used in the intercepted conversations, both in the statement of facts which was the principal evidence in the voir dire inquiry and in the evidence Sgt Nguyen gave in the trial, was in the form of opinions by Sgt Nguyen, not that words and expressions used in the conversations could be references to drugs or were consistent with being references to drugs, but that the words and expressions were in fact references to drugs. 
     
      
    61 Evidence in this form was held inadmissible by this Court in David & Gugea and Keller. Huynh can be distinguished from the present case in that there were not in the intercepted conversations in the present case explicit discussion of weights, measures and quantities and uncoded references to drug dealing and heroin. 
     
      
    62 The evidence by Sgt Nguyen was not admissible under s 79 of the Evidence Act as evidence of opinions wholly or substantially based on the witness’s specialised knowledge, because, as is clear, Sgt Nguyen’s opinions that words or expressions were in fact references to drugs were based, to a substantial extent, on matters other than his specialised knowledge, including information about the activities of the appellant which had been conveyed to him by police participating in the police investigation. 
     
      
    63 Further reasons why the evidence by Sgt Nguyen was not admissible as evidence of expert opinion were that not all of the facts on which Sgt Nguyen’s opinions were based were identified in his evidence and Sgt Nguyen failed to disclose the reasoning process by which he had arrived at his opinions. Makita v Sprowles; Keller v R. 
     
      
    64 To the limited extent to which the facts on which Sgt Nguyen’s opinions were based were identified and the reasoning process by which he had arrived at his opinions was disclosed, this served to confirm that his opinions were not wholly, or even substantially, based on his specialised knowledge.  
     
      
    65 Furthermore, the evidence in the form in which it was given, even if it had been admissible under s 79, should have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act on the ground that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant, in that the evidence was liable to so influence a jury as to distract it from making its own assessment of the evidence of the intercepted conversations. 
     
      
    66 I would allow the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      2. The trial judge erred in admitting opinion evidence from Sgt Luc Nguyen in the form of drug code tables 
       
      
    67 Earlier in this judgment I described the schedules or tables prepared by Sgt Nguyen which were admitted into evidence at the trial.  
     
      
    68 In Sch A which became exhibit 68 English words and expressions were set out as being literal English translations of Vietnamese words and expressions referring to particular quantities of heroin ranging from .2 of a gram to 1 kilogram. In Sch B which became exhibit 69 Vietnamese words and/or English translations of Vietnamese words were set out as being words referring to heroin and particular quantities of heroin. In Sch G which became exhibit 73 Vietnamese words were set out as being words used by Vietnamese drug dealers to refer to money or particular quantities of money. 
     
      
    69 In my opinion, all of these schedules would have been admissible, if tendered on the basis that they could be used by the jury for the limited purpose of showing that the words or expressions in the schedules were commonly used by Vietnamese drug dealers to refer to heroin or particular quantities of heroin or particular amounts of money and hence, when such a word or expression was used in one of the intercepted conversations, it could be a reference to heroin or a particular quantity of heroin or a particular amount of money. 
     
      
    70 However, no limitation was placed by the trial judge on the use to which the schedules could be put and the jury were not warned against using the schedules as a kind of dictionary, such that, whenever in a conversation a word or expression in one of the schedules was used, the word or expression was to be interpreted as in fact having the meaning assigned in the schedule.  
     
      
    71 I would allow the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      3. The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury regarding how they were to approach the opinion evidence of Sgt Luc Nguyen 
       
      
    72 It was conceded by counsel for the appellant that no relevant objection had been taken to the trial judge’s summing-up at the trial and hence r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applied.  
     
      
    73 Given the seriously improper form of the evidence from Sgt Nguyen, it is difficult to see what directions could have been given by the trial judge which would have been sufficient to prevent unfair prejudice to the appellant.  
     
      
    74 In the summing-up the trial judge did tell the jury that it was a question of fact for them whether they accepted Sgt Nguyen’s evidence and in summarising the defence case the trial judge did summarise the submissions which had been put by defence counsel why Sgt Nguyen’s evidence should not be accepted. However, nowhere in the summing-up did the trial judge limit the use to which the jury could put Sgt Nguyen’s evidence, if they did accept that evidence, and the general tenor of the summing-up was that, if the jury accepted Sgt Nguyen’s evidence, they should return a verdict of guilty. For example, at p 40 of the transcript of the first day of the summing-up the trial judge told the jury:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case is that the evidence of the phone calls show beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was running a distribution business in heroin. The Crown case is that the expert evidence of Luc Nguyen that is of the code that is being used discloses that the accused is supplying and agreeing to supply heroin. That gives you the evidence of code in the context of the calls that they are talking of heroin and in the section of the text of the call what is the amount and that you would … accept his expert evidence as to the meaning of the code and accept his evidence as to the fact that they are discussing heroin and as to the quantities of heroin which are being discussed”. 
        
       
      
    75 The summing-up was also defective in that the jury were not directed to examine the basis on which Sgt Nguyen had formed each opinion and to determine whether the facts constituting the basis had been proved. 
     
      
    76 I would grant leave under r 4 to rely on this ground of appeal and I would allow the ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      4. The trial judge erred in failing to direct or warn the jury regarding the caution that needed to be taken when evaluating the evidence given in relation to each separate count on the indictment 
       
      
    77 It was conceded by counsel for the appellant that no relevant objection was taken at the trial and hence r 4 applies.  
     
      
    78 It is true, of course, that two trials were being held, that is trials on each of the two counts in the indictment, and it was necessary that the jury understand that they had to consider each count separately and only with reference to the evidence relevant to that count.  
     
      
    79 In the summing-up the trial judge did deal separately and at length with the Crown case and then the defence case on each of the two counts. The trial judge was not asked by either counsel to say anything further than he had. 
     
      
    80 I would refuse leave under r 4 to rely on this ground. 
     
      
       
      Further matters 
       
      
    81 I have decided that the first three grounds of appeal should be allowed. It was not submitted by counsel for the Crown that, if any of these grounds of appeal were allowed and in particular the first ground, that it would be a proper case for the application of the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. It is clearly correct that the inadmissible evidence given by Sgt Nguyen assumed such an importance at the trial that the proviso cannot be applied. Accordingly, the appeal against the conviction on the first count in the indictment must be allowed. 
     
      
    82 A question arose at the hearing of the appeal whether, in the event of the appeal being allowed, the verdict of guilty on the first count should be quashed absolutely or whether a new trial of the charge in the first count should be ordered.  
     
      
    83 In my opinion, a new trial should be ordered. There was some evidence against the appellant on the first count, namely the first three parts of the Crown case which I summarised near the beginning of this judgment, which was independent of any evidence from Sgt Nguyen. 
     
      
    84 Even without any evidence from a witness such as Sgt Nguyen, a jury could, in my opinion, take the view that it would be an affront to common sense to suppose that all of the words and expressions used in the intercepted conversations were being used as having their ordinary literal meanings. It was conceded at the trial which has taken place that many of the words and expressions did refer to drugs.  
     
      
    85 A witness such as Sgt Nguyen could properly give evidence of considerable cogency, that persons engaged in drug dealings often speak to each other in code and that certain particular words and expressions, which were used in the intercepted conversations, are commonly used by drug dealers to refer to drugs and that these words and expressions as used in the intercepted conversations could be references to drugs. 
     
      
    86 In my opinion, the appeal against conviction on the first count in the indictment should be allowed, the verdict of guilty should be quashed and a new trial should be ordered of the charge in the first count in the indictment. 
     
      
    87 The sentence imposed for the first offence was for a period of 12 years and a non-parole period of 8 years both commencing on 14 October 2003. The sentence imposed for the second offence was also for a period of 12 years and a non-parole period of 8 years commencing on 14 October 2005. Accordingly, at this time the appellant is serving both sentences and would not be released by reason of the quashing of the conviction on the first count. 
     
      
    88 It is desirable that, notwithstanding the absence of any appeal against sentence, some consequential orders be made following upon the quashing of the conviction on the first count. It may be that the Crown will not proceed with a new trial on this count. Even if a new trial does proceed the appellant may be acquitted. It is desirable that this Court adjust the sentences at this stage, whilst giving the parties an opportunity of making submissions, if they should wish to do so, on the form of any such order.  
     
      
    89 Accordingly I propose the following further orders:- 
     
      
       
       Quash the sentence imposed with respect to each count. 
       
       
       Re-sentence the appellant with respect to the second count to imprisonment for 12 years to commence on 14 October 2003 and expire on 13 October 2015. Non-parole period of 8 years to date from 14 October 2003 to 13 October 2011. 
       
       
       Stay these further orders for a period of 14 days from the date hereof or until further order.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Many people think that William Kamm is a prophet, able to communicate directly with God and the Virgin Mary. This gives him enormous power over those who have these deluded beliefs. He has taken advantage of these people by satisfying his desire to have sex with young girls.2 The offender is the leader of a religious order based around a community at Cambewarra near Nowra on the South Coast of New South Wales. He has many followers, many of whom live as part of that community. He claims, and his followers believe, that through some miraculous process he is able to communicate directly with the Virgin Mary, for some reason, this regularly occurring on thirteenth of each month. He writes down what she says and these messages are passed onto his followers. 3 At times some of his followers sought to ask the Virgin Mary specific questions. The process which was followed was that the member of the community would write down some questions and the offender would pretend to have received the Virgin Mary’s answers to those questions, which he would also write down and give to the person who was seeking the information.4 This gave the offender a powerful way over which he could manipulate the beliefs and actions of his followers. In particular he was able to control the actions and desires of young girls with whom he wanted to have sex. Thus in the present case the complainant wrote a number of letters to the Virgin Mary and the offender pretended to receive answers from her to those questions, which were then passed on to the complainant.5 The questions were very poignant at times, demonstrating the normal everyday concerns and wishes of a young girl. Not surprisingly, given the age of the complainant at the time, the questions she asked were those of a child, not of a mature woman. The offender’s response, which I repeat he pretended came from the Virgin Mary, was directed to persuading her to do things which would satisfy his sexual desire for her. That appears to have been the primary focus of the offender’s written communications with the complainant.6 The offender told his followers many strange things. One of them, of central importance to the present case, was that there would soon be a new era, that he would be the last pope, living in Germany, and that he would be able to choose twelve queens and seventy-two princesses who were responsible for repopulating the earth once the new era had arrived.7 One thing that the princesses and queens had in common was that this process of repopulation would come about through them becoming pregnant to the offender after impregnation with his “mystical seed”. 8 There is a traditional respect given to religious beliefs. In times past, and it might even still be the case, in this country there was an offence of blasphemy which, although it only applied to the Christian religion, demonstrated that religious beliefs were in a special category of belief. Those who believe in astrology or UFOs are not accorded the same respect as those who believe in an all-knowing god, virgin birth and resurrection from the dead. 9 Some have questioned whether religious beliefs should be in this special category, but that is not a debate I want to enter here. I mention it only to contrast other religious beliefs from those promoted by the offender, and to emphasise that the way the offender manipulated his followers’ religious beliefs is deserving of no respect at all. 10 It is difficult to understand how anyone could have been taken in by the offender, but clearly many were. It is remarkable that although many believed him to be God and that his writings came directly from the Virgin Mary, no-one thought to question why such all-powerful entities were incapable of spelling simple words correctly. The letters tendered in the trial were clearly not the work of an all-powerful, all-knowing god. 11 I am satisfied that the offender does not genuinely believe that the Virgin Mary told him to have sex with the complainant. The offender’s belief is remarkably convenient for a person who wants to have sex with underage girls. I am satisfied he deliberately manipulated the complainant’s beliefs, not because he wished to repopulate the earth, but simply because he wanted to have sex with her when she was fourteen years old. 12 The complainant moved into the community with her family when she was a very young girl. Her mother was, and indeed remains, a devoted follower of the offender, so much so that she consented to the offender having sex with two of her daughters, even while he was married to a third. In those circumstances, it is in no way surprising to find that the complainant told no-one in authority outside the community about what the offender was doing to her until she left the community in 2002.13 The issue at trial was a very narrow one. There was no dispute that at some stage the offender began a sexual relationship with the complainant. There was no dispute that she was a young girl at the time. The only issue was whether the sexual relationship commenced when she was under the age of sixteen or over it. There was evidence which pointed both ways, but there were significant items of evidence which clearly satisfied the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual relationship began in 1994 when the complainant was fourteen, not 1996 or thereafter when the complainant was over sixteen.14 One particular piece of evidence was quite telling: The complainant kept a diary in which she recorded, as well as her childlike thoughts and desires, matters concerning the offender. In one particular entry which, it was common ground was made on 15 July 1995, she records that: 
     
      
       
      “Tonight I will sleep with William, but he can’t do anything because I have my periods since yesterday”.  
      
    15 It is difficult to conceive of any innocent explanation for that entry.16 Despite the conflicting evidence, the case against the offender was remarkably strong. Although the crown case largely depended upon the evidence of the complainant, there was substantial support for her in many areas.17 The offender now stands to be sentenced for six specific offences, but he is certainly not entitled to any leniency on the basis that these were isolated matters. The offender had an ongoing sexual relationship with the complainant which began in 1994 and ended in 1999 when she became pregnant with the offender’s child. 18 The six specific matters for which the offender is to be sentenced are these:Count One19 The complainant gave evidence that on the first occasion she went to the Sovereign Motel with the offender, the offender told her that it was for the purpose of having sexual intercourse with him. Her evidence was that after they got into the room she watched television while he had a shower. He then came of out the bathroom with a towel wrapped around him and got into bed. He asked the complainant to come to bed as well but she refused, saying that she wanted to sleep on the couch. 20 Her evidence was that he got out of the bed and grabbed her arm, trying to pull her off the couch into bed, but he was unable to. She said that at this time he was not wearing anything. That constitutes an offence of aggravated act of indecency for which the maximum penalty is five years’ imprisonment.Count Two21 This concerned an act of sexual intercourse which the complainant said occurred on 7 July 1994, three days before her sister’s twenty-first birthday. Her evidence was that on this occasion, after they got to the motel they both got into bed, the offender showering first. She said that he began masturbating and touching her on the vagina, before taking her underwear off and penetrating her vagina with his fingers.22 She then gave evidence that the accused got on top of her, asked if she was okay, and when she said “yes” he pushed his penis inside her vagina and had sexual intercourse with her. The complainant said that she cried out because it hurt so much. She could not recall whether he ejaculated, but after twenty minutes or so he got off her, turned around and went to sleep. This constitutes an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a person above the age of ten and under the age of sixteen, for which the maximum penalty is ten years’ imprisonment.Count Three23 This count refers to what the complainant said occurred the morning after the events which formed the subject of count two. On this occasion she said that she was in bed with the offender, facing away from him, and she heard him masturbating. She gave evidence that he pulled her nightie up and pushed his penis inside her vagina and had sexual intercourse with her. On this occasion he ejaculated. This constitutes another offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a person above the age of ten and under the age of sixteen, for which the maximum penalty is ten years’ imprisonment.Count Four24 This count concerns an offence committed at a time when the 1994 Soccer World Cup was on. The offender took the complainant and her sister Z to the Sovereign Motel where the offender got two adjoining rooms. The complainant said that she spent the night alone in one of the rooms, while the offender and her sister spent the night in the other. 25 Her evidence was that the following morning her sister woke her up and told her that the offender wanted her to get into bed with him now. She therefore went into the other room, closing the connecting door, and got into bed with the offender. He started touching her on the vagina while masturbating, took her underpants off and put his fingers inside, and then got on top of her and pushed his penis inside her vagina and had sexual intercourse with her. This is another offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a person above the age of ten and under the age of sixteen, for which the maximum penalty is ten years’ imprisonment.Count Five26 This concerned an act of sexual intercourse which occurred in January 1995. The complainant was able to identify a particular date because of entries in her diary. Her diary entry for 10 January 1995 reads: 
     
      
       
      “Anyway, Y went to hospital today and so I went to William to sleep over for a while, and guess what, I have to sleep with William tonight”. 
      
    27 The complainant interpreted that as meaning that she had to have sex with the offender, and although she did not recall any particular occasion at the offender’s house, her evidence was that if her diary said that she had to have sexual intercourse with the offender then she would have, and that the form of intercourse was like she used to have at the motel, namely he would masturbate and touch her vagina and then push his penis inside her vagina. This constitutes another offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a person above the age of ten and under the age of sixteen, for which the maximum penalty is ten years’ imprisonment.Count Six28 Count six related to another event that the complainant was able to identify by looking at her diary. On 26 January 1995 her diary said, “Tonight I have to sleep with Willy again”. That told her, according to her evidence, that she had to have sexual intercourse with the offender whereby he put his penis inside her vagina. Hospital records showed that on 26 January 1995 her sister Y was still in hospital, being discharged on 5 March 1995. 29 That constitutes another offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a person above the age of ten and under the age of sixteen, for which the maximum penalty is ten years’ imprisonment.30 For each offence the circumstance of aggravation related to the fact that the complainant was under the authority of the offender. 31 It was impossible, when listening to the evidence in this case, not to feel deeply sorry for the complainant. She has been manipulated by many people in her short life. Her mother, her current de facto partner and a journalist from Today Tonight all pursued their own interests at the considerable expense of those of the complainant. But I have to be very careful not to punish the offender for the conduct of others over whom he had no control. I will sentence him for what he has done, not for what others have done.32 These offences are not the first committed by the offender. Indeed, he is currently serving sentences for the indecent and sexual assault of another young girl who was also take in by the offender’s manipulations. His aggregate sentence for those matters is one of five years, with a non-parole period of three and a half years, the non-parole period expiring on 13 April 2009. 33 The fact that the offender has committed similar offences in the past is relevant in a number of ways. In particular, he is not to be sentenced as an offender with prior good character, and I must apply the principle of totality when assessing the appropriate sentences for the present offences.34 No material was put today by Mr Stanton on behalf of the offender. Instead, that which I know of the offender’s background comes from a presentence report and a psychological report tendered by the Crown, those documents being prepared when Mr Kamm was sentenced for the earlier offences. 35 The offender was born in Germany and moved to Australia when he was four years of age. He left school at fifteen and began work in the Wollongong area. He gave up full-time work after he began receiving religious apparitions, and is now the head of a religious organisation with many, many followers throughout the world. As I mentioned earlier, many of those followers live in the Cambewarra community. The offender is regarded as a god by them. 36 I have to take into account that there has been a substantial delay between when these events occurred and today when the offender is to be sentenced for his wrongdoing. I do so, but I note that this was not a case where the offender has lived in fear of the knock on the door for many years. What the offender did, by manipulating both the complainant and her family, was to ensure that she would not complain to anyone outside the community about what the offender was doing to her. It was part of the offender’s manipulative efforts that he was able to commit these offences without any fear that the authorities would discover them.37 I will also take into account that it is likely, because of the nature of the offender’s wrongdoing, that he will serve his sentence on protection. No longer is it the case that I automatically assume that the offender will serve his sentence on protection, and that this will necessarily involve conditions of custody that are harsher than those of the general prison community. But there is the risk that those will occur and so I will take that risk into account in formulating the appropriate sentence.38 Under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I am required to consider whether there are aggravating or mitigating features. Mr Stanton referred to no mitigating features. I find that the offence was part of a planned criminal activity. Indeed, the offender’s modus operandi was to pursue the complainant and her parents through the use of fabricated communications with the Virgin Mary, to make them do something they would clearly not otherwise have done. The offender set out to achieve the objective of having sex with an underage girl and used his religious beliefs to achieve his ends. As I have mentioned, part of his planning also ensured that the risk of disclosure to people outside his religious community was minimised. 39 I turn now to consider whether there has been substantial harm caused to the complainant. There is some controversy as to the meaning of the word “substantial” when considering whether an offender has caused substantial harm. Some authorities suggest that harm can only be “substantial” when it is out of the ordinary, that is when the complainant has suffered more than might have been expected from repeated sexual abuse. I regard this controversy as one of categorisation only. There is no doubt that whether the harm caused to the complainant in this case meets the criteria of being substantial, it is something that I am not only entitled to but required to, consider when formulating the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender. 40 As might have been expected from the offender’s conduct, the complainant has suffered enormously, and will continue to do so, perhaps for the rest of her life. Not only is there the usual harm that one sees when a person sexually abuses a child under his authority, but in this case there was significant collateral damage occasioned. That the offender procured the complainant’s acceptance of her unfortunate duty to have sex with the offender, through involving the complainant’s family in his manipulations, has led to a significant and long lasting split in the complainant’s family.41 The offender’s conduct has also severely damaged the complainant’s religious beliefs and her ability to attend church. It is also appropriate to note, in particular, the circumstances in which count two was committed, with the complainant crying out in pain as that offence was committed. 42 As I said, these offences occurred some considerable time ago and the offender is to be sentenced according to the appropriate sentencing tariff which applied at the time. However, neither the crown nor Mr Stanton submitted to me that there had been any change in the way the courts treated offences such as these from the time when they were committed until today, the time at which the offender is to be sentenced.43 Of course, the principle of totality applies here. I will commence the sentences for the present offences at the expiry of the effective non-parole period which is presently being served by the offender. I recognise that this is the latest date on which the sentences imposed by me can commence, but I recognise also that by cutting into the head sentence for those matters, this is itself a factor which automatically gives some effect to the principle of totality. 44 I will give further effect to the principle of totality, as I will explain later. I recognise also that the imposition of cumulative sentences can be a special circumstances, justifying a variation from the statutory ratio in order that the overall sentence reflects the statutory ratio. I note, however, that it was not submitted to me that there are any other special circumstances in this case. Thus the overall sentence will reflect the statutory ratio. 45 I have decided to impose identical sentences on all counts, apart of course from the first offence where the criminal activity involved is much less than that involved in the other five offences. I have given effect to the principle of totality, both as it concerns these six offences and the fact that the offender is currently serving a sentence for other offences, by ordering that the sentences I will shortly announce are largely to be served concurrently. And in fact the level of accumulation is very modest indeed, in some case there being no accumulation at all.46 For count one on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of six months to commenced on 14 April 2009. That sentence is a fixed term because of the other sentences I will now announce. 47 For counts two and three on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of five and a half years to commence on 14 April 2009, and I set a non-parole period of three years.48 For count four on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for five and a half years to commence on 14 October 2009, and I set a non-parole period of three years.49 For counts five and six on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for five and a half years to commence on 14 April 2010. I set a non-parole period of three years for each offence. 50 The effect of my sentences is that the effective non-parole period to be served by the offender, taking into account the sentences he is currently serving, is seven and a half years with an overall sentence of ten years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 13 April 2013.

       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 23 January 2006 the applicant was sentenced by Sides DCJ to a term of imprisonment of three and a half years with a non-parole period of eighteen months for the offence of ongoing supply of heroin for financial and material reward. As the sentence commenced on 2 June 2005, the applicant was eligible for release on parole on 1 December 2006. Following a conviction in the District Court on 10 April 2006 for possession of a mobile phone by an inmate, the non-parole period was extended to 1 March 2007. The overall sentence will expire on 2 June 2008. 
     
      
    2 The New South Wales State Parole Authority (“SPA”) at its meeting on 25 January 2007 considered the application for a review hearing by the applicant and determined that a review hearing was not warranted. The SPA refused the applicant’s release on parole for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Parole Authority has sufficient reason to believe that if released form (sic) custody at this time the offender would not be able to adapt to normal community life, risk of re-offending, need to address offending behaviour (AOD/violence and gambling), poor prison performance.” 
        
       
      
    3 In an unsigned application for statutory review under s 155 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (“CAS Act”) the applicant contends that the SPA based its decision on information which was false and misleading. 
     
      
    4 The Court file reveals that a facsimile was sent by the Registrar of the Court on 2 August 2007 asking the applicant to indicate in writing whether he wished to attend the hearing. No response was received and the application was heard in the applicant’s absence. As a result, the only material in the proceedings for the applicant is the application itself. One of the contentions made by the SPA is that the application should be summarily dismissed under subs 155(3) of the CAS Act. Due to other matters in the Duty Judge’s list, I reserved my decision to enable the material before me to be properly considered.  
     
      
    5 It seems that the principal contentions of the applicant are that parole officers falsely or misleadingly reported to the SPA that: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) the applicant refused to take part in parole reports; and  
        
       
      
     (2) refused to undertake programs. 
     
      
    6 Section 155 of the CAS Act is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        155 Application to Supreme Court by offender 
          
        
       
      
     (1) If: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) the Parole Authority decides that an offender should not  
          
         
         be released on parole, and  
        
       
      
     (b) the offender alleges that the decision of the Parole  
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
           Authority has been made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information,  
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        the offender may , in accordance with rules of court, apply to the Supreme Court for a direction to be given to the Parole Authority as to whether the information was false, misleading or irrelevant.  
        
       
      
     (2) The Supreme Court may give such directions with respect to  
     
      
       
        
         the information as it thinks fit. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) An application under this section is to be considered by the  
         
         Supreme Court  
        if and only if 
         (emphasis added) it is satisfied  
        
       
      
     that the application is not an abuse of process and there  appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application.” 
     
      
    7 Sub-section 155(3) provides a threshold which must be satisfied before a s 155 application is to be considered by the Court. Failure by an applicant to satisfy the Court that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support it will result in dismissal of the application. 
     
      
    8 The SPA does not contend that the application is an abuse of process and there is nothing to suggest that it is. The argument is that there is insufficient evidence to support the application. 
     
      
    9 In an application under s 155, the Court may only consider whether information given to the Board was “false, misleading or irrelevant”. As was said by Simpson J in R v Naudi [2003] NSWCCA 160 at [19]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is implicit in the section that any information found to be false, misleading or irrelevant has also been information on which the Board’s decision was based. It is not sufficient that there be false, misleading or irrelevant information, that information must also be part (at least) of the foundation for the decision.” 
        
       
      
    10 Evidence is required to satisfy the Court that the information was false, misleading or irrelevant. A mere assertion that it was will not be sufficient. In Rozynski v Parole Board of New South Wales [2003] NSWCCA 214, Greg James J (Hodgson JA and Simpson J agreeing) said at [13]: 
     
      
       
        
        “For my part, I consider that action under the section will not be warranted unless the statutory conditions are met as a matter of substance. This means that information before the Board will not be characterised as false, misleading or irrelevant simply because it was challenged, even if challenged on such a basis before the Board and the challenge determined adversely to the applicant, nor if it is merely incorrect in detail but not false or misleading in substance. This Court will need to be satisfied on appropriate (usually new) evidence that information was false or misleading in substance, and that the direction should be given.” 
        
       
      
    11 In the present application for the Court to be satisfied under subs. 155(3) that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application, there must, in my opinion, be evidence capable of establishing that the SPA based the decision refusing the applicant’s release on parole (at least in part) on false and misleading information. The applicant’s assertions in the application for statutory review are not evidence. The documentary material tendered in evidence by the SPA does not support the application. The absence of the appearance of any evidence supporting the application means that the application does not pass the threshold and is not to be considered. 
     
      
    12 Orders 
     
      
     The application is dismissed.  
     
      
       
      I direct that a copy of this Judgment be provided to the applicant by the Registrar of the Court.

      Ex Tempore Judgment  
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The Attorney General for the State of New South Wales seeks orders pursuant to s 15(4) of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (“the Act”) or further or alternatively s 7(4) of the Act: (a) appointing two qualified psychiatrists to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations, and (b) directing the defendant to attend those examinations. 
     
      
    2 The defendant was sentenced by Delaney DCJ on 4 February 2005 on one count of aggravated indecent assault on a victim under the age of 16 years, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, to imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years commencing on 29 June 2004 and expiring on 28 June 2006, with a balance of term of one year and three months which is to expire on 28 September 2007. The sentence for which the defendant is currently imprisoned accordingly expires on 28 September 2007. 
     
      
    3 An offence contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act is punishable by imprisonment for seven years, and is found within Division 10 of Part 3 of that Act. The offence is a serious sexual offence and an offence of a sexual nature under the Act. 
     
      
    4 Miss Loukas, who appears for the defendant, has informed the court that her client does not oppose the preliminary orders which are sought today. No concession however is made by Miss Loukas concerning the making of any other order that might be made. Notwithstanding the defendant’s lack of opposition to the present orders, the court may not make orders for the appointment of the two qualified psychiatrists unless it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order.5 The court is required by s 15(4) of the Act to look at what is alleged in the documentation to see whether the matters therein alleged would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or extended supervision order. What is required for the making of an extended supervision order or a continuing detention order is set out in s 17(2) and s 17(3) of the Act. 6 In determining whether to order psychiatric examinations pursuant to s 15(4) the court is not involved in weighing the supporting documentation or predicting the ultimate result. See Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119, where the Court of Appeal considered s 16(1)(b) of the Act, which is in similar terms to s 15(4). The test for making the orders presently sought is similar to the requirement for a prima facie case to be made out in committal proceedings. 7 The defendant is a sex offender for the purposes of the Act, having been sentenced to imprisonment following his conviction on 4 February 2005. The offence for which the defendant was sentenced by Delaney DCJ involved the defendant luring a fourteen year old boy into bushes, whereby he indecently assaulted him. 8 A large amount of documentation has been tendered in support of the application, and I do not propose to detail all of it. The documentation addresses each of the matters referred to in s 17(4) of the Act to which the court must have regard, other than s 17(4)(b) and s 17(4)(g), which are not relevant to the present application. 9 The application, in compliance with s 14(2) of the Act, was not made until the last six months of the defendant’s current custody. 10 There is in the supporting material an affidavit of Patrick Sheehan, a psychologist, sworn 28 August 2007. Mr Sheehan assessed the defendant’s risk of sexual re-offending by reference to both his static risk factors, using an instrument known as the STATIC -99, and his dynamic risk factors. A score of “six” and higher in application of the STATIC -99 places a person within the high risk category of sexual recidivism relevant to other male offenders. The defendant scored a “nine”. 11 The factors assessed for the STATIC -99 instrument are factors which do not change, although the offender’s age can have a moderating affect. Mr Sheehan opined that given the defendant’s age of 43 years and the absence of health complaints or diminished sexual desire, it might be premature to make any age-related adjustment moderating his risk at the present time. 12 A score of “nine” places the defendant in a group of offenders who on average sexually re-offend at thirty nine per cent over five years and forty five per cent over ten years. 13 In assessing the defendant’s potential sexual re-offending on the basis of a compilation of both the actuarial risk and his dynamic risk factors, Mr Sheehan considered the defendant as being in the high risk category of sexual re-offending relevant to other adult male offenders. 14 The defendant, in Mr Sheehan’s opinion, requires significant improvement in the dynamic features of his risk before any confidence could be had in his ability to successfully and consistently manage these factors, and the resultant risk to the community. The dynamic risk factors include, in Mr Sheehan’s assessment, intimacy deficit, distorted attitudes, general self-regulation, and social influences. 15 The defendant, to his credit, has been a participant in the Custody Based Intensive Treatment program for high-risk sex offenders, known as CUBIT, since January 2007. However, his progress is described by Mr Sheehan as being inconsistent. Mr Sheehan opines that the defendant’s behaviour indicates ambivalence towards the therapeutic goal of life without sexual offending or deviant sexual interest. 16 Recently, material which might be described as inappropriate and disturbing was found in the defendant’s cell during a random search. The defendant was removed from CUBIT due to security concerns, and his movement back into the program is apparently dependant on these concerns being addressed. 17 It appears that the CUBIT program might not be successfully completed by the time of the expiration of the defendant’s sentence, and Mr Sheehan considers that more treatment within CUBIT to address specific ongoing issues will be required. In his report dated 6 July 2007 Mr Sheehan details at pages nine and ten the previous involvement of the defendant in treatment for sexual offending. 18 The defendant has an unattractive criminal history, which includes an extensive record of sexual offences in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. A disturbing pattern emerges from an examination of those offences, which is summarised in the plaintiff’s written submissions, which I propose to adopt:1. The defendant has been convicted of 20 separate sexual offences  involving over 12 different victims.2. All victims were under-age boys and one victim was only seven years  
     
      
       old. 
      
    3. A number of sexual offences were committed whilst the defendant was  on parole, a good behaviour bond, or on bail.4. The victims were boys who were not related to the defendant.5. The offences reveal at least a degree of sophistication and grooming  techniques on the part of the defendant.19 In his affidavit Mr Sheehan made reference to the defendant’s commission of offences whilst subject to conditional liberty, and considered that “there must be significant concerns as to the extent to which [the defendant] could be relied upon to consistently adhere to conditions on release”. 
     
      
    20 The defendant was born on 2 October 1963 and is 43 years old. It appears from Delaney DCJ’s remarks on sentence that the defendant is a divorced man with two children. He has had limited education, employment and training over the years, principally because of the fact that he has spent much of his life in prison. 
     
      
    21 I conclude, taking into account the considerations to which s 17(4) of the Act directs attention that the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order. I propose to make the orders sought.  I make the following orders: 1. Order that two qualified psychiatrists conduct separate psychiatric  examinations of Warren Graeme Hayter and that those two  psychiatrists furnish reports to the Supreme Court of the results of  those examinations on or before 4pm 20 September 2007. 2. I direct the defendant is to attend those examinations. 3. I list this summons for hearing on 25 September 2007. I note the  estimate to be four days. 4. I direct that the plaintiff is to serve any evidence upon which the  plaintiff relies no later than 4pm Monday 24 September 2007. 5. The parties have liberty to apply to the list judge on one day’s

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence of importing heroin of not less than a traffickable quantity contrary to s 233B(1)(a)(iii) of the Customs Act (Cth). The maximum penalty for such an offence is relevantly imprisonment for 25 years. He was committed to the District Court for sentence and ultimately sentenced by Judge Sorby (the Judge) on 21 June 2005 to imprisonment for nine years with a non-parole period of 5 years. The sentence was dated to commence on 28 October 2004 and the applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 27 October 2009. 
     
      
    3 The applicant now seeks an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal against the sentence. The application for extension of time was lodged on 23 January 2007. The Crown did not oppose the application. The only ground of appeal is that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    4 The applicant arrived at Sydney on 28 October 2004 on a flight from Dubai. Customs officers selected him at random for a search and he was discovered to have packages taped to each of his feet that were found to contain powder. Analysis of the powder revealed that it weighed 427 grams and contained 313.7 grams of pure heroin. It is said to have had a wholesale value of about $150,000 and a street value of between $750,000 and $1 million. The applicant remained in custody from the date of his arrest until he was sentenced. 
     
      
    5 There was a psychological report tendered before the Judge. This revealed that the applicant was aged 35 at the date of sentencing. He was born in Pakistan and had an uneventful and happy childhood. He came to Australia in 1990, became an Australian citizen and worked for 13 years with State Rail. He was dismissed from his employment when he returned to Pakistan on long service leave in February 2003 and stayed past the date he should have returned to work. The applicant stated that he remained in Pakistan to assist in the care for his ailing father. In March 2003 he undertook an arranged marriage. He returned to Australia in September 2003 to find that he had lost his job. He was unable to obtain further full-time employment. 
     
      
    6 The applicant reported to the psychologists that he then started to frequent hotels and was introduced to cannabis and heroin. He was under financial pressure to assist his family and did not reveal to them that he was unemployed. He then decided to assist in the importation of drugs and was to be paid $10,000. He intended to use this reward to pay of some of the debts he had incurred since losing his employment. The applicant has no criminal record. 
     
      
    7 The report states that at the time he was examined the applicant was suffering from a Major Depressive Disorder as a result of the consequences of committing the offence and his imprisonment. It contains statements by the applicant of remorse and shame for his criminal conduct. 
     
      
    8 There was also in evidence a pre-sentence report. It notes that the applicant’s family live outside Australia and were not aware of his offending or incarceration. Nor was his wife of two years who remained in Pakistan aware of his predicament. In addition to reporting his involvement in the use of heroin the applicant also informed the officer preparing the report that he had borrowed money to support a gambling habit. The report also contains statements of remorse and shame made by the applicant for his criminal behaviour. Further there was in evidence a testimonial made by a friend of the applicant that also contains statements of remorse from the applicant to the friend. 
     
      
    9 The Judge was not prepared to make any factual finding about the role of the applicant in bringing the heroin into the country or his position in any hierarchy involved in the importation. He simply dealt with the matter on the basis that the applicant had imported the drug: see The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [19]. The Judge also indicated that he found special circumstances to “vary the statutory ratio that is applicable in Commonwealth matters”. His Honour with respect was clearly in error in the manner in which he determined the non-parole period as there is no such statutory relationship. But this error seems to have favoured the applicant because the non-parole period is 55 per cent of the total sentence and this is below the usual range of non-parole periods fixed for Commonwealth offences. 
     
      
    10 The applicant submits that with a discount for the plea of guilty of 25 per cent the Judge must have started with a sentence that was beyond the appropriate level to meet the objective criminality of the applicant having regard to his favourable subjective circumstances. Reference was made to R v Wong and Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 and the indication in that judgment as to the range of sentences appropriate for a midlevel traffickable quantity (between 200 and 1 kilogram). It was held to be between 6 and 9 years imprisonment for a courier or a person low in the hierarchy involved in the importation. The Crown pointed out in written submissions that the guideline in that judgment referred to the range of sentences that would be appropriate after a discount for a guilty plea and a discount under the now repealed s 16G of the Crimes Act (Cth). 
     
      
    11 Although some question was raised at the hearing as to whether the range set out in Wong and Leung took into account a plea of guilty it is clear that it did. In R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 385 at [161] the Chief Justice clarified the status of earlier guidelines so far as a plea of guilty was concerned, and stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The Court was asked to clarify its earlier guideline judgments in the light of any guideline it might propose in this respect. The standard case identified in each of Jurisic and Henry included a plea of guilty. That was not the case in Wong in which the range encompassed relevant matters, including a plea. In each of Jurisic at 231 and Henry at [162], the Court was concerned with a guilty plea of limited value. The guidelines for the offences considered in those cases should be understood to involve a late plea of guilty, for purposes of the application of the guideline promulgated in these reasons.” 
         
        
       
      
    12 The point of distinction between the guideline in Wong and Leung and the other two decision mentioned by the Chief Justice is that in Wong and Leung the Court referred to a range of sentences for different classes of offenders, whereas in both Henry and Jurisic the Court identified a standard case for the offence under consideration and indicated the appropriate sentence for such a case. But in all three guideline judgments given before Thomson and Houlton a plea of guilty was assumed in fashioning the guideline. That the Wong and Leung guideline takes into account a plea of guilty is made clear in R v Haidar [2004] NSWCCA 350 at [22]. 
     
      
    13 Although the discount given by reason of the repealed s 16G should not be mathematically determined, it was a significant one. The repeal of that section must effect sentences for Federal offences by simply prohibiting the Court from discounting the sentences to take into account the absence of remissions and must substantially affect a range of sentences imposed while the section operated: see R v Studenikin (2004) 60 NSWLR 1. 
     
      
    14 In the present case the sentence imposed is at the top of the range indicated in Wong and Leung notwithstanding that the applicant had a quantity of drug towards the lower end of the relevant quantity. However the applicant did not enjoy the advantage of a finding that his criminality was reduced by reason of him being a courier or a person lower in the hierarchy and therefore the range of sentences did not strictly apply to him. The applicant clearly left this country for the purpose of importing drugs on his return, a matter that to my mind significantly aggravates his criminality over the usual type of courier. This is a circumstance that was not present in Haidar where the appellant sought to obtain possession of drugs that had been sent into Australia by mail and is a reason to distinguish the lesser sentence imposed in that case for a similar amount of drug. In my opinion the sentence is a heavy one for a person with the subjective circumstances of the appellant but I am not satisfied that it was outside of the range legitimately open to the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    15 I would propose that the applicant be granted an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal. Leave should be granted but the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    16 HARRISON J: I agree with Howie J.
