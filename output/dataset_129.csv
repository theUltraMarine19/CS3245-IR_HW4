2768741,Nguyen v R [2016] NSWCCA 5,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: On 29 July 2014 Kim Giau Nguyen (“the applicant”) pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging an offence contrary to s. 233BAA(4) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) in the following terms:
	


“On 13 May 2012, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did, without the requisite approval being obtained, intentionally import goods, being tier 1 goods comprising pseudoephedrine, being reckless to the fact that the goods were tier 1 goods, and being goods the importation of which was prohibited under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth).”


	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine not exceeding 1,000 penalty units, and/or imprisonment for 5 years.
	
	
	Following a trial in the District Court the applicant was found guilty. On 7 November 2014 she was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 2 years and 6 months. The sentencing judge ordered that she be released from custody on a recognisance release order after serving a period of 1 year and 6 months.
	
	
	By notice dated 25 June 2015 the applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the grounds that:
	



	
	the sentence was manifestly excessive;
	
	
	the sentencing judge erred in sentencing her as a person not of good character;
	
	
	the sentencing judge erred in sentencing her on the basis that her case involved greed rather than need;
	
	
	the sentencing judge erred in not sentencing her on the basis of recklessness.
	


THE FACTS


	
	The sentencing judge found the facts of the offending to be as follows.
	
	
	On 1 April 2012 the applicant flew from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City. She returned to Sydney on the morning of 13 May 2012. On arrival she produced an Australian passport in her own name, along with an incoming passenger card printed in the Vietnamese language which she had completed and signed herself. The applicant indicated that prior to leaving Vietnam she had packed the suitcases and handbag which were in her possession on arrival in Sydney, and that she was aware of their contents.
	
	
	At the time of her arrival the applicant had two mobile telephones in her possession, both of which had Vietnamese SIM cards. The applicant provided her mobile telephone number to Customs officers, which was a pre-paid service registered to Henry Cheang at an address in West Pennant Hills. Mr Cheang did not register that telephone number, nor did he know any person by the name of Nguyen. Although the Crown had urged the sentencing judge to find that this service had been falsely registered by the applicant, his Honour concluded (at ROS 2) that such a finding was not relevant for purposes of sentence.
	
	
	Whilst searching the applicant’s bags, Customs officers located two packages labelled “Palm Sugar” (or “Lan Nhi”). The applicant initially stated that the packages had been given to her by her husband (who she also described as her boyfriend) with the intention that they be given to his aunt in Australia. Later, the applicant said that the goods came from the husband of the same aunt. She was unable to provide any contact details for the aunt in Australia, although she did provide a telephone number. That number was registered to a Mr Minkins of Bundaberg in Queensland. The number was not in the contact list of either of the telephones which were found in the applicant’s possession.
	
	
	Presumptive tests conducted on the two packages returned a positive result for the presence of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. Subsequent analysis established that the packages contained a total of 3,605 g of pseudoephedrine, the purity of which ranged between 62.2% and 67.7%. The total weight of pure pseudoephedrine was therefore 2.341 kg. The applicant did not have approval to import pseudoephedrine into Australia.
	


THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL


	
	The grounds of appeal have been set out above. It is appropriate to deal with the issues raised in Grounds 2, 3 and 4, before dealing with the asserted manifest excess of the sentence which is the subject of Ground 1.
	


GROUND 2 – THE SENTENCING JUDGE ERRED IN SENTENCING THE APPLICANT AS A PERSON NOT OF GOOD CHARACTER

The evidence at trial


	
	At trial, both the Crown and the applicant conducted their respective cases on the basis that there was essentially one issue for this jury’s consideration, namely whether the applicant was reckless as to the fact that the goods imported were Tier 1 goods, the importation of which was prohibited. In support of its position on that issue, the Crown led evidence of the applicant’s history of overseas travel in the form of a schedule which demonstrated the following travel undertaken by the applicant from July 2009 up to the time of her arrest in May 2012:

	The applicant did not give evidence at her trial. In his closing address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor (who did not appear for the Crown before this Court) submitted (commencing at T28 L43) that the applicant’s pattern of travel was not that of “somebody on Centrelink” but rather that of “somebody who’s engaged in business overseas”. Counsel for the applicant at trial (who similarly was not counsel before this Court) urged the jury (commencing at T45 L27) to be “very careful” of such evidence. He submitted that the Crown’s position in respect of the applicant’s pattern of travel was wholly speculative. He stressed that the applicant had family members living overseas and submitted that her travel, and in particular the length of her stays overseas, was inconsistent with what might be expected of a person travelling on business, who would be likely to stay only for short periods before returning home.
	
	
	In the course of his summing up, the sentencing judge reminded the jury of the competing positions of the Crown (commencing at SU 13) and the applicant (at SU 18) as to this issue. He also gave the applicant the benefit of a direction as to prior good character (at SU 12).
	


The evidence of the applicant on sentence


	
	Having been found guilty by the jury, the applicant gave evidence on sentence. In the course of doing so, she said the following about her travel movements (commencing at T11 L45):
	


Q   This trip that we’re talking about now, your last trip to Vietnam, is that the only trip that you’ve made to visit your boyfriend?

   A    INTERPRETER: No I made many trips.

Q   And who pays for your airfares and accommodation during these trips?

A   INTERPRETER: Normally – sometimes my boyfriend bought me the tickets, sometime I bought ticket.

Q   How did you afford to buy the ticket yourself on those occasions?

A   INTERPRETER: I stay home looking after children for other people and also cook their meals for other people.

Q   Do you have other relatives yourself in Vietnam?

A   INTERPRETER: Yes

Q   What relatives do you still have in Vietnam?

A   My foster mother

…

Q   On this last trip, who paid for your airfares and accommodation while you were away?

A      WITNESS: Yeah my boyfriend.

A      INTERPRETER: My boyfriend.”


	
	When cross-examined by the Crown the applicant agreed (at T22 L21) that between 2009 and 2012 she had travelled out of Australia on 12 occasions and had spent approximately one third of that time overseas. She was asked (commencing at T24 L32):
	


Q      Who paid for your overseas trips?

A      INTERPRETER: Which trip?

Q       Well all of your overseas trips?

A   INTERPRETER: Normally my husband bought, sometime I did buy.      

Q      Which ones did you pay for?

A   INTERPRETER: The trip that I went back to look after my mother.

Q      But all other trips otherwise were paid for by him?

A      INTERPRETER: Yes.


	
	The applicant said (commencing at T27 L19) that she had been given money from her father to travel to the USA in 2010 and that this money had been spent on fares for her children. She was then asked (commencing at T27 L26):
	


Q      Who paid for yours?

A   INTERPRETER: I bought it myself because I look after children and cook meals for other people.

Q   But Ms Nguyen if you’re outside the country for 65 weeks in 150 weeks you don’t have much opportunity to make money?

A      INTERPRETER: I look after children three days a week.

Q      But you can’t do it when you’re not in Australia?

A   INTERPRETER: This time I went away only a few weeks not very long.


	
	The applicant denied (at T11 L3) that she was being untruthful in her evidence as to her income. She repeated (at T11 L31) that she earned money by minding children and cooking for other people. She said that she was able to afford to travel with the frequency that she did because she “waited until the tickets were on sale” (at T11 L43-44).
	


The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	At the commencement of his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge observed that the objective facts of the applicant’s offending could be stated simply, but that there were other facts which were disputed and which therefore had to be resolved in accordance with the verdict of the jury. In turning to the areas of factual dispute, his Honour said (commencing at ROS 3):
	


“As noted, there is some dispute as to whether the offender was living beyond her means at the time that she committed this offence. I heard evidence from the offender in this regard. It was submitted by the offender that I could not find on the evidence that the offender was living beyond her means. To the contrary, the Crown submits that it was very clear that the offender was living well beyond her humble means and that if I make such a finding, it reflects badly upon her in terms of her character. Further, it is submitted by the Crown that as the offender has been travelling back and forth to Vietnam often, as is noted in the objective evidence, she must have been importing goods which one way or another were providing her with the financial rewards that were over and above that which she could possibly have earned on her own behalf. If that is the case, it must be that she was aware of the nature of goods being imported and that the goods were valuable. In that sense, it is submitted that this is not a case of recklessness, but a case of actual knowledge about the importation of the goods.

The Crown opened to the jury that this was a case about actual knowledge. The Crown submits that it is the only possible conclusion available from the fact that she was living well beyond her means and had been for many years. It is submitted by the offender that this Court could not make that finding beyond reasonable doubt. It is submitted that it would be an aggravating factor on sentence if the Court here was to decide that she had previously imported goods for which she was paid. At the very least, it would affect a finding that she was previously a person of good character.

There is evidence before the Court that the offender was a pensioner at all relevant times in the years leading up to the commission of the offence. In the four years prior to her arrest, the offender travelled to Vietnam 11 times. In addition, she travelled on holiday to the USA. Moreover, the offender often travelled with her children to Vietnam. There are 12 international flights undertaken by herself. Another 21 international flights were undertaken by her children. She has explained that on some occasions, her father paid for the travel of her children. On the occasion that the offender took herself to America, it was for a period of a month. This was in the same year that she also travelled with some of her children to Vietnam on three other occasions. Even if it was true that her father paid for some of the travel, and I note her father did not give any evidence to support this claim, in my view it stretches incredulity that she was able to afford that level of travel based on her own means. The offender claimed in evidence that she had been working. She claimed to have been undertaking work as a nanny, doing babysitting. Again, there was no independent evidence to support her claim, but even if it was accepted that she did work in this way, in my view it does not explain the obvious displays of wealth evident in the offender’s overseas travel. Further, she had spent very significant periods of time overseas in the four years before her arrest. This was a period of some 53 weeks or one year. Given her absences overseas, it appears her work, if she did undertake it, would only have provided her with limited financial reward. Given the lack of any independent evidence to support the claim that she was working in this way or that it was providing her with some significant income, I reject this as a source of income to pay for the flights referred to above.

The offender has attempted to explain in her evidence how it was that she could travel to the extent that she did. In my view, nothing she said explains that travel. There is no independent evidence that would support a conclusion that she could have come into this money innocently. In the circumstances, the only reasonable inference is that the offender has been receiving a significantly greater level of income than that to which she has attested to (sic). She has attempted to explain the source of income as an innocent one. I have rejected that explanation. In the circumstances, the only reasonable inference is that the offender has been travelling to Vietnam for some nefarious purpose and obtaining income from that travel.

The next question is whether I am able to find that she has been importing other goods from Vietnam over the last 4 years. On all but two of the trips to Vietnam, the offender imported some goods which she declared as food. The most likely explanation for the offender’s unexplained wealth is that she has been importing goods to Australia from Vietnam for profit. I am not at this stage able to say more. I cannot, for example, be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the goods were Tier 1 goods or drugs. On the other hand, given the evidence of her travel and her unexplained wealth, I am satisfied that she was aware of the nature of the goods that she was importing on this occasion and consequently, this is not a case of recklessness.

The offence is a serious one. The fact that she was prepared to knowingly import these goods adds to the seriousness of the offending. This was quite a sophisticated offence with the goods being concealed in packaging that resembles sugar. Pseudoephedrine is a precursor that is used to manufacture other drugs. One of the drugs that is involved in the manufacture by using pseudoephedrine is the drug “ice”. There is at least anecdotal evidence and based on my own experience, evidence that this drug is now freely available in the community and is causing extremely serious psychological damage to many users and there may be many ways in which pseudoephedrine might make its way into Australia, but at least one of the ways is demonstrated by the facts in this case. The offender’s willingness to participate in this crime for what appears to be greed rather than need adds to the seriousness of the offending.

I accept that the offender has essentially used the money she has obtained by her illegal activities for the purposes of her family. Her children are indeed a credit to her, but they should understand that their lifestyle has, in part, been based on her illegal activities. I accept that the offender has no previous convictions, but in my view she is not a person of good character. Given my findings in this case, the offender is not entitled to such a finding. In my view, the offender has deliberately given false evidence here in Court. Her answers in evidence to the effect that she saved money for her own travel in such that I cannot accept the evidence as truthful.”

Submissions of the applicant


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant before this Court submitted that the applicant was entitled to rely on her prior good character as a mitigating factor pursuant to s 21A(3)(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). It should be noted immediately that in circumstances where the applicant was a federal offender, that provision had no application. The relevance of the applicant’s character as a mitigating factor on sentence was governed by s. 16A(2)(m) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (“the Act”) which is in the following terms:
	


(2)  In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court:

…

(m)  the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person;


	
	Senior counsel submitted that suspicion that the applicant may have earned income from other “nefarious” acts was not open to be used by the sentencing judge as an aggravating factor. He further submitted that the reasons of the sentencing judge did not support the conclusions at which he had arrived concerning the applicant’s evidence and that, in particular, that there was no evidence that the applicant had previously imported any drug or other prohibited item into Australia. It was further submitted that the sentencing judge had ignored aspects of the applicant’s evidence.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that properly understood, the sentencing judge had done nothing more than conclude that the absence of any previous convictions did not (as might ordinarily be the case) demonstrate an absence of previous criminal behaviour on the part of the applicant. It was submitted that the sentencing judge had concluded, on the basis of the evidence before him, that what was known of the character and antecedents of the applicant did not demonstrate that the offence for which she was found guilty was the first criminal conduct in which she had ever engaged.
	
	
	The Crown specifically submitted that his Honour had been careful not to treat his finding(s) as aggravating the offending, and had concluded that the issue of character was essentially neutral, and a factor which worked neither in favour, nor against, the applicant.
	


Consideration


	
	The passage from the sentencing remarks set out at [20] above includes the following findings relevant to this ground:
	



	
	the applicant had been a pensioner at all relevant times in the years leading up to the commission of the offence (ROS 8);
	
	
	the applicant’s evidence as to her work, even if accepted, did not explain the obvious displays of wealth which were evident from her overseas travel (ROS 8);
	
	
	the applicant’s work did not provide her with sufficient income to sustain her travel (ROS 8);
	
	
	the applicant had been receiving a significantly greater level of income than that to which she had attested (ROS 9);
	
	
	the applicant had been travelling to Vietnam for some nefarious purpose, and had obtained income as a result of so doing (ROS 9);
	
	
	the most likely explanation for the applicant’s unexplained wealth was that she had been importing goods from Vietnam to Australia for profit (ROS 9);
	
	
	the applicant’s evidence that she had saved money for her own travel was not truthful (ROS 9); and
	
	
	the applicant had deliberately given false evidence (ROS 9).
	



	
	Those findings were necessarily based, at least in part, upon an evaluation of the applicant’s evidence. That evaluation, in turn, included an assessment of the applicant herself. In my view, the conclusions reached by the sentencing judge were open on the evidence. The regularity of the applicant’s travel, and its associated cost, were wholly inconsistent with a person who was, for the entirety of the relevant period, in recept of Centrelink benefits. His Honour was entitled to reject the applicant’s various explanations for her ability to fund that travel, particularly in circumstances where that evidence was uncorroborated.
	
	
	His Honour accepted that the applicant had no prior convictions. However, in light of the findings that he reached, he found that the applicant was not, and was therefore not entitled to a finding that she was, a person of good character. Contrary to the submission advanced by senior counsel for the applicant, his Honour did not use any finding to aggravate the applicant’s offending. There is nothing whatsoever in his Honour’s remarks on sentence which supports such a submission.
	
	
	In Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; (2003) 212 CLR 629 the plurality (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) observed (at [25]) that there are difficulties in treating good character as a single and undifferentiated whole. The plurality also observed that the character of the appellant in that case (like that of the applicant in the present case) had at least two relevant aspects: firstly, the absence of criminal convictions, and secondly, whether there was evidence of having engaged in other criminal conduct. Importantly, the plurality observed (at [27]):
	


“… the relevant sentencing fact was what was known about the character and antecedents of the appellant. That task was not to be performed by assigning a single label to the appellant's character or his antecedents as either “good” or “bad”. Rather, the question for the primary judge was, what was known about the appellant's character and antecedents? Was what was known of those matters to be taken into account in a way that favoured the appellant, or in a way that did not? Importantly, did the case fall between these extremes? Was the state of the material before the primary judge such that the appellant's character and antecedents worked neither in his favour nor against him?”


	
	In the present case, the sentencing judge acknowledged that the applicant had no prior convictions. He contrasted that position with the applicant’s evidence, which (generally speaking) he did not accept, and which caused him to reach the findings I have set out. He concluded that in those circumstances, the applicant was not entitled to the benefit of a finding that she was a person of good character. There was no error in his Honour’s approach, nor has it been demonstrated that the findings he reached were not open on the evidence.
	
	
	This ground is not made out.
	


GROUND 3 – THE SENTENCING JUDGE ERRED IN SENTENCING THE APPLICANT ON THE BASIS THAT HER CASE INVOLVED GREED RATHER THAN NEED

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	In the passage set out at [20] above, the sentencing judge concluded that the applicant’s willingness to participate in the commission of the offence for what appeared to be greed rather than need added to its objective seriousness. In reaching that finding, and relevant to this ground, his Honour also concluded that:
	



	
	   there were obvious displays of wealth which were evident from the degree of the applicant’s overseas travel; and
	
	
	in the circumstances, the only reasonable inference available was that the applicant had been in receipt of a significantly greater level of income than that to which she had admitted.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the findings made in respect of the applicant’s character (discussed in relation to ground 2) “relied on (the applicant) being an impecunious pensioner”. It was submitted that in these circumstances, the finding that the applicant’s involvement in the offending arose out of greed rather than need contradicted the findings made in respect of ground 2.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	Counsel for the Crown submitted that there was no error in the finding of the sentencing judge that the applicant’s willingness to participate in the commission of the offence arose from greed. It was submitted that such finding was completely consistent with those of his Honour’s findings which were referable to ground 2.
	


Consideration


	
	His Honour noted that the applicant had been in receipt of a pension in the years leading up to the commission of the offence. He found (inter alia) that the frequency of her overseas travel was inconsistent with a pension being her only source of income. For the reasons previously expressed, that finding was open. In these circumstances, his Honour found that the offence had been committed for what appeared to be greed rather than need.
	
	
	Inherent in that finding was a rejection of the proposition that the applicant was (to use the description adopted by senior counsel for the applicant) an “impecunious pensioner”. To suggest, in these circumstances, that his Honour relied upon such a proposition reflects a misunderstanding of the finding which was reached. That finding is not inconsistent with, nor is it contradictory to, any of the conclusions reached by the sentencing judge which are relevant to ground 2.
	
	
	This ground is not made out.
	


GROUND 4 – THE SENTENCING JUDGE ERRED IN NOT SENTENCING THE APPLICANT ON THE BASIS OF RECKLESSNESS

The relevant legislation


	
	The indictment presented against the applicant alleged an offence contrary to s. 233BAA(4) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). That section is in following terms:
	


(4)  A person is guilty of an offence against this subsection if:

(a)  the person intentionally imported goods; and

(b)  the goods were tier 1 goods and the person was reckless as to that fact; and

(c)  their importation:

(i)  was prohibited under this Act absolutely; or

(ii)  was prohibited under this Act unless the approval of a particular person had been obtained and, at the time of the importation, that approval had not been obtained.

Maximum penalty: A fine not exceeding 1,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 5 years, or both.


	
	The Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (“the Code”) contains a number of provisions relevant to the present case. In particular:
	



	
	s. 3.1 provides that an offence consists of physical elements and fault elements;
	
	
	s. 4.1 provides that the physical element of an offence may be (inter alia) conduct;
	
	
	s. 5.1 provides that a fault element for a particular physical element may be intention, knowledge, recklessness or negligence.
	



	
	Bearing in mind these provisions, and for the purposes of the present case:
	



	
	the physical element of the offence with which the applicant was charged was conduct, namely the act of importation;
	
	
	the fault element was recklessness.
	



	
	Section 5.4 of the Code defines recklessness in the following terms:
	


5.4   Recklessness 

(1)  A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if:

(a)  he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and

(b)  having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.

(2)     A person is reckless with respect to a result if:

(a)  he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and

(b)  having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.

(3)  The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact.

(4)  If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element.

The Crown case


	
	At trial, the parties agreed that the issue for determination by the jury was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was reckless as to the fact that the goods were Tier 1 goods. In the course of his final address to the jury, the Crown said (commencing at T27 L10):
	


“The fourth element was the important one, the knowledge element in relation to whether it was a tier 1 good or not, that’s the wording. So his Honour has given you that list of goods. Did she know it was a tier 1 good or was she reckless as to whether it was a tier 1 good and that’s what this, I suggest to you, is all about. She knew she had those products in her bag. Did she know what they were or was she at least reckless as to what they were, that’s the one I’m obviously going to deal with in my address to you this morning”.


	
	The Crown then continued (commencing at T27 L23):
	


“So we’re left with, I’d suggest to you, element 4. So the Crown needs to prove either that she knew it was a tier 1 good or that she was reckless as to that fact. Recklessness, the legal definition is that I’d have to prove to you, beyond reasonable doubt, that Ms Nguyen is aware of a substantial risk that it was a tier 1 good and two, having regard to the circumstances known to her, that is that there was risk that it was a tier one good or a substantial risk that it was tier one good and bearing in mind all those other things that go with brining such goods into the country, that’s another circumstance, it was unjustifiable to take the risk that she did” (emphasis added).


	
	The Crown then said (commencing at T 27 L43):
	


“So let’s go through those things and there’s a number of them I want to take you through. The circumstances by which the Crown refers (sic) knowledge or recklessness, that is knowledge that it was pseudoephedrine and there’s evidence that she knew what it was, I’d suggest to you, that at the very least there’s evidence that she knew there was a substantial risk that it was a tier 1 good”.


	
	Towards the conclusion of his closing address, the Crown (at T38 L33-35; T39 L13-15) submitted that the jury would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant either knew that she was carrying Tier 1 goods, or was aware of a substantial risk that this was the case, and that having regard to the circumstances known to her, it was unjustifiable to take that risk.
	


The directions to the jury


	
	In the course of his summing up to the jury, his Honour set out the elements of the offence before saying (commencing at SU 7):
	


“So element 4 is the element that is really in dispute. Element 4 as I have set out for you requires that the accused be reckless to the fact that the goods were tier 1 goods. Reckless in this context means that the accused was aware of a substantial risk that it was a tier 1 good that she imported and having regard to the entirety of the circumstances known to her it was unjustified to take the risk of importing such a good. Let me repeat that. Reckless in this context means that the accused was aware of a substantial risk that it was a tier 1 good that she imported and having regard to the entirety of the circumstances known to her it was unjustified to take a risk importing such a good” (emphasis added).


	
	His Honour then said (at SU 8):
	


“What the Crown submits amounts to proof beyond reasonable doubt of element 4 is a set of circumstances which when taken together point inexorably to one reasonable conclusion only, namely that the accused was aware or at least reckless as to whether the goods she imported were tier 1 goods”.


	
	His Honour then said (at SU 8):
	


“Briefly the factors referred to by the Crown fall into a number of categories, these are the factors which the Crown says make clear that (the applicant) was aware of this risk”(emphasis added).


	
	His Honour then proceeded to set out the circumstances upon which the Crown relied to sustain the requisite inference.
	
	
	It will be evident that his Honour explained to the jury (in the passage set out in [45] above) that recklessness in the context of this case meant awareness of a substantial risk in circumstances where the taking of that risk was unjustified. He again made reference to such risk in the passage set out in [47] above. Between those two passages (as set out in [46] above) his Honour made a passing reference to the Crown’s submission that the applicant was aware that she was importing Tier 1 goods. However, his Honour did not (and was not asked to) direct the jury, in accordance with s. 5.4(4) of the Code, that knowledge could amount to recklessness for the purposes of that element of the offence.
	


The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	As set out at [20] above, his Honour concluded that in light of the evidence of the applicant’s travel, and in light of what he regarded as her unexplained wealth, the applicant was in fact aware of the nature of the goods that she was importing. He concluded that this was “not a case of recklessness”. That, in my view, can only be interpreted as a finding by his Honour that this was not a case where the applicant had been reckless in the manner contemplated by s. 5.4(1)(a) and (b) of the Code.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that it was necessary that any factual finding made on sentence be consistent with the jury’s verdict. It was submitted that the finding of the sentencing judge that this was not a case of recklessness was inconsistent with:
	



	
	the terms in which the charge had been brought;
	
	
	the position of the Crown at trial; and
	
	
	the terms in which his Honour had directed the jury.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	In written submissions, the Crown placed some significance on the provisions of s. 5.4 of the Code, and emphasised that recklessness could be constituted by proof of knowledge. It was submitted that the Crown’s position at trial was that the applicant knew that the goods in question were Tier 1 goods and that in these circumstances the finding of the sentencing judge was both open, and consistent with the jury’s verdict. It was further submitted that on sentence, his Honour had available to him evidence which was not before the jury, and which provided support for the finding he reached.
	
	
	However in oral argument, the Crown properly conceded that having regard to his Honour’s summing up, the issue had not been left to the jury on the basis of recklessness constituted by knowledge, but rather on the basis of recklessness constituted by the appellant’s awareness of a substantial risk. The Crown appeared to accept that the terms of his Honour’s directions to the jury were not consistent with his ultimate finding. However, the Crown submitted that there was nothing to indicate that such reached by his Honour had operated to increase the length of the sentence which was imposed.
	


Consideration


	
	It was not the Crown’s position at trial that the applicant knew that she was importing Tier 1 goods. As will be evident from the references to the Crown’s closing address to the jury at [41]-[44] above, the Crown’s position oscillated between asserting on the one hand that the applicant knew that she was importing prohibited goods, and asserting on the other hand that she was aware of a substantial risk that this was the case, in circumstances where it was unjustifiable to take that risk. His Honour directed the jury only as to the latter. In doing so he explained to the jury, by reference to the terms of s 5.4(1)(a) and (b) of the Code, what amounted to recklessness “in this context”, or in other words, in the context of the applicant’s trial. Moreover, immediately prior to enumerating the factors upon which the Crown relied in respect of this element, his Honour directed the jury that these factors were relied upon by the Crown to “make clear that (the applicant) was aware of this risk”.
	
	
	The sole reference in his Honour’s summing up to the applicant being aware that she was importing Tier 1 goods was that set out at [46] above. That was a passing reference only. It fell between the specific directions as to the applicant’s awareness of a substantial risk, and an enumeration of the factors relied upon by the Crown to infer such awareness. In my view, there can be no doubt that the issue was left to the jury on the basis of recklessness as defined in s. 5.4(1)(a) and (b) of the Code.
	
	
	In determining sentence, his Honour was required to find facts consistent with the verdict of the jury: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 380 per the Court. There was only one issue for the jury’s determination. As the Crown properly conceded before this Court, there is an inconsistency between the basis upon which that issue was left to the jury, and his Honour’s finding, on sentence, that the applicant knew that she was importing prohibited goods. That inconsistency is reflective of error.
	
	
	I have noted the Crown’s submission that there is nothing to indicate that his Honour’s finding that this was not a case of recklessness caused the length of the sentence to be increased. In my view, that is not to the point. The error clearly had the capacity to infect the exercise of the sentencing discretion, and was therefore material: Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 per Latham J at [83].
	
	
	For all of these reasons this ground is made out.
	


Ground 1 – THE SENTENCE WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE

The approach of this Court


	
	Ground 1 asserts that the sentence which was imposed was manifestly excessive. However, error having been found in respect of Ground 4, the provisions of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) apply. In those circumstances, it is the duty of this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh: Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 201 at [42]-[43] per French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ. It is not incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. In exercising the sentencing discretion afresh, I have had regard to those provisions of s. 16A(2) of the Act as have application in this case, as set out below.
	


The nature and circumstances of the offending – s. 16A(2)(a)


	
	For the reasons stated in considering ground 4, the verdict of the jury reflects an acceptance of the Crown case that the applicant was reckless as to the fact that the goods she was importing were prohibited. The applicant’s role was that of an importer.
	
	
	The amount of pseudoephedrine which was imported by the applicant was, on any view, significant. I accept that weight is not determinative, be it of the sentence itself or the range into which it should fall: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [68]-[69] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ; DPP v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [68] per Allsop P (as his Honour then was). However, it is clearly a factor which is relevant on sentence: R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238; (2010) 205 A Crim R 106 at [72] per Johnson J (Macfarlan JA and R A Hulme J agreeing). Further, although Wong and Nguyen were cases concerning the importation of narcotics there is, in my view, no distinction to be drawn (in terms of the relevance, on sentence, of weight) between a case involving the importation of narcotics and a case involving the importation of Tier 1 goods. This is particularly so in circumstances where the Tier 1 goods are several kilograms of pseudoephedrine, a substance which, as a matter of common knowledge, can be used as a precursor to the manufacture of illicit substances.
	
	
	Weight has added significance for the purposes of sentence where an offender is aware of it: Nguyen (supra) at [72]; Garcia v R [2013] NSWCCA 241 at [74] per Bellew J (Emmett JA and R A Hulme J agreeing). Senior counsel for the applicant, whilst accepting that weight was a relevant consideration, submitted that there was no evidence that the applicant was aware of the weight of the pseudoephedrine she had imported. However as I have noted in [8] above, the sentencing judge found the applicant had indicated to Customs officers that she had packed her bags herself. There is no challenge to that finding. Even if the applicant was not aware of the precise amount of pseudoephedrine she was importing, I am satisfied that she must have been aware that it was substantial. Her role as the importer was performed with that knowledge.
	


The degree to which the applicant has shown contrition – s 16A(2)(f)


	
	A report of Phil Gorrell, Psychologist, was tendered before the sentencing judge and forms part of the material before this Court. Mr Gorrell concluded that it did not appear that the applicant was suffering from any psychiatric disorder. He also noted that the applicant “regrets her offence”. He concluded that she had “learnt” from it, and that she was “remorseful for her naivety in trusting her ex-partner”. As against those observations, a pre-sentence report dated 17 March 2014 noted that the applicant “maintained her innocence”.
	
	
	The degree to which a person has shown contrition for an offence is a matter which the Court must take into account on sentence under s 16A(2)(f) of the Act. An expression of regret for the commission of an offence in terms such as those noted by Mr Gorrell, is to be distinguished from an expression of genuine contrition. Moreover, the observations in the pre-sentence report are at odds with expressed contrition. In all of the circumstances I am not satisfied that the applicant has demonstrated any contrition for her offending.
	


The applicant’s character, antecedents and background – s. 16A(2)(m)


	
	I have already noted that the applicant has no prior convictions. However, I regard the applicant’s evidence as to her capacity to meet the cost of her repeated overseas travel as fanciful and untruthful. The cost of that travel, bearing in mind its frequency, would be unaffordable to a person whose income consisted solely of Centrelink benefits.
	
	
	I do not accept the applicant’s evidence that her employment provided her with an additional source of income. That evidence was both vague and imprecise and I am satisfied that it was untruthful. Her evidence that she purchased air tickets when they were on sale was, in my view, an answer of convenience.
	
	
	There is necessarily a great deal of suspicion attaching to the underlying reason(s) for the frequency of the applicant’s travel to and from Vietnam. Notwithstanding that suspicion, I cannot be satisfied that the applicant has been a party to the importation of prohibited goods in the past. However, and even though the applicant has no prior convictions, her untruthful evidence before the sentencing judge necessarily reflects the identification of an unfavourable aspect of her character: Weininger (supra) at [25]. That is not to be regarded as an aggravating factor but it leads to the conclusion that the applicant is not entitled to a finding that she is a person of good character. I am left in a position where the applicant’s character works neither in her favour, nor against her.
	


The applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation – s. 16A(2)(n)


	
	There is no evidence before the Court to enable me to make any determination of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation
	


The probable effect of the sentence on the applicant’s family – s. 16A(2)(p)


	
	The applicant is a single mother of three children, the youngest of whom is now 9 years old. Whilst the applicant’s incarceration has an obviously adverse effect upon her family, it has not been suggested that such effect is any greater than might otherwise be expected. In particular, it has not been submitted that the effect upon her family is exceptional. Accordingly, whilst it remains a relevant factor on sentence, the provisions of s 16A(2)(p) of the Act are not engaged: R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222 at [22] per Hoeben CJ at CL (Latham J agreeing).
	


General deterrence


	
	Although not specifically referred to in s. 16A of the Act, general deterrence nevertheless remains an important consideration in determining sentence for a matter of this nature: DPP (Cth) v El Kaharni (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 377 per the Court; R v Riddell [2009] NSWCCA 96; (2009) 194 A Crim R 524 at [55] – [58] per Beazley JA (as her Honour then was), Blanch and Howie JJ agreeing.
	


Sentences imposed in other cases


	
	The Crown provided a schedule of sentences imposed in other cases involving the importation of quantities of pseudoephedrine. Senior Counsel for the applicant relied upon that schedule in support of a submission that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was outside of the established range. This Court has repeatedly commented upon the danger of seeking to establish the appropriateness or otherwise of a particular sentence by comparing it with sentences imposed in other cases of like offending: see for example the observations of Gleeson JA in Briouzguine v R [2014] NSWCCA 264 at [74] and following. The High Court has recently reaffirmed that consistency in sentencing is not synonymous with numerical equivalence: The Queen v Pham [2015] HCA 39 at [28] per French CJ, Keane and Nettle JJ.
	
	
	I have considered the information contained in the schedule prepared by the Crown. It is sufficient for me to note that the vast majority of cases referred to in that schedule were determined in circumstances where the particular offender received the benefit of a substantial discount to reflect a plea of guilty. That is obviously not a relevant circumstance in the present case. Such a fundamental distinction simply highlights the fact that the circumstances of cases necessarily differ and that there is limited utility in engaging in comparative exercises.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the reasons I have set out, the applicant’s offending was serious. It calls for a significant measure of general deterrence. Her subjective case is unremarkable. Taking all of the identified factors into account, and exercising the sentencing discretion afresh, I have come to the view that no other sentence is warranted.
	
	
	I therefore propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

		10 February 2016",2016-02-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768747,Application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police dated 10 February 2016 [2016] NSWSC 56,"Judgment


	
	This is an application under s 19 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth). The application is made by a proceeds of crime authority and the application is supported by an affidavit of James Patterson, who deposes that he is an authorised officer within the meaning of s 338 of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Patterson sets out in his affidavit his suspicion that the property sought to be restrained is the proceeds of a serious offence or is the property of an instrument of the offence.
	
	
	The offences concerned are an offence contrary to 400.9.1 of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), being dealing with money or property reasonably suspected to be the proceeds of crime having a value of $100,000 or more, an offence contrary to s 307.5.1 of the Schedule being possession of a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug, and an offence contrary to s 307.1 of the Schedule, being importing or exporting a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug. These offences are both indictable and serious offences within the meaning of s 19.1(d)(i) and 19.1.(d)(ii) of the Act.
	
	
	I have read the facts set out in Mr Patterson’s affidavit and relevant documents contained in the exhibit to that document, which is marked JP1. Section 19 requires that a restraining order be made if the court is satisfied that the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence or an instrument of a serious offence. I am satisfied from the material that the officer’s suspicion is reasonably held.
	
	
	There are two interested persons in relation to the property. Both were convicted and incarcerated in relation to the offences. The first is Christopher Patino. He has provided a letter to the Court saying that he has no objection to the making of the orders sought.
	
	
	The other interested person is Benjamin James Faulkner. Ms Heathcote has appeared this morning for Mr Faulkner seeking a short adjournment of the matter before restraining orders are made. Ms Heathcote is acting for Mr Faulkner in relation to his appeal from the sentence imposed by Judge Norrish in the District Court. Her firm is not acting for him in relation to this present application. Mr Faulkner has, however, made an application to Legal Aid in relation to the restraining orders and the other orders sought.
	
	
	Ms Heathcote’s instructions for present purposes are that Mr Faulkner opposes the making of the restraining orders. He claims a particular interest in some $3,000 of the amount referred to in schedule 1 to the Summons. The adjournment is sought to enable legal aid to be granted to Mr Faulkner and for an assignment of this matter to a firm to be made.
	
	
	The application for an adjournment was opposed. An alternative was put forward that, given Mr Faulkner’s interest was particularly in $3,000 of the amount sought to be restraint, that amount should be carved out from any orders that are made.
	
	
	The Plaintiff was anxious to proceed with the making of the restraining orders because until restraining orders are made orders under s 38 to have the money transferred to the custody and control of the Official Trustee cannot be made. The relevance of such transfer is that, when so transferred, the money will commence to earn interest whereas at the present time when it is held in the AFP trust account it does not earn interest. Because of the Commissioner’s duty in relation to property that has been seized and is restrained, the Plaintiff is anxious that the orders under s 38 be made.
	
	
	I consider, therefore, that the proposal to carve out the $3,000 from the amount the subject of the order is the appropriate way forward. I note that the Plaintiff gives an undertaking as to damages.
	
	
	In those circumstances, with the amendment made to Schedule 1 to reduce the amount to $135,450, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 4 of the draft orders and I stand the proceedings over before the Registrar at 9:00am on 9 March 2016.

		12 February 2016",2016-02-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768751,R v SE [2016] NSWDC 21,"Judgment

- Admissibility of two recorded telephone conversations; see transcript page


	
	HIS HONOUR: SE was arraigned in this Court yesterday on two counts, one count of sexual intercourse without consent on a person under the age of 16 years and another count of indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16 years, the offences alleged committed between 1 September 1992 and 31 October 1992 at Young.
	
	
	In respect of the prosecution of the matter on indictment the Crown is proposing to call the complainant and other witnesses, the details of the Crown’s case in a general sense was just opened upon by the Crown and I need not reiterate what the Crown anticipates its case to be in detail. This morning before the Crown opening commenced the Crown raised an issue that needed to be resolved before the Crown opened its case. Thus a “voir dire” was conducted in respect of the intention of the Crown to tender in evidence two recorded telephone conversations occurring between the complainant and the accused firstly on 26 August 2013, the transcript of which is exhibit 1 in these proceedings on the voir dire and another conversation on 27 August 2013, the transcript of which is exhibit 2 in these proceedings. I did not hear the recordings, I was not asked to listen to them.
	
	
	Objection is taken by learned counsel for the accused to the admission into evidence of the recordings and the relevant transcripts. In respect of the objection I will come back to its terms as I understood it from learned counsel in a moment.
	
	
	The Crown also tendered on the voir dire, as exhibit 3, a transcript of the electronic interview conducted with the accused as I understand it on 5 March 2014. I must say, as often happens in historical sexual assault matters, the delay in the investigation of these matters is scandalous. It is totally unfair to everybody that a complainant should go to a police station in late 2011 and the accused should not be interviewed in relation to the matter until March 2014 and I would assume be charged on that date. I appreciate the matter has been transferred from Local Area Command to Local Area Command, but it is a blight upon the criminal justice system that matters that are reported are not investigated promptly.
	
	
	In any event the Crown has advised the Court that the complainant made a statement to police in December 2011, a warrant was obtained for the purposes of recording the telephone conversations which the police rather confidently concluded would be had between the complainant and the accused. Of course, when the warrant was obtained nobody would have known how many telephone conversations would occur. These telephone conversations are sometimes referred to as “pretext conversations”.
	
	
	The Crown case in a nutshell was that when the complainant was 10 years of age she was staying at the home of her maternal aunt which as I understand it the home of the accused. Other people staying within the premises at that time were her maternal grandparents and other members of the family I assume. The allegation in relation to count 1 is that the accused came into her bedroom and removed her pants and penetrated her vagina with his finger or fingers. Immediately after the penetration of the vagina in respect of count 2 the Crown case is the accused touched her thigh or leg and then kissed her, thus giving rise to the allegation of indecent assault.
	
	
	The Crown case is that, as I would understand it, almost within some short time of minutes there was immediate complaint by the complainant to her maternal grandmother of wrongdoing on the part of the accused. What particulars were provided to her do not matter at this time. I understand from the Crown’s opening that the accused was confronted by the grandparents. There is an allegation that in fact the grandfather of the complainant struck the accused. Whether that should be admitted or not has not been a matter debated with me. I fail to see how it could establish any matter relevant in this case. Be that as it may the Crown has opened upon it.
	
	
	It seems from the Crown opening that in fact the complaint of the complainant was conveyed to her mother or other responsible adults to the point where at some time, some days later perhaps as it is not clear on the Crown opening, the complainant’s family met in Young as I understood the opening and there was discussion about whether the matter should be reported to the police. As I understand it from the Crown’s opening at the relevant time the complainant lived normally on the Central Coast. It was decided as I understand it by adults, on behalf of the complainant, the matter should not be reported to the police. Thus the Crown case is one of “historical sexual assault”. But without the “normal”, if I might call it and I am not making any comment about the matter, “delayed complaint” which often arises in such matters. I am well aware of the authorities which deal with the issue of there may be good reasons why complainants may delay in their complaint.
	
	
	With regard to the interview conducted with the accused on 5 March 2014 the “pretext” conversations were played to him and the accused was given an opportunity to comment upon them. The accused’s answers in the interview concerning the “pretext” conversations involved on his part explaining what he meant in part in the course of the conversations, but distancing himself from “wrongdoing”.
	
	
	The objection taken by learned counsel for the accused, Mr Walsh, is as I would understand it is that the representations made by the accused in the course of the two recorded conversations are “ambiguous” to use his word. Another word might be “equivocal”. That they are not capable as I would understand his submission of being relied upon by the jury as relevant admissions or confessions of wrongdoing and that this is to be seen in the context of the explanation the accused gave in relation to those recordings when he was interviewed by the police. The Crown relies upon the “pretext” conversation representations of the accused as relevant “admissions”.
	
	
	If I could just briefly turn to the evidence in summary. Exhibit 1, the first recording, amongst other things has the complainant saying in the course of explaining that she was going to be married on the weekend and something that happened when she was younger “with you” has caused her,
	


“ .. a lot of grief of over the years and I just really wanna put that all behind me and make a fresh start”... “I don’t know, I just need some sort of acknowledgement from you that what you did was the wrong thing”.


	
	The accused after the complainant had some more words said,
	


“Yeah, yeah sorry for what happened I shouldn’t have done it and yeah”.


	
	Later, or shortly afterwards I should say, the accused is recorded as saying according to the transcript,
	


“Sorry for all the grief that it caused you”.


	
	The complainant said,
	


“Yep I appreciate you saying that”.


	
	The accused said,
	


“At that time I didn’t realise that it would … (inaudible)”


	
	The complainant then said,
	


“Yeah I know. I don’t think a lot of people realise that when they do you’re not the first person who’s done that to a child, I think a lot of people don’t realise at the time how much at the time it ends up affecting the child’s life. You know what I mean? I’ve had nightmares for years and you know I’ve been petrified of you for years and I just don’t, don’t want to be that way anymore so I appreciate you talking to me, I just really needed to get closure on it all and move on”.


	
	The accused is recorded as saying,
	


“It’s affected your relationship with your family anyway”,

which the complainant did not understand. There was some discussion about some division in the family and the complainant then said,

“Yep all right, that’s all I had to say so umm I appreciate you taking the time to listen and for acknowledging what happened and you shouldn’t have done it”.


	
	The accused’s reply according to the transcript is, “inaudible”. The complainant then says, “All right I will let you go then” and then the accused is recorded as saying as if something he said earlier had been interrupted,
	


“ .. amount of trouble it caused you at the time with it”.


	
	The second conversation the following day (Exhibit 2) includes the complainant in the context that I have outlined saying:
	


“I forgot to ask why you did it ..?”


	
	The accused replied,
	


“Don’t really know why. Just went into pull the bed clothes over you.”

“’Cause I remember that, that time when I was, I think I was like nine or 10. I know Ben was just. It was either Ben or Jack, he was like in the same room, wasn’t he, from memory, he was like in a cot. I remember that time and like another time briefly when I was sitting on your lap and it was a little tickle game and then things sort of happened that shouldn’t have. Is there any other time other than those two times that you remember or was it just those two times?”


	
	The accused said,
	


“I can’t hear you too well, I think I...”


	
	And then after the complainant said,
	


“Can you hear me now?”,

the accused said, obviously reflecting that he had heard some of what the complainant said,

“Only the once I thought”.


	
	The complainant said,
	


“Okay, was it um, like was it just the one? Was it just me that you, like you did it to or have there been others other the years?”


	
	Answer,
	


“Nah, no, just you”.


	
	The complainant said,
	


“So it was just a one-off mistake?”


	
	Answer,
	


“Just a spur of the moment thing”.


	
	The complainant said something and then the accused said,
	


“I got up to go to the loo and check, check bed clothes were on and pulled them over you. I must have touched you”.


	
	The complainant said,
	


“Oh yep, yeah, because I mean, yeah, I was in bed and I remember it was like yesterday”.


	
	And then she said,
	
	
	“Like you acknowledge you touched me where you shouldn’t have and that was wrong?”
	
	
	Answer,
	


“Yeah”.


	
	The complainant said,
	


“Yep, okay, so there’s no real reason why, just a spur of the moment thing?”


	
	And the accused said,
	


“Just a spur of the moment thing”.


	
	There was then other conversation.
	
	
	I have taken the liberty of reading some relevant portions of the pretext conversation, acknowledging, as I said earlier, without going into the detail, that there is extensive questioning of the accused in the course of the electronic interview in March 2014 where he seeks to explain some of the things that he said.
	
	
	In respect of the legal issues that arise, the Crown asserts that the accused’s representations, seen in a context of the Crown case against the accused and considering the two recordings together, constitute admissions by the accused, or an admission by the accused, relevant to the circumstances surrounding the two counts in the indictment occurring at night when the complainant was in bed.
	
	
	The “Dictionary” of the Evidence Act 1995 states this,
	


“Admission means a previous representation that is:


	
	made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including an accused in a criminal proceeding) and
	
	
	adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding”.
	



	
	In this matter, in the context of inviting the parties to call whatever evidence they wished, being told that the material presented by the Crown was sufficient, no issue of voluntariness arises, no issue was argued about unfairness, for example, pursuant to s 90 or in some other way. With respect to the submission put by learned counsel for the accused, in my view, it could be fairly said that there could be not said to be in respect of the relevant representations upon which the Crown would wish to rely made by the accused any ‘ambiguity’ in his responses to the representations made by the complainant.
	
	
	The situation is, having regard to the definition of “admission”, that there are representations of the accused which can be taken as representations against the interests of the accused relevant to the circumstances concerned with counts 1 and 2.
	
	
	The complaint of the defence, in its submissions skilfully put by Mr Walsh, that there were insufficient particulars provided in the conversation from the complainant falls away when one has regard to what the accused specifically admitted in the interview, having regard to the Crown case.
	
	
	To come back to the use of the word ‘ambiguity’. In the overall context of the case, and this includes taking into account the explanations given by the accused in the electronic interview, in my view, the purported ambiguities are matters that go to the weight of the evidence and certainly are not concerned with the assessment of the issue of ""relevance"" as defined by s 55 of the Act or a consideration of the “probative value” of the evidence in the context of judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal such as Shamouil, XY and DJS, judgments I hasten to say, that were extensively discussed in the trial that I have just received a verdict in which has interrupted the conduct of this trial. I have been conducting, in effect, two trials at the one time.
	
	
	Thus, I have concluded, that the evidence is relevant. That the evidence is admissible, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act at Part 3.4, providing an exception to the hearsay rule as evidence of a relevant “admission”. There is, as I said earlier, no basis argued or even hinted at to exclude the admission by reference to other provisions in Part 3.4 of the Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The one matter of course that concerned me and I raised it directly with Mr Walsh, was the issue of s 137 of the Act. Obviously, if the probative value of a particular piece of evidence is outweighed by the unfair prejudice caused by the evidence, the evidence must be excluded. The probative value of the evidence is a matter in the context of the case, as I earlier cited, where one has to consider the issue of the capability of the evidence to be acted upon in a particular way by the jury. It is not for me to assess the ‘reliability’, of any representation made by the accused. I hasten to say, in this context, there is absolutely no doubt, as I understand it, that the relevant representations were made. Thus the objective reliability of the representations is beyond any doubt whatsoever. The issue of ‘reliability’, is actually concerned with whether the representations were true. To my mind this is a matter that has to be seen in the context of the answers given by the accused in the interview and is not a matter that is of any moment, in this case, in considering the issues that arise under s 137. It is a matter entirely for the jury not this Court.
	
	
	In any event, having regard to the probative value of the evidence, the issue is also one of considering the potential for unfair prejudice. In my view the unfair prejudice that might be divined would be the potential for the evidence to be misused by the jury. I am of the view this can be dealt with by appropriate direction. The admissions of the accused are capable of establishing that the accused was in the room with the complainant and in some way touched her or had contact with her, in the course of an evening when she was staying in the house. That evidence contained within those representations would have to be seen in the context of the wider Crown case.
	
	
	The jury would be told, obviously, that the admission of the accused is not a confession by the accused, of digital penetration and it is not a confession of indecent assault. But it is an admission that can be considered with the other evidence in the case, including, if I could call them the exculpatory explanations of the accused in the interview, for the jury to determine what weight it has in supporting or not, the evidence of the complainant in relation to the allegations. Thus, in the circumstances of the matter I am prepared to admit the pretext conversations.
	
	
	There is one matter we have not discussed. It has not been raised with me directly. I did not have much time to consider the detail of exhibit 1 and 2 because, as I said, I am trying to run two trials at the one time. There may be some argument as to whether part of the representations made by the complainant to the accused ought be deleted from the recording. I particularly refer to, and this is a matter for debate I have not formed a considered view about it, some representations made by the complainant such as:
	


“I’ve had nightmares for years and you know I’ve been petrified of you for years”.


	
	It seems to me, with respect, that that statement does not necessarily add any weight or provide any real context for the representation made by the accused in reply. I am prepared to hear further submissions about the aspects of that matter at an appropriate time.
	
	
	Thus, I will admit the recording subject to any discussion about editing.

		09 March 2016",2016-02-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768755,R v Van Ryn [2016] NSWCCA 1,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Mr Maurice Van Ryn committed 17 child sexual assault offences against 9 victims over an 11 year period from 2003 to 2014. He was sentenced in the District Court by Jeffreys DCJ on 9 September 2015 to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 13 years with a non-parole period of 7 years. The sentence was backdated to 10 December 2014. The respondent will become eligible for release on parole on 9 December 2021.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) on behalf of the Crown filed an appeal against the sentence pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on 22 September 2015. The Crown contends that the sentence is manifestly inadequate and asserts that there are numerous errors in the judge's assessment of sentence that explain why that is so.
	
	
	Mr Van Ryn (“the respondent”) contends that none of the asserted errors are made out; that the sentence is not manifestly inadequate; and that even if the Court found that it was, it was not such an affront to justice that the Court would be persuaded to exercise its discretion to intervene by increasing it.
	
	
	I am of the view that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. There were a number of specific errors made by the judge in his approach to sentencing which may explain the inadequacy of the sentence. Even if the errors were not the cause of the inadequacy, the sentence is so unreasonable and plainly unjust that it amounts to an affront to the administration of criminal justice. The Court should exercise its discretion to intervene and impose an appropriate sentence.
	


Sentence details


	
	The respondent pleaded guilty to 10 offences set out on one indictment (""the first indictment"") and 4 offences set out on another (""the second indictment""). He also asked that his guilt in respect of a further 3 offences listed on “Form 1” documents be taken into account in the assessment of sentence for 3 of the offences to which he had pleaded guilty.
	
	
	The judge imposed an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In doing so it was necessary for him to indicate the individual sentences that would have been imposed if he were not imposing an aggregate sentence (“indicative sentences”).
	
	
	All of the offences were contrary to provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Standard non-parole periods under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) were prescribed for most of them. In respect of those offences, it was necessary for the judge to also indicate the non-parole period he would otherwise have imposed. (His Honour did not comply with this requirement in respect of count 1 in the first indictment but that has no effect on validity: s 54B(7).)
	


Facts


	
	The following summary of the facts pertaining to the respondent’s offending is drawn from a statement of agreed facts which was before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The respondent lived with his wife in the Bega district during the period of the offending. He was a prominent member of the community by virtue of his position as Chief Executive Officer of Bega Cheese Pty Limited. He also held a number of volunteer positions in the community. He and his wife lived in a large home with a swimming pool, spa and tennis court. Their children were all adults who had left home. The respondent knew each of his victims, mostly by association with their parents or grandparents.
	


Offences in the first indictment

Count 1 – Victim 1 – Between 1 December 2004 and 31 January 2005: Indecent assault of child under 16

Section 61M(1) – maximum penalty 7 years – SNPP 5 years.

Indicative sentence: 9 months.


	
	Victim 1 was a 10 year old girl whose family had a practice of visiting friends in the Bega district during the summer school holidays. The two families would often visit and socialise at the respondent’s home. There was an occasion during the 2004 summer holidays when Victim 1 went to the respondent’s home with her parents and siblings. At some point she changed into her swimming costume and entered the pool. She remembered people getting in and out of the pool. At one point the respondent was sitting next to her and he placed his hands on the inside of her swimmers and felt her buttocks. He removed his hand and she moved away to sit with her mother. Sometime after this she was again seated next to the respondent and he placed his hand down the front of her swimmers and rubbed her genitalia. Victim 1 then got out of the pool and thereafter kept away from the respondent. She did not complain about his conduct because she was upset and confused by his actions.
	


Count 2 – Victim 2 – Between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2007: Persistent sexual abuse of a child

Section 66EA – maximum penalty 25 years.

Indicative sentence: 8 years – NPP 4 years.


	
	The family of victim 2 lived in the Bega district and were friends with the respondent’s family. Victim 2 suffered from bullying at school and as a result spent a large amount of time at home on his computer. He would visit the respondent’s home on most occasions that his parents did so. Victim 2 enjoyed being at the respondent’s home because he was able to use the swimming pool, spa and play computer games. The respondent befriended him and the pair formed a close relationship. He gave him small gifts, soft drinks and lollies and paid him for performing odd jobs. Victim 2 began spending time alone with the respondent. When he was aged between 10 and 11 the respondent initiated sexual contact with him. This involved him sitting next to victim 2 on the lounge and rubbing his upper thigh.
	
	
	The respondent’s behaviour escalated to the point that when victim 2 was aged between 11 and 12 the pair would have a spa together. During those occasions he would place his hand on the upper thigh of the victim before moving it to touch his genitals. Victim 2 said this touching of his genitals happened “on a number of occasions”. It was an agreed fact that this conduct occurred regularly in the period when victim 2 was aged 12 to 14.
	
	
	On one occasion when victim 2 was aged 12 the respondent sat beside him on the lounge and masturbated his penis while masturbating his own penis. The respondent then commenced performing oral sex on victim 2, continuing until he ejaculated. The respondent performed oral sex on victim 2 on a number of occasions up until he turned 15.
	
	
	On another occasion when victim 2 was aged 13½ he was with the respondent in his home office. The respondent played a pornographic CD on his computer. He began masturbating victim 2 whilst masturbating his own penis. He then performed fellatio upon victim 2 before standing in front of him with his own erect penis near the face of victim 2. He placed his hands on the back of the boy’s head and attempted to pull his mouth towards his penis. Victim 2 turned his head away. The respondent said, “It’s okay, just try it”. Victim 2 declined but the respondent tried again to the point where his penis touched the mouth of victim 2. He then released the boy’s head and they put their clothes back on.
	
	
	A similar incident occurred a few months later in the lounge room after the respondent began playing a pornographic movie on the television. It culminated in him attempting to insert his penis into the mouth of victim 2. Victim 2 kept his mouth closed but could feel the respondent’s penis pressing against his lips. The respondent said, “Just open your mouth up and stop tensing”. Victim 2 shook his head and the incident concluded.
	
	
	When victim 2 was aged 14 he went with the respondent on an overnight stay to Canberra. The respondent picked him up from school on a Friday afternoon and they went to watch a rugby game in a corporate box owned by Bega Cheese at Bruce Stadium. After the game they travelled to a motel room where the respondent gave him alcohol which he consumed. As they were sitting on a bed the respondent put on a pornographic movie on his laptop computer. He then began masturbating victim 2 and performed oral sex on him. He stopped and put victim 2, who was naked, onto his stomach and then straddled him. Victim 2 could feel the respondent’s penis touching him between the cheeks of his backside. Victim 2 moved away and the respondent desisted. They then watched more of the pornographic movie and had another alcoholic drink before they went to separate beds.
	
	
	There was another occasion when victim 2 went with the respondent to gather oysters on the Bega River. The respondent showed victim 2 a pornographic magazine and began rubbing victim 2’s penis. He was rubbing his own penis as he did so. He then performed oral sex on victim 2.
	
	
	Another incident occurred when victim 2 was aged 14½. He was in the lounge room at the respondent’s house watching television. The respondent sat next to him and commenced masturbating him and himself and then removed their clothing. He knelt in front of victim 2 and tried to insert his penis into victim 2’s anus. Victim 2 wriggled and the respondent’s attempt failed. The respondent then rolled victim 2 onto his stomach and then achieved penetration of the boy’s anus with his penis. This caused victim 2 pain and he called out. The respondent removed his penis and they put their clothes back on. Victim 2 had bleeding from the anus shortly after and the respondent did not attempt anal sex with him again.
	


Count 3 – Victim 3 – Between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2011: Aggravated indecent assault of child under 16

Section 61M(2) – maximum penalty 10 years – SNPP 8 years.

Indicative sentence: 12 months – NPP 6 months.


	
	Victims 3 and 4 were brothers. Their grandparents lived in the Bega district and they would often stay with them. The grandparents were friends with the respondent and his family and often visited his home. Victims 3 and 4 would attend such social gatherings with their parents and grandparents when they were in the area.
	
	
	There was an occasion when victim 3 was aged about 10 or 11 when he was at the respondent’s home with his family. A number of guests were either in or in the vicinity of the spa. Victim 3 entered the spa with a number of people including the respondent. At one point the respondent was next to him and reached across and inserted his hands into victim 3’s swimmers and took hold of his genitals.

	The family of victim 5 lived in the Bega district and developed a close friendly relationship with the respondent and his family. Victim 5 recalled an occasion during the summer holidays of 2011/12 when he was 13 years old. Victim 5 was in the computer room intending to download some music from the respondent’s computer to victim 5’s iPod. The respondent approached and opened the front Velcro section of victim 5’s board shorts and took hold of his penis. He commenced stroking it and as he did so he said, “One day I am going to put my mouth around it”. Victim 5 was shocked and remained seated.
	


Form 1 offence in relation to Count 7 – Victim 5 – 23 July 2014: Aggravated indecent assault of child under 16

Section 61M(2) – maximum penalty 10 years – SNPP 8 years.


	
	On 23 July 2014, victim 5 was being given a driving lesson by the respondent. As victim 5 was driving the respondent placed his hand on to victim 5’s thigh. Victim 5 attempted to move his leg away but the hand remained on his thigh. At one point the respondent leant across and tried to kiss the side of his face but victim 5 pulled his head away.
	


Count 8 – Victim 6 – Between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012: Aggravated indecent assault of child under 16

Section 61M(2) – maximum penalty 10 years – SNPP 8 years.

Indicative sentence: 12 months – NPP 6 months.


	
	Victim 6 was a sibling of victim 5. He recalled an occasion when he was about 13 years of age when he was in the computer room of the respondent’s house looking at a movie on the computer. The respondent knelt beside him and put his hand on his knee and then moved it to his groin. He then put his hand under victim 6’s shorts and took hold of his penis and commenced to rub it. Victim 6 said he was scared and just sat there.
	


Count 9 - Victim 7 – Between 1 January 2004 – 31 December 2005: Aggravated indecent assault of child under 16

Section 61M(2) – maximum penalty 10 years – SNPP 8 years.

Indicative sentence: 12 months – NPP 6 months.


	
	Victim 7 grew up with his family in the Bega district and would often spend time at the respondent’s home. He recalled an occasion when he was 13 years old when he and some other boys and adults were there. At one point the respondent picked victim 7 up and carried him to a quiet area of the pool. The respondent positioned himself so that he had his back to the other persons in the pool area. He said to victim 7, “Do you want to be my special friend? You can be my special friend.” As he was saying this he was tickling victim 7 but then moved his hand down his chest to his groin. He then began fondling victim 7’s genitals on the outside of his board shorts. This continued for about a minute until someone approached.
	


Count 10 – Victim 8 – 5 June 2014: Aggravated act of indecency towards child under 10

Section 61O(2) – maximum penalty 7 years.

Indicative sentence: 9 months.


	
	Victim 8’s family were regular visitors to the respondent’s home. On the evening of 5 June 2014, when victim 8 was aged 8, she was in the downstairs area of the home playing with some toys. The respondent’s wife and victim 8’s mother were upstairs. The respondent approached her with his pants open and with his penis exposed. He walked towards her and put his hands on her arms and moved them towards his body. She pulled her arms away from him and walked away. She left the house with her mother shortly after. On the drive home she disclosed what had happened to her mother. Her mother contacted the respondent’s wife and let her know what had happened. Police were then contacted.
	


Offences in the second indictment

Count 1 – Victim 9 – Between 1 January and 20 December 2010: Aggravated indecent assault of child under 16

Section 61M(2) – maximum penalty 10 years – SNPP 8 years.

Indicative sentence: 12 months – NPP 6 months.


	
	Victim 9 moved with his family into the area in early 2010 and they became acquainted with the respondent. Victim 9 was aged 15. The respondent offered victim 9 the opportunity to use the facilities at his home including the swimming pool, spa, computer equipment and tennis court. A relationship developed to the point where victim 9 saw the respondent as a father figure and role model and he visited the respondent on a very regular basis.
	
	
	On an occasion in early 2010 the respondent and victim 9 were in the spa when the respondent placed his arm around victim 9 and lifted him onto his lap. Victim 9 felt that the respondent had an erection which he felt against his back. Victim 9 did not say anything when this happened because he “froze”, was embarrassed and not sure what to do.
	
	
	Victim 9 said that this occurred on most occasions that he was in the spa with the respondent up until December 2010.
	


Offence taken into account in relation to Count 1 – Victim 9 – Between 1 January and 20 December 2010: Aggravated indecent assault of child under 16

Section 61M(2) – maximum penalty 10 years – SNPP 8 years.


	
	On one of the occasions when the respondent was in the spa with victim 9, he moved victim 9 onto his lap and victim 9 could feel the respondent’s erect penis against his back. The respondent placed his hand inside victim 9’s swimmers and pulled them down. He could then feel the respondent’s erect penis rubbing against his buttocks. The respondent was groaning as he did this. Again, victim 9 did not say anything because he “froze”, was embarrassed, and not sure what to do.
	


Count 2 – Victim 9 – Between 1 January and 20 December 2010: Aggravated indecent assault of child under 16

Section 61M(2) – maximum penalty 10 years – SNPP 8 years.

Indicative sentence: 2 years 6 months – NPP 15 months.


	
	On another occasion victim 9 was in the spa the respondent placed his hand inside victim 9’s swimmers, held his penis and masturbated him. Victim 9 said he did not say anything when this happened for the same reasons earlier indicated. Victim 9 said that this type of incident occurred on most occasions that he was in the pool or spa with the respondent or was using the respondent’s computer.
	


Counts 3 and 4 – Victim 9 – Between 1 January and 20 December 2010: Aggravated sexual intercourse with child aged 14 to 16

Section 66C(4) – maximum penalty 12 years.

Indicative sentences: 4 years – NPP 2 years.


	
	On one occasion when victim 9 was visiting the respondent’s home they were watching movies together. The respondent placed his hands down the front of victim 9’s pants and commenced masturbating him. After about 5 minutes the respondent removed victim 9’s lower clothing. He then performed fellatio on victim 9 who was seated on a couch. The respondent then took hold of his arms and moved him onto the floor. The respondent inserted his penis into victim 9’s anus. Victim 9 felt immediate pain. The respondent began thrusting his penis into victim 9’s anus causing more pain. The respondent said, “Does that feel good?” Victim 9 replied, “No it hurts”. The respondent said, “Can I cum inside you?” Victim 9 replied, “No”. The respondent had anal intercourse for some 5 minutes before he stopped after victim 9 indicated he was feeling pain.
	
	
	Victim 9 said that the respondent had penile/anal intercourse with him on about 3 separate occasions but could not identify the other occasions with specificity. He said the respondent performed fellatio on him at least 15 to 20 times during 2010.
	
	
	Victim 9 moved away from the area in 2013. In 2014 he became aware that the respondent had been charged. He made contact with a counselling agency before contacting police in May 2014.
	


Personal circumstances of the respondent


	
	The respondent was aged 60 at the time of sentencing. He had been married for 34 years and had 3 adult children. He was described as having had a positive childhood and had not been exposed to violence or sexual abuse. He had a degree in business studies and had a very successful career in business, working as an accountant with Elders IXL for 10 years and then with the Bega Cheese company for 26 years.
	
	
	He was the chief executive officer of Bega Cheese until he stood down in 2006 and took up a role as international business manager. The company became very successful under his stewardship. He retired at the end of 2012 and then performed some part-time work for a pharmaceutical company.
	
	
	The respondent gave evidence in the sentence proceedings and a number of documents were tendered. They included reports by Dr Bruce Westmore and Dr Jeremy O’Dea, forensic psychiatrists, and by Dr Donald Rowe, neuropsychologist. There were also a statement by the respondent’s wife and a bundle of character references.
	
	
	The respondent has no criminal history in New South Wales but was dealt with for an offence of indecent exposure in Victoria in 1981.
	


Dr Bruce Westmore’s report of 17 January 2015


	
	Dr Westmore assessed the respondent shortly after he was arrested in July 2014. He referred the respondent to Dr O’Dea for treatment and reassessed him in January 2015.
	
	
	Dr Westmore reported that the respondent had told him that he had pleaded guilty to 12 counts of “indecent assault basically”.
	
	
	The respondent told Dr Westmore that all of the offences occurred in his own home. He accepted that he had inappropriate relationships with the victims, “But they all loved being with me and unfortunately, I loved being with them. None of them ever turned on me for what I did to them”.
	
	
	Dr Westmore had available to him the Court Attendance Notices and the Statement of Facts. He said, “I note behaviour consistent with grooming and the detailed description of the offending behaviour in relation to each of the victims”. He indicated that the respondent was not denying any of those details.
	
	
	The respondent told Dr Westmore that his marriage had been a generally happy one and that he had a satisfactory sexual relationship with his wife although in recent years the frequency of intimacy had decreased.
	
	
	The respondent described sexual attractions and fantasies which included younger women and sometimes teenagers and also, some less frequent fantasies involving pre-adolescent children. Dr Westmore said that the respondent’s principal non-adult based sexual focus appeared to be directed towards children who are in the transition between being pre-pubertal into early puberty. He also acknowledged longstanding and repeated fantasies of exposing himself. His sexual thoughts, feelings and impulses towards very young teenagers, mainly girls but sometimes boys, had been more persistent and intrusive and had represented a problem for him for many years.
	
	
	The respondent confirmed to Dr Westmore that he had been seeing Dr O’Dea and had commenced with anti-libidinal medication in November 2014. He told Dr Westmore that within two weeks his testosterone levels had reduced significantly and “the change that happened to me mentally was staggering. It was like a veil had been lifted, a breath of fresh air. Prior to the medication, most of my days were associated with inappropriate thoughts but, within a space of two or three weeks, my life changed mentally.” He also said that “the constant intrusive inappropriate fantasies just weren’t there anymore”. He also said, “the tragedy of all of this is, you don’t see ads on television (that say), if you are this way (sexually attracted to children), you can do something about it”. He wondered why there was not more proactive information about these particular sexual problems.
	
	
	The respondent told Dr Westmore that he had continued taking the medication after going into custody in December 2014 and intended to keep doing so, including after release. He also said that he would be “more than happy” to attend a sex offenders program.
	
	
	The respondent said that he continued to receive strong support from his wife and three children and expects that this will continue when he returns to the community.
	
	
	Dr Westmore asked the respondent whether the offending behaviour was wrong and the respondent replied, “Of course it was wrong, it is illegal and if it negatively and hurtfully hurt the victims (it was wrong)”. He acknowledged a breach of trust: “I abused that trust that their parents gave me and the kids themselves gave me and for that, I’m eternally regretful”.
	
	
	The respondent spoke of being in protection as a “limited association prisoner” although he reported having no major difficulties; he got on with the officers and other inmates. He received a lot of visits from family members.
	
	
	Dr Westmore described the respondent as presenting with complex Paraphilic Disorder. He diagnosed him as suffering from an Exhibitionistic Disorder (sexually aroused by exposing genitals to pre-pubertal children). He also considered it appropriate to make a diagnosis of Paedophilic Disorder (non-exclusive type – sexually attracted to both males and females). He noted that the respondent’s self-reported aberrant sexual focus is towards pre-pubescent children who are entering early pubescence. Dr Westmore queried whether others might debate whether the respondent’s condition was more consistent with Hebephilia. However he thought that was probably more of a semantic issue. Noting the age range of the victims (8 to 15) he thought the respondent might have both conditions.
	
	
	Dr Westmore said that people who suffer from Paraphilia, such as the one suffered by the respondent, have a genetic/constitutional vulnerability to behave in such a way. The paraphilic component of the respondent’s sexual profile was an integral part of his “sexual orientation”. Dr Westmore did not believe that that component can be changed, altered or extinguished, but believed that, with appropriate psychiatric intervention, aspects of it could be contained and controlled.
	
	
	Dr Westmore said it was too early to pass any definitive opinions in relation to the respondent’s long-term risk but there were some early positive indicators which might suggest that his long-term risk of re-offending is in the lower range. In this regard, Dr Westmore said:
	


“I note his positive biological response to the introduction of the antiandrogen medication, along with the self-reported positive psychological changes, which have occurred since he has been on this medication. I note he continues to receive strong support from his wife, mother and children and he has reasonably good insight into the wrongness of his actions, how he betrayed the trust of others, including the children, when committing the offending acts. His positive attitude towards his past, current and ongoing treatment is also a positive prognostic indicator, as is his willingness to attend a Sex Offenders’ Programme whilst in custody.”


	
	Dr Westmore also acknowledged limitations associated with risk prediction. The extent to which the respondent participated in a sex offenders program would be important as would his ongoing willingness to take medication in the long-term, and perhaps for the rest of his life. He considered that the respondent would need to remain under the care of a psychiatrist indefinitely.
	


Dr Jeremy O’Dea’s reports of 30 January 2015 and 5 August 2015


	
	The respondent had seven consultations with Dr Jeremy O’Dea between the referral from Dr Westmore in July and when his bail was revoked in December 2014. Dr O’Dea saw him again on 24 January 2015 and provided a report a short time later.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea’s report included an account of the offence of indecent exposure committed in Melbourne in 1981. The respondent told Dr O’Dea that he had been driving his car at dusk one evening when he had his penis out. He said it was not erect and he was not masturbating. When he stopped at traffic lights a paperboy aged about 12 saw him and took his registration number. As a result the respondent immediately went to the police station and gave himself in. He received a fine and a bond with a condition that he attend a psychiatrist. He said that he had six to eight counselling sessions with a psychiatrist over four to six months.
	
	
	(This account of the 1981 offence is at odds with what the respondent told Dr Rowe who said that ""he reported being caught masturbating in his car"".)
	
	
	Dr O’Dea noted the various offences to which the respondent had (at that stage) pleaded guilty and noted that they included “apparent grooming behaviours, and repeated sexual relations with a particular male child … including anal intercourse”. The respondent told him that the majority of his sexual offences against children “have been in my house … not outside … on my turf … after a period of friendship …”.
	
	
	The respondent reported lifelong specific and strong sexual fantasies and urges towards both male and female children. These urges had been experienced on a daily basis in the past. He said, “I thought they were my fantasies … that most of my life I could control them and keep them as fantasies”. He also told Dr O’Dea of experiencing problems with exhibitionism which he described as a longstanding issue since his teenage years.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea reported that the respondent said that he had a satisfactory sexual relationship with his wife.
	
	
	In describing the respondent’s presentation at interviews, Dr O’Dea said, “He has shown remorse, regret and contrition for his actions in relation to his paedophilia, exhibitionism and sex offending behaviours.” (The doctor did not say how.)
	
	
	Dr O’Dea diagnosed the respondent as suffering from “Paraphilic Disorders, namely Paedophilic Disorder, sexually attracted to both males and females, not limited to incest, predominant if not exclusive (so called Bisexual Paedophilia); and Exhibitionistic Disorder (Exhibitionism)”.
	
	
	It was Dr O’Dea who prescribed anti-libidinal/testosterone lowering medication to the respondent in November 2014. He described this being considered the most effective treatment for the respondent’s diagnosed condition. After several weeks the respondent reported not having any sexual fantasies towards children. Testing by Dr O’Dea showed a significant reduction in testosterone levels. When the respondent was reviewed by Dr O’Dea in custody on 24 January 2015 he spoke of being in control of his paedophilic urges and fantasies and wanted to continue the medication through to his eventual release into the community.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea said that the respondent would require ongoing forensic psychiatric assessment and treatment in the community in the long-term aimed at assisting him to successfully manage and minimise the risk of him engaging in further sex offending behaviours.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea said that the type of paedophilia suffered by the respondent would be generally considered a form of sexual orientation that people would not necessarily choose. The treatment, including the anti-libidinal medication, was not a cure but allowed a patient to control and/or extinguish urges and fantasies and therefore control and extinguish abhorrent behaviours, thereby conducting themselves safely in the community.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea provided a second report after being advised of the further charges that came to be placed on the second indictment. He said that those additional offences did not alter the substance of the opinions that he had expressed previously.
	


Dr Donald Rowe’s reports of 4 February 2015 and 23 July 2015


	
	The respondent saw Dr Rowe in November 2014 and January 2015. The history he gave included masturbation on an average of twice per day prior to receiving anti-libidinal medication. Dr Rowe opined that this was abnormal and a symptom of hypersexual behaviour.
	
	
	The respondent told Dr Rowe of a “relatively normal sex life with his wife for approximately 20 years, after which it began to decline with little or no sexual intimacy for the past 5 to 10 years”. Dr Rowe noted the coincidence of an absence of sexual relations with his wife with the commencement of the alleged offences in 2004. It was Dr Rowe’s opinion that this “most likely contributed in part to more wayward avenues of sexual excitement and relief”.
	
	
	The respondent told Dr Rowe that he “semi-retired” in 2004/2005 which left him with additional recreational time. Again, Dr Rowe noted the coincidence with the commencement of the offences. He wrote:
	


“In my opinion, the series of changes relating to an absence of sexual relations with his wife, reduced access to more legitimate avenues of sexual relief and his semi-retirement, in the context of what was a hypersexual disorder, most likely contributed to his abnormal touching of children and adolescents (due to having more time and contact) and eventual sexual behaviours with some of those young people. Mr Van Ryn due to being less occupied and more sexually frustrated would have also had more time to think about and focus on his deviant sexual obsessions and inadvertently at times involved pre-pubescent and pubescent children”


	
	The respondent’s report of an average of 14 and up to 28 orgasms per week throughout his adult life, generally obtained through masturbation, in addition to frequent thoughts of sexual acts, brothel visits and unprotected sex, were consistent with a chronic case of hypersexual behaviour.
	
	
	Dr Rowe noted a high incidence of childhood ADHD in individuals with hypersexual disorder (17 %) and of those with both hypersexual disorder and a paraphilic disorder (50 %). He reviewed the respondent’s high school reports and noted that his “scholastic background is consistent with the presence of ADHD type features and a probable diagnosis. Neuropsychological testing administered and interpreted by Dr Rowe confirmed in his mind a diagnosis of “high functioning ADHD”. He wrote:
	


“Notably, ADHD is associated with deficits weaknesses [sic] in the area of executive functions which are important for the maintenance of planning, organisation, self-monitoring, response inhibition/impulsivity, reasoning, consequential thinking, decision making and careful judgment. Such individuals are at risk of committing various criminal offences as shown in clinical and forensic studies.

However, patients with ADHD alone do not necessarily commit criminal acts but in the presence of other factors such as hypersexuality and certain environmental factors the individual may not be able to sufficiently inhibit their strong sexual impulses or other impulsive behaviours.”


	
	Dr Rowe cited the offence committed against victim 8 (count 10) as an example of the effects of ADHD and hypersexual disorder. The respondent had told Dr Rowe that the victim and her mother had spent the prior two weeks with him and his wife. He said that there was a lot of playful and physical contact between himself and the victim. He told Dr Rowe, “I had a brain snap and quickly realised what I was doing was wrong and covered up … I didn’t have an erection”.
	
	
	(I note that this is inconsistent with the agreed statement of facts which says that the victim and the mother were at the respondent’s premises on the relevant evening for a meal and the child disclosed to her mother what had occurred on their way home. Further, the claim to having had a ""brain snap"" is seemingly at odds with the agreed fact that the respondent approached the child whilst she was alone in a downstairs area of the house playing with toys while her mother and the respondent's wife were upstairs.)
	
	
	Dr Rowe summarised the significance of his findings of the respondent having ADHD, Hypersexual Disorder and Paedophilia/Hebephilia as follows:
	


“Individuals, with each of these conditions alone, ADHD, HD and/or Paedophilia/Hebephilia do not necessarily commit criminal acts. However, as a result of their somewhat extreme interests and behavioural tendencies, like the respondent, they may be more physical and impulsive (without thought) in their interactions, such as leading to behaviours akin to sexual groping or molestation.

The problem arises when such individuals are exposed to situations where their sexual drive is insufficiently satisfied and due to their underlying sexual impulsivity and paedophilic/hebephilic tendencies they are attracted to the idea of sexual relations with children and adolescents and if untreated inadvertently can act on these impulses, like that which occurred in the case of the respondent, as described in the NSW Police Facts Sheets.

In my opinion, had the respondent not suffered from a combination of ADHD and/or HD he is likely to have been able to better inhibit his paedophilic behaviours. Or had he continued to remain in full time employment from 2004 onwards having less contact with young people and greater contact with adults, including more appropriate adult sexual interactions, it is most likely he would not have participated in such illegal behaviours.” (Emphasis added)


	
	Dr Rowe also reported that the respondent had suffered “deep regret and depression” over the experience. The respondent had said that he knew that what he was doing was wrong but at the time had not considered the consequences. He also acknowledged that “he had caused hurt to his family and was concerned about any potential damage he had inflicted on the victims”.
	
	
	Dr Rowe noted that the respondent had commenced taking anti-libidinal medication. He considered that he had displayed a motivation to treat his condition. The respondent had said to him, “If only these sorts of medication treatments were advertised for individuals with my sort of problem”.
	
	
	On the subject of risk of re-offending, Dr Rowe said:
	


“In my opinion, given the respondent’s acknowledgement of the illegality of his offences and if he were to continue with the full treatment program (which I have recommended in Appendix A and which he has partly commenced), then the likelihood of him suffering a relapse or reoffending would be significantly reduced and in all likelihood become increasingly negligible.”


	
	Dr Rowe provided a further report after being advised of the further offences in the second indictment. He, like Dr O’Dea, confirmed that they did not alter his previously expressed opinions.
	


Statement by the respondent’s wife


	
	A letter by the respondent’s wife was tendered which spoke extensively of the achievements he had made whilst CEO of the Bega Cheese company. She also outlined the charitable and other good works the respondent had provided to the Bega Valley community. Ms Van Ryn spoke of a number of negative aspects of the media publicity the case had attracted including some distressing events directed at her. She confirmed her commitment to support the respondent in the future. She said, “I have full confidence that he is totally remorseful for his action and wants nothing more than to redeem himself”. (What led her to think that he was ""totally remorseful"" was not explained.)
	


Character references


	
	The respondent’s various positive attributes and his commitment and contribution to the local community were confirmed in a body of character references.
	
	
	On the subject of remorse, a retired teacher said, “Maurice has shown remorse and is doing everything in his power to amend his behaviour”. His uncle wrote, “He is genuinely sorry for what he has done and now truly realises the harm that can often flow from actions such as this”. A former manager at Bega Cheese who had maintained both business and social contact with the respondent said that he had “expressed to me his regret and remorse on many occasions for his past actions”.
	


Evidence by the respondent


	
	The sentence hearing commenced before Jeffreys DCJ at the Bega sittings of the District Court on 4 February 2015. The first indictment was presented and pleas of guilty were entered. It should be noted that the respondent had previously entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court on 25 November 2014.
	
	
	The respondent gave evidence when the hearing resumed on 26 February 2015. He confirmed that he had told the truth to the authors of the various reports and that what appeared in them accurately represented what he had said. He accepted the diagnosis of Paraphilic Disorder and he confirmed that he had been sexually attracted to children since his early teens.
	
	
	In relation to the indecent exposure in Victoria in 1981, the respondent said that he saw a psychiatrist for two or three months over six to eight consultations but he did not derive any benefit from it.
	
	
	He was asked by his counsel to explain why the offending started in 2004 and he said, that he could not: “I think it’s fair to say that the control that I had over those sexual urges that I had, there were those odd moments unfortunately when I didn’t exert the control that I should have”. (Emphasis added)
	
	
	He agreed that he knew that what he was doing was wrong and that it was against the law. He was asked whether he knew that it carried a risk of harm to children and he said that whilst it was not in the forefront of his mind at the time but he understood there was a “potential” risk of harm to children. He repeated that he “wasn’t able to resist that urge that hit me at that moment … it was an urge to touch basically … I just did not have the control and I touched”.
	
	
	The respondent was reminded that the offending progressed beyond touching and he said, “It did in one case”. (He had not been charged with the offences on the second indictment at that time.)
	
	
	He was asked whether he groomed any of the children in the sense of engaging in behaviour designed to make them receptive to sexual offending and he gave a categorical denial. He denied planning any of the assaults and maintained that they were “all opportunistic at a moment in time”.
	
	
	He was asked whether he was aware of the existence of anti-libidinal medication prior to 2014. He said he was not and “that’s a real part of the tragedy of the story”. He added, “I’ve been pretty upset about the fact that there were things out there I could have done that I have never known about”.
	
	
	He gave the following evidence on the subject of remorse:
	


“Q. Do you wish to say anything to the victims of these offences and their families?

A. It’s very emotional for me to do so because the parents - most of them are here - and the victims were quite frankly our dearest and closest friends. We had something special … where we socialised virtually on a daily basis and a few minutes of stupidity on my part wrecked something that was really good and really special so obviously I am extremely regretful about what happened, I am extremely sorry for any harm I might have hurt those kids, I’m really, really sorry that we destroyed friendships and relationships that were special, long-lasting, and you know if I could turn back the clock and get those friends back I certainly would try and do so.” (Emphasis added)


	
	Evidence was given about the conditions of custody he had experienced and he referred to being the subject of verbal abuse and accepted that he would always require protection within the prison system.
	
	
	In cross-examination the respondent was asked about his reference to “a few minutes of stupidity” and it was suggested to him that he was “playing it down somewhat”. He replied:
	


“A. I don’t believe it is. With I think it’s 9 of the 10 counts they’re activities that range between 15 seconds and a minute. With regard to the one particular boy where there was a longer term relationship yes that’s a little bit different but with 9 of the 10 those activities were somewhere less than a minute.

Q. You accept don’t you that what you did wasn’t just stupid it was grossly criminal?

A. Of course.”


	
	The offence taken into account in relation to count 7 involved an incident that occurred a short time after the respondent had been arrested and he gave the following evidence about it:
	


Q. You were arrested in relation to an incident in the June of last year?

A. Yep.

Q. And then there was a further incident that occurred which is one of the counts on the Form 1 whilst you were on bail?

A. Yes.

Q. Did the shock of being arrested in the middle of 2014 not bring you to your senses?

A. Let’s talk about what the incident was. It was a hand on a knee and an attempted kiss and I reckon that’s pretty thin for an indecent assault.

Q. Well in circumstances where you had previously been involved in more serious sexual activity you don’t consider that that was a sexually motivated act?

A. No it was not.

Q. But you have given evidence that you felt sexually attracted to children without this treatment?

A. (No verbal reply)

Q. Without this medical treatment - you said you had constant thoughts of sexual attraction to children?

A. Yep.

Q. Well you hadn’t had the treatment by then, by the time you committed that further offence on bail?

A. Yeah but I had a very very close relationship and I’m not talking sexual, I had a very very close relationship with these particular people you’re talking about and for me to put my hand on their knee or around their shoulder or whatever the case may be was literally a regular occurrence which was not considered by me or by them as a sexual event.

Q. What about kissing a young boy?

A. Well, it was an attempted kiss and it didn’t get there and it was - you know it was a bit of a fun joke thing at the time, what can I say.

Q. Is it the case that you received sexual gratification when you did these acts that you have pleaded guilty to?

A. Yep. (Emphasis added)


	
	He was pressed as to his denial of grooming behaviour. He denied that there were incentives for the victims to be at his house. He explained that he had a “very, very open house and a very, very sociable house” at which not only children but their parents and friends were welcome. He described himself as “an extremely hospitable person”. He was asked whether having things such as pay TV, a pool, and a spa were things that attracted children but he said he could not see the point and asked rhetorically, “What am I going to do, fill in the swimming pool?” He agreed, however, that he did not do anything to discourage children from coming to his home.
	
	
	In relation to victim 2 the respondent accepted that the events the subject of the persistent child sexual abuse charge spanned a four year period and covered a wide variety of activity up to and including intercourse. He maintained however that they were spur of the moment or spontaneous acts. He was pressed by reference to the trip to watch the rugby game in Canberra where he stayed overnight with victim 2 in a motel room. It was suggested that he would have had it in his mind that there would be sexual contact during that trip but he said, “Not necessarily, no”.
	
	
	Further on the question of remorse, there was the following evidence:
	


“Q. With your apology to the family, is that in relation to the breach of the trust or in relation to the harm that’s been carried out against these children?

A. Everything - as I think I said in my apology, I apologised to the victims themselves for any harm I may have caused them. The apology is for a lot of things. It’s for you know abusing the trust they gave me, it’s for destroying a fantastic - fantastic friendships and a fantastic lifestyle that we had … , so it’s an all-embracing apology.

Q. Do you see the breach was not just against the parents of the children, but the children themselves?

A. Of course.”

Report of Professor David Greenberg of 15 April 2015


	
	The sentence hearing was adjourned to Sydney on 20 April 2015. At that point the Crown tendered a report of Professor David Greenberg of 15 April 2015. Professor Greenberg is a forensic psychiatrist who described himself as an internationally recognised expert in the area of sex offenders and treatment of paraphiliac disorders. Professor Greenberg had not conducted an assessment of the respondent but had reviewed the documentary evidence including the reports of Drs Westmore, O’Dea and Rowe.
	
	
	Professor Greenberg, speaking generally, said that “sexual child predators often use grooming behaviours which are deliberate tactics such as befriending and establishing an emotional connection with a child to lower the child’s inhibitions and gain their trust in order to sexually abuse them”. He referred to references in the documentary material to the respondent having a home with a spa, swimming pool, a computer and computer games. He noted that access to these would have been attractive to young children. He also referred to the agreed fact that the children were provided with small gifts, lollies and soft drinks. He referred to the use of pornographic material in relation to some of the children. There was also the reference to victim 2 having been shown pornography and provided with alcohol on the trip to Canberra. Reference was also made to the outing to the Bega River to gather oysters and, in respect of victim 5, giving a 15 year old boy a driving lesson. Professor Greenberg continued:
	


“These related behaviours are in my view all common grooming activities used by paedophiles to entice children and to obtain their trust and compliance of these children with intended later sexual activity”.


	
	Professor Greenberg agreed with the diagnosis of Drs O’Dea and Westmore that the respondent likely had a Paedophiliac Disorder. He noted that Dr Rowe had referred throughout his report to the respondent having “paedophilic tendencies” but pointed out that the respondent met the DSM-IV criteria for having a Paedophiliac Disorder.
	
	
	Professor Greenberg also agreed that the respondent likely had a “Hebophilic Activity because of sexual activity also involved these children during their pubertal development [sic]"".
	
	
	Professor Greenberg was critical of Dr Rowe’s apparent acceptance of the respondent’s claim in relation to the offence in count 10 that he had a “brain snap”. He said that paedophiliac activity is associated with ""goal directed behaviour""; ""there is often planning and intentional behaviour to get access to children"".
	
	
	Reference was made to Dr Rowe’s diagnosis of the respondent having “high functioning Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder”. Professor Greenberg said that whilst the respondent may or may not have ADHD, persons with such a disorder do not sexually abuse children. He saw no causal relationship between the respondent having that condition and his sexual molestation of eight children over a decade. He noted that the respondent had tertiary qualifications and had worked at a high level in a business for many years and said, “It is therefore questionable how these deficits or weaknesses in executive functioning was of great significance in his decision making, reasoning, consequential thinking and careful judgment”.
	
	
	Professor Greenberg took issue with Dr Rowe’s diagnosis of the respondent having Hypersexual Disorder. He noted that it was not accepted in the DSM-V or any earlier versions as being a mental disorder. “The acceptance of such a condition as a disorder has not gained wider acceptance in the general clinical sex offender expert community as yet and its validity has been questioned by some researchers”.
	
	
	Reference was made to the differing accounts given by the respondent to Drs Westmore, O’Dea and Rowe about his sexual experience with his wife. It was Professor Greenberg’s opinion that, “not having a sexual outlet with his wife is not a causative factor for paedophiliac behaviour and lack of sexual outlet cannot be used to justify his paedophilic behaviour”. Professor Greenberg noted that “individuals with a Paedophiliac Disorder often deny, minimise and justify their behaviour”.
	
	
	He also disagreed with Dr Rowe’s assessment that if recommendations for treatment were implemented, the likelihood of the respondent having a relapse or re-offending would become increasingly “negligible”.
	
	
	Professor Greenberg concluded his review of Dr Rowe’s report as follows:
	


“I therefore cannot concur with Dr Rowe’s opinion that the respondent’s absence of sexual relations with his wife, reduced access to more legitimate avenues of sexual relief and his semi-retirement as well as his “hypersexual disorder” and his high functioning Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder significantly contributed to him committing his sexual offences. Although Dr Rowe’s theoretical model of the respondent’s sexual offending against eight children, may or may not be true, this view would not be the accepted view of most experts working with paedophiles.”


	
	Professor Greenberg agreed with Drs Westmore, O’Dea and Rowe that with psychosexual treatment combined with anti-libidinal treatment the respondent’s risk of re-offending may possibly or likely be reduced. He added, “Although less likely, it may over time not be reduced because there is no cure for this disorder”.
	
	
	Generally on the subject of anti-libidinal treatment, Professor Greenberg said that many sex offenders who voluntarily undertake such treatment use it until such time as their parole expires. The treatment is voluntary and is often ceased at that point. Such treatments cannot be enforced on any individual. Moreover, individuals may also develop medical complications and may have to cease treatment as a result.
	


Oral evidence of Professor Greenberg


	
	Professor Greenberg was called to give evidence. He maintained his view that if the respondent did suffer from ADHD it did not have any significant role to play in the causation of his paedophilia activity. He was informed that the respondent had described his offending behaviour as “minutes of madness” (in fact “a few minutes of stupidity”). He gave this evidence:
	


“Q. Is describing the sexual activity that he’s pleaded to as “minutes of madness”, in your view, symptomatic of people with this disorder they try to minimise?

A. Yes, they often justify, minimise, deny, rationalise their behaviour.”


	
	In cross-examination Professor Greenberg was tested as to his inability to see the link between ADHD and the offending. His response was to the effect that it was necessary to distinguish between impulsive behaviour generally and sexual impulsivity.
	
	
	The sentencing judge took up the questioning on this subject and Professor Greenberg explained that if there was impulsivity in terms of a lack of control by somebody with ADHD ""it would apply to all actions, it wouldn't be specifically only with sexual behaviour with children"".
	
	
	In relation to Dr Rowe’s diagnosis of Hypersexuality Disorder, Professor Greenberg expressed the need for caution in that it was based on self-report by a person facing legal sanction.
	
	
	Lastly Professor Greenberg was asked about “grooming behaviours” used by child sexual predators and referred to the opinion expressed in his report that the facts of the respondent’s offences included a description of activities consistent with grooming. He maintained that they were consistent, “in the context of having eight children who were reportedly sexually abused”. He agreed that this could have been conduct carried out with an intention or a plan to create opportunities for sexual activity but he agreed that this was not necessarily the case.
	


“Q. In order - and I’m focusing on the latter, you accept that it’s while the conduct was consistent with ‘intentional grooming’ if I might use that phrase it was not necessarily a situation of intentional grooming?

A. It may not be, yes that is correct, I mean people with paedophilia don’t walk down the street and sexually abuse every child they see.”


	
	In re-examination Professor Greenberg was asked again about the respondent having ADHD:
	


“Q. Just assuming for a moment that Mr Vanryn has been a successful businessman over some decades?

A. Right.

Q. Is that a factor, if you accept that to be the case for argument sake, is that a factor you would take into account in determining whether he has deficits in executive functioning?

A. Yes, the issue of so called high functioning, it’s a question, it’s a spectrum, so he has lesser symptoms than a person with full-blown ADHD who has a diagnosis consistent with DSM-5. So the effect of having a much lesser or milder form of ADHD, how that would impact on all areas, it wouldn’t be specifically to one area, one would expect it to be, impact on all areas of functioning where he had deficits.”

Oral evidence of Dr Rowe


	
	Dr Rowe was also called to give evidence. He said in chief that he had recently conducted a Static Test (“2002 R”). The result was that the respondent was assessed as posing a “low to moderate” risk of re-offending. In cross-examination he said he had not previously conducted that particular test because he had not been aware of such tests.
	
	
	Dr Rowe disagreed with Professor Greenberg on the ADHD issue. It was his view that “ADHD doesn’t generalise across all behaviours and activities”.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	A number of victim impact statements were tendered and they indicated a range of emotional and psychological harm that the offences had caused. Perhaps unsurprisingly, victims spoke of feeling anger, betrayal, mistrusting others, personal guilt, and concerns about personal relationships. Two of the victims (Victim 1 and Victim 2) also spoke of having engaged in self-harming behaviours as part of their reaction to what occurred to them.
	


The sentencing judgment


	
	In view of the widespread attack made by the Crown in relation to the sentencing judgment it is appropriate to summarise it in some detail. It comprised the following components:
	


A verbatim recitation of the terms of each count in the two indictments. (ROS 1-4)

Reference to the Form 1 offences. (ROS 4-5)

Reference to the applicable maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods for the offences. (ROS 5-6)

A verbatim recitation of the purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. (ROS 6)

Quotation from R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68 (""the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex""; ""erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of a particular factual circumstance""; etcetera).

Quotation from R v Lattouf (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 12 December 1996, unrep) (a paramount objective of sentencing is ""the achievement of justice in the individual case"").

Citation of five cases in which ""those observations have been endorsed"".

A statement of reasons for reducing sentences by 25 per cent for the utilitarian benefit flowing from the pleas of guilty. (ROS 7-8)

Reference to the sentence being backdated to 10 December 2014; the date the respondent was refused bail. (ROS 8)

Recitation of the facts for each offence. (ROS 8-18)

A reference to the need for ""grooming"", as contended by the Crown, to be proved beyond reasonable doubt: The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27]. (ROS 18)

A reminder of the need to sentence only in relation to the offences charged and not for uncharged offences; although permissible to have regard to offences charged not being isolated incidents. Quotations in this regard from R v Bamford (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 23 July 1991, unrep), R v Dousha [2008] NSWCCA 263 at [27]; and R v Kozakiewicz (Court of Criminal Appeal, 11 June 1991, unrep). (ROS 19)

Quotation of cases in relation to the seriousness of sexual assaults upon children:

The victim impact statements are taken into account by recognising the harm done to the victims and the community pursuant to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. (ROS 25)

A breach of trust, in that the majority of the offences occurred when the victims were guests in the respondent's home, is an aggravating factor. (ROS 25-26)

Rejection of a Crown submission that it was an aggravating factor that the offence taken into account in relation to count 7 was committed whilst the respondent was on bail. (ROS 26)

Summary of some aspects of the respondent's personal circumstances including his tertiary education and ""extremely good work history"". (ROS 26)

Summary of the circumstances of the 1981 offence of indecent exposure; holding that this disentitled him to be considered as a first offender ""to a very minor extent"". (ROS 27)

Good character, although given significantly less weight than in sentencing for other offences, was still necessary to be taken into account. (ROS 27-28)

Contrition was evident from the respondent's early admission of wrongdoing, immediate recourse to psychiatric treatment and taking steps to address offending by involvement in anti-libidinal treatment. It was also evident from his wife's statement and the report of Dr O'Dea. The judge rejected the Crown's submission that contrition was not evident from the respondent's oral evidence. The respondent ""has shown deep contrition"". (ROS 28-29)

""On limited occasions, sporadically, the offender offended in relation to a number of the children"". The judge was unable to say that the respondent's denial of ""grooming"" was untruthful. He was also not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that grooming was involved and that sexual activity with Victim 2 was intended in relation to the trip to Canberra. (ROS 29-30)

The judge considered it important to take into account that the respondent was previously unaware of the availability of anti-libidinal treatment. (ROS 29)

Discussion of the diagnoses of the psychiatrists with quotations from their reports. (ROS 31-33)

Quotations from the respondent's evidence about his good progress in relation to anti-libidinal medication. The respondent has ""reasonable prospects of not offending whilst ever he is on that treatment"". (ROS 34-35)

Reference to the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 243 FLR 28 at [177]-[178] for principles relating to sentencing an offender with a mental health condition. (ROS 35-36)

Discussion of the diagnosis of Dr Rowe, in particular of the respondent having ADHD. Dr Rowe had the advantage of examining the respondent, conducting tests and reviewing school and other reports. Professor Greenberg did not have such advantage. The judge was satisfied that the respondent suffered from ADHD and said he would take it into account as well as what Dr Rowe said about it impacting upon the respondent's inhibitions. (ROS 36-37)

In accordance with Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 there was a need to structure sentences so as to reflect the totality of criminality. (ROS 37)

There was also a need to take into account that a number of the offences under s 61M(1) and s 61M(2) could have been disposed of in the Local Court. (ROS 37-38)

Reference to statements of principle about concurrency and accumulation of sentences for sexual assault offences committed against multiple victims: R v Wicks [2005] NSWCCA 409 at [49] and R v Katon [2008] NSWCCA 228 at [41] were cited. (ROS 38)

Extra curial punishment as described in the respondent's wife's statement and in his oral evidence should be taken into account. Mokhaiber v R [2011] NSWCCA 10 at [31] and R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 were cited. (ROS 38-39; 40-41)

Reference was made to R v Clinton [2009] NSWCCA 276 at [24] and JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [71] on the subject of protective custody. A submission that protective custody and prison overcrowding should be taken into account was rejected. (ROS 39-40)

Special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were found on the bases that the respondent had not previously served a term of imprisonment; he would need a longer period of support in relation to his mental problems when he re-enters the community; and that it was in the interests of the community that he have a long period of parole because of the likelihood of treatment being successful. The judge ""referred"" to R v Carter [2003] NSWCCA 243; R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40; Sayed v The Queen [2012] WASC 17; and R v Moore [2015] SASCA 9 (without saying what he derived from any of them). (ROS 41).

The judge concluded by announcing the indicative sentences for each offence and then the aggregate sentence.


	
	A prominent feature of the sentencing judgment is the fact that it comprises many statements of general principles but very little reasoning is exposed. It is one thing to state a principle; more important is some explanation of how it is being applied. This will be a recurring theme when I come to deal with the specific errors for which the Crown contends.
	


Principles applicable to a Crown appeal against sentence


	
	In R v JP [2015] NSWCCA 267, Hoeben CJ at CL conveniently provided the following statement of principles applicable to a Crown appeal against sentence brought pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act:
	


“[43] A claim of manifest inadequacy requires the party advancing that complaint to establish that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust. In a sentencing environment where there is no single “correct” sentence, judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach (R v Dinsdale [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325; Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]); Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58]).

[44] The High Court has stated on a number of occasions that the primary purpose of a Crown appeal against sentence is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons and that the court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 retains a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1]”.


	
	It should also be noted that in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [69] the plurality also stated that epithets such as ""gross"" or ""an affront to the administration of justice"" are ""indicative of a qualitative judgment that the inadequacy of the sentences imposed is so marked that the need for its correction to maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system outweighs other considerations, including any resulting disparity with unchallenged sentences against a co-offender"".
	
	
	Even if appellable error is established, it remains for the appellant to persuade the Court to vary the sentence imposed by the court of trial: CMB v Attorney General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9; 317 ALR 308 at [6] (French CJ and Gageler J); [56]-[66] (Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ).
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The Crown raised the following grounds of appeal:
	


1   The sentencing judge erred in failing to assess the objective seriousness of the offences.

2   The sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate.

Ground 1 – failure to assess objective seriousness

Submissions


	
	As can be seen from the summary of the sentencing judgment set out above, nowhere was any indication given by the judge as to the view he formed as to the seriousness of the offences.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted that making an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences is such a basic aspect of the sentencing task that it is ""implausible that this experienced sentencing judge failed to perform"" it. The task was likened to processes such as engaging in an intuitive synthesis of all relevant facts; something judges do all the time without being expected to state that they have adhered to the requirement. The problem with this argument is that making and stating an assessment of objective seriousness is not a process; it is an essential task required by authority.
	
	
	Authorities were cited for the proposition that post-Muldrock (Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120) a judge is not required to specify where on a scale of objective seriousness an offence falls: Badans v R [2012] NSWCCA 97 at [55] (in relation to offences carrying a standard non-parole period) and Belghar v R [2013] NSWCCA 245 at [58]-[60]. However, the Crown's complaint is not that the judge failed to specify objective seriousness on a scale; it is that he failed to make, or state, any assessment at all.
	
	
	The written submissions set out a list of ""numerous indications"" in the sentencing judgment that the judge did make an assessment of objective seriousness. The majority of the items listed are simply references to statements made by the judge of general propositions. The judge only stated two findings he had made concerning the seriousness of the offences: rejection of the Crown’s contention that there had been “grooming” and acceptance that the offences were aggravated by there having been a breach of trust.
	
	
	In oral submissions, Mr Odgers SC contended that the judge was not required to resolve disputes between the parties as to the level of objective seriousness of the offences; an assessment could be made as to what he thought about their seriousness by looking at the sentences imposed. However, it was also accepted that the judgment ""wasn't as transparent as it should have been and the reasons are not as well articulated as they should have been"". Nevertheless, the primary submission was that the ultimate issue was whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate and that any inadequacy of reasons was not determinative.
	


Conclusion


	
	In the summary of the sentencing judgment set out above it is clear that apart from reciting the facts of the offences the judge made no assessment of their objective seriousness or, if he did, he said nothing about it. Latham J observed in R v Cage [2006] NSWCCA 304 at [17] that:
	


""A bare recitation of the facts constituting the offences and a reference to the 'objective features of the offences' does not satisfy the requirements of sentencing.""


	
	In R v Campbell [2014] NSWCCA 102 at [27] Simpson J (as her Honour then was) (with whom Hall J agreed) stated:
	


“In my opinion, the assessment of objective seriousness is, and has always been, a critical component of the sentencing process: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357; Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; 209 A Crim R 509 at [71]-[72]. These cases were all decided before judgment was given in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 240 CLR 120. There is nothing in that judgment that cuts across the principle stated. Muldrock exposed error in this Court in over emphasising the assessment of objective gravity in offences to which Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act applies, of notional offences in the mid-range of objective seriousness. It does not preclude proper attention being paid to the objective seriousness of the particular offence under consideration: see, for example, R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 per Basten JA.”


	
	One reason that it is important for there to be some assessment of the seriousness of an offence is because one of the purposes of sentencing is to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence: s 3A(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Another reason is the requirement that a sentence should not exceed, or be less than, what is proportionate to the gravity of the crime: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at 572 [15] (Spigelman CJ). Further, it enables use of the legislative guideposts of the maximum penalty and any prescribed standard non-parole period: R v West [2014] NSWCCA 250 at [27] (Adamson J).
	
	
	In Delaney v R; R v Delaney [2013] NSWCCA 150 the Crown raised a ground asserting that the sentencing judge had failed to determine the objective criminality of the offences. Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) responded (at [56]):
	


“While it is true that his Honour did not in terms assess the objective gravity of the offending, he did specifically refer to the factors which bore upon its objective seriousness. His Honour took account of the amount involved, the role of the appellant, the nature of the conduct and the period over which it took place. While it may have been preferable for his Honour to have made a specific assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, he did implicitly do so. I am satisfied that the factors to which his Honour referred were relevant and important and were given proper weight in the sentencing process. While his Honour may not have expressly determined the objective criminality of the offences, he clearly took that into account.”


	
	That is not this case. Jeffreys DCJ simply recited the facts by reference to the statement of agreed facts. There were lengthy references to, and quotations from, various authorities on the seriousness of sexual assault offences committed against children. It is one thing to refer to the general proposition that child sexual assault is a serious crime; it is another to identify the relative seriousness of the case at hand.
	
	
	Both parties made submissions to the judge about the objective seriousness of the individual offences. For example, in written submissions, counsel for the respondent urged a finding that most of the offences were serious but below the middle of the range. A concession was made that the offence against s 66EA of persistent child abuse was above the mid-range but the judge was urged to find that it was not at or near the top of the range. In the main, the Crown's submissions were that the offences were at or above mid-range, although it was conceded that the offence in count 9 was below that level. The judge did not engage with these submissions at all.
	
	
	The only way of discerning what his Honour thought of the objective seriousness of the individual offences is by drawing an inference from the indicative sentences he specified. For example, he clearly regarded the aggravated indecent assault offences in count 7 of the first indictment (indicative sentence 3 years) and count 2 in the second indictment (indicative sentence 2 years 6 months) as more serious than all of the other aggravated indecent assault offences (indicative sentences of 12 months). But this is as far as one can go in inferring what his Honour thought about the objective seriousness of offences.
	
	
	By drawing inferences from the indicative sentences the most that can be said is that his Honour engaged in no more than a broad brush fashion with the assessment of the seriousness of the offences. For example, 12 months was considered an appropriate sentence for seven of the nine offences against s 61M(2) regardless of the age of the victim (""the younger the victim the more serious the offence"" (RJA v R [2008] NSWCCA 137; 185 A Crim R 178 at [13] (Spigelman CJ))) and despite a concession by the Crown that the offence in count 9 was less serious than the other offences against this provision.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the sentencing process miscarried, either by the judge failing to make any assessment of the seriousness of the offences or, if he did, failing to say anything about his reasoning and conclusions as a result of such assessment.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it remains for this Court to make some assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences in the course of determining the issue posed by the second ground as to whether the aggregate sentence is manifestly inadequate.
	


Ground 2 – manifest inadequacy


	
	In addition to the error asserted under the previous ground, the Crown contended that there were further specific errors that led to the imposition of a manifestly inadequate sentence.
	


Error 1 – finding that the respondent did not engage in grooming behaviours


	
	Professor Greenberg observed that child sexual predators often use grooming behaviours by which he meant ""deliberate tactics such as befriending and establishing an emotional connection with a child to lower the child's inhibitions and gain their trust in order to sexually abuse them. They obtain access to children by creating opportunity to interact with children. They may rely on psychological manipulation and desensitization methods with these children to obtain eventual compliance with their sexual acts. They may also try to make them feel special by giving these children attention, gifts, or special treats"".
	
	
	Professor Greenberg referred to some of the respondent's conduct as set out in the agreed facts and described it as ""common grooming activities used by paedophiles"".
	
	
	Dr Westmore referred to the statement of facts and said: ""I note behaviour consistent with grooming"".
	
	
	Dr O'Dea also described ""apparent grooming behaviours"" set out in the statement of facts. It should be recalled that Dr O'Dea had seven consultations with the respondent before writing his report. It may be assumed that the claim by the respondent in his evidence that he did not engage in grooming was not conveyed to Dr O'Dea.
	
	
	Despite this expert evidence, Jeffreys DCJ was not satisfied that the respondent was being untruthful in his evidence denying grooming any of the victims. This is a surprising finding, particularly in relation to Victim 2 (count 2) and Victim 9 (counts 1 to 4 in the second indictment).
	
	
	In the course of discussing this issue in his sentencing remarks, the judge said some remarkable things. In the context of referring to the frequency with which there would be visitors including children at the respondent's home he said:
	


""On limited occasions, sporadically, the offender offended in relation to a number of the children.""


	
	There were 17 offences that the respondent had pleaded guilty to or had asked the judge to take into account. They occurred from the beginning of 2003 to mid-2014. The agreed facts also referred to numerous other occasions of offending by way of masturbation, fellatio and anal intercourse in relation to Victim 2 and Victim 9. To describe the offending as occurring ""sporadically"" is a serious understatement.
	
	
	The judge rejected the Crown's contention that grooming was evident on the occasion the respondent took Victim 2 (when he was 14 years' old) to see a rugby game in Canberra with tickets to a corporate box, an overnight stay in a motel room, alcohol being provided and pornography being displayed on his laptop computer. The judge said that grooming was not the only available inference and so he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent ""intended when he got the complainant there to participate in sexual activity"". He did not say what alternative inference there was.
	
	
	The Crown contended that the judge was in error in ignoring the preponderance of the evidence and giving unwarranted weight to the opinion of the respondent that he did not groom his victims. By doing so he failed to take into account a matter that seriously exacerbated the criminality of the offending.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent pointed out that whilst the judge was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was grooming, equally he did not make a finding in the respondent's favour that there was not grooming. It was also submitted that for the Crown to succeed in relation to this asserted error it was necessary for it to persuade the Court that the judge's failure to be satisfied of an aggravating circumstance beyond reasonable doubt was ""not reasonably open"". Where the psychiatric evidence was couched in terms of behaviour ""consistent"" with grooming and ""apparent"" grooming behaviour, it was submitted that the judge's finding was reasonably open.
	
	
	In my view, the submissions of counsel for the respondent should be accepted; but that is not the end of the issue. Some of the things the judge said in this context are concerning. More significant, however, is that his Honour did not engage with the undisputed evidence which gave rise to the Crown's contention. These are matters that are relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences; something with which this Court will need to engage with in the absence of the sentencing judge having done so.
	


Error 2 – finding ""deep contrition""


	
	The sentencing judge referred to various aspects of the evidence from which he concluded that ""the offender has shown deep contrition"" (ROS 29.3).
	
	
	The Crown referred to s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provides that remorse is a mitigating factor if the offender has provided evidence of acceptance of responsibility for his or her actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused (or made reparation).
	
	
	It will be evident from the earlier summary of the respondent's evidence that he was not completely forthcoming with an acknowledgement of the harm his offences occasioned his victims. He used terms such as ""potential risk of harm""; ""I might have hurt""; and ""harm I may have caused"". The strident response he gave when cross-examined about the indecent assault of Victim 5 during a driving lesson (“I reckon that’s pretty thin for an indecent assault”) was hardly indicative of ""deep contrition"". Further, he sought to downplay the seriousness of many of the offences by his description of them being ""a few minutes of stupidity"". At the hearing of the appeal, Mr Odgers conceded that ""it's pretty clear from [the respondent's] evidence that he did have tendencies to somewhat underplay the seriousness of the offending"".
	
	
	Despite the above, the judge was uncritical of any of the respondent's evidence. To the limited extent that he referred to it, he accepted it.
	
	
	Aside from the respondent's evidence, his Honour also took into account that he had acknowledged his guilt from a very early time and had promptly sought out psychiatric treatment. There were also the various expressions of his remorse set out in the medical reports and his wife's statement.
	
	
	Despite the respondent's earlier reticence to fully acknowledge the harm he had caused his victims, towards the end of his evidence he said that he understood the long term consequences of such offences. It was open to the judge to accept that on the balance of probabilities this made good the second limb of the mitigating factor in s 21A(3)(i).
	
	
	Using the expression ""deep contrition"" is rather extravagant in the light of some of the evidence given by the respondent. But I cannot conclude that a finding of remorse was not open to the judge to make, particularly in light of the fact of the early pleas of guilty.
	


Error 3 – the approach to the finding of ADHD


	
	Dr Rowe assessed the respondent as having ""high functioning ADHD"" as well as a Hypersexual Disorder. He said that patients with ADHD do not necessarily commit criminal acts, ""but in the presence of other factors such as hypersexuality and certain environmental factors the individual may not be able to sufficiently inhibit their strong sexual impulses or other impulsive behaviours"".
	
	
	Neither Dr Westmore nor Dr O'Dea made these diagnoses or were asked to comment upon Dr Rowe's opinion about causality.
	
	
	Professor Greenberg did not dispute the diagnosis of ADHD but disagreed that there was a causal connection with the respondent's sexual offending. He said in his report, ""there is no causal relationship between having 'high functioning ADHD' (or ADHD for that matter), and sexual molestation incidents with eight children over a period of a decade"". He noted Dr Rowe's assessment of the respondent having a ""high average to superior level of intelligence""; his tertiary qualifications; and his management of a large public company. He said, ""It is therefore questionable how these deficits or weaknesses in executive functioning was of great significance in his decision making, reasoning, consequential thinking and careful judgment"". Further, he said ""To date there is no credible literature to support a significant causality between 'high functioning ADHD' and paedophilic re-offending (sexual recidivism)"".
	
	
	In his oral evidence, Professor Greenberg referred to the absence of any suggestion of impulsivity in the respondent's life aside from his offending. He said that a person with ADHD would be impulsive in all activities, including, for example, their work.
	
	
	The sentencing judge referred to the conflict between Dr Rowe and Professor Greenberg on this issue and accepted the opinion of Dr Rowe on the basis that he had the advantage of having assessed the respondent, seen school reports and administered tests.
	
	
	It would seem that the judge found that there was a causal connection between the condition of ADHD and the offending behaviour:
	


""I am able to accept on balance that the offender was also suffering from ADHD at the time and I need then to take into account the fact of what Dr Rowe says about that impacting on the offender's inhibitions.""


	
	The Crown submitted that Dr Rowe entered the field of psychiatry in expressing any opinion about a link between the offending and the respondent having ""high functioning ADHD"". In WW v R [2012] NSWCCA 165, which was concerned with sentencing for driving in a manner dangerous causing death, a psychologist ventured the opinion that the offender's ADHD ""affected him to some degree at the time of the offence, particularly around the area of inattention on the road"". Hoeben JA said:
	


""[60] It was open to Mr Mahoney [the psychologist] to test the applicant for indications that at the time of testing he was suffering from ADHD. He could describe the characteristics of the condition of ADHD. What he could not do as a psychologist was to express an opinion as to whether and to what extent the ADHD condition affected the applicant at the time of the offence. Counsel for the applicant, in the sentencing proceedings, could make a submission to his Honour linking the test results and the characteristics which can be experienced by somebody with ADHD. His Honour could accept that submission but was not obliged to do so.""


	
	The Crown submitted that another way in which Dr Rowe went beyond his expertise was to express opinions about the efficacy and suitability of various medications which he was not qualified to prescribe and of which he had no personal experience.
	
	
	There is force in these submissions by the Crown but it needs to be recognised that Dr Rowe's report was placed before the sentencing judge without any objection. Further, the prosecutor who appeared in the District Court did not ask the judge to completely reject Dr Rowe's opinions about the significance of ADHD; he simply submitted that it would not have ""any great significance in this particular case"". Counsel for the respondent in this Court submitted that this was an acceptance that it could be given some weight and the judge did not indicate that he gave it any more than ""some weight"".
	
	
	If the opinion of Dr Rowe about a causative link between the respondent's hypersexuality, ADHD and his offending behaviour had not been before the court, it still would have been open to the respondent's counsel to have adduced evidence of his client having those two conditions and, in conformity with WW v R, to have submitted that the judge should accept that there was such a link.
	
	
	The Crown made other criticisms of Dr Rowe's opinions. It is unnecessary to refer to them all but it is worth mentioning the submission that Dr Rowe's diagnosis of Hypersexual Disorder was not made by the psychiatrists. That may be because it is not a condition listed in DSM-V. Professor Greenberg explained that hypersexuality as a disorder ""has not gained wider acceptance in the general clinical sex offender expert community as yet and its validity has been questioned by some researchers"". However, he added:
	


""It is generally held true that individuals with a higher sex drive would have more difficulty controlling paedophiliac urges and paedophiliac behaviour"".


	
	Dr Rowe's ""diagnosis"" of ""Hypersexuality Disorder"" was based upon a history provided by the respondent and he was not challenged on that history in cross-examination by the prosecutor. It follows that whether or not there is a recognised ""disorder"" of hypersexuality, it was open to be accepted that the respondent had a higher sex drive which could mean he had more difficulty controlling his paedophiliac urges.
	


Conclusion


	
	The judge's acceptance that the respondent had a condition of ADHD which had an impact upon his inhibitions may well be a finding that others would not have made. But again, the limits on appellate review of fact finding leave me to conclude that it was one that was open to the judge to make.
	
	
	What the judge did with the finding remains unknown. He said no more about it. He had earlier referred to the various ways in which a mental condition may be relevant to sentence (by his reference to Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa) but that simply involved statements of sentencing principles with no attempt made to say whether, and if so how, they were applied to the case at hand.
	
	
	The problem, as I see it, is that the judge gave no apparent consideration to how any impulsivity of the respondent arising from a condition of ADHD might have had any bearing upon the individual offences. Some of the offences, for example indecently assaulting children in the pool or the spa, were of short duration and might well have resulted from impulse. There would be considerable difficulty in describing others as the product of impulse, such as those which involved the respondent finding a child alone in a room of his house, and more so those that occurred in the context of the long term sexual abuse of Victims 2 and 9.
	
	
	In the end, I do not think that resolution of this assertion of error is necessary. The error is said to be in making a finding; but the significance of the finding upon the assessment of sentence is impossible to discern because of the lack of reasoning disclosed by the sentencing judge.
	


Error 4 – error in approach to the respondent's paedophilia and questions of general deterrence and personal deterrence


	
	The Crown contended that there was error in the judge's failure to find that general and personal deterrence were important considerations on sentence and that this led to (or contributed to) the imposition of a manifestly inadequate sentence.
	
	
	The Crown referred to EG v R [2015] NSWCCA 21 at [42] where Hoeben CJ at CL said:
	


""General deterrence, denunciation and the protection of the community are principles of sentencing which are relevant to cases involving child sexual abuse. The concern of the courts is to send a message to those who would sexually abuse children intentionally and repeatedly that their actions will not be tolerated and that they will receive significant punishment.""


	
	Where an offender suffers from some mental condition it may be relevant to sentencing in the variety of ways described by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa at [177]. One result might be that less weight is given to the need for general and personal deterrence and denunciation.
	
	
	The judge made reference to general principles but said nothing to indicate whether, and if so to what extent, he was factoring into the assessment of sentence any need for general or personal deterrence.
	
	
	The Crown referred to Benitez v R [2006] NSWCCA 21; 160 A Crim R 166 at 175 and R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 51 where it was said that when an offender with some form of mental condition acts with knowledge of what they are doing and of the gravity of their actions, any moderation of general deterrence need not be great. This was a matter of some significance in the Crown's submission. Whatever be the mental condition of the respondent, he was an intelligent man who made the following concessions to the questioning of his counsel:
	


""Q. You were aware that what you were doing was wrong?

A. Yes.

Q. You knew it was against the law?

A. Yes.""


	
	The respondent's primary mental condition was one of paedophilia. It did not involve any cognitive impairment. His offences involved conscious and deliberate actions accompanied by knowledge that it was both wrong and illegal. For these reasons it was submitted that the respondent remained an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence, denunciation and personal deterrence.
	
	
	The written submissions for the respondent referred to the acceptance in the court below that general and personal deterrence had a role to play; the submission was simply that less weight might be given to them. It was open to the judge to accept that submission.
	
	
	It was also submitted for the respondent that there was no fixed or predetermined degree to which general deterrence should be taken into account in sentencing: R v Lattouf; R v MF [2015] NSWCCA 283 at [56]; Muldrock v The Queen at [20]; and Veen v The Queen [No 2] [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 476.
	
	
	The submissions of both parties convey a debate in a vacuum. It is all very well to argue about how deterrence and denunciation might have been taken into account. But it is impossible to know whether, and if so how, the sentencing judge dealt with these issues. He certainly referred to general principles but said nothing about how he applied them.
	
	
	Given the importance of deterrence in cases involving the sexual assault of children, particularly of general deterrence, this, like the failure to make (or state) any assessment of objective seriousness, represented another way in which the sentencing process miscarried. There was, to use the words of Johnson J in R v Porte [2015] NSWCCA 174 at [88], ""a clear and fundamental failure to explain how the sentence to be imposed had been arrived at"".
	


Error 5 – the approach to the respondent's prospects of rehabilitation and failure to consider the risk to the community


	
	The sentencing judge found that ""the offender has been progressing extremely well in relation to anti-libidinal treatment and it is my view that he has reasonable prospects of not offending whilst ever he is on that treatment"".
	
	
	I do not believe there is any error in this finding. It was appropriately qualified by the concluding seven words. It cannot be said that it was not a finding that was open to be made. Importantly, it was not a finding that there were ""good"" prospects of rehabilitation so as to amount to a mitigating factor pursuant to s 21A(3)(h) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	The judge did not expressly refer to any finding on the subject of the protection of the community. At an early stage of his judgment he quoted s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which includes as one of the purposes of sentencing: ""to protect the community from the offender"". Later he quoted from [177] in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa as follows:
	


""Mr Justice McClellan, CJ at CL, said at para 177:

'Where an offender is suffering from mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing.'

His Honour referred to a number of cases. His Honour then continued,

'They can be summarised in the following manner:

• When the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in sentence.'

His Honour referred to a number of cases:

• 'It may also have the consequence that the offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed.'

His Honour referred to a number of cases:

• 'It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person because the sentence would be more onerous for that person, the length of the prison term or conditions under which it is served may be reduced.'

His Honour referred to a number of cases:

• 'It may reduce or eliminate the significance of deterrence.'

His Honour referred to a number of cases. Then his Honour in the next dot point said 'Conversely'. In my view I am not satisfied that on balance I ought to take that particular dot point into account.""


	
	The ""dot point"" the judge declined to take into account was as follows:
	


""● Conversely, it may be that because of a person’s mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23] - [24].""


	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted that by not being satisfied that he should take that ""dot point"" into account, the judge was not saying that he did not take protection of the community into account at all. It rather suggested that he was not satisfied that the respondent was a high danger to the community or that there was ""a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public"".
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the way the judge put aside the final ""dot point"" indicated that the judge did not consider there was a need to take protection of the community into account.
	
	
	The submissions for the respondent should be preferred. The final dot point in paragraph [177] of the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL simply indicates that in the circumstances referred to there may be a need to give additional weight to specific deterrence and the protection of the community. I do not take his Honour to be suggesting that where those circumstances do not arise there is no need to give any weight to either of those purposes of sentencing.
	
	
	However, nowhere in the judge's reasons is there any indication that he regarded personal deterrence and community protection as being of any importance.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that where the cause of the respondent's offending was an incurable sexual orientation (Paedophilic Disorder) and where prospects of reoffending are entirely dependent on the voluntary acceptance of drug treatment, it will always be necessary to consider the need for protection of the community and to balance that consideration against the prospect of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Even though early signs might be seen as encouraging, the evidence of Drs Westmore and O’Dea was to the effect that it was too early to make any definitive finding about the respondent's risk of reoffending. The respondent's stated intention was that he would continue taking anti-libidinal medication for the long term. However, there could be no guarantee of this. The taking of such medication may be precluded by side effects; it cannot be enforced; and Professor Greenberg spoke of his experience of many sex offenders ceasing treatment at the end of their parole period.
	
	
	Once again, the error in relation to these topics of personal deterrence and community protection is not so much a matter of positively not taking them into account but the lack of any indication that they were.
	


Error 6 – error in the approach to special circumstances and the setting of an erroneously lenient non-parole period


	
	The non-parole period specified by the judge constitutes 53 per cent, or 7 years of the 13 year aggregate term. If the judge had not made a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the non-parole period would have been one of 9 years 9 months.
	
	
	One of the reasons for finding special circumstances was that the respondent had not previously been imprisoned. The Crown noted that this has been doubted as a sound basis for making such a finding: Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49 at [12]; Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [36]. However, this was not the only basis for the finding. It would seem that the more significant basis was the need for the respondent to have a longer period under parole supervision in the community to ensure compliance with his treatment needs: ""a longer period of support in relation to his mental problems when he re-enters the community"". His Honour also said:
	


""The fact that the offender has been progressing well in relation to anti-libidinal treatment, it is my view, in the interests of the community that he be on a long period of parole because I am satisfied that it is likely that the treatment will be successful.""


	
	It is notable that the judge did not indicate why a potential parole period as long as six years was thought necessary to serve these purposes for reducing the non-parole component of the sentence.
	
	
	The Crown argued that there was error in both the finding of special circumstances as well as the extent by which the non-parole period was reduced.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was no evidence that a parole period in the usual statutory proportions (in this case 3 years 3 months) would be inadequate to assist the respondent's rehabilitation.
	
	
	The Crown's primary submission, however, was that a non-parole period of 7 years ""could not possibly reflect the profound criminality involved in the respondent's conduct"". Reference was made to various authorities, including the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [65] where his Honour spoke of the need for a non-parole period to reflect ""all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender – including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence"".
	
	
	In Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 I summarised the relevant principles:
	


[27] The non-parole period is the minimum period of actual incarceration that the offender must spend in custody having regard to all the elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of the offence and the offender's subjective circumstances: Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 at 627-629; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [59]; R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [34].

[28] A finding of special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact in respect of which this Court will be slow to intervene: Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83].

[29] ""As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive"": R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [19]; R v Cramp at [36].

[30] Simply because there are circumstances which are capable of constituting special circumstances, the court is not required to make such a finding and reduce the non-parole period: R v Fidow , above, at [22].

[31] The degree or extent of any adjustment of the ""statutory ratio"" is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge: R v Cramp, above, at [31]; Trad v R [2009] NSWCCA 56 at [33].


	
	Counsel for the respondent pointed out that the Crown Prosecutor had not opposed a finding of special circumstances, saying ""It's the first time that Mr Van Ryn has been in custody"". The prosecutor's opposition was confined to an argument that the non-parole period should not be reduced to 50 per cent of the overall term as had been submitted on the respondent's behalf.
	
	
	Having regard to the position adopted by the Crown below, I would reject its contention here that there was error in making a finding of special circumstances. Whether this Court would make such a finding is another matter. And the question whether a 7 year non-parole period is manifestly inadequate will be considered below.
	


Error 7 – error in the approach to the Form 1 offence committed on bail


	
	This error is said to have affected the manner in which the judge took into account the Form 1 offence when assessing the sentence for count 7.
	
	
	When a sentencing court is asked to take an offender’s guilt in respect of one or more other offences into account, the task is still confined to imposing sentence for the primary offence. However, in doing so it may increase the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate by giving greater weight to the need for personal deterrence which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate is called for and to retribution because of the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed: Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42] (Spigelman CJ). See also Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115; 231 A Crim R 413.
	
	
	The additional offence taken into account in relation to count 7 was committed whilst the respondent was on bail. He had been charged with the offence in count 10 on 16 June 2014 and committed the offence that was on the Form 1 with Victim 5 on 23 July 2014.
	
	
	The sentencing judge refused to find that committing the Form 1 offence whilst on bail was an aggravating factor because: “It seems to me that there is a danger of double-counting if I take into account as an aggravating factor the matter on a Form 1”.
	
	
	It is difficult to understand that statement. On one view, his Honour may have misconceived the issue. The Form 1 offence was not an aggravating factor in respect of the principal offence. That the Form 1 offence was committed on bail was an aggravating feature of that offence itself. In any event, I cannot understand what concern his Honour held about “double-counting”.
	
	
	In any event, I do not consider that this asserted error requires resolution of the competing submissions. The indicative sentence for count 7 was 3 years, the longest for any of the offences against s 61M(2). The Crown's appeal is against the aggregate sentence, not the indicative sentences. Assuming the Crown's contention is correct, the indicative sentence for count 7 should have been longer; but not by any substantial margin. In the context of the totality of the respondent's criminality, a slightly longer indicative sentence for count 7 would not have had a material bearing upon the assessment of the aggregate term.
	
	
	However, one statement by the sentencing judge should not escape mention. He said:
	


“I note having availed himself of this arrangement, that is the Form 1 matters, the offender has the benefit of not facing sentences of imprisonment for those additional offences. By clearing the slate in this way, as it is described, he has provided considerable utility which must be brought to account for the offender."" (Emphasis added)


	
	The emphasised words mirror what his Honour said when sentencing the offender in Hinchcliffe v R [2013] NSWCCA 327. In the course of allowing the appeal against the manifestly inadequate sentence imposed in that case it was said by Johnson J (Leeming JA and Hall J agreeing) that Mr Odgers (who coincidentally appeared) ""acknowledged that this observation of the sentencing judge did not accord with principle"". Johnson J explained:
	


""[219] It appears that his Honour's approach to the Form 1 matters involved a type of double counting in favour of the respondent. It is no doubt correct that the Form 1 procedure involves a type of clearing the slate by an offender. In this way, an offender obtains an advantage in that there is a cap upon the available sentence confined to the primary offence, in relation to which the Form 1 matters are to be taken into account. However, it is erroneous to, in some way, seek to afford a further benefit to an offender because he or she has co-operated in such a process. To the extent that his Honour's words indicate that such an approach was taken, it was erroneous.""

Error 8 – error in the approach to the fact that the s 61M and s 61O offences are capable of being prosecuted in the Local Court


	
	This asserted error refers to the following passage of the remarks on sentence (which, despite the statement of the error, is confined to s 61M offences):
	


""I also need to take into account the fact that in relation to a number of the offences under s 61M(1) and also 61M(2) that those offences could have been disposed of in the Local Court. The authorities are clear that I need to take that into account. The authorities are clear that I am not constrained to impose sentences that the Local Court might impose but I am nevertheless to take the sentences that might be imposed in the Local Court into account and I propose to do so.""


	
	When announcing the indicative sentences that would have been imposed for the individual offences, his Honour commenced:
	


""In relation to the first indictment on the first count an indicative sentence, bearing in mind that it is a matter which would most likely be dealt with in the Local Court, is nine months.""


	
	His Honour did not say anything about the possibility of summary disposal in the Local Court when announcing any of the other indicative sentences. It is doubtful that this means that he did not think it was relevant to any other offence as it seems clear from his earlier statement that he regarded it as relevant to all of the s 61M offences.
	
	
	Offences against ss 61M and 61O(2) may be dealt with summarily in the Local Court unless either the prosecutor or the accused elects for them to be dealt with on indictment: s 260 and Table 1 in Sch 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The maximum term of imprisonment that may be imposed by the Local Court in either case is 2 years: s 267(2). That is a ""jurisdictional limit"" of the Local Court, not the maximum penalty for the offence: R v Doan [2000] NSWCCA 317; 50 NSWLR 115 at 123 [35].
	
	
	Reference should be made to the judgment of Johnson J in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at [84]-[121] for a comprehensive survey of the principles relating to summary disposal of indictable offences and when it may be appropriate when sentencing in the District Court to take into account the possibility that an offence may have been dealt with in the Local Court.
	
	
	The Crown contended that because of the objective seriousness of the offences against s 61M and s 61O, and the fact that other offences could only be dealt with on indictment, it was not the case that these offences would have been the subject of summary disposition in the Local Court. Whilst the judge was technically correct as to the possibility, the practical reality was that there was no mitigation flowing from this at all.
	
	
	Guideline 8 of the Prosecution Guidelines of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for New South Wales furnished pursuant to s 13 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW) makes clear that an election to proceed on indictment should be made in a case such as this where the criminality of the offender could not be adequately accommodated within the sentencing parameters available in the Local Court and where the offender is also charged with strictly indictable offences.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted (with reference to authority) that ""the applicable principle is that where an offence could reasonably (or 'appropriately') have been disposed of in the Local Court, the sentencing court should take into account that fact"". So much may be accepted. But the fact is that it would not have been reasonable or appropriate for any of the present offences to be finalised in the Local Court.
	
	
	It was also submitted that ""as a general proposition, it would be appropriate to impose the likely sentence that the offender would have received in the Local Court if the offences had been disposed of there"".
	
	
	Johnson J made an observation in Zreika v R (at [112]) to the effect that the theoretical availability of summary disposal is not a relevant sentencing consideration unless it can be shown that ""it is plainly wrong that the offence is in the District Court"". A common example of it being ""plainly wrong"" is where the offence was only in the District Court because the offender was also prosecuted for a strictly indictable offence for which he or she was there acquitted. The two authorities cited by counsel for the respondent for the ""general proposition"" just mentioned, Peiris v R [2014] NSWCCA 58; 240 A Crim R 114 and R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167, were both examples of such a case.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent maintained that in accordance with Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 it is necessary for a judge in a multiple offence sentencing exercise to first determine the appropriate sentence for each individual offence before turning to a consideration of totality. In this way, it was submitted, the individual offences could have been considered as appropriate for summary disposal in the Local Court. With respect, I cannot accept the logic of this in a case where there are a significant number of charges with some being strictly indictable. Although it was said that it was not necessary for a judge to look at each offence in a vacuum, it was submitted that the gravity of the offences must be determined individually. I accept the latter but it does not justify invocation of an artificial consideration that if each offence was prosecuted in isolation from the others they might have been dealt with in the Local Court.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the judge was wrong to take into account the sentences that might have been imposed in the Local Court for the s 61M offences where it would have been entirely inappropriate for such indictable offences to be the subject of summary disposal.
	


Error 9 – error in the approach to totality


	
	Street CJ described the principle of totality in sentencing in R v Holder; R v Johnston [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 260 as follows:
	


""The principle of totality is a convenient phrase, descriptive of the significant practical consideration confronting a sentencing judge when sentencing for two or more offences. Not infrequently a straightforward arithmetical addition of sentences appropriate for each individual offence considered separately will arrive at an ultimate aggregate that exceeds what is called for in the whole of the circumstances. In such a situation the sentencing judge will evaluate, in a broad sense, the overall criminality involved in all of the offences and, having done so, will determine what, if any, downward adjustment is necessary, whether by telescoping or otherwise, in the aggregate sentences in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences. ""


	
	In R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; 171 A Crim R 267 at [46], the Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Hulme and Hislop JJ) emphasised the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice when sentencing for multiple offences by endorsing the remarks of Sully J in the two-judge bench decision in R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at [36]-[37]:
	


""... (There) is the need to ensure public confidence in the administration of criminal justice; and, in particular, to ensure that there does not emerge in the community at large a perception that there is not all that much to choose between the person who commits one or two offences, and the person who commits six or seven offences, for the reason that somehow or other they all manage to finish up with effective sentences between or among which there is hardly anything in practical terms to choose.

It needs to be clearly understood by all concerned that a person who commits a deliberate series of discrete offences, - and the present applicant's case, is a good example of the kind, - he must not be left with the idea that by intoning references to the principle of totality as though it were some magic mantra, he can escape effective punishment for the offences which follow successively one upon another throughout the whole course of a studied and deliberate course of criminal behaviour.""


	
	In R v XX (2009) 195 A Crim R 38 at [52], Hall J set out a number of propositions derived from the case law concerning the discretionary exercise of ordering sentences to be served concurrently or cumulatively in accordance with the principle of totality. They included reference to the following passage in the judgment of Howie J in R v Cahyadi [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41at [27]:
	


""… [T]here is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both."" (Emphasis added)


	
	The Crown contended that the indicative sentences were unduly lenient (which is a matter left for consideration in relation to the overall complaint of manifest inadequacy) but there was also an inadequate notional accumulation of those sentences in arriving at the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	Whilst the Crown accepted that the approach to totality is not strictly mathematical, it sought to illustrate and make good this complaint by reference to the indicative sentences specified in relation to Count 2 on the first indictment and counts 3 and 4 on the second indictment. Count 2 has an indicative sentence of 8 years and each of counts 3 and 4 has an indicative sentence of 4 years. If the sentencing exercise had involved only these offences, an appropriate measure of partial accumulation would have yielded an aggregate term very close to, or the same as, the 13 year aggregate term arrived at by Jeffreys DCJ. This was said to be illustrative of the fact that the aggregate sentence did not reflect the totality of the respondent's criminality as it left largely unpunished the multitude of offences committed in relation to seven other victims.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent, correctly with respect, pointed out that the Crown's complaint in relation to this asserted error is not specific. It simply raises a question as to whether the aggregate sentence is manifestly inadequate. It was submitted that ""the starting point sentence of 17 years imprisonment was appropriate, notwithstanding the seriousness of the offences committed by the respondent"".
	
	
	Jeffreys DCJ adverted to the principle of totality (ROS 37.8). The question is whether there was error in the manner in which he exercised his discretion in applying the principle. In these circumstances, it is appropriate to proceed to consider the overarching question, whether the aggregate sentence is manifestly inadequate.
	


Objective seriousness of the offences


	
	Before turning to the critical issue it is necessary to deal with the issue of the objective seriousness of the offences. Generally speaking, it is open to this Court when dealing with a Crown appeal against sentence to make its own assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences: Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 254 ALR 379 at [24]. In this particular case it is mandated because of the failure of the primary judge to do so.
	
	
	In relation to each of the offences it is appropriate to take into account that the respondent, knowing of his sexual urges towards children of both sexes, took advantage of the fact that they frequented his home. He conceded in his evidence (somewhat begrudgingly – ""what am I going to do, fill in the swimming pool?"") that he knew his home was attractive to children with its facilities including a tennis court, swimming pool, spa and computer games. He preyed upon his victims in this context.
	


Section 66EA – Persistent sexual abuse of a child


	
	Section 66EA provides that it is an offence to engage in conduct with a child that constitutes a sexual offence on three or more separate occasions during any period of time. A ""sexual offence"" includes offences of aggravated indecent assault (s 61M), sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 14 (s 66C(1)) and sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 (s 66C(3)). The conduct need not be of the same nature nor constitute the same offence. It is immaterial if some of the offences were committed outside of the State. It is unnecessary for the prosecution to specify or to prove the dates or the exact circumstances of the various occasions on which the conduct constituting sexual offence occurred.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for an offence against s 66EA is imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	It has been said that an offence against s 66EA is more serious than the offences which comprise the individual acts: Langbein v R [2008] NSWCCA 38; 181 A Crim R 378 at [115] (McClellan CJ at CL). However, it also has been accepted that there is ""nothing … to suggest that the Parliament intended sentencing for a course of conduct that had crystallised into a s 66EA conviction to be more harsh than sentencing for the same course of conduct had it crystallised into convictions for a number of representative offences”: R v Fitzgerald [2004] NSWCCA 5; 59 NSWLR 493 at 503 [13]; R v Manners [2004] NSWCCA 181 at [21].
	
	
	The agreed facts for this offence particularised a number of offences of aggravated indecent assault and sexual intercourse committed by the respondent against Victim 2 in the 5-year period from January 2003 to December 2007 when Victim 2 was aged 10 to 14 years' old. They are described above (at [13]-[20]). There were multiple occasions of indecent assaults and a progression to fellatio and anal intercourse. There were four instances of the respondent showing pornography to Victim 2 as a prequel to his sexual acts. The particularised offences (eight offences against s 61M(2) and seven against s 66C (two being attempts)) were not isolated incidents; it was an agreed fact that indecent assaults and oral sex occurred on many other occasions.
	
	
	As noted earlier, the sentencing judge was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was ""grooming"" behaviour by the respondent. It was an agreed fact that he befriended Victim 2 and afforded him the opportunity to enjoy the facilities at his home: computer games, the spa and swimming pool. He gave Victim 2 money for performing odd jobs and gave him small gifts, soft drinks and lollies. He took him away to Canberra to watch a rugby game from a corporate box and took him on a trip to gather oysters on the Bega River. This was activity engaged in by a man in his late 40's – early 50's in relation to a boy aged 10 to 14. Even if there might be doubt about whether this was grooming behaviour, it remains a serious aspect of the offending that the respondent engendered a comfortable and generous relationship with the young boy and sexually violated him in that context.
	
	
	Having regard to these features I am satisfied that the concession made by the respondent’s counsel in the District Court and maintained in this Court that the objective seriousness of this offence was above the middle of the range was appropriate. I would consider it to be comfortably above that level but I also accept counsel's submission that it was not ""at or near the top of the range"".
	


Section 61M – Aggravated indecent assault


	
	The actual character of the assault, including the degree of physical contact involved, is of considerable significance in assessing the objective seriousness of indecent assaults against children: Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 at [72] (Johnson J).
	
	
	As an example of how this Court has regarded the seriousness of an offence against s 61M(2), constituted by an adult touching a child's genitalia, in GSH v R; R v GSH [2009] NSWCCA 214, Latham J observed that ""it is difficult to justify a finding below the mid-range for an offence under s 61M(2) constituted by the touching of the genitalia of a nine year old girl"". Contrary to the finding of the primary judge, her Honour assessed the offence as ""well above the mid-range, although not in the worst category"" (at [59]). It involved the offender asking the child, a visitor to his home, to sit on his lap and when she did so he touched her on the outside of her vagina.
	
	
	Other matters bearing upon the assessment may include the age difference between the perpetrator and the child (Corby v R at [77]). The age of the child relative to the range encompassed by the offence is also relevant - ""the younger the child the more serious the offence"": R v KNL [2005] NSWCCA 260; 154 A Crim R 268 at [42] (Latham J); RJA v R at [13] (Spigelman CJ).
	
	
	The aggravated indecent assault offences in the first indictment involved (except in the case of Count 9) skin on skin touching of children's genitalia and/or buttocks. In the context of an offence with an age range up to (but not including) 16, the ages of the children and the activity involved were:
	


Count 1   Victim 1   Aged 10        Touched girl's buttocks and genitalia

Count 3   Victim 3   Aged 10-11   Touched and held boy's genitals

Count 4   Victim 4   Aged 8-9       Rubbed boy's buttocks

Count 5   Victim 4   Aged 9-10     Touched boy's genitalia

Count 6   Victim 4   Aged 12        Touched boy's genitalia

Count 7   Victim 5   Aged 13        Stroked boy's penis; spoke of fellatio

Count 8   Victim 6   Aged 13        Rubbed boy's penis

Count 9   Victim 7   Aged 13        Touched boy's genitalia


	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted that the offences in counts 1, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9 were ""serious but below the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". The submissions included that the offences were ""opportunistic"" and there was no ""grooming"". The offence in count 4 was said to be of low objective seriousness but the submissions incorrectly describe the offence as involving a ""touching"" of the child's bottom and do not mention that the child was aged 8-9. The offence in count 10 was submitted to be ""below the middle of the range"" but no reason was given for why that should be so.
	
	
	I would regard each of the offences as being considerably serious examples of their type and the more so the younger the victim. The offence in count 7 was more serious as well because it involved stroking the boy's penis and speaking of a desire to perform fellatio in the future although I do not accept that it was at a greater level of seriousness that the indicative sentence of 3 years compared to the indicative sentences of 9 or 12 months for the other indecent assault offences would indicate. The offence in count 8 was more serious because it involved more than just touching.
	
	
	The aggravated indecent assault offences in the second indictment occurred in the context of a relationship engendered by the respondent. It was part of the agreed facts that he welcomed the boy to use the facilities at his home and a relationship developed in which Victim 9, who was 15 years' old, looked upon him as a father figure and role model. Count 1 involved the respondent sitting the child on his lap with his erect penis pressing against the child's back. The Form 1 offence in relation to count 1 involved pulling Victim 9’s swimmers down in the spa and rubbing his erect penis against the boy's buttocks whilst groaning. Count 2 involved the respondent masturbating the boy's penis.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted in the District Court that the objective seriousness of these offences ""would not exceed the middle of the range"". In this Court it was submitted that the offence in count 1 was ""below the middle of the range"" and the offence in count 2 was ""significantly more serious"".
	
	
	Although the victim was at the upper end of the age range for this offence, the activity involved was particularly serious and they were not isolated incidents. In my view, the offence in count 1 was of middle range seriousness and I agree that the offence in count 2 was comparatively worse.
	


Section 66C(4) – Aggravated sexual intercourse with child aged 14 to 16


	
	The nature of the sexual intercourse is very relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness although there is no rigid hierarchy of seriousness of different forms of intercourse: R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56; 239 A Crim R 469 at [97]. However in sentencing in sexual assault cases, generally the form of intercourse is not determinative; it is necessary to look at all of the relevant circumstances: Simpson v R [2014] NSWCCA 23 at [30].
	
	
	The maximum penalty for an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child aged 14 to 16 is imprisonment for 12 years. The circumstance of aggravation was that the victim was under the authority of the respondent (the offence occurred in his home).
	
	
	These two offences in counts 3 and 4 of the second indictment concerning Victim 9 occurred in the context of the relationship I have described above and were preceded by indecent assaults ""on most occasions"" the pair were in the spa together. Counts 3 and 4 comprised acts of fellatio and anal intercourse inflicted during the one incident. The latter lasted some 5 minutes and only stopped when Victim 9 complained of the pain. This was not an isolated incident, it being agreed that oral and anal intercourse occurred on a number of other occasions.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted in the District Court that ""the objective seriousness would not exceed the middle of the range"". I agree with the Crown's submission in this Court that the s 66C(4) offences ""are very serious examples of their kind"".
	


Section 61O(2) – Act of indecency towards child under age 10


	
	To understand the seriousness with which Parliament recognises offences involving acts of indecency it is necessary to look at both s 61N and s 61O.
	
	
	Section 61N provides for act of indecency offences with maximum penalties of 2 years if the victim is under the age of 16 and 1 year 6 months if the victim is of or above that age.
	
	
	Section 61O(1) provides for an aggravated act of indecency offence against a person under the age of 16. The circumstances of aggravation are either that the offender is in the company of another person or persons; the victim is under the authority of the offender; the victim has a serious physical disability; or the victim has a cognitive impairment. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years. Section 61O(1A) provides for such an offence but in relation to a victim who is of or above the age of 16 and the maximum penalty is 3 years.
	
	
	Section 61O(2) provides for an act of indecency offence with a maximum penalty of 7 years where the victim is under the age of 10. No circumstance of aggravation is required.
	
	
	Section 61O(2A) provides for an aggravated form of the s 61O(2) offence, the aggravation being that the offender knows that the act is being filmed for the purpose of producing child abuse material. The maximum penalty is 10 years.
	
	
	From this review it may be seen that Parliament has regarded an act of indecency offence involving a child under 10 as considerably more serious than offences involving persons of a greater age.
	
	
	The offence involving Victim 8 in count 10 of the first indictment involved the respondent approaching an 8-year old visitor to his home who was playing with toys in an area well away from the adults. He approached her with his penis exposed and put his hands on her arms and pulled them towards him but she pulled away. It may be inferred that she was sufficiently distressed by the experience to make a complaint to her mother on their journey home.
	
	
	Again, this is a particularly serious example of an offence of its type.
	


Submissions


	
	The Crown's submissions in relation to the indicative sentences for each offence included reference to the maximum penalty and, in most cases, the applicable standard non-parole period. These are important guideposts in the assessment of sentence: Muldrock v The Queen at 132 [27].
	
	
	It was submitted by the Crown that almost all of the indicative sentences specified by the primary judge were inadequate having regard to the serious nature of the offending.
	
	
	It was also submitted that there was some inexplicable (that is, unexplained by the judge) disparity in relation to some of the indicative sentences. For example, the sentence for count 7 was three times greater than the sentences for other aggravated indecent assaults in the first indictment. The first count in the second indictment required a very serious indecent assault to be taken into account yet it had an indicative sentence of only 12 months compared to the 2 years 6 months indicated for the second count in that indictment.
	
	
	The Crown also contended that the aggregate sentence failed to reflect the totality of the respondent's criminality to an extent that it was manifestly inadequate and below the range of sentence that could be justly imposed consistently with sentencing standards: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at 588 [24]. That criminality included the commission of very serious crimes over a long period of time in circumstances where the respondent constantly found new victims.
	
	
	Reference was made to observations made in this Court as to the profound and long-term deleterious effects that child sexual assault offences have upon victims: R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [92]. Reference was also made to SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 where Johnson J stated (at [52]):
	


""Sexual abuse of children of very tender years will inevitably give rise to psychological damage emanating from (at least) the confusion in the young mind of the victim of abuse.""


	
	Submissions for the respondent emphasised the favourable findings made by the sentencing judge in relation to his subjective case (they are included in the summary of the sentencing judgment above at [122]). It was contended that these findings permitted a degree of leniency.
	
	
	It was submitted that in the light of these findings, ""the starting point sentence of 17 years imprisonment was appropriate"". I interpolate that the judge did not adopt such a ""starting point"". He reduced each of the indicative sentences by 25 per cent before then considering what the aggregate term should be having regard to the principle of totality. It would have been erroneous to proceed in the reverse fashion so as to arrive at an aggregate term and then apply the discount for the pleas of guilty: SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94 at [35]-[43].
	
	
	The submissions also cited authorities in which there is a discussion of ""individualised justice"", ""the application of a degree of mercy"", and ""leniency [being extended] to encourage reform"". For example, in Elias v The Queen; Issa v The Queen [2013] HCA 31; 248 CLR 483 at 494 [27] the High Court said:
	


""[T]he factors bearing on the determination of sentence will frequently pull in different directions. It is the duty of the judge to balance often incommensurable factors and to arrive at a sentence that is just in all of the circumstances. The administration of the criminal law involves individualised justice, the attainment of which is acknowledged to involve the exercise of a wide sentencing discretion.""


	
	It is important, in my view, to note that the Court immediately went on to speak of the need for judges to ""act in accordance with statutory and any applicable common law principles and in a manner that is consonant with reasonable consistency"" and referred to a statement by Gleeson CJ in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 591 [6] that included:
	


""The outcome of discretionary decision-making can never be uniform, but it ought to depend as little as possible upon the identity of the judge who happens to hear the case.""


	
	In oral submissions it was accepted that the sentence appeared on its face to be a relatively lenient one. However, it was contended that various subjective factors rendered this case ""very different from almost all other cases involving the sentencing of persons guilty of child sexual assault offences"". For this reason, so-called comparable cases were not comparable at all. Moreover, it was submitted that this was a case in which there was justification for giving less weight to general and specific deterrence and the protection of the community and more weight to rehabilitation.
	
	
	Counsel referred to certain statements made by McHugh J in Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 in relation to the sentencing of paedophiles. His Honour only engaged with the issue because of certain statements made by Kirby and Callinan JJ in their judgments. It is important to note that in concluding his judgment, McHugh J said (at 285 [56]):
	


""Nothing I have said about sentencing paedophiles or the weight to be given to the publicity and opprobrium accompanying conviction is intended to or could be definitive. Nor are my remarks intended to be an exhaustive discussion of these issues. And, since they were not made in deciding a litigated issue, they are not binding on any judge or magistrate.""

Determination


	
	The Crown devoted effort to submissions as to the asserted inadequacy of indicative sentences. Of course, the appeal is primarily concerned with the aggregate sentence. In JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 I discussed the relevance of indicative sentences in an appeal that is concerned with an aggregate sentence. The following propositions (at [40]) are presently relevant:
	


11. The indicative sentences recorded in accordance with s 53A(2) [of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act] are not themselves amenable to appeal, although they may be a guide to whether error is established in relation to the aggregate sentence.

12. Even if the indicative sentences are assessed as being excessive, that does not necessarily mean that the aggregate sentence is excessive.

13. A principal focus of determination of a ground alleging manifest inadequacy or excess will be whether the aggregate sentence reflects the totality of the criminality involved."" (Citation of authorities omitted)


	
	The submissions for the respondent about this case justifying less weight being given to general and specific deterrence and the protection of the community and more weight to rehabilitation is problematic in that it remains unknown whether that was an approach taken by the primary judge. His Honour quoted such matters as being part of the purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but said nothing about how significant he found any of them.
	
	
	A summary of ""comparative cases"" was annexed to the written submissions for the Crown. Counsel for the respondent replied by providing written ""Notes on Appellant's Summary of Cases"". Neither party made any submissions about any of the cases except that for the respondent it was submitted that this case was unique and so no case was comparable. In the result, there was no suggestion on behalf of either party that there was a range of comparable sentences that would bear upon the assessment of sentence in this case. In those circumstances, the assessment should be based upon general sentencing principles with regard to the guideposts of the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods provided by Parliament.
	
	
	Counsel accepted in oral submissions that there were flaws in the sentencing judgment such that it came down to this Court making its own determination of what the sentence should be and then comparing that with what was imposed. The question was said to be: ""is the difference so great that no reasonable judge sitting at first instance could properly, in accordance with all the relevant principles, even though he hasn't articulated everything, come to the conclusion that he did?"" In my assessment, the answer to that question is in the affirmative.
	
	
	I have come to the view that both the aggregate sentence of 13 years as well as the non-parole period of 7 years are manifestly inadequate in the sense that they are unreasonably and plainly unjust. A significantly higher assessment was required in order for there to be a sentence that was proportionate to the objective gravity of the offences. The sentence imposed completely fails the first purpose of sentencing (s 3A(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act), namely to ensure the respondent is adequately punished for his predatory sexual abuse of 9 children in a period exceeding 10 years. It also fails to sufficiently denounce his conduct and to recognise the considerable harm he has caused (s 3A(f) and (g)).
	
	
	True it is that there were a number of significant matters in the respondent's subjective case that called for not inconsiderable mitigation. But giving due recognition to those matters cannot be allowed to prevail over the well-established sentencing principle described by Spigelman CJ in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at 572 [15]:
	


""It is authoritatively established that the common law principle of proportionality, propounded in Veen No 2, requires that a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the gravity of the crime, having regard to the objective circumstances. (Hoare v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 348 at 354.) In a line of cases, commencing with R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354, referred to and affirmed by a five judge bench in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 at [156]-[158], the proportionality principle is also held to apply so that a sentence should not be less than the objective gravity of the offence requires.""

Residual discretion


	
	The Crown (which bears the onus on this issue) submitted that there was no specific matter (e.g. delay, progress towards rehabilitation) that would militate against intervention. Counsel for the respondent did not contend otherwise. The Crown also submitted that the interests of justice called for the imposition of an appropriate sentence, particularly having regard to the offences having been committed against multiple victims: R v Gommeson [2014] NSWCCA 159 at [124].
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted, by reference to R v MF [2015] NSWCCA 283, that even if this Court were to conclude that the sentence was manifestly inadequate it was ""not so lenient as to constitute an affront to justice such that intervention is necessary"". That quotation was taken from the judgment of Bathurst CJ at [4]. It was immediately preceded by his Honour saying that the sentence in question might be considered ""somewhat lenient"". (R v MF was a case in which the sentence was not found to be manifestly inadequate.)
	
	
	In my view, the sentence imposed by Jeffreys DCJ is such an affront to the administration of justice that interference is justified in order to maintain adequate standards of punishment for offences of this kind.
	


Exercise of the sentencing discretion afresh


	
	I have previously indicated my view as to the seriousness of the offences (see above at [237]-[263]).
	
	
	A number of subjective mitigating factors legitimately identified by the primary judge should be brought to bear on the assessment of sentence. In this regard I have in mind the 25 per cent reduction of sentence for each individual offence on account of the respondent's early pleas of guilty. I also have in mind his otherwise prior good character (I agree that the 1981 indecent exposure offence is too removed in time to have significance). His charitable and other community engagements are significant matters.
	
	
	No submissions were made as to whether or not s 21A(5A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which prohibits good character and a lack of previous convictions being taken into account in child sexual assault cases, should apply. It applies if either of those factors was of assistance to the offender in committing the offences. Arguably it does apply but the situation is not entirely clear and in the absence of the Crown raising it I would not apply it. I bear in mind, however, that good character is of less significance in cases such as this involving repeated sexual offending against children over a lengthy period of time: see, for example, PGM v R [2008] NSWCCA 172; 187 A Crim R 152 at [43]-[44]; Dousha v R [2008] NSWCCA 263 at [49].
	
	
	I am prepared to accept that, to a degree, the respondent is remorseful. His early guilty pleas, entered before a brief of evidence was compiled and served and his prompt seeking out of psychiatric treatment for his paedophilic condition are significant matters. The manner in which he gave evidence in the sentence proceedings (arrogance and belligerence is apparent even from the transcript e.g. “What am I going to do, fill in the swimming pool?”), and the acceptance by his counsel in this Court that he sought to understate the seriousness of some of his offences, points in the opposite direction.
	
	
	The finding by the primary judge that there are ""reasonable"" prospects of rehabilitation should be maintained. The qualifier to this is, as his Honour stated, ""whilst ever he is on that treatment"". (It was common ground that the respondent had continued treatment whilst in prison.)
	
	
	I am not prepared to accept that the condition of ADHD (assuming the respondent has it) reduces his moral culpability for the offences or justifies any reduction in the weight to be given to general deterrence. He is a very intelligent man who was a highly successful businessman. He acknowledged in his evidence that he knew what he was doing was wrong and against the law. Yet he repeatedly offended against different children for years. If his offending was at all impulsive, which I doubt, he continually allowed himself to be presented with opportunities, and on many occasions sought out opportunities, to offend.
	
	
	The difficulties the respondent's wife has experienced and his anxiety in relation to it should be taken into account.
	
	
	I am not prepared to find that there are special circumstances warranting a reduction of the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period. There is a significant purpose in the respondent being supervised in the community when released on parole and that is to ensure that he maintains treatment directed to minimising the risk of further offending. However, the potential period of parole incorporated by a sentence that is framed in the usual statutory proportions will be more than adequate for that purpose. Mr Van Ryn is a mature and intelligent man who claims to understand the link between him maintaining treatment and reduction of his risk of reoffending. He should not need to have a parole officer looking over his shoulder for a greater period of time to ensure he is doing what needs to be done.
	


Indicative sentences


	
	Pursuant to s 53A(2)(b), I propose the following sentences as those that would have been imposed if the Court did not proceed to impose an aggregate sentence. Each has been reduced by 25 per cent (with some rounding for practical purposes) on account of the utilitarian value of the early pleas of guilty. Additional offences have been taken into account in relation counts 4 and 7 on the first indictment and count 1 on the second indictment.

2768758,Kiernan v R [2016] NSWCCA 12,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offence and sentence

The applicant seeks leave pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Lerve DCJ on 28 November 2014 in the District Court at Dubbo. He was sentenced for one count of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 25 years. The offence has a standard non-parole period of 7 years.


	
	After allowing a 25 percent discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months, commencing 3 December 2013, with a non-parole period of 5 years.
	
	
	The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 1 – Lerve DCJ erred in finding that the offence was within the midrange of objective seriousness.

Ground 2 – Lerve DCJ erred in not taking Mr Kiernan’s subjective evidence into account when determining the approach to take to his criminal history.

Ground 3 – The sentence is manifestly excessive.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	The facts before the Court were contained in an Agreed Statement of Facts (Exhibit A).
	
	
	The victim lived alone in a caravan on a property west of Wellington. On the night of 29 November 2013 the applicant and Ms Higgins, who was at the time in an intimate relationship with him, drove to the victim’s caravan in order for Ms Higgins to obtain money from the victim which he had previously agreed to provide to her.
	
	
	After obtaining the money from the victim, the applicant and Ms Higgins purchased drugs which they then consumed. Ms Higgins in the course of a conversation with the applicant informed him that the victim had engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with her. (The victim denied any such inappropriate sexual conduct, although he did agree that he had paid one of Ms Higgins’ friends for sex when Ms Higgins was present.)
	
	
	The applicant and Ms Higgins decided that they would as a payback to the victim, return to his caravan and rob him. At about 1.15am on 30 November 2013 the applicant and Ms Higgins changed their clothes and drove to the victim’s caravan. It was planned that Ms Higgins would drive both of them away after the robbery. Accordingly, she positioned the vehicle to wait for a call from the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant entered the caravan and he and the victim talked for about an hour. The discussion revolved around the victim’s relationship with Ms Higgins. In the course of the conversation the applicant became enraged and decided that he would seriously hurt the victim rather than rob him.
	
	
	The applicant pulled a Stanley knife from his pocket, jumped on the back of the victim, pulled his head back and in two motions cut his throat with his right hand. The first cut caused a superficial laceration, but the second caused a deeper wound that commenced to bleed profusely. A struggle thereafter ensued with the victim striking the applicant on the head with a fan in an effort to stop the assault. As a result of being so struck, the applicant fell backwards before again lunging at the victim, this time stabbing him in the right leg.
	
	
	The victim again struck the applicant with the fan and was able to get off the bed. As he did so, the applicant lunged at him with the knife still in his hand. The applicant threw the knife at the victim, narrowly missing him. The applicant retrieved the knife and ran from the caravan. When the applicant last saw the victim he was lying face down on the bed and the applicant thought that he was dead. The applicant contacted Ms Higgins who drove to the caravan and collected him.
	
	
	The victim was able to get up and saw the vehicle drive away. The victim, although suffering wounds, was able to walk to a nearby property from where he was taken to Wellington District Hospital.
	
	
	Ms Higgins was arrested on 1 December 2013 and made full admissions when interviewed by the police. The applicant attended Dubbo Police Station on 3 December 2013 and although he initially denied any involvement, later made full admissions to having committed the offence.
	
	
	A medical report of 10 February 2014 set out that the victim had suffered a 10cm laceration through the skin and subcutaneous tissue but not into the deeper tissue. There was a smaller 3cm cut on the right side of the neck at the level of the vocal chords. The principal wound was repaired with sutures and there was no major haemorrhage or air leak from that laceration. The smaller wound only required surgical cleaning and dressing.
	
	
	The treating doctor gave the following opinion in his report:
	


“The main laceration was consistent with being cut from one side of the neck to the other with a knife or sharp object. The type of laceration would be consistent with an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to the patient. Fortunately there were no major structures involved and the injury was not life-threatening.”

The victim was allowed to go home the following day and at the time of the sentence proceedings, had fully recovered from his injuries.

The applicant’s subjective case


	
	The applicant was aged 32 at the time of the offending and is currently aged 35. He was born in February 1981. He had a poor criminal record. As a juvenile in 2000, he was convicted and sentenced to a total of 4 years and 6 months imprisonment in respect of sexual assaults on a person under 16 years of age. In 2007 at the District Court in Cairns he was convicted of a number of offences including use/threaten violence whilst armed in company, deprivation of liberty, common assault and stealing. The applicant said that these offences related to one incident after some people drugged and raped his cousin. The applicant and others assaulted the men involved by way of retribution for that offence.
	
	
	The applicant was also convicted of offences involving damage to property, steal from the person and common assault. The list of prior offences was substantial.
	
	
	There was a medical consensus that at the time when he was sentenced, the applicant was not suffering from schizophrenia or bi-polar disorder. He was not demonstrating features that would support a diagnosis of a major mood disorder or a psychotic condition.
	
	
	In a report dated 11 November 2014 Dr Dayalan, who was a consultant forensic psychiatrist, concluded:
	


“His history of stimulant abuse is more recent and is likely to exacerbate any underlying behavioural and emotional disregulation”.

Dr Dayalan recommended psychological intervention and engagement in a substance abuse rehabilitation program.


	
	The applicant began using cannabis at the age of 10 and progressed to heroin, alcohol and later amphetamines. He was regularly using amphetamines after his release from custody in March 2013.
	
	
	Exhibit 2 was an important document in the sentence proceedings. It contained considerable material relating to the applicant’s offending and personal circumstances as a juvenile when he came before the Children’s Court on various occasions. He first appeared in the Children’s Court when he was aged 10. He was described as having behavioural problems, such as being belligerent, deceitful and aggressive towards other students and displaying inappropriate sexual behaviours. Attempts both real and proposed to harm those who had displeased him included threats to kill those persons. The material in Exhibit 2 continually referred to such behavioural issues.
	
	
	Exhibit 2 included a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Schlebaum, dated 3 February 1995, to the effect that “the offender at the time was suffering from a complex combination of post traumatic stress disorder, chronic anxiety, intense fear, phobias, nightmares, poor impulse control, severe recurrent at times suicidal depression, attention deficit disorder, physical developmental delay and multiple personality disorder.” It was also clear from that material that until he was taken into care in 1991 the applicant was subjected to ritual and constant physical, sexual and psychological abuse. That abuse included satanic practices.
	
	
	Even while in foster care, the applicant was subjected to abuse which included strategies to try to “shame/humiliate him to change his behaviour which only made things worse”. When he wet his bed, he was required to carry a bucket of his urine and pour it on himself. He was also required to wear a bell around his neck so that the members of the foster family knew where he was.
	
	
	On the basis of the contents of Exhibit 2, there was no issue in the sentence proceedings that the applicant in his formative years was subject to constant and ritualised physical, sexual and psychological abuse.
	


Remarks on sentence


	
	Having reviewed the circumstances of the offence and the applicant’s criminal history, his Honour considered the competing submissions of counsel. In the course of doing so, his Honour said:
	


“Mr Nash of counsel for the offender submitted that the criminal history is one that did not entitle the offender to any leniency. A little later Mr Nash submitted that the criminal history has to be examined in the context of the significant volume of subjective material contained within exhibit 2, that is material relating to the care proceedings in the Children’s Court in the 1990’s relative to the offender when he was a child. I will go into the content of exhibit 2 later in these remarks. However I am of the opinion that despite the strength of the subjective material it does not impact on how the criminal history is taken into account.” (Sentence judgment 6.6) (Emphasis added)


	
	His Honour noted the Crown’s reliance upon what was said by Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ in Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 477-478:
	


“There are two subsidiary principles which should be mentioned. The first is that the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences - DPP v Ottewell (1970) AC 642 at 650. The antecedent criminal history is relevant however to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence and continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind. Counsel for the applicant submitted that the antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a prisoner’s claim for leniency, that is not and has never been the approach of the Courts in this country and it would be at odds with the community’s understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalties”.

His Honour also noted the content of s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.


	
	It was against that background that his Honour said:
	


“In the matter presently under consideration the offender is to be sentenced for a serious personal violence offence and he has a record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences. Considering the offender’s criminal history I am of the opinion that the offence for which the offender appears for sentence illustrates a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law and accordingly retribution deterrence and protection of the community will have more of a part to play than the determination of the ultimate sentence to be imposed.” (Sentence judgment 8.1) (Emphasis added)


	
	His Honour noted that the author of a psychologist’s report from Messrs Duffy Robilliard, found that the applicant was ambivalent about the offence. The report recorded the psychologist being told that he knew that it was wrong in the eyes of the law but in the eyes of justice, he did not so believe. The report recorded that the applicant was able to identify the negative impact on the victim but believed that this impact was generally a positive outcome for society. His Honour found that this indicated an absence of remorse which did not aggravate the offence but did not mitigate the offence by remorse.
	
	
	On the issue of the potential danger which the applicant posed to the public, his Honour took into account the following from the psychologist’s report:
	


“He believed that some people deserved to be hurt as punishment, including himself as he had taken the law into his own hands. His reasoning became more personal when he spoke further about it being practice for his own abusers and he hoped now he had done this people would leave him alone as they know what he is capable of.”


	
	In relation to the applicant’s abusive upbringing, his Honour said:
	


“The material within exhibit 2 grounded a submission which is accepted that the principles enunciated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kennedy v R [2010] NSWCCA 260 are enlivened in this case.” (Sentence judgment 11.3)


	
	His Honour explained that conclusion by reference to the following extract from the judgment of Simpson J in Kennedy:
	


“53 Properly understood Fernando is a decision not about sentencing Aboriginals but about the recognition in the sentencing decisions of social disadvantage that frequently, no matter what the ethnicity of the offender, precedes the commission of the crime. Particularly relevant in the circumstances of that case and this, is the impact of alcohol addiction or dependence. In the proposition lettered (E) Wood J said:

‘While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor where the abuse of alcohol by the person standing for sentence reflects the socio‑economic circumstances of the environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. …””


	
	His Honour also had regard to the following extract from the judgment of Simpson J (Bathurst CJ and Adams J agreeing) in Millwood v R [2012] NSWCCA 2:
	


“… I am not prepared to accept that an offender who has the start in life that the respondent had bears equal moral responsibility with one who has had what might be termed a ‘normal’ or ‘advantaged’ upbringing. Common sense and common humanity dictate that such a person will have fewer emotional resources to guide his (or her) behavioural decisions. I should not be taken as implying that such a person bears no moral responsibility, but I consider the DPP’s submission significantly underestimates the impact of a dysfunctional childhood. … That his background is of relevant consideration affording some (although limited) mitigation is entirely consistent with the approach taken by Wood J (as he then was) in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, a decision which has been repeatedly followed in this Court. …”


	
	His Honour set out his findings in relation to the contents of Exhibit 2 as follows:
	


“In the course of taking submissions I indicated that the material within exhibit 2 justifies a finding as I have already set out, that the offender in his formative years was subject to constant and ritualised physical, sexual and psychological abuse. There is simply no reason to doubt the material contained within the exhibit. That finding, as I have already made clear, justifies a finding that the principles enunciated in the decisions of Kennedy and Millwood, to which I have referred and from which I have extracted, are enlivened and are very much part of the subjective case for this offender.” (Sentence judgment 13.4)


	
	In relation to the seriousness of the offence, his Honour accepted that an offence of this kind was a “result offence”. His Honour quoted with approval that which Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing) said in McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94:
	


“37   “Malicious wounding is principally a result offence. Generally speaking the seriousness of the offence will significantly depend upon the seriousness of the wounding. That is not to say that the manner in which the wound was inflicted and the reason for the infliction of the wound and the circumstances surrounding the wounding are irrelevant the same can be said for an offence of involving the infliction of grievous bodily harm. The more serious the harm inflicted the more serious the offence. See R v Mitchell, R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296.”


	
	His Honour rejected the applicant’s submission that the objective seriousness of the offence was below the midpoint because of the nature of the injuries and the fact that the victim made a complete and rapid recovery. His Honour did so on the basis that the attack was vicious and sustained and that it was a matter of good fortune rather than anything else that the victim did not suffer more serious harm. His Honour considered the nature of the attack to be a relevant consideration when determining the objective seriousness of the offence. It was for that reason that his Honour assessed its objective seriousness at midrange. His Honour also took into account as aggravating factors the use of a knife, that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of the offence and that the attack occurred in the victim’s home.
	
	
	His Honour gave only limited weight to the Judicial Commission’s statistics relating to offences contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act. In doing so, his Honour relied upon Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 and the observations of Garling J (with whom Beazley P and Hulme AJ agreed) in Brown v R [2014] NSWCCA 215:
	


““In offences such as the one with which the Court is here concerned, the statistics from the Judicial Commission are a particularly blunt tool because the injuries which were actually inflicted are not described. Whether the sentences which were imposed upon offenders who had a prior criminal history and what that criminal history was, are not described and the range of possible factual circumstances involved in an offence such as this are broad”.


	
	His Honour noted the applicant’s submission that a sentence of imprisonment was inevitable and that the non-parole period should be in the vicinity of 4 years.
	
	
	His Honour made a finding of special circumstances because of the risk of institutionalisation and because of the need for intensive and extensive supervision upon the applicant’s release to ensure that he received appropriate treatment and counselling and other necessary assistance to enable him to integrate into society. The applicant received a discount on sentence of 25 percent because of his early plea of guilty.
	


GROUNDS OF APPEAL

Ground 1 – Lerve DCJ erred in finding that the offence was within the midrange of objective seriousness.


	
	The applicant submitted that an offence contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act was principally a result offence so that the sentence should significantly depend upon the seriousness of the wounding. In that regard, the applicant noted that the victim had only been hospitalised for a day and that apart from a scar, he had made a complete recovery. The applicant submitted that those facts did not allow a finding by his Honour that the offence was within the midrange of seriousness.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that leaving aside the severity of the wounds, there were other matters which reduced the objective seriousness of the offending. These were that the applicant was alone, his decision to hurt the victim was not premeditated, the victim was not helpless but fought back and that the incident appears to have taken place over a relatively short period.
	
	
	By reference to those matters, the applicant submitted that his Honour had erred in his assessment of objective seriousness as being at the middle of the range for offences of that kind.
	


Consideration


	
	While authorities such as McCullough v R make it clear that offences of this kind are result based, they also make it clear that the manner in which the wound was inflicted, the reason for its infliction and the circumstances surrounding the wounding are relevant when assessing the seriousness of the offence (McCullough v R at [37]).
	
	
	In this case there was no good reason for the applicant’s attack on the victim and the manner in which the wound was inflicted and the overall circumstances were such as to be correctly characterised by his Honour as “vicious and sustained”.
	
	
	While the applicant is to be sentenced for what did occur and not for what might have occurred, it is a relevant factor that the deeper of the two wounds to the neck could have been fatal. It is clear from the photographs that had the wound been a centimetre deeper, it would probably have been fatal. It is not without significance that when the applicant left the victim he believed that he was dead.
	
	
	Another relevant feature of the offending was the mode of the attack, which involved the production of the Stanley knife, the pulling back of the victim’s head and the cutting of the throat in two motions. Even when the victim sought to defend himself, the attack was maintained leading to a further stabbing in the leg. Although the attack was not planned, it is relevant that the applicant went to the victim’s caravan with the intention to rob him.
	
	
	That such matters are relevant to the seriousness of offences of this kind is clear from R v Westerman [2004] NSWCCA 161, R v Zhang [2004] NSWCCA 358; Matzick v R [2007] NSWCCA 92 and AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203; 225 A Crim R 481.
	
	
	In Dennis v R [2015] NSWCCA 297, a case which also involved a victim having his throat cut, Beech-Jones J (Johnson J and RS Hulme AJ agreeing) said:
	


“31   … A cut to the throat may inflict the same or similar physical harm as a cut to the leg, however a sentencing judge is entitled to treat the former as far more serious than the latter. Although not specifically referred to by the sentencing judge, s 21A(2)(ib) of the Sentencing Act specifies that it is an aggravating factor that “the offence involved a grave risk of death to another person or persons”.”


	
	Also relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending were the matters of aggravation identified by his Honour, i.e. the use of a knife, that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time and that the attack occurred in the victim’s home.
	
	
	A further difficulty for the applicant in making out this ground of appeal is that the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is a discretionary exercise which is classically within the role of the sentencing judge and which this Court will be slow to set aside. The categorisation of the objective seriousness of the offence is only reviewable on appeal on the principles set out in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. This was made clear in in Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 (Spigelman CJ at [37] and Simpson J at [46]).
	
	
	I have concluded that there was ample evidence before his Honour to justify his conclusion as to objective seriousness and that no error in his Honour’s exercise of discretion on this issue has been demonstrated. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2 – Lerve DCJ erred in not taking Mr Kiernan’s subjective evidence into account when determining the approach to take to his criminal history.


	
	The effect of the applicant’s submissions was not that his Honour did not take into account his subjective case but that he failed to properly take it into account when having regard to the effect to be given to the applicant’s criminal history. In support of that submission, the applicant relied upon the conclusions of his Honour as to the effect which he would give to his criminal history. They comprised the underlined portion of his Honour’s observations at [24] and [26] hereof. The applicant submitted that those conclusions involved error.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour also erred in dealing with the applicant’s criminal history and subjective case separately. He submitted that they should have been dealt with together. He submitted that had that been done, it would have been apparent to his Honour that the extraordinary circumstances of his childhood were such as to explain his history of violent offending and would have substantially reduced the weight to be given to his criminal history. While the applicant accepted that protection of the community would still remain a relevant factor, he disputed that the concepts of retribution and deterrence had any part to play in the sentencing process because of his extraordinary subjective case.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the depraved circumstances in which he grew up were reflected in his inability to make sensible behavioural decisions and reduced his moral culpability for his offending. He submitted that these matters had to be given appropriate weight and taken into account in mitigation (Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at [40], [42[ - [44]).
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his experiences as a child and as he developed, were relevant to the question of whether retribution and deterrence called for an increased sentence. He submitted that by isolating his subjective case from a consideration of his criminal history, his Honour effectively equated his life with that of the general population. This was despite the fact that his Honour elsewhere recognised that he had a compelling subjective case.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that had his Honour properly considered his subjective case, he would have concluded that it tended against retribution and general deterrence arising from his criminal history being given any weight in the sentencing process.
	


Consideration


	
	The extracts from his Honour’s judgment relied upon by the applicant, looked at in isolation, appear problematic. They do, however, need to be read in their proper context and by reference to the way in which the argument proceeded before his Honour in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	In the sentence proceedings counsel for the applicant submitted that because of the applicant’s strong subjective case, the only effect which his Honour should give to Veen (No 2) was to find that the applicant’s criminal history did not entitle him to any leniency (T.14.11.14 – p11.16-24). The passages on which the applicant relies involve a rejection of that proposition and indicate that his Honour was prepared to apply the principles in Veen (No 2) more broadly than was submitted by counsel for the applicant. When one looks at the whole of the judgment, and in particular the favourable findings made by his Honour in respect of the applicant’s subjective case, it is apparent that his Honour was not rejecting the applicant’s subjective case. What his Honour was doing was making it clear that despite the strength of the applicant’s subjective case, he still needed to give some effect to the considerations referred to in Veen (No 2). It is, however, fair to say that in relation to those passages relied upon by the applicant, his Honour could have expressed himself more felicitously.
	
	
	The difficulty which confronted his Honour was that identified by the plurality (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) in Veen v R (No 2) at [13] where their Honours said:
	


“13   … The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions. And so a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter. These effects may balance out, but consideration of the danger to society cannot lead to the imposition of a more severe penalty than would have been imposed if the offender had not been suffering from a mental abnormality. …”


	
	In this case one should read the reference to “mental abnormality” as a reference to the applicant’s deprived and depraved childhood and its effect on his subsequent conduct.
	
	
	Not only was his Honour conscious of the facts relating to the applicant’s childhood but he was well aware of the effect of that traumatic childhood on the applicant’s offending, both in relation to this particular case and in relation to his criminal history. It was for that reason that his Honour quoted with approval the principles set out in Kennedy v R and Millwood v R.
	
	
	As was conceded in the course of argument in this Court, the applicant’s criminal history, together with the effect on him of his deprived and abusive childhood, meant that his Honour had to take into account the protection of the community and to that extent, at least, Veen (No 2) had effect. Moreover, his Honour recognised that pursuant to s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the applicant’s previous “serious personal violence offences” had a part to play in the determination of the sentence ultimately imposed.
	
	
	It is also not accurate to say that his Honour considered the applicant’s criminal history separately from his subjective case. All that his Honour did was to consider those two topics sequentially before reaching a conclusion as to their combined effect.
	
	
	The complexity of sentencing repeat offenders with a background of profound social deprivation and dysfunction was explained in Bugmy v The Queen where the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ) said:
	


“44   Because the effects of profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending, it is right to speak of giving ""full weight"" to an offender's deprived background in every sentencing decision. However, this is not to suggest, as the appellant's submissions were apt to do, that an offender's deprived background has the same (mitigatory) relevance for all of the purposes of punishment. Giving weight to the conflicting purposes of punishment is what makes the exercise of the discretion so difficult. An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.

45   The point was made by Gleeson CJ in Engert in the context of explaining the significance of an offender's mental condition in sentencing:

""A moment's consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. That was the particular problem being examined by the court in the case of Veen (No 2). Again, in a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence, might, at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the offender.""

46   It does not advance the appellant's case to say, as he does, that the Court of Criminal Appeal was wrong to take into account general deterrence in concluding that Judge Lerve erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. Consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence must take account of the fact that this was an offence committed by a prisoner against an officer in a prison. These are the ""particular circumstances"" to which Hoeben JA was referring when he said that it appeared that Judge Lerve had given inadequate weight to general deterrence. An issue for determination on the remitter is whether the appellant's background of profound childhood deprivation allowed the weight that would ordinarily be given to personal and general deterrence to be moderated in favour of other purposes of punishment, including rehabilitation, to the extent that Judge Lerve allowed.”


	
	Significantly the plurality in Bugmy v The Queen did not talk in terms of concepts such as “general deterrence” having no effect in such circumstances but referred to those concepts being “moderated in favour of other purposes of punishment” depending upon the particular facts of the case.
	
	
	Contrary to the submissions of the applicant, this is precisely what his Honour did. His Honour comprehensively examined the applicant’s criminal history and concluded that the principles in Veen (No 2) should be given effect. His Honour also comprehensively examined the applicant’s subjective case and his findings made it clear that his Honour well understood that the effect of that subjective case was to moderate the weight that would ordinarily be given to personal and general deterrence.
	
	
	What his Honour did was to balance the competing considerations raised by the evidence before him and in the exercise of his discretion fix an appropriate sentence. No error has been identified in that process. Accordingly, this ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 3 – The sentence is manifestly excessive.


	
	The applicant acknowledged that the sentencing exercise required his Honour to take into account a number of factors unfavourable to him or which were neutral. He submitted that nevertheless the sentence ultimately imposed went beyond the bounds of a reasonable and just sentence, bearing in mind the objective and subjective circumstances referred to in the first two grounds of appeal. He submitted that any increase in the sentence on account of the Veen (No 2) findings should have been marginal.
	


Consideration


	
	When considering this ground of appeal it is not without significance that counsel for the applicant in the sentence proceedings submitted that imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years would be appropriate. Against that background, for this ground of appeal to succeed the applicant had to establish (in the absence of specific error) that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”. This is a difficult task in that discretionary error of the House v R type had to be established.
	
	
	On this issue, the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) said in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357:
	


“27   Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.”


	
	The applicant had to demonstrate that the length of the sentence was such that it may be inferred that there was some misapplication of principle in the sentencing process even though where and how was not apparent from the statement of the sentencing judge’s reasons (Wong v R [2001] HCA 64 ; 207 CLR 584; Hili v R; Jones v R). That this Court may have exercised the sentencing discretion differently is not the test: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665.) The question in respect of manifest excess is whether a sentence has been imposed that is above or below the range of sentences that could justly be imposed for the offence consistently with sentencing standards: Bugmy v The Queen.
	
	
	In this case there were some relevant guideposts. The offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm carries a maximum penalty of 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period are not mere formalities, but represent important guideposts created by the legislature for sentencing courts.
	
	
	Given the applicant’s failure to make out the first two grounds of appeal, and when all other factors are taken into account, in particular the balancing of such matters as the applicant’s criminal history, the objective seriousness of the offending and the applicant’s strong subjective case, it has not been established that a sentence of imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years was plainly unreasonable or unjust. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders which I propose are:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal be granted.

(2)   The appeal be dismissed.


	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

	HIS HONOUR: The offender has pleaded guilty to involvement in two conspiracies to import illicit drugs into Australia, the first over a period between 2001 and 2003 and the second between 2006 and 2008. In the course of the proceedings each criminal enterprise has been referred to by the name assigned to the investigation of it: Operation “Statice” for the first, and operation “Octans” for the second. In respect of each enterprise I have been supplied with detailed statements of undisputed facts. However, I have also been provided with helpful overviews of the facts, to which I shall refer for the purpose of these remarks, although it will be necessary later to go to some of the detail of the Statice matter.  
	


Statice – charges and facts


	
	In the Statice matter the offender pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiring to import into Australia a commercial quantity of MDMA, the drug commonly known as ecstasy. In the first count the offence, contrary to s 233B(1)(cb) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), is said to have occurred between about 1 July 2001 and 14 December 2001. In the second count the offence, expressed to be contrary to s 233(1)(b) of the Customs Act and s11.5 of the Criminal Code (Cth), is said to have occurred between 15 December 2001 and 14 March 2003. The two counts represent the same conspiracy but were necessary to reflect amendments to s 233B of the Customs Act which came into force on 15 December 2001. Each offence carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life.
	
	
	The offender also pleaded guilty to a third count: money laundering between 1 February and 31 December 2002, an offence contrary to s 81 (since repealed) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth) which carried a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years.
	
	
	The offender, who was born on 6 July 1958, holds British and Irish citizenship. Between 2001 and 2003, a Dutch based group, referred to in the proceedings as “The Haklander syndicate”, was responsible for international narcotics trafficking and money laundering activities. The syndicate and its associates were involved in the following activities;
	


(a)   importing large quantities of MDMA to Australia by packing the drugs in PVC pipes, which were in turn concealed in pallets of horticultural products;

(b)   obtaining delivery and possession of the consignment from a horticultural business, removing and disposing of “cover loads” that concealed the PVC pipes and then storing the pipes containing the MDMA in storage facility units;

(c)   collecting, counting and storing the cash proceeds of the enterprise; and

(d)   repatriating the cash proceedings overseas through money laundering schemes.


	
	During 2002 the offender visited Australia on a number of occasions in pursuance of these illegal activities. He also travelled to a number of overseas locations for the purpose of meeting senior syndicate members.
	
	
	Three separate shipments of MDMA, each not less than the commercial quantity under applicable Commonwealth law, were imported into Australia from the Netherlands in 2002, the first arriving on 28 January, the second on 30 July and the third on 16 December. The estimated total gross weight of the drug imported in the three shipments is in excess of 1.1 metric tonnes, comprising about five million tablets. The drugs had an approximate wholesale value of AUD $60 million and an approximate street value of AUD $200 million.
	
	
	Following these importations, the offender was involved in collecting and counting large amounts of cash on behalf of the syndicate, and sending those funds overseas. This conduct is subject of the money laundering offence.
	
	
	The offender was a trusted associate of senior Haklander syndicate members, including the syndicate head, Ronald Haklander. Although he was based in Europe, he travelled to Australia during the relevant period to execute and oversee different aspects of the importation enterprise. At first he performed this role personally, but after the first shipment of MDMA had been imported he recruited and directed two accomplices, Nicholas Loizou and James Kent, to assist in performing his role.
	
	
	His role included:
	


(a)   providing funds to syndicate members in Australia to meet their ongoing expenses arising from the importation, on behalf of the senior syndicate members in the Netherlands;

(b)   communicating and liaising with senior Dutch syndicate members overseas, including reporting back to them any matter that might endanger the enterprise;

(c)   directing some of the activities of other participants in respect of the receipt and storage of the imported drugs;

(d)   taking possession of the proceeds of the enterprise and counting and storing this money until it, or portion of it, could be sent to senior syndicate members; and

(e)   delivering the proceeds of the enterprise to those capable of laundering the money and repatriating it overseas.


	
	Put shortly, the money laundering offence involved the offender receiving large amounts of cash, the proceeds of the importations, and maintaining possession until it could be laundered and repatriated to senior syndicate members overseas. The offender, Mr Loizou or other syndicate members acting on his behalf collected, counted and delivered large amounts of cash to money launderers based in Melbourne and Sydney on an ongoing basis. The precise amount involved is not known, but it was at least AUD $3.55 million. In Sydney the offender dealt with a money launderer named Azees Ansari who, with his brother, conducted a money exchange business called “Exchange Point.” To this I shall return.
	
	
	The indictment in respect of the Statice matter and the detailed statement of facts are to be found in tabs 1 and 2 of exhibit B. They reveal the part played by Dutch syndicate members, Lex Erdtsieck, Mike Van Gelder and Marinus Van Tilbeurgh. Van Gelder and Van Tilbeurgh arrived after the first consignment and their role, particularly Van Tilbeurgh’s, was to supervise the activities of Erdtsieck. Erdtsieck and Van Gelder were involved in the handling of the second and third consignments, while Van Tilbeurgh’s task was more to assist the offender in the handling of money. The offender also had meetings in early 2002 with senior members of the syndicate, including Ronald Haklander, in Sydney and Bali.
	
	
	On 24 December 2002, Australian Federal Police officers executed a search warrant on a vehicle in Sylvania. They found 7 PVC cylinders containing a large quantity of MDMA tablets bearing a logo consistent with those being imported by the syndicate. The tablets weighed 235.5 kilograms (in round figures), and were found to have an average range of purity of about 39%. This led to the arrest of three men as a result of a police investigation, to which it will be necessary to refer later. Two days after the seizure Loizou left Australia, and on the following day Erdtsieck, Van Gelder and Van Tilbeurgh also left the country.
	
	
	The offender was arrested on 14 March 2003 in relation to related State charges, which were subsequently “no-billed” by the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions. Upon his arrest, he revealed to police that a large number of MDMA tablets were stored in a unit at Millers Self-Storage at Waterloo. A search of the unit recovered about 72 kilograms of the drug. To these matters also I shall return.
	
	
	The offender left Australia on 15 February 2004. On 31 May 2008, following a request by the Australian government, he was arrested in Bangkok by Thai police. He contested his extradition to Australia though the Thai court system, but on 26 October 2012 he was extradited in respect of these offences. It will be necessary later to examine the offender’s period of custody in Thailand.
	
	
	He has been in continuous custody since his arrest in Bangkok on 31 May 2008.
	


Octans - charge and facts


	
	In the Octans matter the offender pleaded guilty to conspiring to import into Australia a commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine, a border controlled precursor, intended for use in the manufacture of a controlled drug, methylamphetamine. The offence, contrary to s 307.11(1) and s 11.5 of the Criminal Code, is said to have occurred between 1 January 2006 and 2 June 2008. This offence carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The amount of pseudoephedrine the subject of the conspiracy was not less than 300kgs. Under the relevant Commonwealth law the applicable commercial quantity is 1.2kgs. This offence also involved the Haklander syndicate, with which the offender had a close association.
	
	
	The offender’s arrest for State offences in 2003, to which I have referred, was effected by police attached to the NSW Crime Commission. Following his arrest, he met Mark Standen, a senior investigator with the Crime Commission. In October of that year he became a registered informer for the Crime Commission, directly managed by Standen.
	
	
	Standen became a co-conspirator. During the period of the offending conduct he held the senior position of Assistant Director, Investigations at the Crime Commission. The Crime Commission was established to investigate illegal drug trafficking, organised and other crime, and to confiscate property derived from serious criminal activities. Standen’s duties involved the investigation of organised crime syndicates and the cultivation and management of police informants. At the relevant time he was an experienced narcotics investigator, with extensive knowledge and experience of police and customs methodology and complex narcotics investigations.
	
	
	Following the offender’s departure from Australia in February 2004, he maintained contact with Standen. Over time the relationship between the two men developed beyond an appropriate relationship between a law enforcement “handler” and his informer. Standen experienced severe financial difficulties, and from December 2005 the offender arranged for substantial sums of money to be paid to him.
	
	
	Some of those payments were made through another co-conspirator, Bakhos (Bill) Jalalaty, an Australian citizen who operated a business called BJ’s Fine Foods at Blacktown. Prior to the offence the business was legitimately involved in food importation and distribution. However, it had not been involved in the importation of container loads of goods. Standen had known Jalalaty for some years, and they became friends. Standen facilitated the introduction of Jalalaty to the offender.
	
	
	The three men were participants in the conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine from Pakistan into Australia. It also involved the participation of various members of the Netherlands based syndicate, together with their manufacturers and suppliers in Pakistan. The suppliers were responsible for the concealment of the pseudoephedrine in bags of rice to be shipped from Karachi to Sydney. Jalalaty’s food importing business was used as the importer and consignee of the shipments. To this end it was necessary for Jalalaty to expand his business to include the importation of containers of food products. This was funded with money sourced from the offender. The use of Jalalaty’s business was intended to provide a veneer of commercial legitimacy to the enterprise, so as to make detection by quarantine and customs authorities less likely.
	
	
	The offender played an organisational role in the importation. Here also, he was involved in funding the Australian side of the enterprise, to the tune of more than $1.7 million. He gave directions to Jalalaty throughout the relevant period about the way he should conduct himself in his dealings with other syndicate members and their Pakistani suppliers. The offender maintained direct contact with senior members of the Dutch syndicate. He also sought and obtained the assistance of Standen in managing and instructing Jalalaty, and by using his position as a very senior law enforcement officer to determine whether the importation had been detected and to minimise the risk of law enforcement action. The offender remained overseas for the period of the conspiracy, while Standen and Jalalaty were largely situated in Australia.
	
	
	While their roles were different, the offender and Standen were each principals in the conspiracy. They communicated with each other on terms of equality. Jalalaty’s position in the conspiracy was subordinate. Both the offender and Standen gave him instructions and sought to oversee his conduct.
	
	
	Negotiations for the importation of pseudoephedrine took place over 2007 and early 2008 between Netherlands based syndicate members and their Pakistani suppliers. Jalalaty, though his business, transferred funds into a bank account in Pakistan to pay for the shipments of rice, one of which was intended to contain pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	A test shipment of rice (without pseudoephedrine) was delivered to BJ’s Fine Foods in October 2007. This was sold by Jalalaty on instructions from the offender. The next shipment arrived on 26 April 2008. It contained about 18,000kgs of Basmati rice and was supposed to contain at least 300kgs of pseudoephedrine. It was offloaded, awaiting customs and quarantine clearance. There were significant administrative delays in obtaining customs clearance, mainly due to the unavailability of the original bill of lading. In May 2008, officers of the Australian Federal police inspected the contents of the shipping container, finding a large number of bags of rice but no pseudoephedrine. Why the drug was not there is unclear.
	
	
	On 23 May 2008, the original bill of lading arrived from Pakistan, permitting the container to be cleared. The offender and Standen advised Jalalaty about precautions which should be taken to minimise the risk of being detected by law enforcement authorities. On 28 May, the consignment was delivered to Jalalaty’s warehouse in Blacktown. After being notified of delivery, the offender sent coded emails to Jalalaty and Standen with instructions about what to do with the shipment.
	
	
	Around the end of May 2008, Dutch authorities began to arrest senior syndicate members in the Netherlands. The offender sent a coded email to Jalalaty reporting the arrest of those people and requesting he seek Standen’s advice about moving the consignment to a safe destination. Over the next days there were further communications between the conspirators, in which Jalalaty reported his unsuccessful attempts to locate the drugs and the offender asked Standen to help Jalalaty in this respect.
	
	
	During the course of the conspiracy, the offender met with Jalalaty overseas on a number of occasions and on one occasion with Jalalaty and Standen. He regularly communicated with Standen and Jalalaty through a form of covert email communication known as “hushmail”. Email accounts were created using a variety of nicknames and aliases. After an account was established, email messages were created and saved in the draft folder, which then could be accessed by the other users from any online computer. The offender accessed the emails from numerous overseas countries. Coded language was used in their communications.
	
	
	The Indictment in respect of the Octans matter and the detailed statement of facts are to be found in tabs 1 and 2 of exhibit A.
	
	
	Standen and Jalalaty were arrested and charged in Sydney on 2 June 2008. Both of them have been dealt with for their part of the conspiracy, and it will be necessary later to consider the sentences passed upon them.
	
	
	I have had the benefit of extensive reference to authority by the Crown and by counsel for the offender, Mr Dalton SC and Mr Williams. This dealt with relevant sentencing principles, including the approach to sentence for offences of this kind, together with reference to Pt 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and, in particular, s 16A. For the most part it will not be necessary to refer to the statutory provisions, which are familiar, or the authority, which is well established.
	


Objective gravity


	
	The objective gravity of both criminal enterprises, especially the Statice offences, hardly needs to be emphasised. The facts speak for themselves. As to the Statice matters, I have earlier referred to the estimated amount of MDMA the subject of the three importations. The Crown provided an estimate of the total amount of pure MDMA based upon the average purity of the tablets seized on 24 December 2002, arriving at a range of 200-410 kilograms. A detailed analysis by Mr Dalton’s junior, Mr Williams, arrived at a figure of about 246 kilograms. Neither process is easily absorbed by the mathematically challenged. I accept the Crown prosecutor’s submission that it is permissible to have regard to a range rather than a specific figure. I approach the matter upon the basis that the pure weight was at least 200 kilograms, a very substantial quantity, vastly in excess of the commercial quantity prescribed by Commonwealth law, 500 grams. I am satisfied that the offender was aware of the magnitude of each importation.
	
	
	The offender was not the progenitor of the enterprise, which was conceived and monitored by the Dutch syndicate. Nevertheless, he occupied a senior position, playing an organisational role at the Australian end. Plainly enough, his motive was profit which, no doubt, would have been commensurate with the large quantity of drug imported. The money laundering offence was also very serious. As the Crown prosecutor put it in written submissions, it was integral to the overall criminal enterprise and represents a form of criminality distinct from that involved in the importation conspiracy.
	
	
	The Octans offence, while not of the scale of the Statice enterprise, is also of considerable gravity. This is so even though no pseudoephedrine arrived in this country, perhaps the result of a measure of incompetence at some level of the enterprise. The offence had its origin in a corrupt relationship between the offender and a very senior law enforcement officer. It was a further serious episode of criminality, connected to the same Dutch syndicate which was the source of the Statice conspiracy. As recorded in the facts, the offender was a principal in the operation, on a par with Standen and senior to the position of Jalalaty. Here also, of course, his motive was financial gain.
	
	
	The “black market” value of 300 kilograms of pseudoephedrine at the time was about $12 million. Such a quantity could have yielded between 141 and 228 kilograms of methylamphetamine, of a value between $22 million and $41 million wholesale on the drug market. Again, the amount of pseudoephedrine is greatly in excess of the prescribed commercial quantity of 1.2 kilograms. Of course, the offender stands for sentence for a conspiracy to import the pseudoephedrine, and it is the value of that drug which is relevant in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	An important factor, and a valuable guide, in the determination of sentence for this offence is the sentence passed upon Standen. After a lengthy trial before James J, Standen was found guilty of the conspiracy, together with related offences of knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. I have been supplied with the remarks on sentence of James J which need not be examined in detail: R v Standen [2011] NSWSC 1422.
	
	
	His Honour considered Standen and the present offender to be principals at the same level of criminal responsibility, their role being greater than that of Jalalaty. Standen had no prior convictions and made out a generally favourable subjective case. However, an important consideration in sentencing him was his abuse of his position as a senior investigator. There was considerable overlap between the three offences, although his Honour saw some additional conduct in the supply offence which called for a sentence greater than that to be imposed for the importation conspiracy. For the supply offence Standen was sentenced to imprisonment for 22 years with a non-parole period of 16 years, for the importation conspiracy he was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 years with a non-parole period of 12 years, and for the conspiracy to pervert the course of justice to imprisonment for 3 ½ years. All sentences were to be served concurrently.
	
	
	Jalalaty pleaded guilty to the same conspiracy, and was also sentenced by James J: R v Bakhos Jalalaty [2010] NSWSC1561. After allowing him a combined discount “in the vicinity of 40%” for his plea of guilty and assistance he had rendered to the authorities, his Honour imposed a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.
	


Subjective case


	
	The offender is now 57 years old. He has a substantial criminal history in England for robbery, burglary and other offences of dishonesty, and has served terms of imprisonment. However, he has no prior convictions for drug offences.
	
	
	His background is sketched in a psychological report of Dr Mark Milic. It discloses a socially disadvantaged upbringing, and his movement in an anti-social milieu since his childhood. He first came to police attention early in his life. He has family in England, including two children from a marriage which has not endured. He has had gainful employment, and appears to have achieved some stability when he moved to Portugal, where for some years he ran a restaurant. He hopes to return to that country upon his release.
	
	
	He described to Dr Milic his experience of prison conditions in Thailand, to which I shall turn in a moment. He said that this had left him with ear and eye infections, and an enduring anxiety.
	
	
	Dr Milic completed his report with the observation that the offender “had a disadvantaged childhood and began to live a street-oriented rather than home-oriented lifestyle from an early age.” He “demonstrated talent at school and in work, but was not able to make the most of his abilities.” Dr Milic also observed that, as a result of his incarceration in Bangkok, the offender “developed generalised anxiety disorder, as described in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders”, that he also has “symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder”, and that his worries about chronic physical health problems “have delayed his recovery from his mental health condition.”
	
	
	An affidavit of the offender was read in which he recounted his experience of custody in Thailand. He described the conditions as “terrible.” He shared an unfurnished cell with a concrete floor with a large number of other prisoners. The toilet was an unscreened hole in the ground. They were normally locked in the cell for 14 hours a day. It was hot, and plagued by mosquitos and ants. Lights were kept on 24 hours a day, the entire complex was noisy and sleep deprivation was a major problem.
	
	
	At times he was ill, suffering from dysentery and infections in his eyes, ears and on his skin. He was able to buy antibiotics, but his access to a doctor was limited. He could buy his own food but, when it was not available, the food provided was substandard. He could buy a bottle of water but, if it was not available, he had to drink tap water which invariably made him sick. There was a shower in an open yard which hardly ever worked. It was necessary to wash in a communal trough, which was also used to wash plates and eating utensils.
	
	
	He was beaten on two occasions, and he saw other prisoners beaten for minor infractions of discipline. A number of prisoners were killed while he was there, one of them stabbed in front of him. There were also a number of attempted and successful suicides. There were no guards on duty at night.
	
	
	There was a period of several weeks when the whole of Bangkok was flooded, and water in the prison was at waist height and was fouled by sewage and pollution. When he was required to go to court, he was barefoot and was required to wear chains on his legs as well as handcuffs.
	
	
	This is sufficient to portray the conditions the offender faced. I have not referred to every detail of the affidavit, which is unchallenged.
	


Assistance


	
	When the offender was arrested on 14 March 2003, he was charged with 2 counts of supplying ecstasy in a commercial quantity (s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985) and 1 count of money laundering (s 73 of the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989). He had been under investigation since early 2002 by a joint taskforce comprised of NSW and Australian Federal police and the NSW Crime Commission. One of the storage units which he had hired for the Statice offences was at the premises of Rent-a-Space at Waterloo. On 4 March 2003, police executed a search warrant at that storage facility and found AUD $500,000 in a bag.
	
	
	At this time the offender was living in a unit at the Quay apartments in Sydney, which he and Loizou had rented in April 2002. A search of those premises revealed keys to two safety deposit boxes at the Martin Place branch of the Commonwealth Bank, in one of which was located AUD $30,000. On 10 March 2003, a telephone conversation between the offender and a Dutch syndicate member, Petrus Dekker, was intercepted. The conversation revealed a joint interest in the marketing of pills, and there was what police believed to be a coded reference by the offender to the $500,000 in the storage facility.
	
	
	There was evidence suggesting that by 12 March the offender was concerned that he was under police investigation. Ms Kirstie Chambers, a person engaged to clean the offender’s apartment and with whom he had social contact, told police that on 14 March the offender asked her to remove a number of items from the apartment and from a storage locker in the car park of the building. In particular, she was asked to remove a plastic bag which had been secreted in the car park and dispose of it. She did so, throwing it from the car park to a laneway below. The bag was located and was found to contain ecstasy tablets.
	


Past assistance - Statice


	
	It is the offender’s case that in 2003 he assisted authorities by the provision of information about the Statice enterprise and other criminal activity, which should be reflected by a reduction of the sentence which he might otherwise face in respect of the Statice charges. The provision of this information had been the basis of an application for a permanent stay of the Statice prosecution, which he later abandoned. I shall turn to that matter later. This issue of assistance is contentious, and was the subject of careful examination of a large volume of material. I have been assisted by helpful submissions on this aspect by counsel, and I am able to deal with it relatively briefly.
	
	
	Upon his arrest, the offender agreed to supply information to assist ongoing police investigations in exchange for later assistance for him at court. He revealed that he had a further large sum of money in a hotel room at Coogee, which the police had in any event intended to search as they had information from Ms Chambers that he had stayed there the previous night. A search was conducted, and about AUD $227,000 cash and about $15,000 in foreign currency was seized.
	
	
	After he appeared in court and bail was refused, the offender said that he was happy to continue discussions with police and the Crime Commission. I have already referred to the information he supplied concerning the MDMA tablets, part of the third consignment, at the Millers storage unit at Waterloo. He said that that unit was controlled by Loizou, as was the $500,000 at the Rent-a-Space premises.
	
	
	In the middle of March 2003, the offender provided further information in response to a Crime Commission summons. He provided details of the progress and methodology of the Statice enterprise, including the involvement of Erdtsieck, Van Gelder, Loizou, and Van Tilbeurgh (whom he knew only as “Mark”). He spoke generally of his long standing connection with the Dutch syndicate, its involvement in the manufacture of ecstasy and its interest in importing the drug into Australia. He revealed that what had been recovered from the December shipment was only a portion of it, and that there had been previous importations. However, he did not in terms disclose what he knew of the first and second consignments and his involvement in them. He also sought to convey that the role of Loizou in the enterprise was more senior than it was. In assessing the value of this information, it is necessary to have regard to what was already known to authorities through police investigations.
	
	
	Put shortly, apart from evidence relied upon for the State charges against the offender, it was known that he was part of a syndicate involved in the importation and supply of ecstasy in Australia, and Loizou, Erdtsieck and Van Gelder had also been identified as participants. In particular, in relation to the December consignment Erdtsieck’s use of a fictitious business name, “Rosa Nova”, as the consignee, and of the Millers storage facilities leased in that business name, had come to light. It was in the course of this police investigation that the search of the motor vehicle at Sylvania on 24 December 2002 was conducted and three men, Carl Hinke, Francis Ballis and Wayne Moore, were arrested.
	
	
	Investigations revealed that in the afternoon of 24 December 2002 material the subject of the December consignment was delivered to the Millers facility. A search conducted of two units in the facility in February 2003 located items consistent with the manner in which the ecstasy found in the car had been packaged.
	
	
	Accordingly, given the fruits of this investigation, the Crown prosecutor questioned the value of the information provided by the offender in March. Further, in addition to noting the fact that the money which the offender disclosed was in the hotel room in Coogee would almost certainly have been discovered by police, he argued that the same was true of the 72 kilograms of ecstasy found in the Millers Self-Storage unit. That unit was in the name of Loizou, who was known by police to be the offender’s “right hand man.” Moreover, it was very close to the units searched by police in February 2003 and which were understood to have been the location where material from the December shipment had been housed. The Crown prosecutor argued that, in the course of routine police work following that search, it was likely that a unit in the name of Loizou would also have been searched.
	
	
	From March and over the ensuing months until September 2003, the offender gave some further information relating to Van Tilbeurgh and to Haklander, whom he knew as “fat Ron”, and whom he described as being in charge of the syndicate and responsible for transporting drugs from the Netherlands to locations around the world. He also provided information about Mr Ansari’s money laundering operation.
	
	
	In October 2003, by which time he was at liberty on bail, the offender participated in a controlled operation, which he had suggested, directed to Mr Ansari’s activities. He initially told police that he had $1.5 million of syndicate money which could be used for that purpose. However, he said that Mr Ansari insisted that any transfers at that time would have to be in cash and that, of the $1.5 million, $1.1 million was readily accessible in that form. In the event, $300,000 was sent overseas, but it was successfully collected in Paris by a person unknown. As to the remaining $900.000, he said that he no longer had control of that money as he had been under significant pressure from the Dutch syndicate to return it. The operation was terminated, and it seems that no useful information was derived from it.
	
	
	In assessing the value of the offender’s assistance in relation to the Ansari money laundering operation, I received the evidence of a senior AFP officer, Detective Superintendent Benjamin McQuillan. He said that the information supplied by the offender about the Ansaris was already known to police, but at the time was not investigated because there was limited law enforcement focus on money laundering as an offence and there were higher operational priorities. He said, however, that the offender’s provision of information and his participation in the controlled operation constituted a significant factor, among others, in the decision to pursue an investigation. In the event, the Ansari brothers were convicted of money laundering offences (unrelated to the present offences) committed in late 2003, and those convictions were upheld on appeal: R v Ansari [2007] NSWCCA 204, 70 NSWLR 89.
	
	
	The offender also provided other information about criminal activities in which he had not been involved. Of most value was information concerning the importation into Australia of 157 kilograms of MDMA, which police were able to seize and which led to the arrest and conviction of two people. The Crown acknowledges that this was of significant benefit to Australian law enforcement. Otherwise, information in this category was assessed as of intelligence value only.
	
	
	There is no doubt that in providing this information the offender was acting out of self-interest. Information was supplied over a period as negotiations continued relating to the disposition of the charges he faced. The Crime Commission, at the instigation of Standen, made strong representations to the Director of Public Prosecutions to have bail granted and charges against him dropped. At the outset, it was said that he would plead guilty to the supply offences if the money laundering charge was dropped. The money laundering charge and one supply charge were dropped. However, it was conveyed that he would not plead guilty to the remaining supply charge but might plead guilty to a reduced charge. Further representations were made and ultimately, as Ms Chambers had become unavailable as a witness, the remaining supply charge was no billed in January 2004. The offender had been released on bail on 4 July 2003 and, as I have said, he left the country in February 2004.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor acknowledged that the information provided by the offender resulted in, or contributed to, significant seizures of drugs and investigations into serious criminal conduct. However, he noted that all of the information was in the form of criminal intelligence. At no stage did the offender provide a statement for use by prosecuting authorities or sign an undertaking to give evidence in any future prosecution. The Crown prosecutor argued that he had not given the authorities his full and frank co-operation, and that the information he provided was selective. He noted the offender’s omission to disclose the full extent of his involvement in, and knowledge of, the Statice importations, and what he described as his “selective assistance” in the money laundering controlled operation, by providing only a portion of the proceeds of crime to which he had access.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor also argued that the offender had received a substantial benefit for his assistance through the disposition of the State charges which he had faced. Rather than the usual recognition of his assistance by a reduction of sentence, he was effectively rewarded by the termination of the prosecution. He noted that the State charges were serious and that there appeared to be a strong Crown case. In the event of conviction, the offender would have faced a significant custodial sentence.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor further argued that the development of the offender’s corrupt relationship with Standen during this period, and his subsequent serious offending, overrode any benefit on sentence to which he might have been entitled as a result of his assistance. He submitted that it would be contrary to the public policy underlying the extension of leniency for assistance to the authorities to allow the offender any further benefit, given that his subsequent offending was the product of that corrupt relationship and was an abuse of the benefit he had received of gaining his liberty after the prosecution of the State charges was discontinued.
	
	
	In response to that last submission, Mr Dalton accepted that the offender’s assistance was born of self-interest, and that it was apparent from his subsequent offending that it did not demonstrate any element of remorse or any step towards rehabilitation. He submitted, however, that the pragmatic purpose of rewarding assistance on sentence, the encouragement of offenders to provide information about criminal activity, would be served by a measure of leniency.
	
	
	The fact that the offender was unwilling to provide formal statements or give evidence based upon the information he supplied was due to his fear, probably well founded, of reprisal by the Dutch syndicate. Nevertheless, Mr Dalton submitted that the information he supplied was significant and of considerable value. As to the Statice importations, while the information was of a general nature, it revealed the extent of the involvement of the Dutch syndicate and the scope of the enterprise. His information about Mr Ansari and his participation in the controlled operation contributed to a successful investigation of the Ansari brothers’ criminal dealings, and there was no denying the significance of his information concerning the importation of 157 kilograms of MDMA.
	
	
	Mr Dalton argued that the benefit the offender derived from the termination of the State prosecution was limited. He challenged the strength of the Crown case in that prosecution. He argued that the coded telephone conversation of 10 March 2003 did not necessarily refer to the $500,000 found in the storage facility and noted that, in any event, that facility was rented in the name of Loizou. He relied upon the unavailability of Ms Chambers, arguing that, even if s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 could have been brought into play, the Crown case was significantly weakened by her absence. He added that, if the prosecution had proceeded and the offender had pleaded guilty, he would have been unlikely to have received a sentence above the order of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 ½ years.
	
	
	The offender now faces sentence for the Statice offences. Effectively the only benefit he has received for his assistance, Mr Dalton argued, was his liberty from 4 July 2003, when he was released on bail, to 31 May 2008, when he was arrested in Thailand. Moreover, the period between July 2003 and January 2004, when the prosecution was terminated, was one of conditional liberty. If the Statice prosecution had proceeded following his arrest in March 2003, Mr Dalton argued, the criminality of the State offences would have been subsumed within the criminality alleged in that prosecution. The assistance the offender had afforded, he said, was such as might have earned him a discount of the order of 40%, a very substantial reduction. For example, if a sentence of 30 years was a starting point the discount would amount to 12 years.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, Mr Dalton submitted, some reduction of sentence on account of the offender’s assistance in 2003 is called for. I accept his argument that the offender’s subsequent conduct does not disentitle him from any reduction of sentence. However, the leniency it affords him can only be limited. His assistance was of value, but that value was attenuated by the considerations raised by the Crown prosecutor. I hesitate to assess the strength of the Crown case on the State charges, and I do consider that the termination of that prosecution was a benefit to the offender which should be taken into account on this issue. In assessing the measure of leniency, of course, regard must still be had to the need to impose a sentence which adequately reflects the offender’s criminality. For that reason it is also necessary to have regard to the Crown’s concession that the sentences for the two enterprises should be concurrent, a matter to which I shall turn later.
	
	
	There is a separate issue of recent assistance by the offender to be considered, but before doing so it is convenient to deal with the significance of his abandonment of the permanent stay application.
	


The stay application


	
	As the submissions of counsel developed, this aspect of the matter can be dealt with briefly.
	
	
	At an early stage of the proceedings in this Court the offender, then differently represented, filed an application for a permanent stay of the proceedings on the basis that to proceed with them would be unfair and an abuse of process. Put shortly, the application was based upon the fact that the information he had given to the Crime Commission about the Statice conspiracy had been provided on the basis that it would not be used against him, and that he would be given assistance with relation to bail and consideration of the narrowing of the charges brought against him.
	
	
	As I have said, he attended the Crime Commission in mid-March 2003 pursuant to a summons. At no stage was he informed of the protections under the relevant legislation, the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985, applicable to a hearing held by the Commission: in particular, s 13, requiring that such a hearing was to be held in private, and s 18B, providing that nothing said at such a hearing would be admissible against him in any subsequent proceedings. He was at the time charged with relevant offences, and considerations such as those examined in the line of authority including Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20, 253 CLR 455, arose.
	
	
	The information he provided was disseminated to police in this country and the Netherlands, and was available to them in the pursuit of their investigations.
	
	
	The AFP investigation into the Statice importations was re-instated in mid-2005, when authorities became aware of a possible corrupt relationship between the offender and Standen. As the investigation progressed, statements about the conspiracy, incriminating of the offender, were taken from Van Tilbeurgh and Erdtsieck in 2007, and from Loizou in 2009.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor submitted that the stay application would not have succeeded because the prosecution could have proceeded upon evidence independent of the offender’s admissions in the course of his discussions with the Crime Commission. Apart from the statements taken from the three co-conspirators, he pointed to the information produced by the police investigation prior to the offender’s arrest in March 2003 to which I have earlier referred. Significantly, he also relied upon the fact that Van Tilbeurgh initially contacted Dutch police on his own initiative between July and September 2003, and provided information about the syndicate and the Statice importations. The AFP was made aware of this approach in September 2003.
	
	
	It is unnecessary for present purposes to consider recent cases on stay applications in circumstances such as these. The crucial issue in the offender’s application would have been the extent to which the prosecution case was the product of the derivative use of information provided by him to the Crime Commission. Mr Dalton acknowledged that, in the light of Van Tilbeurgh’s early, unsolicited provision of information, the stay application might not have succeeded. He added, however, that it would have been open to the offender to explore in evidence the circumstances in which Van Tilbeurgh came forward, apart from an examination of the process of obtaining statements from Erdtsieck and Loizou, and that this would have been a process of some length and complexity.
	
	
	Alternatively, Mr Dalton argued that, at the very least the application might have led to a temporary stay of the proceedings so that a new prosecution team, from whom the information supplied by the offender was withheld, might be engaged. This would have involved further considerable delay and expense. Although not conceding that this alternative result would have been the outcome, the Crown prosecutor fairly acknowledged that it would be a reasonable argument.
	
	
	These opportunities, Mr Dalton said, were foregone by the offender when he abandoned the application. In so doing he facilitated the course of justice. The Crown prosecutor’s position was that minimal weight should be given to this matter, standing alone, and that it should be dealt with as an aspect of the assessment of the value of the pleas of guilty. I accept that it entitles the offender to a measure of leniency, albeit modest, but I agree that it should be taken into account in relation to the guilty pleas.
	


Recent assistance


	
	In the later part of 2015, after the offender had entered his pleas of guilty in the present proceedings, he provided further information to authorities in relation to alleged criminal activity between 2003 and 2006. This is the subject of two confidential exhibits. He signed a statement concerning these matters and undertook to give evidence about them if required. A senior law enforcement officer, Leo Lahey, gave evidence about this. It seems that the utility of this information is questionable but, in the light of the offender’s undertaking to provide continued assistance, its value has been assessed as medium. Mr Lahey’s evidence, however, was that, because of the offender’s dubious credibility, it was unlikely that any future assistance from him would be sought.
	
	
	The assistance provided so far by the offender merits some recognition in the sentences in respect of both criminal enterprises. However, I accept the Crown prosecutor’s observation about the piecemeal way in which the offender provided the information, revealed by the confidential exhibits, which again suggests an approach whereby he was bargaining for the extension of a benefit. I note the offender’s undertaking to provide further assistance but, in the light of Mr Lahey’s evidence, I do not consider that that warrants any further reduction of sentence.
	


Pleas of guilty


	
	The proceedings in this Court have had a long history, which I need not recount. The offender had been committed for trial in respect of both the Statice and the Octans matters, and his pleas of guilty were entered very late. It must be said that there was considerable delay at an early stage when the offender had different legal representation, and when little or nothing seems to have been done to advance the matter. When his present legal team came into the matter significant progress was made, and negotiations were pursued responsibly and as expeditiously as was reasonably possible.
	
	
	It is difficult to see any demonstration of remorse by the pleas. The Crown case in respect of both enterprises was strong, and it appears to me that pleas of guilty to the charges agreed upon were a recognition of the inevitable. Nevertheless, they demonstrate some willingness to facilitate the course of justice and, to adopt the parlance of New South Wales law, they have considerable utilitarian value. (On this I can see the force of the observations of Basten JA in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Gow [2015] NSWCCA 208 at [26]-[28], but this is not the occasion to pursue that issue.) The pleas of guilty averted what would otherwise have been two lengthy trials and, in the Statice matter, a substantial application for a permanent stay of the proceedings. This must be recognised in the sentences passed. I propose to specify a combined discount of sentence on account of the pleas and the offender’s assistance, the course adopted by James J in Jalalaty.
	
	
	I have difficulty with Mr Dalton’s submission that the offender should be entitled to greater leniency on the basis of an Ellis factor, that is, a disclosure to the Crime Commission of criminality which would be unlikely to have been otherwise discovered: R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, per Street CJ at 604. As noted above, while he disclosed aspects of the enterprise which might not then have been known by the police, he was already under suspicion in relation to it. Moreover, the information he provided was on the basis that it would not be used against him. The situation was very different from that considered in Ellis.
	


Other factors


	
	It is common ground that in relation to the Statice matters leniency should be extended to the offender because of the conditions of custody he endured in Thailand between his arrest on 31 May 2008 and his extradition on 26 October 2012, a period of about 4 years and 5 months. Mr Dalton submitted that this should be recognised by a significant reduction of the non-parole period as a proportion of the head sentence. Indeed, his position was that an allowance should be made for double the time that the offender spent in Thai custody. However, I accept the Crown prosecutor’s submission that it should be reflected in the overall sentence and that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to apply a mathematical formula. It is a matter of considerable significance, which has some bearing on the non-parole period but which should be also reflected in the head sentence, given that release at the expiration of the non-parole period is not guaranteed. True it is that the offender was incarcerated in Thailand as long as he was because he contested his extradition, but it was his right to do so.
	
	
	In relation to the Statice matters Mr Dalton also argued that the period the offender spent in custody in 2003 should be taken into account. I think that this is appropriate. It seems to me, and was fairly acknowledged by the Crown prosecutor, that the offences for which the offender was then in custody are sufficiently related to the criminality of the Statice matters to permit that course. That period of custody, from 14 March to 4 July 2003, amounts to 3 months and 20 days. But for that period, the sentences for the Statice offences would commence from the day the offender was arrested in Thailand, 31 May 2008. A further backdate of 3 months and 20 days would mean that they commence on 11 February 2008.
	
	
	Further as to the Statice matters, the Crown prosecutor submitted that there should be some accumulation of sentence for the money laundering offence upon the sentence for the conspiracy. I agree. I accept his submission that, while the money laundering is closely allied with the offender’s role in the importations, it represents a distinct form of criminality.
	
	
	That said, the Crown prosecutor fairly submitted that it would be appropriate for the sentence for the Octans conspiracy to be concurrent with the sentences for the Statice offences. He recognised that those offences are relatively stale, that the investigation of them did not recommence until 2005 and that there was, accordingly, significant delay in the prosecution of them. However, he added, correctly, that totality must be taken into account, so that the overall sentence is of sufficient severity to recognise the criminality of all the offences.
	
	
	I take into account the offender’s troubled upbringing which, no doubt, affords some explanation for his criminal history. He is now a mature man, facing a lengthy prison term. Nevertheless, in all the circumstances, any assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation must be guarded.
	


Sentencing


	
	Counsel have supplied me with a number of judgments and summaries of decisions on sentence for offences involving large scale drug importing. Some of these cases are included in the extensive review of sentences of this kind by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, 79 NSWLR 1. Some were after trial, others after pleas of guilty, and in some assistance to the authorities was a factor. They cover a lengthy period, from the 1990s to recent years, embracing cases before and after the repeal of s 16G of the Crimes Act (Cth). In some imprisonment for life was imposed, while the others demonstrate a considerable range of determinate sentences.
	
	
	Grave as the Statice conspiracy is, it does not call for the maximum sentence and the Crown prosecutor did not argue that it did.
	
	
	In relation to the Statice matter I was also supplied with the remarks on sentence of Wayne Moore, one of the men arrested in relation to the December shipment to whom I have earlier referred. On 2 September 2004 Kinchington DCJ sentenced him to imprisonment for 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years for the offence, also under s 233B of the Customs Act, of possession of a prohibited import, being a commercial quantity of MDMA. His Honour arrived at that sentence after a discount of 25% for that offender’s plea of guilty and co-operation with authorities. His Honour described Moore as a member of a syndicate involved in the importation into Australia of a commercial quantity of ecstasy, saying that, while he was not a principal in the organisation, he was a “senior and trusted member” of it.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor also supplied a schedule of sentencing decisions in money laundering cases. These cover a period relevant to the Statice offence, from the mid-1990s to 2004. I have had regard to all this sentencing material in determining the sentences which I must impose.
	
	
	As I have noted, the first 2 counts on the Statice indictment embrace the same conspiracy to import MDMA. In my view, the practical course is to pass the same sentence on each of them, to be served concurrently, that sentence representing the criminality of the conspiracy as a whole. I must assess a starting point of a sentence for the conspiracy and the money laundering offence, having regard to their objective gravity, to the offender’s background and antecedents and, particularly, to his experience in custody in Thailand. I must then reduce that to recognise his pleas of guilty and his assistance to the authorities. Mr Dalton realistically acknowledged that the starting point for the conspiracy could not be less than 30 years. I am of the view that, but for the Thai custody, it would need to be of the order of 35 years. The appropriate starting point, I find, is 32 years. I would discount that sentence for the plea of guilty and assistance by 30%, producing a figure, rounded off, of 22 ½ years.
	
	
	For the money laundering offence, again having regard to the Thai custody, my starting point would be 10 years. A 30% reduction produces a figure of 7 years. I shall accumulate that sentence upon the sentence for the conspiracy by 2 years. The aggregate sentence, then, is 24 ½ years. I shall set a non-parole period amounting to 65% of that figure which, again in round figures, is 16 years.
	
	
	In the Octans matter, I accept Mr Dalton’s submission that the appropriate starting point is imprisonment for 18 years, the term imposed upon Standen for that offence. While it is true that, unlike Standen, this offender has a criminal history and had been involved in previous serious drug offences, on the other hand, Standen’s abuse of his position as a senior law enforcement officer was a significant aggravating factor in his case. I would reduce that period by 20% in recognition of the offender’s plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities, resulting in a rounded off term of 14 ½ years. I shall fix a non-parole period of 10 years, and this sentence will be directed to be served concurrently with the sentences for the Statice matter.
	
	
	Accordingly, as to the Statice indictment, the offender is sentenced on each of the 1st and 2nd counts, conspiracy to import MDMA, to imprisonment for 22 ½ years, commencing on 11 February 2008 and expiring on 10 August 2030. On the 3rd count, money laundering, he is sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years, commencing on 11 August 2025 and expiring on 10 August 2032. I set a non-parole period of 16 years, commencing on 11 February 2008 and expiring on 10 February 2024.
	
	
	As to the Octans indictment, for the offence of conspiring to import pseudoephedrine the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for 14 ½ years, commencing on 11 February 2008 and expiring on 10 August 2022. I fix a non-parole period of 10 years, commencing on the 11 February 2008 and expiring on 10 February 2018.
	
	
	The offender will be eligible for release on parole on 10 February 2024.

2768774,In the matter of Reece George Barnes [2016] NSWSC 133,"Judgment


	
	On 18 December 2015, Reece George Barnes, who will be referred to in these remarks as ""the contemnor"", pleaded guilty before me to a charge laid orally against him on 13 October 2015 that on that date he was in contempt of the Supreme Court of New South Wales arising out of his wilful refusal to take the oath or make an affirmation when required to do so for the purpose of giving evidence in a criminal trial.
	
	
	The contemnor was charged with contempt of court under Pt 55, r 3(a) of the Supreme Court Rules. The proceedings were then adjourned from time to time; and in due course he appeared before me on 18 December 2015, on which occasion he was represented by Mr A Evers of counsel, who confirmed that his client had pleaded guilty to the offence and adhered to that plea. On the latter date I heard submissions by Ms B Baker of counsel, who appeared as amicus curiae, and Mr Evers on behalf of the contemnor.
	


Procedure in Appointment of Amicus


	
	Under the summary procedure for contempt where a contemnor is charged by the trial judge, the matter may proceed without the involvement of a prosecutor. I refer to European Asian Bank v Wentworth (1986) 5 NSWLR 445. It is accepted procedure that counsel may appear as amicus to assist the judge by way of adducing evidence and making submissions. Such procedure has been adopted in a number of cases, as noted by Ms Baker in her written submissions: Honourable Acting Justice Ireland v Russell (2001) NSWSC 468; In the matter of David James Ezold (2002) NSWSC 574; In the matter of Bauskis [2006] NSWSC 908; Trad v Pickles Auction Pty Ltd; In the matter of Carl Trad (2006) NSWSC 1177; Re Steven Smith [2015] NSWSC 832.
	


The Criminal Trial


	
	The contemnor and Chad Frederick Misiepo were both charged with offences arising out of the death of Peter Leslie Martyn on 1 January 2014 at Port Macquarie.
	
	
	Mr Martyn (“the deceased”) died as a result of three stab wounds to the chest inflicted on that date.
	
	
	The contemnor had been charged with the unlawful killing of the deceased, with an alternative charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On 9 September 2015, following a trial in Newcastle, he was acquitted of both charges.
	
	
	The contemnor's co-accused, Chad Frederick Misiepo, was charged with the murder of Mr Martyn on 1 January 2014. He was tried in a separate trial, before a jury, held in Coffs Harbour. He was acquitted of the charge of murder, but convicted of the manslaughter of Mr Martyn.
	
	
	The events that occurred during a Basha inquiry conducted on 13 October 2015, when the contemnor was called to give evidence, have conveniently been summarised in the written submissions of Ms Baker dated 17 December 2015. Mr Evers, at the hearing on 18 December 2015, accepted Ms Baker's written submissions as accurately recording those events: T 8. The account below concerning the relevant events, accordingly, draws upon paragraphs 7 to 16 of those submissions. In summary, the relevant events are as follows.
	
	
	On 13 October 2015 the contemnor was called by the Crown to give evidence on a Basha inquiry. At the outset of the inquiry, the contemnor was asked by the Court Officer whether he would take an oath or an affirmation. He replied “Neither. I don't wish to be here at all.” When I repeated the question as to whether he would take an oath or an affirmation, he repeated that answer.
	
	
	The contemnor was then warned that if he refused to take an oath or affirmation he ran the risk of placing himself in contempt of court. The transcript at pages 3 to 4 records the following:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Mr Barnes, if you refuse to take either an oath or affirmation you run the risk of placing yourself in contempt of court. And that can result in unfortunate consequences in terms of the criminal justice system being activated involving you for contempt. We don't want to get into a situation whereby that situation eventuates and I want to just put you on notice there so you don't jeopardise your own interests.

The position is that you are required by order of the Court to attend to give evidence in these proceedings.

I appreciate what you've said that you don't wish to give evidence but it's not a personal wish in these proceedings, it's a question of obligation by law that every citizen has. You understand what I'm saying?”


	
	The contemnor replied ""Yeah.""
	
	
	The transcript further records:
	


“HIS HONOUR: I just don't want you to be in the dark as to the consequences of you refusing to take an oath or affirmation. In fairness to you I want to put you on notice so that you don't get yourself into any difficulties. The first step, as I say, is to take either an oath or affirmation. If you refuse to do that, then you are starting to put yourself in jeopardy.

So Mr Barnes, the position is that you are required to do that and then we will take it to the next step.

Do you understand what I've said?

WITNESS: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Barnes, I'll ask you again. Do you take an oath or affirmation?

WITNESS: Neither. I refuse to participate.”


	
	As recorded in Ms Baker's submissions in paragraph 9, there was further discussion concerning whether the contemnor had obtained legal advice. The proceedings were adjourned to enable him to obtain legal advice. Further discussion on that matter, as set out in paragraph 9 of Ms Baker's submissions, took place.
	
	
	After the luncheon adjournment, Ms Manuell of Senior Counsel appeared and advised the Court that she had been instructed by the Legal Aid Commission to provide advice to the contemnor: T 14:35. The matter was again stood down to enable Ms Manuell to speak to him.
	
	
	Following this adjournment, Ms Manuell advised the Court that she had explained to the contemnor what contempt is, how a finding of contempt may be made by his refusal to take an oath, and that she had explained the consequences of a finding of contempt: T 16:5. Ms Manuell stated that the contemnor instructed her that, notwithstanding this advice, he did not wish to take an oath in the proceedings, or to participate any further.
	
	
	The following exchange then occurred: T 16:30 to T 17:10:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Yes. Mr Barnes, I adjourned this morning so that you would have the opportunity of considering the position, having heard what I said then, to reflect upon the position and obtain some legal advice. Very fortunately, you have the services of Ms Manuell SC this afternoon and, notwithstanding that, you still maintain the position whereby you will not take an oath or affirmation. I have indicated before the seriousness of that position, so far as the Court is concerned and so far as you personally are concerned. Notwithstanding that, your position is that you still maintain your refusal, is that right?

WITNESS: Yes.”


	
	The transcript then records the contemnor was informed that he left the Court with no alternative but to charge him with contempt, and the charge was then read to him. He was directed to make his defence to the charge of contempt.
	
	
	The transcript further records, as extracted in paragraph 12 of Ms Baker's submissions, that the contemnor was advised as follows:
	


“Notwithstanding the fact that you have had the benefit of legal advice this afternoon, I am going to afford you a further opportunity of preparing any defence that you wish to make to the charge and I am going to list those proceedings later this week. Insofar as you require legal advice or representation in relation to the charge of contempt of this Court, if you are unable to afford legal representation then Legal Aid may be available to you from the Legal Aid Commission. I propose, accordingly, to stand the contempt proceedings over to Thursday of this week.”


	
	Discussions then ensued as to the future listing of the contempt charge.
	
	
	The contempt matter was next before the Court on 22 October 2015. There was discussion then with counsel for the accused Misiepo as to Mr Barnes refusing to take oath in the presence of the jury.
	
	
	On 27 October 2015, the contemnor was called before the jury in the Misiepo trial. The following exchange occurred:
	


“HIS HONOUR

Q.   Sir, would you state your name?

A.   Reece Barnes.

Q.   Mr Barnes, you've been subpoenaed to give evidence, is that true?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I'll ask that you take an oath or affirmation as you choose for the purpose of giving evidence.

A.   Sorry, I can't do that.

Q.   When you say you can't do that, that means what?

A.   No.

Q.   That you are refusing to?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And are you indicating by that refusal that you are refusing to give evidence in this trial?

A.   Yes.”


	
	There was further discussion as set out in Ms Baker's submissions, and as noted in paragraph 16, the contemnor was not charged with contempt arising out of this second refusal to be sworn.
	


Evidence Tendered at the Sentence Hearing


	
	The evidence tendered at the sentence hearing was entirely documentary. Ms Baker tendered the following documents relating to the contemnor:
	


Exhibit A – Criminal History as at 12 October 2015. Bail Report

Exhibit B – New South Wales Department of Corrective Services Statement of conviction, sentences and appeals

Exhibit C – Inmate Profile Document dated 17 December 2015.


	
	Mr Evers tendered the following documents:
	


Exhibit 1 – Transcript of a recording between Detective Senior Constable Sanger and Reece Barnes dated 1 January 2014

Exhibit 2 – Transcript of the listening device recorded conversation between Mr Barnes and an unnamed person on 8 January 2014

Exhibit 3 – Transcript of conversation between Mr Barnes and ""Brendan"" 11 February 2014

Exhibit 4 – Recording of phone call with Mr Barnes' father on 12 February 2014

The Contemnor's Subjective Circumstances


	
	The contemnor was born on 9 December 1988. He was, accordingly, 26 years of age at the time of the subject offence.
	
	
	His criminal record contains a number of relatively minor offences, including driving offences on or about 31 October 2006. On 12 February 2014, he was charged with drug offences; namely, possess prohibited drug and supply of prohibited drug.
	
	
	On 12 February 2014, he was sentenced by the Port Macquarie District Court for the offence of supply prohibited drug to imprisonment for a period of 2 years commencing 28 April 2015 and concluding on 27 April 2017, with a non-parole period of 1 year commencing 28 April 2015 and concluding on 27 April 2016.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions did not proceed on the offence of possess prohibited drug.
	
	
	The contemnor did not give evidence in his trial, nor did he give evidence before me at the sentence hearing in respect of the contempt charge.
	
	
	In respect of the trial of Misiepo, the Crown case was that he, Misiepo, inflicted the three stab wounds on Mr Martyn which occurred outside a block of home units at Port Macquarie in the early hours of New Year's Day. Immediately before the attack on Mr Martyn, he and his partner, Megan Hill, arrived outside the home unit block, there having been an earlier incident involving Ms Hill. Soon after their arrival, Ms Hill and two other women identified as the Park sisters, who had been staying in the home unit block along with Mr Misiepo and the contemnor, commenced fighting. The Crown case was that Misiepo engaged in fighting Mr Martyn, during which he stabbed the deceased.
	


A Serious Class of Contempt


	
	It is well-established that contempt of court may fall into different categories with different levels of seriousness. In The Matter of Steven Smith (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1141, Wilson J observed:
	


“The authorities have identified different categories of contempt, being technical contempt, wilful contempt and contumacious contempt. The least serious category is that of technical contempt, whilst the most serious is contumacious contempt. This latter category encompasses acts of wilful and intentional defiance of the court's authority, such that the proper administration of justice is diminished.” (at [39])


	
	The contempt count against the contemnor in the present proceedings concerns his refusal to take an oath or affirmation preparatory to giving evidence in the proceedings against Chad Frederick Misiepo for the offence of murder. In this respect I note that the then accused, Misiepo, disputed that he was the person who stabbed Mr Martyn. Accordingly, a factual question arose in the trial as to whether the fatal stab wounds were inflicted by Misiepo or by another person. It was suggested to the jury by counsel for Misiepo in his closing address that on the evidence the jury should find that the contemnor, Mr Barnes, was the person who inflicted the fatal wound upon the deceased.
	


Sentencing Principles: The Offence of Contempt


	
	There is no maximum penalty prescribed by statute for the offence of contempt of court, it being a common law offence. Accordingly, the penalty for such an offence is at large.
	
	
	In accordance with the provisions of Pt 55, r 13 of the Supreme Court Rules, the court may impose a fine or a term of imprisonment.
	


(1)   Where the contemnor is not a corporation, the Court may punish contempt by committal to a correctional centre or fine or both.

(2)   …

(3)   The Court may make an order for punishment on terms, including a suspension of punishment or a suspension of punishment in the case the contemnor gives security in such manner and in such sum as the Court may approve for good behaviour and performs the terms of the security.”


	
	As observed in the matter of Steven Smith (No 2) to which I have referred, r 13 is a declaratory provision rather than being an exhaustive statement of the penalties that may be imposed: Wilson J's remarks at [38].
	


Factors Relevant to Sentence


	
	The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applies to the sentencing of persons convicted of contempt: Principal Registrar of Supreme Court (NSW) v Jando (2001) 53 NSWLR 257; 125 A Crim R 473 at [42]-[45]; R v Razzak [2006] NSWSC 1366; (2006) 166 A Crim R 132 at [42] per Johnson J.
	
	
	Accordingly, it is necessary that I consider the general sentencing principles enunciated in s 3A of that Act and the criteria set out in s 21A of that Act insofar as they have application to the present case.
	


The Objective Gravity of the Offence


	
	An assessment of the objective gravity of an offence of contempt has been an essential part of the sentencing process: Steven Smith (No 2) at [42]. As Wilson J observed in that case, the factors to be taken into account in making that assessment in relation to an offence of contempt were stated by Dunford J in Wood v Staunton (No 5) (1996) 86 A Crim R 183 at 185. His Honour there identified ten specific factors. They are:
	



	
	The seriousness of the contempt proved.
	
	
	Whether the contemnor was aware of the consequences to himself of what he did.
	
	
	The actual consequences of the contempt on the relevant trial or inquiry.
	
	
	Whether the contempt was committed in the context of serious crime.
	
	
	The reason for the contempt.
	
	
	Whether the contemnor has received any benefit by indicating an intention to give evidence.
	
	
	Whether there has been any apology or public expression of contrition.
	
	
	The character and antecedents of the contemnor.
	
	
	General and personal deterrence.
	
	
	Denunciation of the contempt.
	


(1) The Seriousness of the Contempt Proved,


	
	There is a long line of cases that have recognised and emphasised the serious nature of contempt of court by way of a refusal to be sworn or affirmed or to answer questions. In R v Razzak, at paragraph 39, Johnson J extracted dicta from a number of cases which supports the proposition that it is critical that the authority of the court is not subverted by conduct such as that with which the contemnor in the present proceedings has been charged. In Registrar of Court of Appeal v Raad (NSW Court of Appeal, 9 June 1992, unreported at p 14), the then President, Kirby P, emphasised that the class of contempt involving a wilful refusal to be sworn or affirmed or to answer questions undermines the rule of law in our society.
	
	
	In Smith v The Queen (1991) 25 NSWLR 1; 56 A Crim R 148, Mahoney JA observed at [23]:
	


“Conduct of this kind will not be deterred by admonition or by gesture: it is necessary that the punishment for it be direct, immediate and exemplary.”


	
	In Registrar of Court of Appeal v Gilbey (NSW Court of Appeal, 20 August 1991, unreported), the Court of Appeal stated (at 27):
	


“It may be accepted that if witnesses will not give evidence, the process of law enforcement will be less effective and more people will suffer accordingly. There is a public interest in ensuring that, in this regard, disobedience of the Law will be, and will seen to be, punished.”


	
	The contempt in this case was clearly a very serious one. In this case, and in a number of well-known authorities where a person with relevant evidence declines to give evidence, the contempt strikes at the heart of the system of the administration of justice. The contemnor was subpoenaed by the Crown to give evidence in the murder trial involving Misiepo but he persistently refused to cooperate in the trial process, resulting in its frustration in the way to which I shall refer.
	
	
	As I have stated, this contempt occurred in the course of a trial for the very serious charge of murder. The refusal to give evidence did, in my assessment, in the way in which I will shortly refer, have a real tendency to frustrate the administration of justice with respect to the trial in which he was subpoenaed to give evidence.
	
	
	The contemnor's refusal to be sworn or affirmed represented a global refusal by him to comply with his duty, having been subpoenaed by the Crown to give evidence to do so. Such a refusal may be regarded as striking at the heart of the system of the administration of justice.
	


(2) Whether the Contemnor Was Aware of the Consequences to Himself of What He Did


	
	As the summary of the events to which I have referred indicates, the contemnor was made aware of the potential consequences of his refusal to be sworn or affirmed and to give evidence.
	
	
	He was given the opportunity of considering his position and of obtaining legal advice. On 13 October 2015, as I have stated earlier, he had the benefit of the advice of very experienced Senior Counsel but again refused to take an oath or an affirmation.
	
	
	The proceedings were stood over so that he was given the opportunity of reconsidering his position and obtaining further legal advice, and yet he maintained his refusal to give evidence.
	


(3) The Actual Consequences of the Contempt of the Relevant Trial


	
	Submissions were made by Mr Evers on behalf of the contemnor that the refusal of the contemnor to give evidence did not have any real practical effect upon the trial.
	
	
	Ms Baker, on the other hand, in her oral submissions contended that the assertion made by Mr Evers on behalf of the contemnor as to the effect on the trial was ""somewhat speculative"": Submissions at T 19.
	
	
	In addition to relying upon Exhibits 1 to 4 inclusive, Mr Evers also relied upon particular extracts of the transcript from the trial of Misiepo as a basis for establishing, in his submission, that much of the evidence that could have been adduced from the contemnor was in fact adduced in other ways in the trial. In this respect he relied upon Exhibit 1 and portions of the transcript of Detective Senior Constable Halverson at T 429-432 and 439, T 520-521. Reference was also made to T 550-553 of the Crown Prosecutor's closing address.
	
	
	I have examined Exhibit 1 and the above portions of the transcript of the trial. Exhibit 1 is the transcript of an interview between Detective Senior Constable Sanger and the contemnor. In brief, the first reference of the transcript relates to police investigations at the home unit, including a statement attributed to Pania Park to police that ""Reece didn't kill him, he didn't do it"". The second transcript includes a reference to a note written by Misiepo said by the Crown at trial to have constituted evidence of an admission by him. The reference to the Crown Prosecutor's closing address relates to a segment where a reference was made by the Crown Prosecutor to evidence that the Crown pointed to as establishing Misiepo as the offender.
	
	
	Mr Evers also referred to evidence going, amongst other things, to the identification of the assailant given by Ms McKenzie and Mr Paine. Those witnesses were subject to fairly extensive cross-examination. The jury was required to carefully assess the accuracy of their observations of fast moving events from a distance.
	
	
	The contemnor's refusal to take an oath or affirmation, involving a deliberate refusal to discharge his obligation to do so, and to give evidence, occurring in the context of a trial for murder involved, in my view, an effective frustration of the administration of criminal justice in the way to which I shall refer. The contemnor's refusal was of particular significance to the trial in which the then accused charged with the offence of murder, now the offender Misiepo, was pursuing a defence based upon the proposition that he was not the stabber and that the jury should consider the contemnor as having been the person who inflicted the fatal stab wound to Mr Martyn.
	
	
	Whilst Detective Constable Rider gave evidence that the contemnor, when interviewed by him, denied having stabbed Mr Martyn, that does not, as Mr Evers argued, in my view, diminish the seriousness of the contempt. The contemnor stated in the presence of the jury, in effect, that he would not give evidence. The jury, of course, was left in the position of not knowing why he refused, though they were instructed that they should not speculate as to the reason or basis for his refusal. Plainly, the contemnor was, on the evidence, present in the vicinity of the attack on Mr Martyn when it occurred and he was therefore in a position to give evidence on the central issue; namely, whether it was Misiepo who inflicted the fatal stab wounds.
	
	
	The fact that Detective Constable Rider gave evidence at the trial as to the contemnor's denial of having stabbed Mr Martyn was, of course, evidence on that question of an entirely different character to sworn evidence that the contemnor was in a position to give. The jury was, of course, directed that caution was required in acting on Detective Rider's evidence of the above denial by the contemnor given that it was an unsworn out of court statement attributed to the contemnor that was not capable of being tested by cross-examination. I refer in that respect to the summing-up at page 74. When so considered, the contemnor's contempt conduct in refusing to give evidence had, in my view, a real tendency to frustrate the administration of criminal justice in the Misiepo trial, and it carried the serious potential of deflecting the jury from being in a position to effectively discharge its important function in determining the facts alleged by the prosecution on sworn eyewitness evidence.
	
	
	Whilst the Crown case relied upon a considerable amount of circumstantial evidence, some of which was referred to in the extracts in the transcript relied upon by Mr Evers, that does not, in my opinion, mitigate the fact that refusal by the contemnor, as a key witness, to give evidence placed a significant obstacle in the path of the jury's deliberations in determining the factual findings to be made in reliance upon circumstantial and other evidence.
	
	
	The fact that the jury ultimately was able, on the evidence, to arrive at a guilty verdict does not, in my assessment, reduce the seriousness of the contempt. The jury did not have available to it the contemnor's sworn evidence on the issue as to the stabbing of Mr Martyn to assist them in resolving issues concerning criminal liability as alleged in the proceedings. It may be readily inferred that the jury would have been troubled and concerned by the contemnor's unwillingness to give evidence from the witness box, the defence case being conducted on the basis to which I have earlier referred. A jury, of course, should in no circumstances be obstructed or hindered in any way by the deliberate refusal of a key witness to give evidence.
	
	
	Mr Evers placed much emphasis upon the fact that the evidence of witnesses such as Ms McKenzie and Mr Paine, and the circumstantial evidence as well as DNA evidence, enabled the Crown to construct its case, as I have already referred to. Whilst it is, of course, the case that the Crown was in a position to adduce evidence from a number of sources, nonetheless without sworn and tested evidence from the key witness I do not consider those matters are definitive on the issue presently under consideration.
	
	
	The jury's task of assessing the evidence in order for it to be satisfied to the requisite standard that the contemnor had not inflicted the fatal wound to Mr Martyn but that the offender Misiepo had done so, was, as I have stated, significantly obstructed by the contemnor's refusal to give evidence on what became the sole ground of defence. The fact that the jury deliberated for in excess of three days is, in the circumstances, understandable.
	
	
	As I have previously noted, not only was the contemnor given the opportunity to seek legal advice concerning his obligations and his refusal but he also had the benefit of advice from Ms Manuell SC who, it is plain, fully advised him of the consequences of his refusal to take an oath or an affirmation and give evidence. He was granted an adjournment in order to permit this to be done. Notwithstanding advice and being made aware of the position before he was charged, the contemnor maintained and continued his refusal to take an oath or affirmation or to participate in the proceedings.
	
	
	Accordingly, it is plain that the contemnor was well aware of the consequences of his actions in refusing to be sworn or affirmed on 13 October 2015.
	


(4) Whether the Contempt was Committed in the Context of Serious Crime


	
	As to the issue of whether the contempt was committed in the context of a serious crime, it is clear that the contempt was committed in the most serious context of a murder trial.
	


(5) The Reason for the Contempt


	
	The contemnor did not give evidence in the proceedings before this Court. The evidence contained in Exhibits 2, 3 and 4, being, respectively, the transcript of a listening device recording made on 8 January 2014, and the intercepted calls on 11 February 2014 between the contemnor and ""Brendan"", and an intercepted telephone call on 4 February 2014 between the contemnor and his father, provides some evidence of his determination not to divulge evidence to investigating police for fear of retribution. I am prepared to accept that the contemnor was influenced, at least in part, in his refusal to take an oath or an affirmation or to give evidence of a fear that there could be reprisals upon himself.
	
	
	It is accepted that although a subjective apprehension of danger is not sufficient to constitute duress, it may be taken into account in mitigation of penalty where a contemnor is guilty of contempt. I refer to the decisions in Wood v Galea (1997) 92 A Crim R 287 at 291, Trad v Pickles Auction Pty Limited, supra, at [16]; R v Razzak, supra, at [63].
	
	
	Accordingly, if the contemnor acted as he did by reason of a subjective fear, that is a matter capable of operating, as I have said, as a mitigating factor on sentence for contempt of court. As was noted in Razzak at [64], this principle is reflected in s 21A(3)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provides, as a mitigating factor on sentence, circumstances where ""the offender was acting under duress"". In Razzak, Johnson J observed that clearly the word ""duress"" in this provision relates to partial duress in the sense of subjective fears in accordance with the first leg stated in R v Aubusafiah, (1991) 24 NSWLR 531; 56 A Crim R 424.
	
	
	There is no evidence from the contemnor himself in these sentencing proceedings on this question other than the material to which reference was made by Mr Evers in his submissions contained in the exhibits in the proceedings, Exhibits 2, 3 and 4. I accept that the contemnor did have a concern or apprehension that if he disclosed information concerning the offender Misiepo's participation in the events leading to the death of Mr Martyn he could be the subject of reprisals. Accordingly, I accept that there was some measure of subjective fear in him at the time when he committed his contempt. I have, accordingly, taken this matter into account in determining the sentence to be imposed.
	


(6) Whether the Contemnor has Received any Benefit by Indicating an Intention to Give Evidence


	
	As to whether the contemnor received any benefit by indicating an intention to give evidence, that factor is not relevant in the present proceedings.
	


(7) Whether there was any Apology or Public Expression of Contrition


	
	There has been no apology offered by the contemnor, nor has there been any expression of contrition.
	
	
	In that respect I note that the contemnor, as I have stated, was given a further opportunity to reverse his refusal to give evidence when he was called to give evidence during the trial itself. Although he was not further charged with contempt on that occasion, this did represent a further opportunity for him to, in effect, purge his earlier contempt, but he did not do so.
	
	
	I have, of course, also taken into account the factors under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act insofar as they are relevant. In particular, I take into account the fact that the contemnor has pleaded guilty to the charge, a matter to which s 21A(3)(k) and s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act refers. Some limited utilitarian value, in my view, attaches to the plea. Such value is at the lower end of the scale that might be envisaged. It might be said there was some limited saving of court time by reason of the plea. In the circumstances, I consider a modest allowance only should be made for the plea of guilty in the circumstances of this case.
	


(8) The Character and Antecedents of the Contemnor


	
	As to the character and antecedents of the contemnor, I have previously referred to the fact that the contemnor is presently aged 27 years of age, 26 years at the time of the attack on Mr Martyn, and I have identified the evidence tendered by Mr Evers at the sentencing hearing. I have had regard to the other exhibits as to the contemnor's background. There is no other evidence by way of his background or personal information.
	


(9) General and Personal Deterrence

(10) Denunciation of the Contempt


	
	I turn to the issue of general and personal deterrence. Each of these matters, and the need for denunciation of the contempt, assume relevance in the present case. I consider there is a need in determining the appropriate punishment to take into account and to give effect to considerations of general and personal deterrence, and to denunciate the serious contempt by the contemnor.
	
	
	I have referred to the contemnor's criminal antecedents earlier. Whilst, as I have indicated, the contemnor's history of offending is limited, it is not a theoretical possibility, in my view, that at some future time the contemnor may find himself as a potential Crown witness with respect to some other crime. I do not, however, put this possibility at a high level. I bear in mind the absence of any expression of contrition or remorse as an important aspect in relation to the issue of personal deterrence.
	
	
	I consider that general deterrence is an important factor in determining sentence in the present case. It is well-accepted that persons who are called as witnesses in criminal proceedings must understand that significant consequences will flow from a refusal to be sworn or affirmed or to give evidence, referring in that respect, as I do, to Court of Appeal, Registrar v Gilbey (NSW Court of Appeal, 40172 of 1991, 20 August 1991, unreported). Johnson J in Razzak also observed at [78]:
	


“If witnesses will not give evidence, the process of law enforcement will be less effective and more people will suffer accordingly. There is a public interest in ensuring that in this regard, disobedience of the law will be, and will be seen to be, punished.”


	
	In Gilbey, supra, strong emphasis was placed by the court in that case upon the duty of citizens to give evidence in criminal trials.
	
	
	Johnson J in Razzak further observed at [81]-[82]:
	


“The response of the justice system to these circumstances must be to facilitate the giving of evidence by witnesses and to minimise the effects of intimidation. This can be done by various means, including the use of witness protection (for witnesses in the community), protective custody (for witnesses in custody) and the giving of evidence from a remote location by audio-visual link. Other protective measures are no doubt also available to the authorities.

In addition to these measures, however, it is important that the courts send a message that refusal by a witness to give evidence in criminal proceedings, through fear or otherwise, will not be treated lightly.”


	
	The operation of the principle of general deterrence in relation to contempt of the kind to which the contemnor has entered a guilty plea makes plain to future witnesses in criminal trials that a refusal to give evidence will be met by stern penalties, and for this purpose it is accepted that in order to vindicate the criminal justice system a meaningful sentence to denounce a contempt of this class should be considered. I refer in that respect to his Honour's observations in Razzak at [86].
	


Determination of Punishment


	
	I have given close consideration to the submissions that have been made on sentence. I have been referred to sentences imposed in other cases for contempt of the kind with which this case is concerned. Those cases refer to a wide range of sentencing outcomes. As has been observed, comparative cases do not so much provide ""any safe guide to the proper tariff or punishment for contempt of court. This is because both the nature of the contempt itself and its consequences vary so greatly in different cases"": Wood v Galea, supra, at 277 per Hunt CJ at CL. See also Registrar of Supreme Court (NSW) v Tran [2006] NSWSC 1183; 166 A Crim R 393 per Buddin J at [36]-[40].
	
	
	In the present case, notwithstanding the subjective features of the contemnor's case, I have come to the view that no penalty other than a full‑time custodial sentence should be imposed.
	
	
	I am mindful, of course, of the fact that the contemnor is currently serving a sentence. In determining sentence in respect of the charge of contempt of court, any sentence to be imposed must have regard to the terms of the sentence imposed in respect of the drug offences to which I have earlier referred.
	
	
	In determining sentence I have regard, firstly, to the non-parole and parole periods to which the contemnor is presently subject under the sentences imposed upon him by the Port Macquarie District Court for the supply of prohibited drug, being, as I have earlier stated, a sentence of 2 years imprisonment commencing 28 April 2015 and expiring 27 April 2017, with a non-parole period of 1 year commencing 28 April 2015 and concluding on 27 April 2016.
	
	
	Accordingly, under that sentence the contemnor will be eligible for parole on 27 April 2016.
	
	
	Section 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act contains provisions concerning the commencement of sentences. Section 47(2) is in the following terms:
	


“A court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment:

(a)   is taken to have commenced on the day occurring before the day on which the sentence is imposed, or

(b)   commences on a day occurring after the day on which the sentence is imposed, but only if the sentence is to be served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively) with some other sentence of imprisonment.”


	
	Section 47(2) is to be read in the light of s 47(4), which is in the following terms:
	


“The day specified in a direction under subsection (2)(b) must not be later than the day following the earliest day on which it appears (on the basis of information currently available to the court) that the offender:

(a)   will become entitled to be released from custody, or

(b)   will become eligible to be released on parole, having regard to any other sentence of imprisonment to which the offender is subject.”


	
	The provisions of s 47(2)(b) set out above, accordingly, are relevant to the present case.
	
	
	In determining the sentence to be imposed I take into account the following matters:
	



	
	The fact that the contemnor is presently serving a non-parole period under the sentence imposed by the District Court.
	
	
	The District Court in respect of that sentence made a finding of special circumstances in terms of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and varied the statutory ratio in respect of the non-parole and parole periods for that offence. The special circumstances included the assessed need for a longer period of supervision on parole.
	
	
	The head sentence imposed by the District Court for the drug supply offence was clearly an important aspect of the sentencing process undertaken by the District Court.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case there is a need:
	



	
	for the imposition of an appropriate non-parole period that gives effect to the principles of general deterrence.
	
	
	in imposing a sentence for the subject offence there is a need to avoid a sentence that defeats the purpose of the sentencing judge's decision in the District Court, which impliedly recognised the need for a 12 month parole period.
	



	
	It is, in my assessment, appropriate that a finding of special circumstances be made under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in respect of the sentence now to be imposed so as to vary the statutory ratio of the non-parole and parole periods. The basis for such a finding, as sought on behalf of the contemnor, and accepted in the submissions of Ms Baker, is the need for provision to be made in the sentencing for an appropriate accumulation and concurrency in respect of the District Court sentence and the sentence to be imposed. On that basis I do make a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The sentence which I will impose is to commence upon the expiry of the non-parole period for the sentence imposed by the District Court; namely, on 27 April 2016. It will include a non-parole period of 10 months, with a parole period of 12 months, which I note is consistent with the length of the parole period that was determined by the District Court in respect of the supply drug offence.
	
	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Reece George Barnes, in respect of the charge of contempt of court you are convicted.
	
	
	You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 1 year and 10 months to commence on 28 April 2016 and to expire on 27 February 2018, comprising a non-parole period of 10 months to commence on 28 April 2016 and to expire on 27 February 2017, with a parole period of 12 months to expire on 27 February 2018. The first date upon which you will be eligible for parole, accordingly, is on 28 February 2017.

		03 March 2016",2016-02-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768799,R v James Ian Longworth [2016] NSWDC 132,"Judgment


	
	Sometimes serious crimes are committed by good people. Often such cases involve car accidents. A driver has a momentary lapse of attention and someone else is killed or seriously injured. The driver may be an upright citizen who contributes to society but they then face a very serious charge involving the death or grievous bodily harm of a fellow citizen. That person in a short moment faces a prison sentence.
	
	
	This case is another example of such a crime. James Longworth has a host of character references confirming that he is a very decent man. But on the night of 6 September 2013 he encountered another very decent man. That man is Fred Taiba. He was doing his security job at a bar here in Sydney. James Longworth had been drinking a lot. He was not an aggressive drunk but the experienced Fred Taiba could see he was drunk enough to refuse him entry. James Longworth tried to talk his way in but Fred Taiba maintained his refusal. Then James Longworth did something completely out of character. He stepped away but then launched a heavy blow to Fred Taiba when he was engaged with other patrons. Fred Taiba had no idea it was coming. He fell to the hard floor and received a serious brain injury.
	
	
	James Longworth was arrested and charged with an assault occasioning grievous bodily harm committed with intent. As an alternative he was charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	The case came to trial before a jury in October last year. The jury returned a jury of not guilty of the first charge involving an intent but found James Longworth guilty of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	In accordance with the jury verdicts, and if I have not done so already, I acquit James Longworth of the more serious offence involving intent but I convict him of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	That crime is an offence against s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament regards the crime as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of ten years imprisonment to the crime. Not only that, Parliament has indicated that the crime should attract a standard non-parole period of four years.
	
	
	What I will do now is to briefly recount what happened which led to the crime. I will make reference to the evidence before me and to some of the issues I need to resolve in the sentence proceedings. I have already referred to what happened at the scene. What preceded that was a tragic family story. James Longworth was brought up in a stable and loving family. He was working overseas in London. Sadly his father suffered from cancer. James Longworth visited him around Easter 2013, he then went back to London. His plan was to return to say goodbye to his father once his father became close to death. However, the progress of his father’s disease was quicker than expected. His father deteriorated suddenly and died in June 2013. The deterioration was so sudden that James Longworth was not able to get home to say goodbye to his father. He got home for the funeral.
	
	
	The impact of his father’s death, of missing his father’s death and therefore not being able to say goodbye had a significant impact on James Longworth. There is plenty of evidence to that effect. James Longworth himself said as much. His mother gave evidence to that effect, as did his sister and his uncle. For some months he was at a loss. He was living at home with his mother and his sister and her partner. He was lethargic and disinterested in life. He did not engage in the community. Things were becoming tense in the family home. Finally, his uncle put him in touch with an agency that offered him a job. He was interviewed and secured the job. It was not a demanding job but nevertheless it meant he had to get up and be at work and engage in work.
	
	
	He had been doing that job for a couple of weeks when a further serious issue arose within the family. It became apparent that the ashes of James Longworth’s late father had been misplaced. In fact in the end, thankfully, they were located but for some days there was a state of uncertainty. This obviously upset Mrs Longworth. It equally obviously upset James Longworth. The news came a couple of days before the assault I have described. Enquiries were made by Mrs Longworth of the funeral directors. On the day of the assault, while he was at work, James Longworth found out that those enquiries had so far been fruitless. He headed home. It was a Friday night so he stopped for a drink and met some friends. They were in a bar in the city. They watched the Swans match on TV that night. James Longworth drank a lot of beer that night. He was very intoxicated.
	
	
	As I said, he was a quiet drunk and showed no signs of aggression until later on. He was with some mates watching the Swans. After the match they decided to kick on. They went to the bar where Fred Taiba worked. They tried to get in. Fred Taiba indicated that James Longworth was not sober enough to enter the bar. Obviously he was responsibly discharging his duties, not only to his employer but to members of the public who would attend the bar. There were discussions amongst the young men and Fred Taiba. That is apparent from the CCTV which I have viewed again. James Longworth made one or two attempts, it seems, to talk Fred Taiba out of his decision but Fred Taiba maintained his position and refused him entry. The men then stepped a few metres away outside the entrance to the bar. They were apparently talking among themselves deciding what to do next. Some of them started heading off.
	
	
	James Longworth was standing there. He looked at Fred Taiba and then, as I said, he launched a heavy blow to Fred Taiba’s head. At the time Fred Taiba was not facing James Longworth. He was turned away from him because he was talking to other patrons. James Longworth caught Fred Taiba completely by surprise. At least one witness said, “He fell like a tree”. He hit his head on the hard surface and was very seriously injured. James Longworth tried to run away but others caught up with him. He was arrested and charged and spent about three days in custody.
	
	
	I had before me, of course, the evidence that was called in the trial. In addition evidence was called in the sentence proceedings from Mrs Danielle Taiba, Fred Taiba’s wife. James Longworth himself gave evidence in the proceedings, as well as his sister Jacquelyn Longworth. The prosecution called Dr Yvonne Skinner, an experienced forensic psychiatrist. The defence called Dr Bruce Westmore, also an experienced forensic psychiatrist, as well as Mr Longworth’s treating psychologist, Sam Borenstein.
	
	
	I have reports from the various specialists who treated Fred Taiba. I have Mrs Taiba’s victim impact statement and photographs of him in hospital. I have from the defence a letter of apology from James Longworth, as well as a large number of references. The prosecution papers include a medical report from Dr Skinner and the defence exhibits include medical reports from Dr Westmore as well as Mr Borenstein. In addition there is affidavit material and, as I have already said, a large number of references.
	
	
	There were some issues which were debated in the sentence proceedings. I must record here, as I have already, how competently each party was represented. The Director of Public Prosecutions was represented by the Deputy Director, Mr John Pickering SC, and Mr Longworth was represented by Mr H Dhanji SC who was accompanied in the sentence proceedings by Ms C O’Neill. The trial and the sentence proceedings were conducted robustly, fairly and in a very helpful manner so far as I was concerned.
	
	
	The issues which became apparent in the sentence proceedings and which I should resolve are these. First there is a question of whether or not Mr Longworth could serve a prison sentence but not in full-time custody; examples are a suspended sentence or an intensive correction order. Sentencing legislation in New South Wales provides that a judge ought not to sentence an offender to prison unless the court is satisfied “having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate”: see s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. No sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate in this case and Mr Dhanji acknowledged as much. One of the issues in the case was whether that could be served other than by a full-time detention. That cannot be the case in my opinion. In order to fix a sentence which would be served in the community the gaol term itself would need to be two years or less. This is not a case which can attract a gaol term of two years or less. In due course I will sentence James Longworth to full-time custody.
	
	
	The next issue which I should resolve is whether or not the injury was in the upper reaches of grievous bodily harm. Mr Dhanji acknowledged that the injury was very serious and that Mr Taiba continues to suffer the ongoing effects as a result of the trauma but noted that he was assessed at making an excellent recovery considering the severity of the injury. On the other hand, Mr Pickering referred to the medical evidence and the victim impact statement which he said supported his argument that the injury sustained by Mr Taiba was in the upper reaches of grievous bodily harm. Mr Dhanji warned against accepting that any brain injury would necessarily be in the upper reaches and reminded me that grievous bodily harm necessarily starts with really serious bodily injury.
	
	
	I accept both of those submissions but the following features and consequences of the grievous bodily harm suffered by Mr Taiba place this injury, in my opinion, in the upper reaches of grievous bodily harm but, I acknowledge, falling short of a worst type of case.
	
	
	Mr Pickering referred me to the evidence of Dr Jonker, the neurosurgeon who operated on Mr Taiba. Dr Jonker noted that Mr Taiba’s coma scale was 7 when he was brought to hospital and that a CT scan “revealed a right sided subdural haematoma”. Dr Jonker told the court and the jury (at T18) that a coma figure of 8 or less is considered to be comatose. Dr Jonker described the surgery he had to undertake. It involved opening the side of Fred Taiba’s head to expose the brain and taking off the window that was overlying the meninges. He was worried about the severity of the injury which meant that the bone could not go back straightaway because the brain could swell further and there could be a secondary injury, so the window of bone was left out. It was necessary to leave the brain exposed for some time. This procedure occurred at St Vincent’s Hospital where Mr Taiba was admitted on 6 September 2013. On 16 October 2013 he was transferred to the neurosurgical ward at Liverpool Hospital and on 21 October 2013 transferred to the brain injury unit in that hospital. Then he had to return to St Vincent’s for the cranial reconstruction required because of the initial surgery leaving the brain exposed. That occurred on 31 October 2013.
	
	
	Mr Taiba did not go home until almost three months after the injury, namely on 29 September 2013.
	
	
	Mr Taiba was also treated by Dr Ahamed Beerabangsa. That doctor is a specialist in rehabilitation medicine. That doctor expressed the opinion that as a result of the assault Mr Taiba sustained a severe traumatic brain injury. Dr Beerabangsa went on to say that the injury “has resulted in skull fractures and a permanent brain injury”. The doctor said that the “brain injury was critical and life-threatening and required emergency cranial surgery”. The doctor went on to say that the “clinical findings, CT brain scan findings of extensive damage to the brain, the prolonged period of [posttraumatic amnesia] of 40 days, and the findings of the neuropsychological assessment all confirm the very severe nature of the brain injury he has sustained”. In a supplementary report Dr Beerabangsa said that Mr Taiba has “developed seizure episodes”.
	
	
	The medical evidence given by the doctors was supplemented by Mrs Taiba who gave an account of the impact which this injury and surgery has had on her husband in day‑to‑ day activities. She said (at T11) that “one minute he could be on one scale of the spectrum being happy and then the next second he could be on the bottom of the scale, angry or upset or sad. So in that split second he can change his personality, his temperament in that split-second. People, like if we go out somewhere and if I can see that he looks uncomfortable I need to withdraw from that situation as quickly as possible just so things don’t escalate. He has silent seizures, so we need to monitor that as well.”
	
	
	As I might have mistakenly said, it was not Mrs Taiba who gave a victim impact statement but Mr Taiba himself. Mrs Taiba gave the evidence that I have just quoted.
	
	
	In his victim impact statement Mr Taiba set out the ways in which “my life has been impacted”. It included an inability to work as a security officer to support his family, an inability to play the sports he used to play, an inability to play recreational sports with family and friends. He finds that he now has to take about 140 tablets “to manage seizures and ongoing medical issues” since the assault. He cannot drive because he does not yet have a clearance. That is because of his seizures. He thinks that if he cannot get his licence back he will need to find other work. He fears that if he loses his job he would be at high risk due to the severity of his brain injury and therefore an unattractive candidate to appoint. He cannot do “everyday household maintenance due to having seizures”. He pointed out that James Longworth’s attack “scarred me for life, from the front of my forehead around to the back of my head” and that the “scar is a constant reminder of what happened that night and will be with me till the day I die”.
	
	
	Returning to Mrs Taiba, she described the impact on her husband’s employment (at T12). She said that they “started off doing one day a week just to get him, catching a train on his own. So we had to catch a train with him to make sure he caught the train on his own, he felt safe. So we progressed from say month to month, say we do one day, then two days, then build it up to five days. He is not doing what he was doing before. He is doing lighter duties but he just wanted to get back to work”.
	
	
	I have little hesitation in light of that evidence comprising the medical evidence and the evidence given by Mr and Mrs Taiba that the injury sustained by him was within the upper reaches of grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	Another issue which was agitated by Mr Pickering and Mr Dhanji in the sentence proceedings was Mr Longworth’s mental condition of depression. Related was the significance of any contribution of that condition to his offending behaviour compared with the contribution of alcohol to his offending behaviour. I should explain how that issue arose and why there is a tension. Very many of the factors relevant for a judge to take into account when sentencing an offender are set out by Parliament in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 21A (5AA) provides that in “determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the self‑induced intoxication of the offender at the time the offence was committed is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor”. In this case, as I have said, Mr Longworth was very drunk, he acknowledged his drinking and its effect and there was scientific evidence called by the prosecution in the trial as to the likely high extent of his intoxication.
	
	
	On the other hand James Longworth had been depressed. The psychiatrists acknowledged as much. Arguably James Longworth was still depressed at the time of the offence. A mental health problem can be a mitigating factor for a judge to take into account in sentencing an offender. So Mr Pickering was arguing to reduce the significance of depression and he was arguing to attribute more significance to the alcohol. Mr Dhanji was arguing that his client’s depression remained a significant contributing factor despite the alcohol. As I have said, each of them called highly qualified forensic psychiatrists and, in addition, Mr Dhanji called his client’s treating psychologist Mr Borenstein.
	
	
	I should say at this point what the Court of Criminal Appeal has said about the significance of a mental health issue. In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 McClellan CJ at CL, as his Honour then was, made reference to the settled principles to be applied in sentencing where “an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems” (43 at [177]). His Honour said that the principles could be summarised as being relevant in the following ways where “the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way; the offender's moral culpability may be reduced”. His Honour added that the “need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence”. A mental health condition “may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed”. A mental illness or mental health condition “may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person”. Finally, such a condition “may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence”. A number of those were live issues in these sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	I have reviewed the helpful evidence of Dr Westmore, Mr Borenstein and Dr Skinner, and these are my findings. Dr Westmore did have an advantage in seeing Mr Longworth, although it was well after the event. Dr Skinner acknowledged that there could be some advantage in seeing a patient. Dr Skinner’s opinion was based upon reading other material. It was common ground that Mr Longworth suffered a major depressive disorder between the death of his father and returning to work a couple of weeks before the crime. That condition had improved enough for James Longworth to engage in undemanding employment but there was an exacerbation of his depression and grief on learning of the loss of his late father’s ashes. I accept Dr Westmore here, as well as Mr Borenstein. Dr Skinner acknowledged that such news had the potential to cause a setback. There was no evidence of any predisposition to violence in Mr Longworth and Dr Skinner accepts the significance of that history. Both doctors and Mr Borenstein agree about the contribution of alcohol in removing inhibitions and in acting impulsively in a case such as this. Mr Longworth’s drunkenness was clearly a contributing factor to what happened.
	
	
	Dr Skinner acknowledged on 29 January 2016 (at T54) that “the alcohol was a factor that made this person lose control, so that he acted on an emotion he would not have acted on had he not been drinking”. She agreed with the proposition that “depression can cause a reduction in frustration tolerance” and acknowledged that “depression might be a contributing factor” in the behaviour of Mr Longworth on the night.
	
	
	Dr Westmore expressed his opinion on the same day (at T23) in the following terms -
	


“It’s hard to isolate I think in any sensible percentage terms, how the alcohol affected him and how the depression affected him in that way. Because there’s a very unfortunate combination of things that occurred at that time, which resulted in his behaviour. I can’t really be more specific than that. We know that depression does obviously affect judgment, affect our capacity to assess our environment properly, as does alcohol. And we know that depression, certainly in males, depression and anger can be closely related clinically. So the fact that, I think it was an act of anger, the emotion of anger was present at the time and I think that anger arose from his depression primarily and the impulsiveness probably from the alcohol.”


	
	I accept on the balance of probabilities that the news of the loss of his late father’s ashes a day or two beforehand resulted in an exacerbation of James Longworth’s depression and grief. I accept that his mental condition of depression was a contributing factor to this crime, and therefore becomes a mitigating factor in accordance with the principles with which I have referred to. Mr Pickering acknowledged that there is an element of contribution which the depression can make but argued that it was not significant. At the same time Mr Longworth’s intoxication explains his behaviour but in no way mitigates it.
	
	
	There was another issue about the extent to which James Longworth knew about the consequences - the very serious and tragic consequences - that one punch to the head of an individual can have. He was cross‑examined about that by Mr Pickering during the trial (over T279 – 280). Mr Pickering asked him about “the phenomenon of one punch death”. He was asked what he thought would happen “if you struck someone in the head when they didn’t know that they were going to be struck with a forceful punch?” Mr Longworth said the he “didn’t know what to expect”. He went on to explain that he would not expect a serious consequence “from one punch”. He acknowledged that maybe multiple punches that somebody would be unconscious or severely injured, “but one punch, no” (T279). He was cross‑examined about watching boxing matches and maintained that he did not think that one punch could knock someone unconscious and cause such a serious injury.
	
	
	Here it is important to state a legal principle that binds me in resolving disputes. The prosecution asks me to find that Mr Longworth must have been aware of the impact of one punch. If he was aware, that would tend to aggravate the circumstances of the crime. In turn that means, according to the High Court, that I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before I reach that conclusion. Mr Longworth was cross‑examined on the issue. He maintained that he did not appreciate the possible consequences of the punch. Mr Dhanji reminded me that the jury verdicts did not necessarily involve the rejection of his client’s evidence. The jury found him not guilty of acting with intent. The fact that they found him guilty of reckless behaviour included turning his mind to the possibility of causing actual bodily harm but did not involve the jury considering the impact of alcohol - that was a legal component for the jury to take into account in their reason. That meant, Mr Dhanji argued, that I should not conclude that the jury rejected his client’s evidence. I think there is force in that argument. In addition, I have seen James Longworth give evidence. My impression is that he gives his evidence in a way consistent with trying to tell the truth as best as he recollects it. He did not give me the impression of being overly defensive or prevaricating in his answers.
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution that he understood the potential of a “one punch”.
	
	
	Next I turn to the punch itself. There was an issue here agitated between Mr Dhanji and Mr Pickering. Mr Pickering points out that Mr Longworth was refused service and then he waited for an opportunity to strike Fred Taiba while he was not looking. Mr Pickering argued that I could conclude from viewing the CCTV that Mr Longworth was waiting for his victim to be distracted and then launched his aggressive and violent punch. In other words, he argued that there was some degree of planning and that the punch itself was not instinctive.
	
	
	On the other hand Mr Dhanji invited me to look closely at the CCTV footage. He argued that there was no sufficient evidence of contemplation or calculation involved in what I could see. He invited me to look carefully, including the quality of the footage. He argued that the quality of the footage did not allow for the degree of accuracy for me to find what the prosecution says. I cannot conclude, he said, that it was a calculated process. He reminded me of the evidence of the turmoil in his client’s mind. In that moment there was significant turmoil caused by a range of factors.
	
	
	Once again, I need to be satisfied of Mr Pickering’s argument. I am not. I do not accept that there was a degree of planning or calculation before James Longworth punched Fred Taiba. However, at the same time the punch was not immediate and instinctive. There were a few seconds between his rejection and his punching Mr Taiba. At the same time I accept what Mr Pickering says, that when he punched Mr Taiba, Mr Taiba was not watching, he was in engaged with someone else. In other words, Mr Longworth’s punch hit Mr Taiba whilst he was distracted, so the act was not accompanied by planning or calculation but nor was it immediately spontaneous or instinctive.
	
	
	I need to add something now about what the Courts have been saying about this kind of crime. The Court of Criminal Appeal re-determined the sentence regarding the tragic killing of Thomas Kelly. That was, of course, a different kind of case because it resulted in the death of Mr Kelly. But the Court -comprising Bathurst CJ and Johnson and R A Hulme JJ said this in R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120; (2014) 243 A Crim R 31 at [216] -
	


“Secondly, the commission of offences of violence, including manslaughter, in the context of alcohol-fuelled conduct in a public street or public place is of great concern to the community, and calls for an emphatic sentencing response to give particular effect to the need for denunciation, punishment and general deterrence.”


	
	Their Honours went on to say in the following paragraph -
	


“General deterrence and retribution are elements that must assume greater importance when the crime in question is a serious one, has been committed in a particularly grave form and its contemporary prevalence is the cause of considerable community disquiet.”


	
	I acknowledge that their Honours were dealing with a case of manslaughter. The circumstances of the crime may have been marginally different so far as the attack was concerned. However, it is important to note their Honours’ reference to the “contemporary prevalence” of such a crime being “the cause of considerable community disquiet”.
	
	
	In sentencing another offender for the same kind of crime as I am sentencing James Longworth for, Judge Haesler SC made the following comments in R v Angelos (unreported, District Court of New South Wales, 4 October 2014) –
	


“Crimes of violence on public streets cause harm, not just to their immediate victims and the victims’ friends and family. They also caused disquiet and frustration among the general public. They break down the bonds that bind the community, bonds of mutual respect and care for others.”


	
	Finally, in Field v R [2015] NSWCCA 332, RA Hulme J, with whom Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreed, referred at [143] to the “clear need for sentences that will serve the community interest of deterring others from public acts of aggression that may, and in this case did, have tragically fatal consequences.” Fortunately for Mr Taiba, the consequences of James Longworth’s assault were not tragic in the sense of causing his death. However, they have made the very serious impact on his person and his personality in the ways that I have described.
	
	
	Finally, I should make some finding about the relevance of general deterrence. I have already referred to the authorities and it is clear that general deterrence - an important sentencing principle - looms large as very significant in this case. Mr Dhanji argued that his client was not “an angry drinking young man” and there was a fairly limited audience to which I could send the message of general deterrence in this case. He described that audience as people who were drunk and depressed but with no pre-existing notice of any violent tendencies. Mr Pickering acknowledges that there must be some allowance made for James Longworth’s depression but that the intoxication had a very significant role to play and being self‑induced was not relevant.
	
	
	In many cases there are likely to be underlying psychological or psychiatric factors - depression is one - but the crime remains one of alcohol - fuelled violence. That offence in this case is one of the kind that attracts general deterrence. This is not a case, in my opinion, where Mr Longworth’s mental health condition makes such a contribution that there should be a very significant reduction in the weight I put on general deterrence.
	
	
	Mr Dhanji referred to what the High Court had said in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [53]. Their Honours referred to the judgment of the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Mooney (unreported, 21 June 1978) and extracted the following “frequently cited” passage from the judgment of Young CJ at 5 -
	


“General deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.”


	
	That is why I propose to allow the depression to have some impact but because the depression acted in combination with the disinhibiting effect of the alcohol, the need for general deterrence remains very significant.
	
	
	There are some other factors that I should refer to here. I should record them because they are relevant to the sentence which I will impose. Both parties agree that, because Mr Longworth had very early offered to plead guilty to the offence that he was ultimately convicted of, he would be entitled to a discount of 25% on the sentence which I impose. That is in accordance with legal principle.
	
	
	Mr Longworth, after he was arrested, spent some three or so days in custody and I will backdate the sentence by some days to take that into account.
	
	
	Mr Longworth is aged 35.
	
	
	It is important to record certain mitigating factors which are relevant in his case and that I must take into account in accordance with s 21A of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Mr Longworth has no criminal record whatsoever. A person who is sentenced is entitled to call that into account when he or she is being sentenced for the first time.
	
	
	Mr Longworth is entitled to have taken into account his good character. People who have known him very well, some all his life, speak of him as a very decent human being. This offence was completely out of character; I accept that.
	
	
	In addition, the referees talk about his obvious remorse at what he has done. I myself accept that Mr Longworth is demonstrably remorseful for the offence that is he has committed and particularly for the impact that it has had on Mr Taiba and his family. In accordance with s 21A(3)(i) Mr Longworth has given evidence of his remorse. In addition he has accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledged the injury, loss and damage caused by what he did.
	
	
	Mr Longworth is unlikely to reoffend. That is obvious to me from the evidence that he gave but it is put beyond doubt by the evidence of Dr Westmore and Dr Skinner.
	
	
	Mr Longworth has very good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	On the other hand, there is an aggravating factor here that I must take into account. That is provided for in s 21A (2)(l) of the same Act. Mr Taiba in carrying out his job was “vulnerable”. That provision gives examples that include “the victim’s occupation”. Although they do not specify a security guard, examples include a public transport worker, a bank teller or a service station attendant. Mr Pickering emphasised in his submissions Mr Taiba was employed by his employer to protect members of the public. He was protecting patrons of the bar and anybody in the vicinity from the actions of people who may be intoxicated. He is by that very occupation in a vulnerable position. He was also doing a service to members of the public who wanted to enjoy their evening and their alcohol at quite a late stage of the night. That vulnerability is an aggravating factor in this case.
	
	
	There was some argument about the impact of the media coverage which this case has received. Mr Longworth gave evidence about the impact on him of that media coverage. It is the impact on him of course that is relevant. It was intense but it was not extreme. Mr Dhanji acknowledged that. He also acknowledged that the impact on the family is not relevant, just on Mr Longworth because it is what Courts regard as an additional form of punishment. But he acknowledged, and I agree, that it is not a determinative factor; it goes into the mix to be taken into account. In a sense if one commits a crime such as this, one must expect that. Nevertheless, it has had an additional impact on Mr Longworth.
	
	
	There was some reference to the delay in the case being heard between 2013 and 2015. That is not a factor to which I give any weight in favour of Mr Longworth. There was appropriately a committal proceeding and then the case came up for hearing and was heard when it was first listed.
	
	
	His moral culpability is reduced somewhat by his depression. I add “somewhat”.
	
	
	Specific deterrence is reduced to negligible because it is most unlikely that he will reoffend.
	
	
	It is relevant to observe that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily upon him. He will receive reduced attention from his personal GP and his psychologist but on the other hand he will receive treatment in the prison system if it is needed. He will receive appropriate attention. It may be that the attention he receives is not as great as he is receiving in the community. Mr Borenstein says as much but to my mind it is not a significant factor.
	
	
	I turn now to the sentence that I will impose on James Longworth. Bearing in mind the seriousness of the assault and the seriousness of the impact on its victim - being in the upper reaches as an example of grievous bodily harm - but on the other hand bearing in mind, as I am obliged to, the factors that are mitigating for Mr Longworth and that I have referred to, bearing in mind, as I must, the maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment and as an additional factor the standard non-parole period of four years, I regard an appropriate head sentence as being one of six years and six months imprisonment. However, Mr Longworth is entitled to the 25% discount that I have already referred to. That means that the appropriate sentence for him in my view is one of four years and ten months imprisonment.
	
	
	For a sentence of four years and ten months imprisonment the sentencing legislation envisages that a non-parole period would ordinarily be 75% of that head sentence. In this case that would be three years and seven months imprisonment. But a judge can reduce the non-parole period if there are special circumstances. Amongst the special circumstances Mr Dhanji outlined were that it would be harder for his client in custody because of the reduction in the treatment that he is receiving from Mr Borenstein. That has some impact, I accept. It will also be, for him, the very first time in custody. I regard those factors as relevant and I propose to reduce the non-parole period. But I also bear in mind that Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of four years for this offence. I regard an appropriate non-parole period as one of three years imprisonment.
	


HIS HONOUR:   James Longworth, I am going to sentence you now, if you would stand up please.


	
	I sentence you to four years and ten months imprisonment. I will backdate it to commence on 14 February 2016. It will therefore expire on 13 December 2020. I fix a non-parole period of three years that will commence on 14 February 2016 and it will expire on 13 February 2019. The first date on which you will be eligible for parole is 13 February 2019. Whether you get parole or not is a matter for the Parole Authority.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Have a seat for a moment, Mr Longworth. Ms Anderson and Mr Gibson, two things: perhaps first for Mr Gibson, the prison authorities make it clear that psychological and psychiatric reports about prisoners are very helpful in the assessment process. Do you have instructions, and my associate sends them.

GIBSON: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: We got Dr Westmore and Mr Borenstein.

GIBSON: I’d ask that they go.

HIS HONOUR: Both of them. Do you want Dr Skinner included or not?

GIBSON: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: No. Good.

GIBSON: In addition, your Honour, I’ve got a letter from Mr Longworth’s doctor which just outlines his current medication which may be of assistance to authorities?

HIS HONOUR: Would you like that to be sent as well?

GIBSON: I’d like that to go with the warrant, yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. With the warrant today. What we will do, I will ask the court officer just to go and do a photocopy.

GIBSON: I’ve got copies if you want?

HIS HONOUR: You’ve got copies?

GIBSON: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Done. Good. I’ll take that. Thank you.

EXHIBIT #S5 LETTER PREPARED BY DOCTOR TENDERED, ADMITTED WITHOUT OBJECTION

A photocopy should be given to your client for him to take into custody and I will give the copy here to my associate who will include it in her fax or email to the Corrective Services which includes, Mr Borenstein and Dr Westmore, so three things.

GIBSON: Thank you, your Honour. Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Gibson, anything else? I was just going to ask whether there’s any factual or legal matters which could be dealt with now.

GIBSON: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I think the figures are correct.

GIBSON: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Anderson.

ANDERSON: Just one further--

HIS HONOUR: I am going to ask you in a minute about backup charges.

ANDERSON: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: First, are there any factual or legal matters that need to be attended to?

ANDERSON: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And the figures I think are correct.

ANDERSON: They are, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: My associate has reminded me there is a backup of assault occasioning actual bodily harm withdrawn and what do you propose?

ANDERSON: I’d ask you to withdraw and dismiss that charge.


	
	So you withdraw that charge and I dismiss it.
	


ANDERSON: Thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thanks, Ms Anderson. Mr Longworth, it might be a matter if you want to stay here for a few moments with your family, is that okay with you gentlemen, just two or three minutes? Mr Longworth has posed absolutely no security risk that I know. That’s a matter for you, not for me, but if you want just a few minutes with your family that’s okay with me. If you want some privacy you might go into the dock and they can be there with you in front of the dock and talk to you but I will leave that management to you and to the Corrective Services.

HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else, Mr Gibson and Ms Anderson?

GIBSON: No, your Honour.

ANDERSON: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you.

		12 July 2016",2016-02-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768801,Nand v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2016] NSWSC 85,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By summons filed on 17 December 2014 the plaintiff sought relief, including the following, in respect of his conviction for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm which was entered in the Local Court following his plea of guilty on 30 July 2013:
	



	
	An order under s 53(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), and an associated grant of leave and an extension of time under r 51B.6(2)(a) of the Supreme Court Rules 1970; and
	
	
	An order under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) and an extension of time under Pt 59.10(2) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
	



	
	At the hearing of the summons on 15 February 2016, Mr Wendler, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, no longer pressed the relief under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act. Accordingly it is not necessary to consider it further. The plaintiff’s sole remaining challenge is that his plea of guilty in the Local Court was not valid as it did not comply with s 192 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). I accept the contention of Ms Davidson, who appeared on behalf of the first defendant, that this question was one of mixed law and fact since it involved the application of a statutory provision to relevant facts: JP v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2015] NSWSC 1669 at [47]-[49] (Beech-Jones J). Mr Wendler made no submissions to the contrary. Accordingly, leave to appeal is required.
	
	
	As the summons was filed more than 28 days after the material date (30 July 2013), an extension of time is also required.
	
	
	The defendants are:
	



	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (the first defendant, or the DPP);
	
	
	The Local Court of New South Wales (the second defendant);
	
	
	The District Court of New South Wales (the third defendant).
	



	
	The second and third defendants have filed submitting appearances.
	
	
	The plaintiff appealed to the District Court against his conviction and sentence. Although the facts surrounding his appeal and their determination do not strictly arise, it is necessary to include relevant statutory provisions and a summary of what occurred by reason of the issues raised as to whether an Anshun estoppel (named after Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (No. 1) (1980) 147 CLR 35) arises against the plaintiff or whether the principle in Wishart v Fraser (1941) 64 CLR 470 affects my jurisdiction to hear the appeal or is otherwise material to the discretion whether to extend time or grant leave.
	


Relevant legislative provisions

Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)


	
	The Crimes Act relevantly provides:
	


“59 Assault occasioning actual bodily harm

(1) Whosoever assaults any person, and thereby occasions actual bodily harm, shall be liable to imprisonment for five years.

. . .

61 Common assault prosecuted by indictment

Whosoever assaults any person, although not occasioning actual bodily harm, shall be liable to imprisonment for two years.”

Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW)


	
	The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act relevantly provides for an appeal from the Local Court to the District Court as of right against a sentence (s 11) and an appeal with leave against a conviction following a plea of guilty (s 12). An appeal must be lodged within 28 days. There is provision for an extension which is subject to the statutory limit of three months for the lodgment of an appeal or leave application (s 13). Sections 17 and 18 provide respectively that appeals against sentence and conviction are to be by way of rehearing. Section 20 provides for the orders that may be made by the District Court when determining appeals against conviction and sentence.
	
	
	Section 29 limits the circumstances in which a person may appeal both to the District Court and to this Court. It relevantly provides:
	


“29 Limits on appeals

(1) No appeal may be made to the District Court under this Part against a decision of the Local Court:

. . .

(c) that is or has previously been the subject of an appeal or application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court under Part 5.

(2) Subsection (1) (c) does not prevent a person who has made an appeal or application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court under Part 5 from making an appeal or application for leave to appeal to the District Court under this Part if:

(a) the Supreme Court has remitted the matter on appeal to the Local Court for redetermination, and the Local Court has redetermined the matter, or

(b) the Supreme Court has refused leave to appeal in relation to an appeal made on a ground of mixed law and fact.”


	
	Section 53(1), which concerns appeals to this Court, relevantly provides:
	


“53 Appeals requiring leave

(1) Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court . . . may appeal to the Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence on a ground that involves:

(a) a question of fact, or

(b) a question of mixed law and fact,

but only by leave of the Supreme Court.”


	
	An application for leave to appeal to this Court must be filed within 28 days after the “material date”, or within such further time as the Court may fix: Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW), Pt 51B, r 5(3) and (5). The “material date” is relevantly the date on which the order is pronounced or given: SCR, Pt 51B r 3.
	


Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW)


	
	The Criminal Procedure Act makes provision both for summary hearings and trials on indictment. Section 3(1), which is contained in Ch 1 (headed “Preliminary”), defines “accused person” as follows:
	


“(1) In this Act, except in so far as the context or subject-matter otherwise indicates or requires:

accused person includes, in relation to summary offences, a defendant and, in relation to all offences (where the subject-matter or context allows or requires), an Australian legal practitioner representing an accused person.”


	
	Chapter 2, headed “General Provisions”, makes provision for offences that must be tried summarily; those that must be tried on indictment; and those which may be dealt with either summarily or on indictment. It was common ground that the offence with which the plaintiff was charged and to which he pleaded was in the third category: namely, an indictable offence which may be dealt with summarily.
	
	
	Part 3 of Chapter 2, entitled “Criminal proceedings generally”, contains the following provisions:
	


“36 Representation and appearance

(1) A prosecutor or accused person may appear personally or by an Australian legal practitioner or other person empowered by an Act or other law to appear for the prosecutor or accused person.

. . .

37 Conduct of case

. . .

(2) The accused person's case may be conducted by the accused person or by the accused person's Australian legal practitioner or any other person permitted to appear for the accused person (whether under this or any other Act).”


	
	Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act, entitled “Indictable procedure”, makes provision for pleas of guilty for offences which are dealt with on indictment. Sections 99-102, which are contained in Division 5 (entitled “Procedure if accused person pleads guilty”), make provision for a plea of guilty at committal proceedings. Sections 154 and 155, which are contained in Division 5 (entitled “Pleadings on trial”), make provision for a plea on arraignment. These sections, which are to be distinguished from those governing pleas at earlier stages, provide:
	


“154 Plea of “not guilty”

If an accused person arraigned on an indictment pleads “not guilty”, the accused person is taken to have put himself or herself on the country for trial, and the court is to order a jury for trial accordingly.

155 Refusal to plead

If an accused person who is arraigned stands mute, or will not answer directly to the indictment, the court may order a plea of “not guilty” to be entered on behalf of the accused person, and the plea so entered has the same effect as if the accused person had actually pleaded ‘not guilty’.”


	
	Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act, entitled “Summary procedure”, contains s 170(1), which provides:
	


“(1) This Chapter applies to or in respect of proceedings for summary offences, including proceedings for indictable offences that are being dealt with summarily.”


	
	Division 2 of Chapter 4, entitled “Pre-trial procedures”, contains the following provisions:
	


“182 Written pleas

(1) An accused person served with a court attendance notice may lodge with the registrar a notice in writing that the accused person will plead guilty or not guilty to the offence or offences the subject of the court attendance notice concerned.

(2) The notice is to be in the form prescribed by the rules and, in the case of a guilty plea, may be accompanied by additional written material containing matters in mitigation of the offence.

(3) An accused person who lodges a notice under this section with the registrar not later than 7 days before the date on which the person is required to first attend before the Local Court:

(a) is not required to attend the Court on that date, and

(b) is taken to have attended the Court on that date.

(4) This section does not apply to an accused person who has been granted or refused bail or in relation to whom bail has been dispensed with.”


	
	Division 3 of Chapter 4, entitled “Hearings” contains the following provisions:
	


“192 Procedures where both parties present

(1) If both the accused person and the prosecutor are present at the day, time and place set for the hearing and determination of proceedings for an offence (including a day to which the hearing has been adjourned) the court must proceed to hear and determine the matter.

(2) The court must state the substance of the offence to the accused person and ask the accused person if the accused person pleads guilty or not guilty.

. . .

193 Procedure if offence admitted

(1) If the accused person pleads guilty, and does not show sufficient cause why he or she should not be convicted or not have an order made against him or her, the court must convict the accused person or make the order accordingly.

. . .”

Background facts


	
	On 24 July 2013 the plaintiff was arrested and charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) alleged to have occurred on 23 July 2013. There was also a back-up charge of common assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act. Unlike the principal charge, the back-up charge did not require proof of actual bodily harm. The plaintiff was served with a Court Attendance Notice (CAN) which required his attendance at the Campbelltown Local Court on 30 July 2013.
	
	
	The CAN set out the “Details of Offence/s” as follows:

	When the matter was called, Ms Carr, a Legal Aid solicitor, announced her appearance on behalf of the plaintiff and informed Magistrate Walsh that the plaintiff pleaded guilty to sequence 1 (the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm). The Magistrate confirmed with the Prosecutor (Sergeant Billet) that sequence 2 was to be withdrawn and dismissed on the basis of acceptance of the plea.
	
	
	Because of the importance of the issue, it is desirable to set out in full the relevant part of the transcript on which the DPP relied in this Court to establish compliance with s 192 of the Criminal Procedure Act:
	


“CARR: I note the time, but perhaps if I could just raise one issue with your Honour. The matter of Nand—

HIS HONOUR: Yes? Yes Ms Carr?

CARR: Is a plea of guilty.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

CARR: I anticipate the common assault is a backup offence to the actual bodily harm charge--   

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

CARR: --it might be appropriate for your Honour to at the very least, briefly peruse the facts, my client has no previous criminal history but your Honour might be assisted from a duty report from probation and parole--   

HIS HONOUR: All right, so it’s a plea to sequence 1—

CARR: It is.

HIS HONOUR: --sequence 2 to be withdrawn and dismissed on the basis of the acceptance of the plea.

PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour. . .”


	
	Ms Carr referred the Magistrate to the pre-sentence report which indicated that the plaintiff was suitable for supervision and also for a community service order. The evidence on sentence also included a reference from the plaintiff’s local bishop and a letter of apology from the plaintiff. His Honour invited Ms Carr to make submissions on why he ought not impose a custodial sentence, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence. Ms Carr and the Police Prosecutor addressed on penalty (the substance of which is not recorded on the transcript) following which the Magistrate delivered ex tempore remarks on sentence. His Honour convicted the plaintiff of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and imposed a sentence of imprisonment of nine months with a five month non-parole period.
	
	
	On 31 July 2013 the plaintiff’s solicitor lodged a notice of appeal to the District Court against the severity of his sentence pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.
	
	
	On 5 August 2013 the plaintiff, who was represented by Mr Hammond, applied to Magistrate Rabbidge of the Local Court at Campbelltown for a grant of bail. Mr Hammond confirmed that the plaintiff had pleaded guilty in open court and informed the magistrate that the plaintiff had lodged an appeal against sentence. Bail was granted on conditions which included that: he reside with his parents; he not approach the victim; and that he prosecute his appeal in the District Court. It was noted that no date had been allocated for the hearing of the appeal against sentence.
	
	
	On 18 October 2013 the plaintiff’s appeal was listed for hearing in the District Court before Haesler DCJ. Mr Hammond again appeared on behalf of the plaintiff. His Honour rejected the plaintiff’s application that the matter be disposed of pursuant to s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW). On the application of Mr Hammond, the matter was adjourned part-heard to 26 February 2014 pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) so that the plaintiff could continue to see his psychologist.
	
	
	On 26 February 2014, the plaintiff was represented by Saba El-Hanania, his new (and present) solicitor, who informed Haesler DCJ that there was a possibility of an application to set aside the guilty plea and have the matter proceed as a conviction appeal. It was adjourned to 11 April 2014.
	
	
	On 8 April 2014 the plaintiff swore an affidavit in which he denied the charge and deposed that he had instructed Ms Carr to indicate that he pleaded not guilty to the charge. This affidavit, together with a notice of motion, in which the plaintiff sought leave to traverse the plea of guilty, was filed in the District Court on 9 April 2014 by Mr El-Hanania. The matter was mentioned before Haesler DCJ on 11 April 2014 and adjourned (due to the number of other matters in the list) to 22 May 2014. The plaintiff swore a further affidavit on 20 May 2014 in response to Ms Carr’s affidavit sworn on 15 May 2014, both of which were read at the hearing of the motion.
	
	
	The notice of motion was listed before Haesler DCJ on 22 May 2014. The prosecutor maintained that the Court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the matter as the application was filed outside the time period of three months provided for in s 13(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, beyond which no extension of time could be granted.
	
	
	His Honour heard evidence from the plaintiff and Ms Carr, both of whom were cross-examined. Later that day Haesler DCJ gave reasons for judgment on the plaintiff’s application to withdraw his guilty plea. His Honour followed Denning v Department of Environment [2007] NSWLEC 258 and accepted the prosecutor’s submission that the District Court had no jurisdiction to traverse the guilty plea as the plaintiff’s application for leave was out of time. However, his Honour proceeded to make findings of fact relating to the application in the event that he was found to be incorrect on the application of s 13 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act and refused the application for leave to traverse the plea of guilty. His Honour upheld the severity appeal in part and varied the sentence to eight months, wholly suspended upon entry into a bond.
	


Whether time should be extended for leave to appeal


	
	The plaintiff requires an extension of time for leave to appeal, as well as leave, before the appeal can be considered by this Court.
	
	
	In my view, for the reasons given in more detail below, the appeal is incompetent since it challenges an order, being the conviction in the Local Court, which is no longer operative, having regard to the orders of the District Court refusing the application for leave to appeal against conviction. Accordingly, for that reason alone, no extension of time ought be granted. However, in deference to the parties’ submissions, I propose to address the substantive arguments made by the plaintiff in support of the application for extension of time.
	
	
	The matters to be taken into account in deciding whether time ought be extended include: the length of delay; whether an explanation for delay has been given, and the substance of the explanation; and whether the plaintiff has a fairly arguable case: see the authorities summarized in Dyason v Butterworth [2015] NSWCA 52 at [65] (in the context of UCPR r 59.10); and Pace v Read [2000] NSWSC 823. These matters will be considered in turn.
	


The length of delay


	
	The order for the plaintiff’s conviction was pronounced in the Local Court on 30 July 2013, which was, relevantly, “the material date” within the meaning of SCR 51B. The plaintiff’s application for leave to appeal was required to be filed by 27 August 2013. The summons was filed on 17 December 2014. Accordingly, the delay was over fifteen months. As can be seen from the narrative of facts set out above, the summons was filed about seven months after the District Court appeal was finally determined.
	


The explanation for the delay


	
	Mr Wendler neither identified a reason for the delay nor adduced any evidence to explain it. Although one might surmise that the plaintiff hoped that he would be successful in the District Court and did not avail himself of his right to seek leave to appeal to this Court until the District Court appeal had been determined, there is no evidence to the effect that this was why the summons was not filed earlier. Even if it were assumed, in the absence of evidence, that this occurred, there is no explanation whatsoever for the delay between 22 May 2014, when the District Court appeal was finally determined and 17 December 2014 when the summons in these proceedings was filed.
	


Whether the plaintiff raises a fairly arguable ground


	
	The plaintiff relies on the following ground (which is set out in [8] of the summons):
	


“The plea of “guilty” announced by his solicitor then acting rather than the plaintiff was contrary to ss 192 and 193 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and precipitated a fundamental failure of procedure going to the root of the proceedings before the Local Court.”


	
	Mr Wendler argued that the plaintiff’s plea of guilty in the Local Court failed to comply with s 192 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and was, accordingly, invalid, for the following two reasons:
	



	
	it was not given by him personally; rather it was given by Ms Carr on his behalf;
	
	
	the Local Court did not state the substance of the offence to him.
	


Whether the plea of guilty was required to be given by the plaintiff personally


	
	The first matter gives rise to a question of statutory construction. Mr Wendler argued that the use of the term “accused person” in s 192 did not include a legal practitioner appearing on behalf of the accused person. He submitted that the words in s 3 which qualify the definition, “where the subject matter or context allows or requires” have the effect, when applied to s 192, that a defendant in the Local Court who stands charged with an offence (such as assault occasioning actual bodily harm) which could be, but was not, tried on indictment, is required to answer the charge personally and cannot enter a valid plea through a legal practitioner appearing on his or her behalf.
	
	
	In Collier v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2011] NSWCA 202 the Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary in Local Court proceedings for the charge or charges to be read formally to a defendant before a plea is taken for the plea to be valid and effective. As the Court was concerned with similar issues to those which arise in the present case I propose to set out the relevant passages in full. Justice Hodgson (Campbell JA and Latham J agreeing) said:
	


[50] In my opinion, it can confidently be inferred by this court, as it could have been by the primary judge and by Magistrate Stevenson, that Mr Madden had been provided with copies of the Court Attendance Notices and the police facts, so that he was well aware of the terms of the charges. In my opinion, in those circumstances, his statement to the court that he was instructed to enter a plea of guilty would unequivocally convey to the court that Mrs Collier did plead guilty to those charges, in a way that was valid and sufficient, at least unless s 192 prevented this. In my opinion, it is clear from the definition of “accused person” in the CP Act, as well as from Dunn and Paauwe, that a plea can be entered by a legal practitioner. If it were the case that Mr Madden acted contrary to his instructions from Mrs Collier or misunderstood those instructions, this would not affect the validity of the plea, but at best support an application to withdraw it.

[51] Dunn lends support to the proposition that the stating of the charge to the accused person, or at least to a legal practitioner appearing for the accused person, can be waived. Of course, that was a case in which counsel pleaded “not guilty”; but I do not think that this would justify a different result. If the statement of the charge is a condition precedent to the validity of one plea, I think it must be a condition precedent to the validity of the other, and to the validity of consequent proceedings also. The legislation in that case was in somewhat different terms from s 192 of the CP Act; but again I do not think it is sufficiently different to justify a different result.

[52] I am not sure, however, whether a procedure required by a statute can simply be “waived”. I think the more appropriate enquiry is whether or not s 192(2) of the CP Act is prescribing something that must occur before the power (and perhaps obligation) to convict can be exercised, and/or whether or not it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [41], [91]–[93].

[53] It seems clear that the purpose of s 192(2) is to ensure that, to the knowledge of the court, an accused person adequately understands what it is to which he/she is to plead guilty or not guilty, and understands that his/her response will count as such a plea.

[54] But for the definition of “accused person” in s 3, one would read s 192(2) as requiring that the stating of the offence charged be to the accused person himself/herself; and one might then quite readily consider that this requirement was appropriately selected by the legislature as something that had to happen, in order to ensure, to the knowledge of the court, that the accused person does understand these things. . . .

[55] However, in my opinion the definition of “accused person” in s 3 makes an important difference. In the light of that definition, the statement in s 192(2) can be made to a legal practitioner, and the legal practitioner may enter the plea. It is clear that in those circumstances what I have identified as the purpose of s 192(2) could be achieved readily and sometimes much more efficiently in other ways; for example, by the court directing the attention of the legal practitioner to an identified document in which the charge or charges are set out. In a busy Local Court list it may be highly inconvenient that multiple charges be individually stated in court; and the identification of charges could more effectively, as well as more conveniently, be done by drawing attention to an identified document. I think this suggests that, consistently with the purpose of s 192(2), it was not the purpose of the legislation to invalidate pleas or convictions if that section was not complied with.

[56] One indication in the CP Act suggesting that the formality of stating the charges in court may not be a requirement for the validity of a plea is s 182:

[provision set out]

[57] This means that, in cases where an accused has not been arrested, there may be a written plea of guilty based on no more than the Court Attendance Notice; in which case, the accused would have no more than the Court Attendance Notice, which an accused to whom s 192(2) applies would also have.

. . .

[60] Accordingly, in my opinion the primary judge did not make an error of law in determining that Mrs Collier had pleaded guilty, because non-compliance with s 192 does not of itself invalidate a guilty plea, and Mr Madden’s statement that he was instructed to plead guilty, when Mrs Collier’s matter had been identified, was a sufficient unequivocal acknowledgment of guilt, referable to charges well understood by Mr Madden and Mrs Collier. . .”


	
	Of present relevance to the first argument, the Court of Appeal found that the words “accused person” in s 192 included a legal practitioner (in that case, Mr Madden) appearing on behalf of a defendant in the Local Court. Mr Wendler sought to distinguish Collier v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) on the ground that it concerned minor traffic offences, which were summary offences, whereas the present case concerned indictable offences which were dealt with summarily. He submitted that the feature of such offences was that they were, necessarily, more serious and that, accordingly, the “subject matter or context allows or requires” the words “accused person” to mean the actual accused person rather than including a legal practitioner representing him or her. Mr Wendler was unable to point to anything in Collier v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) which supported the drawing of such a distinction and accepted that there was nothing other than the potential seriousness of the offence which could form the basis for such a distinction.
	
	
	I am bound by Collier v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW). I am not persuaded that the difference for which Mr Wendler contended between summary offences on the one hand and those that could be dealt with summarily or on indictment on the other constitutes a relevant distinction. However, in deference to Mr Wendler’s argument, I shall address the question of construction of s 192 in the context of the Criminal Procedure Act. This requires an examination of the relevant provisions of the Act as a whole, which have been set out or summarised above.
	
	
	As provided for in ss 36 and 37 of the Criminal Procedure Act, an accused person can appear by a legal practitioner. I considered the legislative history of ss 36 and 37 of the Criminal Procedure Act and cases applying the provisions in McKellar v DPP [2014] NSWSC 459 at [22]-[33]. These provisions have the effect that, as the plaintiff was represented by Ms Carr, Ms Carr’s announcement of the plea of guilty would appear to be as effective as it would have been had the plaintiff announced it himself. There is no indication in the text of s 192 or s 193 that a plea has to be given personally.
	
	
	The provisions in Chapter 4 (ss 192 and 193) are to be distinguished from ss 154 and 155, which provide for pleas on arraignment. In such cases, it appears from the wording of s 155 that the context requires the expression “accused person” to be confined to the accused person, since the legal representative is not “arraigned” and it would appear unlikely that Parliament contemplated that a legal practitioner would either “stand mute” or “not answer directly to the indictment”.
	
	
	The broad terms of s 170 provide, in my view, a further basis for not distinguishing between summary offences and those indictable offences which can be dealt with summarily, since s 170 makes Chapter 4 (which contains s 192 and 193) apply to all such offences, without differentiation.
	
	
	The procedure for written pleas in s 182 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which was referred to by Hodgson JA in the passage from Collier v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) set out above, provides a further indication that a plea need not be given personally in Court.
	
	
	Mr Wendler also referred to R v Duffield and Dellapatrona (1992) 28 NSWLR 638, in which Kirby P, at 655-656, emphasised, by way of obiter, the practical benefits of taking a plea orally from an accused person personally in committal proceedings. In particular his Honour said, at 656A-C:
	


“Where a person pleads guilty in committal proceedings, there is no invariable practice in this State to take such a plea from the accused himself or herself. Stephen (above at 275) acknowledges that by ancient English criminal procedure, at the trial, the plea has to be taken from the accused person ""orally in open court"". Especially in circumstances where the committing magistrate is aware that the plea is proffered following ""negotiations"" between the prosecutor and those representing the accused, there is much to be said for affording the accused the opportunity, for himself or herself, to acknowledge the plea orally in public before the magistrate acts upon it. The reasons for such a course are obvious. Such an act acknowledges guilt in a public way. It thereby attracts to the accused the advantages, upon sentence, which normally attend the admission of guilt and the formal acceptance of what must then follow. . . . A public acknowledgment of a plea of guilty from the lips of the accused person may help ensure against later assertions of a lack of understanding, confusion or actual misrepresentation of instructions given to legal representatives. . .”


	
	This dictum supports the proposition that, whatever the practical benefits of taking a plea from the accused person personally, it is not a legal requirement (except at a trial on indictment at the point of arraignment). In my view, for the reasons given above, it is not fairly arguable that ss 192 and 193 of the Criminal Procedure Act required the plaintiff’s plea to be given personally. Accordingly, the circumstance that the plea was communicated to the Court by Ms Carr complied, in that respect, with the requirements of the Act.
	


Whether the Local Court stated the substance of the offence to the plaintiff as required by s 192 of the Criminal Procedure Act


	
	Mr Wendler sought to distinguish Collier v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) on the same basis (that it applied only to summary offences rather than indictable offences dealt with summarily) for the second ground of alleged non-compliance. He submitted that the statements in Collier v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) concerning the requirement to state the substance of the offence to the accused person had no application to the present case. For the reasons given above, I do not consider there to be any basis, either in Collier v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) or in the Criminal Procedure Act itself, to impose a higher standard for indictable offences dealt with summarily than has been held to apply to summary offences.
	
	
	I consider that the extract from the transcript of the Local Court proceedings on 30 July 2013 set out above indicated the following:
	



	
	The charge of common assault was a back-up charge to the principal charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	Mr Nand pleaded guilty to the principal charge, which had the effect that the back-up charge was withdrawn and dismissed.
	



	
	These indications are clear when regard is had solely to the transcript. They correspond with the CAN and the Police Facts Sheet, both of which were before the Court and can be taken to have been in the hands of Ms Carr, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff. Although the court did not, in terms, “state the substance of the offence to the accused person”, the Magistrate adopted what Ms Carr had said as to the substance of the offence (assault occasioning actual bodily harm), which was, accordingly, incorporated by reference into the Magistrate’s response of “Yes” and his Honour’s confirmation that it was a “plea to sequence 1” and that “sequence 2 [was] to be withdrawn and dismissed on the basis of the acceptance of the plea [to sequence 1]”. Accordingly, I consider that the requirements of s 192(2) were fulfilled and that, in light of Collier v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), it is not fairly arguable that they were not.
	


The incompetence of an appeal, if leave were granted


	
	At the commencement of the hearing of the summons, I raised the question of the competence of the appeal (if leave were granted), having regard to the principle that this Court has no power to review any aspect of the decision of the Local Court if it has effectively been superseded by the judgment in the District Court: Wishart v Fraser and Garde v Dowd [2011] NSWCA 115; 80 NSWLR 620 at [11]-[13] per Basten JA (Giles and McColl JJA agreeing). I also noted that the plaintiff did not challenge, in the orders sought in the summons, the order of the District Court dismissing the plaintiff’s application for leave to appeal against conviction.
	
	
	Mr Wendler submitted orally that Wishart v Fraser had no application and relied on s 60 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. Ms Davidson sought leave to provide a written note within a short time of the conclusion of the hearing, to which Mr Wendler was given an opportunity to respond. Ms Davison accepted, in her written note, that the plaintiff’s application for leave to appeal was futile as any appeal would be incompetent in light of Wishart v Fraser. What follows are my reasons which address Mr Wendler’s written submissions in response.
	


The plaintiff’s submissions on the competence of the appeal


	
	Mr Wendler submitted that there was no impediment to the plaintiff’s exercising his right to seek leave under s 53 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. He contended that the only limitation on the right to seek leave to appeal was imposed by s 60, which prevents a person from appealing to this Court against a decision of a Local Court which has already been the subject of an appeal or leave application to this Court. He submitted that, had Parliament intended that a person who appealed, or applied for leave to appeal, to the District Court against a conviction or sentence imposed by the Local Court would not be permitted to appeal, or seek leave to appeal, to the Supreme Court, the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act would have made express provision. Mr Wendler made no submission about the effect of s 29 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.
	
	
	Mr Wendler contended that Wishart v Fraser did not apply as the plaintiff’s notice of motion in the District Court for leave to appeal against his conviction was “a nullity” and “totally void” since the District Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the leave application, as it was out of time. He also submitted, in the alternative, that, because the arguments relating to alleged non-compliance with s 192 of the Criminal Procedure Act were not put in the District Court, there was no impediment to his relying on them in this Court. Further, Mr Wendler submitted that the purpose of Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act was “to ensure the Supreme Court’s supervisory jurisdiction remains inviolable” and relied on Campbell v DPP (NSW) [2008] NSWSC 1284.
	


Section 60 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act


	
	I am not persuaded that s 60 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act evinces the intention for which Mr Wendler contended. A statute is presumed to operate against the background of the existing legal principles. As Sackville AJA explained in Navazi v New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation [2015] NSWCA 308 at [82]-[107], a party who seeks to challenge a decision of a lower court both in an intermediate court and a superior court may be put to his or her election, depending on the nature of the respective proceedings. One of the reasons for this is that, once the intermediate court has made orders (in this case, the District Court), its orders, and not those of the lower court (in this case, the Local Court), are the operative ones.
	
	
	Further, an Anshun estoppel may arise. In the present case, the plaintiff could have made (but failed to make) the same arguments in the District Court before Haesler DCJ as he seeks to advance in this Court (based on alleged non-compliance with s 192 of the Criminal Procedure Act). That he did not does not prevent the estoppel arising. However, it is not necessary to determine the estoppel point as the appeal is incompetent on the grounds of the principle in Wishart v Fraser.
	


The jurisdiction of the District Court and its orders


	
	I reject the plaintiff’s submission that the orders of the District Court were a nullity. The District Court had power to determine the leave application. It determined that it was obliged to refuse leave, by reason of s 13 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, as the application was not lodged within time. The effect of s 13 was not to deprive the District Court of its jurisdiction to determine whether it could grant the application for leave, but rather to prevent its granting the application. When the District Court dismissed the plaintiff’s notice of motion, its orders, which were made within its jurisdiction, became the operative orders and displaced the orders of the Local Court. That its jurisdiction on an appeal against conviction under s 20 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act did not arise (as there was no appeal, merely an application for leave to appeal, which was required to be refused) is beside the point.
	
	
	This analysis is consistent with the decision of the Court of Appeal in Blacker v Parnell [1978] 1 NSWLR 616 in which a convicted defendant sought statutory prohibition in this Court pursuant to s 112 of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW), as well as appealing to the District Court against conviction and sentence. He sought to withdraw the proceedings in the District Court to allow the application to this Court to be determined. To this end, the appeals to the District Court were dismissed by consent. The Court of Appeal held, in accordance with Wishart v Fraser, that: the operative orders were the orders of the District Court dismissing the appeal against conviction; and that, accordingly, it had no jurisdiction to determine a challenge to the conviction in the Local Court.
	
	
	The decision on which Mr Wendler relied, Campbell v DPP (NSW), is of no assistance since it involved solely an application for leave to appeal from the Local Court to this Court; there was, in that case, no appeal, or application for leave to appeal, to the District Court.
	


The effect of s 29 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act


	
	Section 29 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act would appear to contemplate that an appeal to this Court on a question of law (which arises as of right under s 52) and an application for leave to appeal to this Court on a question of mixed law and fact (under s 53) ought be made before an appeal to the District Court against conviction or sentence under ss 11 and 12. However, s 29(2) expressly preserves the right of a person to appeal to the District Court if this Court has refused leave to appeal on a ground of mixed law and fact.
	
	
	In my view, the better view is that, although a plaintiff may lodge an appeal or leave application in the District Court against a conviction in the Local Court (and must do so within three months or be time-barred by s 13 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act), the appeal ought not be dealt with (and no orders made by the District Court) until the proceedings in this Court under Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act have been determined (see Lazarus v DPP (NSW) [2015] NSWSC 1776 at [24]-[25] per RS Hulme AJ). I do not consider that s 29 (1)(c) has the effect of invalidating an appeal lodged in the District Court if Supreme Court proceedings are on foot since this construction would carry the risk that a plaintiff would be out of time for an appeal to the District Court if this Court refused leave to appeal outside the three month period allowed by s 13 for filing appeals or leave applications in the District Court.
	
	
	Section 29 does not appear to contemplate a person’s exercising his or her rights to appeal or to seek leave to appeal in the District Court, before commencing proceedings under Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. This is a powerful indication that Parliament did not intend to sanction the course taken by the plaintiff in the present case of exhausting his or her rights in the District Court before commencing proceedings this Court for relief under ss 52 or 53. Moreover, as referred to above, when orders have been made in the District Court (including, as in Blacker v Parnell, consent orders dismissing the appeal, or, as in the present case, dismissal of the leave application as it was not brought within time), the principle in Wishart v Fraser applies and the plaintiff would have to challenge the District Court decision, since it, not the decision of the Local Court, would be the operative decision. I note for completeness that this Court’s jurisdiction to review the decision of the District Court is limited to jurisdictional error (which cannot validly be excluded: Kirk v Industrial Relations Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531 at [54]-[55]), by reason of s 176 of the District Court Act 1973 (NSW) which provides that no adjudication on appeal of the District Court is to be removed by any order into the Supreme Court.
	
	
	Had the plaintiff wished to make the present challenge and preserve his rights to appeal or seek leave to appeal to the District Court, he could have filed a summons in this Court as well as lodging an appeal in the District Court within 3 months of 30 July 2013. The summons in this Court would have been dealt with first. If leave had been refused by this Court, the plaintiff would then have been able to prosecute his appeal in the District Court. By doing it the other way around, the plaintiff is seeking to challenge a decision (the conviction in the Local Court) that is no longer operative. Unlike the procedure I have referred to above, the course taken by the plaintiff in the present case is not sanctioned by the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act (cf. Sinkovich v Attorney-General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; 85 NSWLR 783 at [46]-[47] per Basten JA (Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Price and Beech-Jones JJ agreeing)). It would offend the principle in Wishart v Fraser as well as the principle of finality of litigation: Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; 238 CLR 218 at [16], were this Court to treat the appeal against the conviction in the Local Court as competent.
	


Conclusion


	
	The delay in bringing these proceedings is lengthy. It has not been explained. The sole ground raised by the plaintiff (based on alleged non-compliance with s 192 of the Criminal Procedure Act) is, for the reasons given above, not fairly arguable. Accordingly, there would be no utility in extending the time within which the plaintiff’s application could be brought. For these reasons, I am not disposed to extend time.
	
	
	There is a further, and independent, reason, why an extension of time ought not be granted. The plaintiff’s appeal to this Court against the conviction ordered in the Local Court would, if leave were granted, be incompetent, since the operative decision is that of the District Court in respect of which no orders are sought.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Refuse the application to extend the time for filing the summons.
	
	
	Dismiss the summons.
	
	
	Order the plaintiff to pay the defendants’ costs of the proceedings.

		18 February 2016",2016-02-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768803,Hashin v The Office of DPP [2016] NSWSC 93,"Judgment


	
	RS HULME AJ: By an amended summons filed on 26 November 2015, the plaintiff seeks a number of orders directed to quashing a decision of a magistrate refusing in the course of committal proceedings to grant a direction pursuant to s 93 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 for the attendance of a witness for cross-examination and remitting proceedings to the magistrate for re-consideration.
	
	
	On 16 October 2014 the witness, a Mr William Siale, was shot. The Plaintiff is alleged to be one of the persons who shot him.
	
	
	While still at the scene and being attended to by one or more ambulance officers he was asked a number of questions by a Constable Cuffe. Constable Cuffe's statement indicates that in answering questions Mr Siale said that he didn't know who had shot him and didn't see a car that was apparently involved. Constable Cuffe indicated that during the time of these questions, Mr Siale was fading in and out of consciousness - a circumstance that may well provide an explanation for Mr Siale's answers at that time being either inaccurate or reflecting less than he actually knew.
	
	
	On the following day, a recorded interview was held in hospital. On that occasion, Mr Siale said that there were two people, one Lebanese or Arabic and the second, African and that they had both alighted from the front of a silver Toyota. Asked to describe the persons and who had shot him, Mr Siale said little other than some description of their clothing. He did say that he thought he would recognise the Lebanese if he saw him again. Mr Siale also said that he was pretty stoned at the time.
	
	
	Mr Siale made further statements concerning the identification of the shooters. The first of these was on 30 October 2014, refers again to the silver Toyota and contains a more detailed description of the shooters. However, the detail provided would apply to a substantial number of people in the community.
	
	
	The next statement was made on 14 November 2014. In this Mr Siale said that on looking at Facebook he had seen someone whom he recognised as the shooter and had observed that person for a few hours on the screen to make sure it was the right person.
	
	
	Mr Siale returned to the topic in a further statement of 20 August 2015 saying on this occasion that while during his consideration of Facebook he had believed the person he saw was one of those who shot him and had told police he was 100 percent sure, as time went on, he became more and more unsure. By August 2015 he was not certain that the person seen was one of the males who was involved in the shooting.
	
	
	It was against that background that the application was made under s 93 to cross-examine Mr Siale at the committal proceedings. So far as is presently relevant s 93 precludes the magistrate making the order sought unless “satisfied that there are special reasons why the alleged victim should, in the interests of justice, attend to give oral evidence.”
	
	
	After referring to the evidence above and by way of reasons for her decision, the magistrate said – I quote from the transcript:
	


I am satisfied that in relation to any application to cross-examine him, (i.e. Mr Siale) at a committal stage relating to identification would not take the matter further, that is all material that could be before the trial and if it gets that far, or even be the basis of a no bill application.


	
	The proceedings before me are not an appeal on the merits. Rather is the plaintiff entitled to succeed only on the basis of prerogative relief granted in the course of judicial review. In so considering the matter, I am entitled to have regard to an error on the face of the record and anything which indicates that the magistrate did or may not have applied the proper test in making her decision. Applying that criteria, I am satisfied the plaintiff should succeed.
	
	
	Firstly, her Honour was obviously in error when she said that cross-examination would not take the matter further. It is clearly of significance to the plaintiff here if Mr Siale could be induced in the course of cross-examination to completely repudiate those of his statements which provide evidence that he had identified the shooters or was in a position to provide any description of them. While undoubtedly the inconsistencies to which I have referred could be relied upon at trial it is clear that there is potential advantage to the plaintiff to be able to have Mr Siale repudiate any description which does tend to implicate him.
	
	
	Furthermore, I do not regard the magistrate as having provided anything that could be regarded as adequate reasons for her decision. She has not explained why cross-examination would not take the matter further and though that conclusion might be correct if she had decided that the plaintiff would not be committed for trial she has not said so. In the result, I am satisfied that the magistrate did not apply her mind to the proper questions, that her decision in any event is so unreasonable that it demonstrates both that fact and in that respect itself provides grounds for an order by way of prerogative relief.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I think appropriate orders are to:
	



	
	Quash the decision of magistrate Schurr made on 5 November 2015 refusing to direct the attendance of William Siale for cross-examination, and
	
	
	Direct that the magistrate reconsider the application made in that regard and determine it in accordance with law.
	



	
	The plaintiff having succeeded, there will also be an order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs.

		18 February 2016",2016-02-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768811,Bae v R [2016] NSWCCA 11,"Judgment


	
	CHIEF JUSTICE BATHURST: I agree with the orders proposed by RS Hulme AJ and with his Honour's reasons.
	
	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with RS Hulme AJ.
	
	
	RS HULME AJ: This Applicant for leave to appeal was on 11 November 2014 convicted of a charge that between about 5 February 2013 and 2 April 2013 he imported a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug viz methamphetamine.
	
	
	On 5 February 2015 Toner DCJ sentenced the Applicant to imprisonment for 9 years including a non-parole period of 6 years, both such periods commencing on 1 April 2013.
	
	
	The offence was one constituted by s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a fine of $850,000.
	
	
	A marketable quantity includes quantities between 2 and 750 grams – see Criminal Code Regulations 2002 (Cth). A similar offence including a commercial quantity i.e. 750 grams or more carries a maximum period of imprisonment of life – s 307.1. Pursuant to s 307.3 if the quantity is less than a marketable quantity the maximum period of imprisonment prescribed is 10 years.
	
	
	The offence was constituted by the Applicant bringing into Australia a suitcase containing approximately 409 grams of powder, the pure methamphetamine component of which was 309 grams. The potential wholesale value of these drugs was about $102,000 and the potential street value between about $286,000 and $306,000.
	
	
	The Applicant was persuaded to participate in the importation by a Mr Yong Sik Song who imported an identical suitcase at the same time containing some 297.9 grams (pure) of methamphetamine. Toner DCJ found that Mr Song’s participation was much more significant than that of the Applicant.
	
	
	Mr Song pleaded guilty to the importation of the drugs contained in both his and Mr Bae’s suitcases, the total combined weight being 606.9 grams (pure) of methamphetamine. Mr Song was sentenced by Blackmore DCJ on 4 April 2014 to imprisonment for a period of 7 years 9 months including a non-parole period of 5 years. Blackmore DCJ arrived at this period by applying a discount for plea and assistance of 27.5% to a period of 11 years that he said would otherwise have been appropriate. Mr Song gave evidence at Mr Bae’s trial.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal are that:
	



	
	The Applicant suffers a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon his co-offender, Mr Yong Sik Song.
	
	
	The sentence imposed was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.
	



	
	I may perhaps add that Mr Bae was also charged with the joint importation of the 606.9 grams but the jury acquitted him of that charge.
	
	
	The Applicant gave evidence that he was induced to participate in the importation by Mr Song who told him that the suitcase contained jewellery. It may be that the Applicant was also in need of money although he denied that fact. Blackmore DCJ found that Mr Song was a courier and Toner DCJ concluded that this also was the role of Mr Bae and that his remuneration was to be similar to that promised to Mr Song, viz about $9,000.
	
	
	His Honour also observed that by his plea, Mr Song had acknowledged that he had actual knowledge that what he was importing was methamphetamine whereas Mr Bae’s state of mind was that of a degree of recklessness which his Honour regarded as towards the upper end of a range tending to merge with actual knowledge.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the jury’s rejection of the charge involving importation of the 606.9 grams jointly with Mr Song, Toner DCJ regarded parity between the two sentences as important and this notwithstanding the difference in mental elements and a conclusion that Mr Song’s participation was much more significant than that of Mr Bae.
	


Ground 1


	
	Despite the jury’s apparent rejection of the proposition that the Applicant was a co-offender with Mr Song in respect of the importation of the 606.9 grams, it seems clear that they were co-offenders in respect of the lesser quantity of 309 grams imported by the Applicant. The principles of parity thus have application.
	
	
	While the authorities indicate that quantity is not determinative of criminality it remains relevant. The quantity with which the Applicant was involved is only a little more than half that with which Mr Song was involved.
	
	
	His Honour’s findings that Mr Song’s participation was much more significant than that of the Applicant and that the Applicant was reckless, albeit to a high degree, rather than having actual knowledge as Mr Song did both also argue for Mr Song’s criminality being higher.
	
	
	There are other differences between the offenders but in the scheme of things I do not regard them as significant. However the factors I have mentioned are. And they are not adequately reflected in the difference between the starting point of 11 years for Mr Song’s sentence and the 9 years head sentence imposed on the Applicant.
	


Ground 2


	
	Before turning to the question of whether, despite the above conclusion, this Court should interfere, it is appropriate to say something concerning this ground. It is not made out.
	
	
	A group of other cases, most of which were summarised in a table before Toner DCJ demonstrates why this is so. I do not find it necessary to record here any detailed analysis of those cases. They include:-
	


Ho Yan Cheng v R unreported Qld Supreme Court, 27 May 2014

AB v R [2013] NSWCCA 333, 27 March 2012

Thuong Nguyen v R [2012] NSWCCA 184, 25 March 2011

Kuti v R [2012] NSWCCA 43, 1 April 2011

Hoon Tiong Seah v R [2011] NSWCCA 269, 12 March 2010

Lau v The Queen [2011] VSCA 24, 12 May 2010

Youssef v R [2011] NSWCCA 104, 12 February 2010

Tsen v The Queen [2010] WASCA 21, 18 December 2009


	
	They illustrate that in the case of couriers involved in the importation of methamphetamine in quantities between 274 and 710 grams, head sentences (before discount) varying between 10 and 12 years have been regarded as appropriate. Two other cases reflect sentences after discount of 8 and 9 years. Reference may also usefully be made to Huynh v R [2015] NSWCCA 167.
	
	
	While these cases do not persuade me that no reduction should be made to the Applicant’s sentence on parity grounds, they do argue for the view that any large reduction is liable to result in a sentence that is manifestly inadequate. In that connection I would record my view that, apart from the impact of disparity, I would not reduce the sentence imposed on the Applicant.
	
	
	However, the conclusion expressed above in respect of the first ground means that this Court is required to exercise the sentencing “discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit” – Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [42]. Doing so, I am satisfied that a lesser sentence should be imposed.
	
	
	Lest silence may be misconstrued, I should acknowledge that in arriving at the sentence referred to below I have been mindful of the requirements of s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) but do not regard it as necessary to refer to these seriatim. I also have taken into account the information contained in a number of affidavits read on the Applicant’s behalf. They indicate that he is using his time in custody to good advantage. I also record my view that a non-parole period shorter than I have specified would be wholly inadequate in this case.
	
	
	In the result, I would propose that the Court make the following orders:-
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal;
	
	
	Allow the appeal;
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed by Toner DCJ;
	
	
	Sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a period of 8 years commencing on 1 April 2013 and concluding on 31 March 2021, such period to include a non-parole period of 5 years and 4 months also commencing on 1 April 2013 but concluding on 31 July 2018.

2768814,R v Hindmarsh [2016] NSWSC 94,"judgment


	
	The accused, Paul Hindmarsh, was arraigned today. He has pleaded not guilty to the single count on the indictment that, on or about 31 July 2014 at Mt Warrigal in the State of NSW, he murdered the deceased, Mr Joseph Gumley. An election under s 132(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) was made by Mr Hindmarsh within the time permitted by law to be tried by a judge alone. This election was consented to by the Crown on 23rd November 2015. These circumstances require the Court to order that Mr Hindmarsh by tried by a Judge sitting without a jury and that order was made by Johnson J on 4th December 2015 under s 132(2). The real issue is whether the defence of mental illness is made out.
	


Summary of Crown case


	
	The Crown case is that on 31 July 2014 at some time between 6:30 am and 7: 00 am, Mr Hindmarsh struck Mr Gumley a number of times about his head with an electric guitar belonging to Mr Gumley, also strangling him with the guitar’s electric lead causing fatal injuries. The Crown accepts that the whole of the evidence supports the return of the special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness.
	


Agreed statement of facts


	
	The Crown and the accused tendered an agreed statement of facts signed by counsel (Exhibit B). According to Section 191(2) Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), where the parties have produced an agreed statement of facts complying with subsection (3), evidence is not required to prove the existence of these facts. Nor may evidence be received to contradict those facts without leave of the court. Accordingly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of each of the agreed facts which I have set out [4]-[25] below:
	
	
	The offender, Paul Hindmarsh and the deceased, Joseph Gumley were both patients at the high dependency observation ward, Elouera West Mental Health Unit, at Shellharbour Hospital. They both shared room 6.
	
	
	The offender had been an involuntary patient at the facility for a period of approximately 11 months. The offender has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and poly substance abuse (cannabis/methamphetamine and alcohol) and presented as an in-patient on 23 August 2013 after referral by police.
	
	
	The deceased was an involuntary patient at the facility on an on-and-off basis for a number of years with a last admission date of 14 April 2014. He had been diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia and chronic alcoholism with significant cognitive deficits.
	
	
	About 3:00am on 31 July 2014 the offender was observed by staff attached to the Elouera West high dependency unit to be watching a female patient who was in her room through the glass insert on her bedroom door. This was highly unusual behaviour for the offender.
	
	
	About 6:30am nightshift staff, Kaitlin Brown and Neil Mullins, entered room 6 and conducted a routine inspection of the offender and the deceased. Both were seen to be sleeping at this time.
	
	
	About 7:50 am Health and Security Assistant Ross Twyford entered room 6 to tell the occupants that breakfast was being served. The door to the room was open and ajar.
	
	
	Mr Twyford noticed that a curtain to his left was drawn to cover the offender's bed for privacy. Mr Twyford called out to the offender and informed him that breakfast was ready. The offender did not reply.
	
	
	Mr Twyford then noticed the deceased's bed was alongside the south western wall of the room. Normally, the deceased's bed was located on the south eastern wall against the window. It was not unusual for the deceased to move his bed around in the room.
	
	
	The deceased was lying supine in the bed with his head closest to the door to the room and his face covered with a blanket.
	
	
	Mr Twyford then noted chocolate coloured splatter on the wall close to the deceased's head. This was later identified as human blood. He walked over to the deceased's bed and pulled the blanket down off his face and noticed blood on the deceased's face and an injury. The deceased's face was red and blue in colour.
	
	
	Mr Twyford pulled the blanket back up over his face. At this time the offender ran from the room and out to the courtyard area. Mr Twyford alerted staff who entered the room and commenced CPR on the deceased without success.
	
	
	A blue coloured strap was wrapped around the deceased's neck which was removed prior to commencing CPR. Mr Twyford then entered the courtyard area and confronted the offender saying, ""Did you attack Joe?""
	
	
	The offender replied, ""Yes."" Mr Twyford said, ""Why did you attack him?"" The offender did not respond.
	
	
	Mr Twyford and another nurse, Maxine Johnson, escorted the offender back through the facility to a seclusion room. In doing so they walked through the dining room area. At this time the offender turned to the female patient and said, ""I love you.""
	
	
	The offender was placed into the seclusion room. Police were contacted and on their arrival secured the location as a crime scene. Police saw red stains on a number of the walls in room 6, the window, and on a blue coloured guitar, which were identified as blood.
	
	
	The deceased was lying on the floor in the centre of the room with injuries to his face and head.
	
	
	About 10:05am the offender was cautioned and arrested and conveyed to Lake Illawarra police station and introduced to the Custody Manager who read him his rights under Part 9 of the Law Enforcement (Powers & Responsibilities) Act 2002.
	
	
	The offender consented to a forensic procedure in the form of a buccal swab, photographs and swabbing. The offender was offered the opportunity to speak with a legal practitioner of his choice in relation to both the forensic procedure and later prior to participating in an electronically recorded interview which he declined.
	
	
	He was then offered the opportunity to participate in an electronically recorded interview and again declined saying, ""I don't want to say anything"".
	
	
	The Crown case is that sometime between 6:30am and 7:50am on Thursday 31 July 2014 the offender hit the deceased with the deceased's electric guitar causing fatal injuries to the face and head.
	
	
	An autopsy report was completed by Dr Szentmarlay which concluded that the cause of death was the combined effects of strangulation and blunt force head and neck injuries.
	
	
	The accused has a history of mental illness having been first diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2004 with multiple admissions to psychiatric hospitals over the intervening years. It is the opinion of experts retained by both the Crown and the accused that he has available to him the defence of mental illness.
	


General legal principles


	
	Section 133 Criminal Procedure Act prescribes my duties in a criminal trial without a jury. The section requires me to include in my judgment the principles of law and findings of fact I have relied on in reaching my decision. The section also requires me to take into account any warning which, in the circumstances of this case, would usually be given to a jury.
	
	
	I bear in mind that I have the responsibility of identifying the real issues for decision. It is necessary for me to state only so much of the law relevant to those real issues: Alford v Magee (1952) 85 CLR 437 at 466.
	
	
	The starting point, and fundamental rule, as in any criminal trial, is that Mr Hindmarsh is presumed to be innocent. It is relevant to record, given his plea, that he is also presumed to be sane. The presumption of innocence is rebutted if and only if the Crown proves the essential elements of the charge beyond reasonable doubt. It is for the accused to rebut the presumption of sanity by establishing his mental illness defence on the balance of probabilities, a much less exacting standard of proof.
	
	
	The elements of murder which the Crown must establish in the present case to prove Mr Hindmarsh’s guilt are that by his voluntary, or deliberate, act of striking and strangling Mr Gumley, neither in self-defence nor by provocation, Mr Hindmarsh caused Mr Gumley’s death, intending at that time to kill him. Given the nature of his acts and the account he has given to various psychiatrists who have since examined him, the consideration of a lesser intent can safely be put aside.
	
	
	Particular considerations apply to this case because Mr Hindmarsh has raised mental illness as a defence: Hawkins v The Queen [1994] HCA 28; 179 CLR 500; R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226; 63 NSWLR 490 at [32]. Those considerations relate to the order in which the issues are required to be approached. As Ms C Loukas SC, who appears for Mr Hindmarsh, and the learned Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor both argued, the better view is that the issues are to be approached in the order which I will now set out.
	
	
	The first issue is whether the striking of Mr Gumley with the guitar and strangling him were deliberate acts. Mental illness is irrelevant at this stage. There is no issue that the actions of Mr Hindmarsh against Mr Gumley were willed and voluntary.
	
	
	The second issue is whether Mr Hindmarsh is criminally responsible for the consequences of his actions. This involves resolution of the mental illness defence.
	
	
	Once again, there is no issue that Mr Hindmarsh suffered from a mental illness when he killed Mr Gumley; probably for some years before; and ever since. Mr Hindmarsh was first diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2004, and since then has been involuntarily admitted to psychiatric hospitals on multiple occasions. His last such admission was on 23 August 2013 to the Elouera West Mental Health Unit, where he remained up until the day of the alleged offence. At the time, Mr Hindmarsh was being treated for schizophrenia and poly substance abuse. The issue is as to the nature and severity of his illness: was it such as he was not responsible for his actions in the relevant legal sense?
	
	
	The mental illness defence is governed by the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW). Section 38 provides for a “special verdict” if the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness. This is a third category of available verdict in addition to verdicts of “guilty” or “not guilty”. The legal consequences which follow a special verdict “are quite different from those which follow a plain verdict of not guilty on the ground that [Mr Hindmarsh] did not do the things charged” (The King v Porter [1933] HCA 1; 55 CLR 182 at 185).
	
	
	If I return a special verdict, I am empowered to order that Mr Hindmarsh be detained “in such place and in such manner” as I think fit “until released by due process of law” (s 39 of the Act). I am not authorised to release Mr Hindmarsh into the community unless I am satisfied that his safety, or the safety of any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release (s 39). A decision that he be detained in custody means that he will be a forensic patient under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, which will review his case and make orders for his continued detention, care and appropriate treatment. The Tribunal may not release Mr Hindmarsh unless it is satisfied as required by law about his safety and the safety of members of the public. And it may only do so after it has given the Minister for Health and the Attorney General prior opportunity to make submissions about his possible release. The Tribunal will be bound to review Mr Hindmarsh’s case, at least every six months. Importantly, in this case, whilst under its supervision, the Tribunal may make orders for Mr Hindmarsh’s continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital or prison.
	
	
	I emphasise that the return of a special verdict will not mean that Mr Hindmarsh has not perpetrated what is the greatest wrong that may be committed according to the ordinary standards adopted by reasonable people; rather the law does not attribute criminal responsibility to him for it by reason only of his mental illness.
	
	
	Not every case of mental illness is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the mental illness defence absolving a person from criminal responsibility. As Dixon J (as the Chief Justice then was) pointed out as long ago as 1933 (in Porter at 187):
	


… a great number of [the] people who come into a Criminal Court are abnormal. They would not be there if they were the normal type of average everyday people. Many of them are very peculiar in their disposition and peculiarly tempered…. Nevertheless, they are mentally quite able to appreciate what they are doing and quite able to appreciate the threatened punishment of the law and the wrongness of their acts, and they are held in check by the prospect of punishment. It would be very absurd if the law were to withdraw that check on the ground that they were somewhat different from their fellow creatures in mental make-up or texture at the very moment when the check is most needed.

His Honour went on to point out:

(The criminal law) attempt[s] to define what are the classes of people who should not be punished although they have done actual things which in others would amount to crime. It is quite a different object to that which the medical profession has in view or other departments of the law have in view in defining insanity for the purpose of the custody of a person’s property, capacity to make a will, and the like.


	
	As I say, the standard of proof is less exacting, but, in a given case, the necessary elements of the defence may not be easily satisfied. The legal requirements of the defence have been established since 1843 (R v McNaughten (1843) 8 ER 718) in the following terms:
	


… to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the quality and the nature of the act he was doing; or if he did know it that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.

It is necessary for me to focus on that short period of time during which Mr Hindmarsh attacked and killed Mr Gumley. Even so, his past and subsequent medical history relevantly shed light on his condition at the time.


	
	Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst are in complete agreement in their expert reports. The evidence is unanimous that Mr Hindmarsh, at the time he killed Mr Gumley, was suffering from a disease of the mind, namely paranoid schizophrenia (Dr Allnut’s report, page 10; Dr Hurst’s report, page 12). Both experts considered, adapting the language of Dixon J (Porter at 189 – 190), that he maintained the capacity to know the nature and quality of his actions. However, due to the psychotic symptoms of his particular disease of the mind, Mr Hindmarsh was not able to distinguish between reality and his hallucinations, (Dr Allnut’s report, page 10; Dr Hurst’s report, page 12). In the words of Dr Allnut:
	


‘He was compromised significantly in his ability to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense of composure as a person of normal mind would’


	
	As can be seen, the psychiatric evidence, in terms of the opinion of each expert on the facts as agreed upon by the parties, favours me finding the mental illness defence has been established. As I have said, the Crown does not argue otherwise.
	
	
	However, I bear in mind that the value of expert opinions is very much dependent upon whether the facts assumed for the purpose of expressing the opinion are sufficiently like the facts as I find them to be. I am not obliged to accept the opinion of any expert. I may reject the evidence, especially where the facts upon which the opinion is based do not accord with the facts as I find them to be.
	
	
	It is very important to bear in mind that the expert evidence is unchallenged by either party. Notwithstanding this, and the parties’ agreement, it is for me to decide whether I am actually satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Hindmarsh has made out the mental illness defence.
	
	
	In undertaking the review of the evidence I will bear in mind that if it is shown that the two doctors not only come to the same conclusion, but provide like reasons for it which “clearly lead to that conclusion … the right decision … must be that the defence has been made out” (R v Jenkins (1963) 64 SR (NSW) 20 at 31 by Walsh J).
	
	
	Before proceeding further, I record that if I am not satisfied that the mental illness defence has been made out, it will be necessary to go on to consider the question of whether Mr Hindmarsh intended to kill Mr Gumley when he attacked him. The answer to that question will be informed by his mental illness, even if it does not rise to such a level as to support the mental illness defence. If I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had that necessary intent, a final question will be whether his mental illness supports the partial defence of substantial impairment provided by s 23A Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) reducing murder to manslaughter.
	


Issue 1 – Voluntary Act


	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the acts of strangulating and effecting blunt force head and neck trauma on Mr Gumley were deliberate acts by Mr Hindmarsh, and that that act caused Mr Gumley’s death.
	
	
	At the time of the incident, Mr Gumley and Mr Hindmarsh shared a room at the Elouera West Mental health Unit at Shellharbour Hospital. By the 31st July 2014, he had been an involuntary patient at that facility for 11 months. He had been diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia, chronic alcoholism and had significant cognitive deficits. Because of his illness he was non-compliant with the treatment prescribed, especially, refusing to take his oral medication.
	
	
	The agreed statement of facts sets out clearly the facts surrounding the incident in question, as set out above in paragraphs 7-17.
	
	
	The autopsy report prepared by Dr Szentmarlay, as stated in the agreed statement of facts, ‘ concluded that the cause of death was the combined effects of strangulation and blunt force head and neck injuries’ (at para 21).
	
	
	The facts founding my finding of deliberate act are the relative ferocity of the attack involving a number of blows, attempted strangulation, then further blows when Mr Hindmarsh perceived Mr Gumley was still breathing, and the account he subsequently gave that at the time of his attack he “heard” what he believed to be the voice of the devil commanding him to “kill”.
	


Issue 2 – Mr Hindmarsh’s history of mental illness


	
	As I have already commented Mr Hindmarsh undoubtedly suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. The question is whether when he attacked Mr Gumley, his condition gave rise to such a defect of reason that he did not know what he was doing was wrong. It remains relevant to consider the nature of the history of his condition.
	
	
	It was agreed by the parties that Mr Hindmarsh has a history of mental illness, dating back to his first diagnosis with schizophrenia in 2004, and having been admitting on multiple occasions in the years since then. This history is detailed in the expert reports (Dr Furst, p 3; Dr Allnut p 2) and need not be further recoumted. At the time of the alleged offence, Mr Hindmarsh was on a prescription of Risperidone Consta, Clozapine and Olanzapine. Mr Hindmarsh had been refusing to take oral antipsychotic medication in the weeks leading up to the alleged offence, and Clopixol Decanoate injections were being administered on a fortnightly basis (Dr Allnut, p 3).
	


The expert evidence


	
	The reliability of the expert psychiatric evidence depends in part upon the validity of the assumptions they have made about Mr Hindmarsh’s medical history, and the reliability of the accounts he gave them. In this case the facts assumed by the experts were supported by clinical records of the institutions where Mr Hindmarsh had received treatment since 2004 and the opinions of the psychiatrists who had treated him there. The accuracy of the histories is agreed by counsel.
	
	
	Whilst at the police station, Mr Hindmarsh consented to forensic procedures, namely a buccal swab, photographs and swabbing. As he was completely entitled to do, he declined to participate in an electronically recorded interview. I draw no inference from Mr Hindmarsh exercising his right to silence. However, he voluntarily provided an account of the events surrounding the alleged offence to the expert witnesses, Dr Allnut and Dr Furst . As he has not given evidence, it is appropriate that I warn, or caution, myself that hearsay evidence is often unreliable perhaps especially when it consists of out of court statements by a person accused of a serious crime, who may therefore have a motive for proffering self-serving statements of an exculpatory type. That Mr Hindmarsh cannot be cross-examined on them affects the weight which might be accorded them. Nonetheless the statements made are admissible because they are the foundation, or part of the foundation, of the opinions expressed by Drs Allnutt and Furst. Being admissible for that purpose, I am entitled to rely upon them, if I am otherwise persuaded as to their reliability, as evidence of the truth as an exception to the hearsay rule under s 60 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	Whilst I am not bound to accept these out of court statements, as they are consistent with accounts he has given to Justice Health psychiatrists, and the experts regard what Mr Hindmarsh told them as consistent with his disease, especially given his resistance to treatment, I am satisfied that his account is probably reliable and should be accepted.
	
	
	Mr Hindmarsh told Dr Allnut that he had been unable to sleep. While lying in bed awake, he began to hear voices saying ‘Kill, kill, kill’’, which he took to be the voice of the ‘devil’. He further told Dr Allnut that he thought at the time that he was the character of Jack from the movie, ‘The Shining’. Mr Hindmarsh said, “There’s this little boy who writes REDRUM on the wall, which is “murder” backwards. I thought that I was taught by the devil to kill someone, so I snapped. I picked up his electric guitar. He was asleep, facing the wall on his side, and I just hit him about three times on the back of the head and then I looked at him. It looked like he was still breathing. I got guitar wire and wrapped it round his neck and made it tight. He was still breathing. I hit him two or three more time on the head and then covered him with a blanket. It looked like he has stopped breathing’ (Dr Allnut’s report, page 3). Substantially the same account was given to Dr Furst (page 4), and to Dr Henderson of Justice Health on 14th October 2014 (Dr Furst page10).
	
	
	It is not without significance that upon being taken into custody Mr Hindmarsh was admitted into the Mental Health Screening Unit at Silverwater Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre (“MRRC”) on 4 August 2014. He was transferred to Hamden two months later, a step-down mental health pod at the MRRC. Throughout his time at the MRRC he has been under the care of Justice Health with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and under treatment by appropriate anti-psychotic medications.
	
	
	Dr Furst examined Mr Hindmarsh on 11 March 2015 at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater. Dr Furst carefully detailed the full mental health history of Mr Hindmarsh dating back to 2004. A feature of his past illness was episodic aggression and threatened self-harm when Mr Hindmarsh was unwell or untreated. This had been manifested in one attempted strangulation and other assaults. He concluded that the main psychotic symptoms of Mr Hindmarsh are paranoid delusions and auditory hallucination, which Mr Hindmarsh referred to as ‘the voice of the devil’ (Dr Furst report, p 3). Dr Furst refers to the long period of involuntary admission of Mr Hindmarsh, recording his feelings of frustration and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. At the time, Mr Hindmarsh was prescribed Risperidone Consta, Clozapine and Olanzapine. Clopixol Decanoate injections were given on a fortnightly basis because Mr Hindmarsh had been refusing to take oral antipsychotic medication in the weeks leading up to the alleged offence (p 3). His condition was symptomatically worsened by bouts of abuse of various substances.
	
	
	Dr Furst made a diagnosis of chronic and treatment resistant schizophrenia with a co-morbidity of substance abuse disorder. He said that schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic illness often characterised by delusional beliefs, auditory hallucinations, disorder of thought form, difficulty processing information, marked instability and bizarre behaviour as a consequence of the illness (Dr Furst report page 10) he said that non-compliance with medication and the co-morbid substance abuse are frequently problems for managing the condition. He concluded that Mr Hindmarsh was mentally ill when he attacked Mr Gumley by virtue “of his chronic treatment resistant schizophrenia” (Dr Furst report page 11). This condition is a disease of the mind. Mr Hindmarsh’s account of his mental processes leading up to the attack on Mr Gumley demonstrates delusional thinking and auditory hallucinations. If accepted, and I accept the account, these matters constitute a defect of reason. Dr Furst said ( Dr Furst report page 12):
	


He was probably also unable to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure owing to his impoverished thinking, negative symptoms of schizophrenia and apparent cognitive defects from his schizophrenia and previous alcohol abuse.


	
	Dr Allnutt substantially agrees. In his report dated 20th August 2015, he recorded a history of the occurrence in all material respects identical to that received by Dr Furst ( Dr Allnutt report page 3). He too reviewed the clinical evidence concerning Mr Hindmarsh’s previous psychiatric history expressing conclusions similar to Dr Furst. He made a diagnosis of “paranoid schizophrenia, characterised by hallucinations of a command nature in the form of auditory hallucinations” (report page 9). He was not persuaded that there was clear evidence of delusional content, but considered his presentation “was probably one of thought disorder and thought blocking”.
	
	
	Dr Allnut concluded (report page10):
	


Based on his account as provided to me, at the material time of the alleged offence the defendant was manifesting symptoms consistent with a “disease of the mind”, that is thought disorder and auditory hallucinations derived from an underlying condition of schizophrenia.

The “disease of the mind”, impaired his reasoning capacity because it was psychotic and he was unable to distinguish reality from his delusional and auditory perceptual beliefs, and would not have been able to think in a logical manner about his circumstances.

In my view he maintained capacity “to know the nature and quality of this actions”. However he was compromised significantly in his ability to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense of composure as a person of normal mind would, that is there was a religious entity which was urging him to act in a particular manner and he was incapable of reasoning about this because of his thought process problems.


	
	Dr Allnut said that he was fairly confident about his opinion. The degree of diffidence implied by that expression was founded on the absence from the material he received of the Justice Health documentation regarding Mr Hindmarsh’s condition since he was taken into custody for this matter. Dr Furst, as I have said, reviewed that material and having considered his summary of it, I am persuaded that had it been given to Dr Allnut, he would have expressed his views in even firmer language.
	


Determination


	
	This body of evidence, including the opinion of the experts actually persuades me on the balance of probabilities that, at the time he attacked and killed Mr Gumley, Mr Hindmarsh was suffering from a severe case of paranoid schizophrenia. This is undoubtedly a disease of the mind as the Crown and defence agree.
	
	
	On the evidence of the experts, in particular Dr Furst, I accept that the account given by Mr Hindmarsh of his perceptions when he attacked Mr Gumley he was then labouring under a delusional belief system which was symptomatic of his paranoid schizophrenia. I am satisfied when he killed Mr Gumley, Mr Hindmarsh suffered from a disease of the mind giving rise to a defect of reason such that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong according to the accepted standards of ordinary members of the community. I find this because I am satisfied that his condition then was such as left him unable to reason about his actions and beliefs with even a moderate degree of sense and composure.
	
	
	It follows from this finding that I will return a special verdict that Paul Hindmarsh is not guilty of the murder of Joseph Gumley by reason of mental illness. This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the issue of intent or the alternative defence of substantial impairment.
	
	
	As I said at the outset, a special verdict is not the same as a verdict of not guilty. Mr Hindmarsh may not walk free from this court. It is apparent to me from the evidence I have received that his particular disease is a serious illness which is likely to remain resistant to treatment.
	
	
	In these circumstances there is not the slightest question of it being appropriate to release Mr Hindmarsh into the community at this time. I am not satisfied that he does not present a danger to himself or to others. Accordingly the effect of my verdict will be that Mr Hindmarsh will be committed to the long-term supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. Pursuant to s 43(a) of the Act, the Tribunal may not release Mr Hindmarsh into the community unless and until it is satisfied that he will not seriously endanger any person including himself.
	


Orders


	
	My orders are:
	



	
	Under s 38 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), I return a special verdict of not guilty of the charge of murder by reason of mental illness;
	
	
	Under s 39 of the Act, Paul Hindmarsh is to be detained in a correctional facility or at such other place as determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law;
	
	
	I direct the Registrar to notify the Minister for Health of these orders;
	
	
	I direct the Registrar to notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of my special verdict and of these orders. The Registrar is to provide the Tribunal with a copy of these reasons, my orders and the exhibits.

		22 February 2016",2016-02-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768819,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 23) [2016] NSWSC 103,"Judgment


	
	Objection has been taken by counsel for the accused Rogerson to evidence sought to be led by the Crown of the analysis of items of clothing seized from Rogerson’s premises and which were found to contain traces of gunshot residue. Counsel for McNamara does not oppose the admission of the evidence, and indeed has actively supported it.
	
	
	In order to place the issue in its proper context it is necessary for me to set out the background against which it arises.
	


The respective cases


	
	The Crown alleges that the deceased Jamie Gao was shot and killed on 20 May 2014 pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise between the two accused. On the Crown case, the deceased was shot inside storage unit no. 803 at Rent-A-Space at Padstow between about 1:46pm and 2:18pm on that day. In the course of his opening address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor made plain that he was not able to identify which of the accused shot the deceased. However, the Crown properly pointed out that in circumstances where a joint criminal enterprise was alleged, it was not necessary that he do so.
	
	
	McNamara’s case is that Rogerson shot the deceased in his (McNamara’s) presence, without warning. Rogerson’s case is that McNamara shot the deceased prior to him (Rogerson) entering the storage unit. Both deny the existence of a joint criminal enterprise.
	


The evidence 


	
	CCTV cameras were operating in the vicinity of storage unit 803 at the time of the deceased’s murder. Although the footage itself has not been tendered on the present application, a number of still photographs taken from it form part of the material relied upon by the Crown. The following photographs are of particular significance in terms of the present application:
	



	
	Photograph 97 shows the accused Rogerson walking towards storage unit 803 at 1:49pm on 20 May 2014, wearing (inter alia) black pants and white shoes;
	
	
	Photograph 98 shows Rogerson entering storage unit 803 at 1:49:16 on 20 May 2014, at which time the black pants are again visible;
	
	
	Photograph 99 shows Rogerson exiting storage unit 803 at 1:58:15 on 20 May 2014, wearing (inter alia) a cap, black pants and running shoes.
	



	
	The Crown case is that following the shooting of the deceased the two accused attended the premises of Kennards Hire at Taren Point for the purposes of hiring a block and tackle. CCTV cameras were also operating within those premises on that day. Still images taken from that CCTV footage have also been tendered on the present application. The following images are of particular significance:
	



	
	Photograph 118 shows both accused inside the premises of Kennards Hire. Rogerson is seen wearing (inter alia) a cap and black pants. What appears to be a draw string is visible at the waist, giving the appearance of “track suit” pants;
	
	
	Photograph 119 again shows both accused inside the Kennards premises. Rogerson’s cap is clearly visible in that photograph. The front part of it is grey. The area above the brim of the cap appears to bear a logo or insignia, the details of which cannot be identified;
	
	
	Photograph 121 again shows both accused within the premises of Kennards Hire. Rogerson’s cap as previously described is clearly visible.
	



	
	The Crown alleges that both accused then went to the Cote D’Azur Apartments in McDonald Street, Cronulla. CCTV footage was also operating within those premises and still images from that CCTV footage have been tendered on the present application. The following images are of particular significance:
	



	
	Photograph 129 shows both accused in the lift at the apartment block at 5:14pm on 20 May 2014. Rogerson is wearing a cap, the front half of which is light grey. Its appearance is generally consistent with that shown in photograph 119 taken at Kennards Hire. Photograph 129 also shows that the back half of the cap is red. Rogerson is again wearing black pants with a draw string at the front;
	
	
	Photograph 132 taken at 5:26pm shows Rogerson wearing the cap and pants as previously described;
	
	
	Photographs 142(a) and 142(b) were taken in the lift at the apartment block at 7:32:13 and 7:32:50 respectively on the morning of 21 May 2014. In each of those photographs Rogerson is wearing a cap, the appearance of which is consistent with that previously described. The different colours of the cap can clearly be seen in photograph 142(b). In photograph 142(a) Rogerson is wearing a mauve shirt.
	



	
	On 25 May 2014 police executed a search warrant at Rogerson’s residence at 22 Churchill Road, Padstow Heights. Amongst the items seized were:
	



	
	a mauve shirt;
	
	
	a pair of black “tracksuit” type pants;
	
	
	a red and grey cap bearing a “Sydney 2000” logo at the front; and
	
	
	a pair of white running shoes.
	



	
	All of those items were ultimately submitted for scientific testing and are depicted in photographs 139, 140, 142 and 145 tendered on the present application. Items of clothing were also seized from McNamara’s premises and subjected to analysis. However, no gunshot residue was detected on any of them.
	


THE scientific analysis 


	
	Two expert reports of Dr Stephanie Hales have been tendered on the present application. Dr Hales is the manager of the Chemical Criminalistics Unit at the NSW Forensic and Analytical Science Service. She holds a Bachelor of Science (Applied Chemistry) with Honours in Forensic Science, together with a PhD (Forensic Science). She has more than 15 years experience as a Forensic Chemist.
	
	
	In her report of 21 October 2015, Dr Hales explained that she examined each of the articles of clothing seized from Rogerson’s premises as set out in [8] and [9] above. Her examination produced the following results:
	



	
	one particle characteristic of gunshot residue containing lead, antimony and barium, and two indicative particles containing lead and antimony, were detected on the cap;
	
	
	two particles characteristic of gunshot residue containing lead, antimony and barium, and one indicative particle containing lead and antimony, were detected on the mauve shirt;
	
	
	one particle characteristic of gunshot residue containing lead, antimony and barium was detected on the black pants;
	
	
	two indicative particles characteristic of gunshot residue containing lead and antimony were detected on the pockets of the pants;
	
	
	no gunshot residue was detected on the shoes.
	



	
	In light of the results of her analysis, Dr Hales expressed the following opinion (in paragraph 18 of her report):
	


“a. The presence of four particles characteristic of gunshot primer residue and five indicative particles on the samples from ROGERSON’s clothing supports the proposition of firearm association.

b. These particles could have been deposited and retained as described in paragraphs 5 and 7 of my previous expert certificate dated, 28 July 2015, including being accounted for by one or all of the following:

i.   ROGERSON having fired a gun;

ii.   ROGERSON being in close proximity to a gun at the time that it was discharged;

iii.   ROGERSON having come into contact with an object or surface that was contaminated with gunshot residue;

c. It is possible that the two indicative particles on the samples from within the pockets of the pants of Rogerson have been retained after washing of the garment, since pockets are generally more protected from washing action;

d. The absence of gunshot residue on the samples from the clothing of McNamara does not support or preclude the proposition of a firearm association … . Some reasons for the absence of gunshot residue could be:

i.   The clothing was neither in the immediate vicinity of a discharge firearm or in contact with a surface contaminated with gunshot residue;

ii.   Gunshot residue particles were not deposed on the clothing;

iii.   Gunshot residue particles that were originally deposed were lost prior to sampling of the clothing …; or

iv.   Gunshot residue particles were not present on the specific areas sampled.”


	
	In an earlier report of 28 July 2015, which was tendered on the present application, Dr Hales said the following (commencing at paragraph 5):
	


“5. Gunshot residue can be deposed directly during discharge as small particles on the hands, face, hair and clothing of the shooter and on people and surfaces near the immediate firing point. Gunshot residue particles can then be transferred during contact with a direct source such as a fired gun or fired cartridge case. Further transfer of particles can take place through contact with a surface previously contaminated with gunshot residue. The presence of gunshot residue on a person or item is therefore evidence of a firearm association. In some cases, the nature of the firearm and manner of its discharge and handling might be such that gunshot residue particles are in fact not deposed.

6. Gunshot residue particles are rapidly lost from the skin surfaces of a live person, such as their hands, due to normal manual activities. In general, the majority of particles deposed on hands will be lost within the first two hours after a firearm association, with the remainder lost within a further two hours. Washing of hands with soap and water is likely to completely remove any gunshot residue particles present.

7. Clothing retains gunshot residue particles for a longer period of time than skin surfaces, but particles are lost as time elapses due to normal activity. Washing of a garment is likely to completely remove any gunshot residue present.

8. Gunshot residue particles can remain on an undisturbed surface indefinitely. However, when a surface is disturbed, such as by contact with other objects or people, the gunshot residue particles can transfer and be removed from the surface over a period of time.”

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES

Submissions on behalf of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that it was open to the jury to infer that the cap and the black pants which the accused Rogerson was seen to be wearing on 20 May 2014 were two of the items which were later seized from his premises and found to contain gunshot residue. In circumstances where there is a fundamental issue in the case as to the identity of the person who shot the deceased, the Crown submitted that the evidence was clearly relevant.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that there was no basis on which to exclude the evidence pursuant to s. 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”). The Crown submitted that the probative value of the evidence was substantial, and that there was little or no danger of unfair prejudice to the accused if it were admitted. In particular, the Crown pointed to the fact that Dr Hales would be called to explain the results of her analysis, and that in these circumstances there was no danger that the evidence would confuse or mislead the jury.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the evidence of the gunshot residue on the mauve shirt was in a different category, due principally to the fact that there is no evidence that Rogerson was wearing that item of clothing on the day of the deceased’s murder (although there is evidence that he was wearing it on the following day). The Crown described the relevance of the analysis of that item of clothing as “marginal” but did not go so far as to concede that it was irrelevant.
	


Submissions on behalf of McNamara


	
	As I have previously noted, counsel for McNamara supported the admission of the evidence. In short, counsel submitted that the evidence was obviously relevant in circumstances where there was an issue as to the identity of the person who shot the deceased.
	


Submissions on behalf of Rogerson


	
	The position taken by counsel for Rogerson shifted somewhat in the course of argument. Initially, counsel took issue with the evidence of the continuity of the items between the time of seizure and the time of analysis, and argued that because the chain of continuity could not be established, the evidence was not relevant and was therefore inadmissible. However that argument was subsequently abandoned.
	
	
	I had understood counsel to accept, at that point, that the evidence was relevant, such that the only issue was whether or not it should be excluded pursuant to s. 137. However counsel proceeded to submit that the evidence was not relevant and that, in the event that I concluded that it was, it should be excluded pursuant to s. 137 of the Act. He described the issue arising under s. 137 as his “main argument”, in support of which he advanced a number of submissions.
	
	
	Firstly, counsel submitted that there was no evidence to “verify” that the items of clothing which Rogerson was seen to be wearing in the photographs taken on 20 May 2014 were those which were later seized from his premises. Counsel also pointed out that in the case of the mauve shirt, there was no evidence at all that Rogerson had worn that item on the day the deceased was killed.
	
	
	Secondly, it was submitted that the evidence “stood alone”, thus giving rise to a danger that it would be misused by the jury. Counsel described the effect of the admission of the evidence as “catastrophic” to Rogerson’s case.
	
	
	Thirdly, it was submitted that the evidence was subject to “significant qualifications”, and that Dr Hales’ report posed a number of alternative hypotheses, any of which were “real possibilities”. This, it was submitted, also gave rise to the danger of misuse.
	
	
	Fourthly, counsel pointed to what he submitted were a number of shortcomings in the investigation which resulted in what he described as an “evidentiary void”, to which Rogerson had not contributed, and which was said to give rise to unfair prejudice. Such “evidentiary void” was said to be constituted by (inter alia) the fact that:
	



	
	the storage unit was not tested for the presence of gunshot residue;
	
	
	the vehicle in which the deceased’s body was placed immediately following the shooting was not tested;
	
	
	the parking bay in the garage of the Cote D’Azur apartments was not tested; and
	
	
	only two items of McNamara’s clothing were tested for gunshot residue and that these items did not include the clothing that McNamara was seen to be wearing on 20 May 2014.
	



	
	Finally, counsel submitted that in the circumstances he had outlined, the danger that the jury would misuse the evidence grossly outweighed what was said to be its “limited” probative value.
	


THE RELEVANCE OF THE EVIDENCE


	
	There is a clear issue in the present proceedings as to the identity of the person who shot the deceased. Indeed, the written submissions of counsel for Rogerson described this as “the most important fact in issue in the case”.
	
	
	Relevance is governed by s. 55 of the Act which is in the following terms:
	


55 Relevant evidence

(1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.

(2) In particular, evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to:

(a) the credibility of a witness, or

(b) the admissibility of other evidence, or

(c) a failure to adduce evidence.


	
	It has been observed that the test of relevance under s. 55 is a wide one and that the word “could” means “it is possible that it may”: Nye v New South Wales [2002] NSWSC 1270 at [13]. Consistent with the fact that the test is a wide one, the effect of a particular piece of evidence on the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue may be direct or indirect: Zaknic v Svelte Corp Pty Limited (1995) 140 ALR 701 at 704.
	
	
	In my view, the evidence of the gunshot residue found on the cap and black pants is relevant in the sense contemplated by s. 55. Clearly, that evidence has the capacity to rationally affect the assessment of the probability of a principal fact in issue, namely the identity of the person who shot the deceased.
	


Exclusion under section 137


	
	Section 137 of the Act is in the following terms:
	


137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.


	
	In my view, the probative value of the evidence is significant, and I am not persuaded that it is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. In this regard, and in light of the submissions advanced on behalf of Rogerson, a number of observations must be made.
	
	
	Firstly, an inference is clearly available to the jury that the cap and pants which Rogerson was seen to be wearing in the photographs taken on 20 May are the same cap and pants which were seized from his premises some days later. The cap, in particular, is distinctive in colour. Whilst the pants are somewhat more “generic” in their appearance, and quite apart from the inference which I consider is available, it is relevant to note that in the course of the cross-examination of a witness on a pre-trial application (a transcript of which was tendered on the present application) counsel for Rogerson affirmatively put that Rogerson was wearing “dark pants” when seen in the lift of the Cote D’Azur apartments on the afternoon of 20 May 2014.
	
	
	Secondly, the fact that evidence may “stand alone”, and/or be “catastrophic” to an accused’s case does not mean that it is unfairly prejudicial. In Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 McHugh observed (at [91]):
	


“Evidence is not unfairly prejudicial because it makes it more likely that the defendant will be convicted. In R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 141 at 139-140 Hunt CJ at CL pointed out:

‘The prejudice to which each of sections [s135, s136 and s137] refers is not that the evidence merely tends to establish the Crown case; it means prejudice which is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way’ ” (emphasis in original).


	
	In R v Yates [2002] NSWCCA 520 the Court (Wood CJ at CL, Hulme and Buddin JJ) observed (at [252]):
	


“On the other side of the comparison is ""unfair prejudice"", or the danger thereof arising from the evidence. All evidence incriminatory of an accused which has a probative value, necessarily causes prejudice, but this is not the prejudice of which s. 135 to s. 137 (or for that matter s. 192) speak. Prejudice argues for exclusion only if there is a real risk of danger of it being unfair: R v Lisoff [1999] NSWCCA 364. This may arise in a variety of ways, a typical example being where it may lead a jury to adopt an illegitimate form of reasoning, or to give the evidence undue weight. However, insofar as any prejudice flows from the legitimate use of evidence it provides no ground for the exercise of the duty or discretion arising under sections s135-s137”.


	
	Thirdly, there is nothing to suggest that if the evidence is admitted the jury will adopt any illegitimate form of reasoning, or give the evidence undue weight. Whilst the evidence is obviously significant, it is one part (albeit an important part) of an overall circumstantial case against the accused.
	
	
	Fourthly, the fact that the evidence of Dr Hales may support to more than one hypothesis does not lead to a conclusion that the evidence is unfairly prejudicial. In R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142 James J (with whom Rothman and Harrison JJ agreed) said (at [38]):
	


[38] It not infrequently happens that evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown in a criminal trial is open to more than one interpretation or is capable of giving rise to more than one inference. However, provided that the evidence is capable of bearing the interpretation or of giving rise to the interference contended for by the Crown, the fact that the defence can suggest some other interpretation or inference which would be consistent with the innocence of the accused does not, of itself, show that any probative value the evidence has is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

[39] It is part of the function of the jury as the judges of the facts to determine what interpretation should be given to evidence they accept and to determine what inferences should be drawn from evidence they accept. It is frequently part of the function of the jury to determine which, if any, of a number of competing inferences should be drawn.


	
	Finally, whether there exists an “evidentiary void” of the kind suggested will be a matter to be evaluated by the jury. I am in no position at the present time to make any determination as to whether or not the police investigation was lacking in the respects suggested by counsel. No doubt these matters will be the subject of cross-examination in due course and, if appropriate will be the subject of a submission to the jury at the conclusion of the trial. Even if there is such a void, it does not give rise to unfair prejudice in the sense contemplated by s. 137.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, the evidence of the analysis of the cap and black pants should be admitted.
	
	
	The evidence of the analysis of the mauve shirt is in a different category. There is no evidence that Rogerson was wearing that item of clothing on the day of the deceased’s murder. The only evidence is that he was wearing it the following morning. In these circumstances, I propose to reject the tender of the analysis of that item.

		15 June 2016",2016-02-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768823,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 25) [2016] NSWSC 110,"Judgment – EX TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	Earlier today I ruled upon an application made by the Crown for leave to allow the present witness, Justin McLannen, to revive his memory from a statement he made to the police on 16 January 2015. One of the areas in respect of which that leave was sought was contained in paragraph 24 of the statement in which the witness attributed to the accused McNamara the following statement:
	


“‘Do you know who I am?’ I said ‘No’, he said ‘I am an ex-cop from Kings Cross. I was a bikie and I've seen things you could never imagine.’”


	
	I have previously excluded, in the context of an earlier pre-trial application, the reference to ""bikie"".
	
	
	For the reasons that I gave at the time (see R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 24) 2016 NSWSC 105), I refused the Crown leave to allow the witness to revive his memory. Those reasons included the fact that I was not satisfied in all the circumstances that the event was fresh in the memory of the witness at the relevant time.
	
	
	Mr Thomas, who appears for the accused Rogerson, now seeks to elicit that part of the contents of paragraph 24 set out in [1] above (other than the reference to ""bikie"") in the course of cross-examination. Ms Shead who appears for the accused McNamara does not object to the line of questioning, however she objects to the evidence being elicited in a leading form.
	
	
	The question put by Mr Thomas which gave rise to the objection, and which has led to the argument which has ensued was as follows:
	


""Did he tell you he was an ex-cop from Kings Cross?""


	
	That is, on any view of it, a leading question.
	
	
	Whether or not the question ought be allowed is governed by s. 42 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) which is in the following terms:
	


42 Leading questions

(1) A party may put a leading question to a witness in cross-examination unless the court disallows the question or directs the witness not to answer it.

(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to disallow the question or give such a direction, it is to take into account the extent to which:

(a) evidence that has been given by the witness in examination in chief is unfavourable to the party who called the witness, and

(b) the witness has an interest consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner, and

(c) the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination, either generally or about a particular matter, and

(d) the witness’s age, or any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the witness is subject, may affect the witness’s answers.

(3) The court is to disallow the question, or direct the witness not to answer it, if the court is satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used.

(4) This section does not limit the court’s power to control leading questions.


	
	Subsection 42(2) sets out a number of factors which, although they do not constitute an exhaustive list, are matters I must take into account in determining whether or not the question should be permitted.
	
	
	The first of those matters contained in s. 42(2)(a) does not appear to be applicable to the present circumstances. However, those in ss. 42(2)(b) and (c) may be relevant. Those matters focus respectively upon whether or not the witness has an interest consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner, and whether or not the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination, either generally or about a particular matter.
	
	
	Because of the circumstances in which the issue has arisen, the parties have not been able to refer me to any authority which deals with those particular provisions. As to s. 42(2)(b), I do not think it could be said that the witness has an interest consistent with those of Mr Thomas and/or his client. A more difficult question is whether or not the witness could be said to be “sympathetic”, either generally or about a particular matter, in the sense to which s. 42(2)(c) is directed.
	
	
	The Crown urged that I should conclude that the reference to a witness being “sympathetic” in s. 42(2)(c) was a reference to a witness having a particular state of mind. I am not satisfied that the provision should be read in such a narrow way. In my view, it could be said that the witness is sympathetic to the interests of Rogerson, in the sense that he asserts things which may support Rogerson’s position, and which may be the subject of final submissions to the jury.
	
	
	The final mandatory factor to be taken into account is contained in s. 42(2)(d). It concerns the personal characteristics of the witness, including his age and any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which he might be subject which may affect his answer to the question. There is nothing in particular about Mr McLannen’s age which, in my view, might affect his answer. There has been passing reference to his drug use, and to the possibility of him suffering from some form of mental illness in the past. However, the evidence in relation to those matters is vague to say the least.
	
	
	I have observed Mr McLannen closely as he has been giving evidence, which has now extended for more than a day. It has appeared to me that he has had, from time to time, the propensity to agree with propositions put to him simply because they were put in an affirmative way. That, in my view, is a factor which tends against allowing the question.
	
	
	I also take into account ss. 43(3) which requires that I disallow the question if I am satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if a leading question was not used. In my view, the fact that the Crown's application for leave for Mr McLannen to revive his memory, in relation to the same evidence that Mr Thomas now seeks to elicit by way of a leading question, is a factor which tends against allowing the question.
	
	
	That is not to say that Mr Thomas is not at liberty to pursue the issue in another way. The objection which was taken was one as to the form of the question only. No objection has been taken to the general issue being pursued by way of a non-leading question or questions.
	
	
	For these reasons I propose to disallow the question which has been asked. However I will allow Mr Thomas to pursue the issue by putting some other question(s) if he wishes to do so.

		15 June 2016",2016-02-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768837,Huckstadt v R [2016] NSWCCA 22,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Button J.
	
	
	BUTTON J: This is an application for leave to appeal brought by Geoffrey Huckstadt (the applicant) with regard to a sentence imposed upon him by Judge Colefax SC in the District Court at Bathurst on 13 March 2014. The sole ground of appeal asserts that there is erroneous disparity between that sentence and a sentence that was imposed by his Honour on the same occasion upon Shane Galvin (the co-offender).
	


Background


	
	Each offender pleaded guilty to three offences that were committed to the District Court for sentence. They were as follows.
	
	
	First, an offence of supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis. In the case of the applicant, that offence was committed between 5 December 2012 and 3 January 2013. In the case of the co-offender, that offence was committed between 27 September 2012 and 26 October 2012. Pursuant to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), that offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, and has no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Secondly, an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely amphetamine. In the case of the applicant, he committed that offence on 24 January 2013. In the case of the co-offender, he committed the offence on 31 October 2012. Pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, that offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years, and has no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Thirdly, an offence of possessing a prohibited weapon; namely, a taser. The offender committed that offence on 24 January 2013. In the case of the co-offender, he committed the offence separately, but on the same date. Pursuant to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW), that offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. It also carries a standard non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	Each offender also asked his Honour to take into account on sentence a number of further offences by way of a Form 1 pursuant to s 32 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
	
	
	In the case of the applicant, they were as follows: four charges of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug (on 10 October, 16 October, 25 October and 31 October 2012); two charges of possessing a prohibited drug (cannabis leaf, and cannabis seeds); one charge of possessing a prohibited weapon (a body armour vest); and one charge of possessing an unauthorised firearm (a pellet gun).
	
	
	In the case of the co-offender, they were as follows: two charges of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug (on 18 December 2012 and 2 January 2013); one charge of possessing a prohibited drug (cannabis); and one charge of possessing an unauthorised firearm (an air pistol).
	
	
	The Form 1 offences were taken into account with regard to the offence of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug committed by each offender.
	
	
	Each offender received a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty entered in the Local Court.
	


Objective features


	
	These do not require elaborate discussion in light of the single ground of appeal. That is because his Honour said in the remarks on sentence that “for parity considerations I am of the view that in terms of objective criminality, the conduct of each offender was approximately equivalent”. That finding was impugned by neither party before this Court.
	
	
	To state things succinctly, the two offenders, who are cousins, were involved in the supply of substantial quantities of amphetamines in Lithgow and Bathurst. In late 2012 and early 2013, their actions were detected by police by way of telephone intercepts and the use of an undercover operative.
	
	
	On 10 October 2012, the applicant and the co-offender travelled to a meeting place that had been arranged with the undercover operative. The applicant was the driver. The co-offender supplied 53g of amphetamine to the undercover operative in return for $5,600. The drug had a purity of 15%.
	
	
	That conduct constituted the first “sub-offence” in the ongoing supply count against the co-offender, and one of the charges of knowingly taking part in a supply of prohibited drug on the Form 1 of the applicant.
	
	
	On 15 October 2012, the co-offender and the operative arranged to meet the following day. They did so at a car park in Lithgow. Again, the applicant was the driver for the co-offender. The co-offender provided a little under 54g of amphetamine to the operative in return for $4,700. The drug was later found to have a purity of 13%.
	
	
	In the case of the co-offender, that transaction was the second sub-offence of the ongoing drug dealing count. In the case of the applicant, it constituted a further charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug on his Form 1.
	
	
	On 25 October 2012, the co-offender and the operative again met by arrangement in a car park in Lithgow. Yet again, the applicant was the driver. The co-offender supplied a little under 56g of amphetamine to the operative, in exchange for $5,000. The drug was later found to have a purity of 16%.
	
	
	This transaction was the third and final sub-offence in the count of ongoing supply of the co-offender. It formed the basis of the third charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug on the Form 1 of the applicant.
	
	
	On 31 October 2012, the co-offender and the operative met for a fourth time. For a fourth time, the applicant was the driver. On that occasion, a little over 54g of amphetamine was supplied, in exchange for $5,000. The drug was later found to have a purity of 14.5%.
	
	
	This illegal transaction underpinned the offence of supplying a prohibited drug brought against the co-offender. It also constituted the fourth and final charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug on the Form 1 of the applicant.
	
	
	On 28 November 2012, the operative received a telephone call from the co-offender. The latter foreshadowed that the applicant would, from that point on, be taking over the criminal business of the co-offender. Later on the same day, the applicant telephoned the operative, and, having referred to what his cousin had told the operative, said “I’m looking after things now”.
	
	
	Thereafter, on 5 December 2012, the operative met the applicant at the same car park in Lithgow. The co-offender was not present. The applicant supplied 55g of methylamphetamine in exchange for $5,000 in cash. On subsequent analysis, the drug was found to be of 12% purity.
	
	
	That conduct of the applicant constitutes the first sub-offence within his own count of ongoing drug dealing.
	
	
	On 18 December 2012, the applicant and the operative met by arrangement in the village of Hartley, some kilometres east of Lithgow. On this occasion, the co-offender was the driver of the applicant. The applicant supplied the operative with a little under 55g of methylamphetamine, in return for $5,000. The drug was later found to have a purity of 12.5%.
	
	
	This conduct is the second sub-offence in the count of ongoing drug dealing committed by the applicant. It also underpins one of the charges of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug on the Form 1 of the co-offender.
	
	
	On 2 January 2013, the operative and the applicant met yet again by arrangement. For a second time, the co-offender was present as the driver. The applicant provided a little under 56g of methylamphetamine in return for $5,000. The drug, consistent generally with what had been the case on previous occasions, had a purity of 11.5%.
	
	
	That conduct was the third and final sub-offence within the ongoing drug dealing count of the applicant. It also constituted the second charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug on the Form 1 of the co-offender.
	
	
	Approximately three weeks later, on 24 January 2013, the operative and the applicant met again in the car park in Lithgow. The applicant drove himself there, and the co-offender was not present. On this occasion, the applicant supplied almost 142g of a form of amphetamine known as NNDMA. It was subsequently found to have a purity of 14.5%. No money changed hands, because the applicant was arrested immediately after the drugs had been handed over.
	
	
	That conduct underpinned the count of supplying a prohibited drug committed by the applicant.
	
	
	The co-offender was arrested shortly afterwards on the same day. The homes of the applicant and the co-offender were thereafter searched by police.
	
	
	At the home of Mr Galvin, the police found a taser, which underpins the charge brought against him of possessing a prohibited weapon. They also located an air pistol and 7g of cannabis. Those items underpinned two of the charges on the Form 1 brought against him.
	
	
	At the home of the applicant, the police found another taser. That is the separate basis of the count of possessing a prohibited weapon brought against him. They also found a pellet gun, some cannabis leaf, and some cannabis seeds. It is also noteworthy that they located a body armour vest. Those items underpinned various offences contained on the Form 1 of the applicant.
	
	
	In short, it is true that the offences were not identical, and were assigned differently as between the two offenders with regard to whether they were placed before his Honour as substantive matters committed for sentence or placed before his Honour as offences on a Form 1. Nevertheless, it can be seen that the offending of the two offenders was (as his Honour said) broadly equivalent: each of them was involved in the supply of large quantities of amphetamines, often as an assistant to the other, to an undercover operative in return for some thousands of dollars, and each of them possessed small quantities of prohibited drugs at their separate homes, along with other prohibited items.
	
	
	Only one further aspect of the objective features need be noted. That is the fact that an attempt by the applicant in oral evidence in the proceedings on sentence to abrogate the contents of an agreed set of facts – in particular, with regard to the proposition that he had taken over the unlawful business in question from his cousin – was rejected by his Honour in the remarks on sentence.
	


Subjective features of the applicant


	
	The applicant was born in September 1973, and accordingly as at the date of sentence was aged 40 years.
	
	
	He had suffered a damaging childhood, during which he and other members of his family had been the victims of violence at the hands of his alcoholic father. He left school early, and is functionally illiterate. He has four children from previous relationships, but does not maintain contact with them.
	
	
	Regrettably, his mother suffers from a chronic bone disease that affects her mobility. He was actively involved in her full-time care for a number of years, and resided with her at her home at the time of his arrest.
	
	
	His criminal record is not short. It began in March 1988, when he was aged 14 years. He was placed on a bond for 12 months for stealing by the Children’s Court.
	
	
	In April 1989, for two charges of breaking, entering and stealing, two charges of stealing, and one charge of receiving, he was placed on probation for 12 months by the same court.
	
	
	In June 1991, the same court ordered that he perform 100 hours of community service for an offence of breaking, entering and stealing.
	
	
	In January 1992, in the Local Court at Lithgow, he was fined for various traffic offences. In May of the same year, he was fined in the same court for further offences of the same nature.
	
	
	In January 1996, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of six months for repeatedly driving whilst disqualified. On appeal to the District Court at Penrith in 19 May 1997, however, that sentence was reduced to community service and a bond.
	
	
	In May 2003, for an offence of intimidation, he was ordered to perform community service yet again by the Local Court at Lithgow.
	
	
	In April 2005, in the Local Court at Lithgow, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for three months for two charges of threatening injury to a potential witness. One can infer from the fact that an all grounds appeal to the District Court was lodged that those matters had been the subject of pleas of not guilty. In September 2005, the convictions and sentences were confirmed in the District Court at Bathurst.
	
	
	Finally, in May 2005, he had been given short sentences of imprisonment of no more than four months for four offences: resisting a police officer; escaping police custody; escaping lawful custody; and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	In summary with regard to the criminal record of the applicant, it is true to say that he had only ever been dealt with in the Children’s Court or the Local Court. It is also true to say that there was a gap in his offending between 2005 and 2012.
	
	
	On the other hand, his offending had extended over 25 years; had resulted in sentences of imprisonment; featured offences against both property and person; and included offences against public justice.
	
	
	As for remorse, his Honour found it difficult to assess, and had reservations about the applicant’s expressions of remorse, based on the rejected evidence of the applicant in relation to taking over the unlawful business.
	
	
	As for the prospects of rehabilitation of the applicant, his Honour considered the past criminal history, lack of family support, and age of the applicant, and was of the opinion that, at best, his prospects might be regarded as reasonable.
	


Subjective features of the co-offender


	
	The co-offender was born in April 1984, and accordingly was 28 years of age when he was sentenced.
	
	
	He had suffered from addictions to cannabis and gambling for many years. His Honour accepted that the offences under consideration were committed in order to support those addictions.
	
	
	At the time of his arrest, he had been in a relationship with his partner for 13 years. There are three children from that relationship, and his partner remained supportive of him.
	
	
	The criminal record of the co-offender was shorter than that of the applicant. He had been fined in July 2002 by the Local Court at Lithgow for an offence of common assault. In November 2009, the same court had fined him $400 for driving with a low range of the prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood. In April 2011, the same court had placed him on a bond without conviction pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) for damaging property. That was the extent of his recorded offending prior to the matters that brought him before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	His Honour was prepared to sentence the co-offender on the basis that he had no criminal record. The words his Honour used at page 12 of the remarks on sentence were: “Mr Galvin has a very limited criminal history… Whilst these matters are not trivial, it is almost as if he had no prior convictions and accordingly some leniency in the nature of that usually extended to first offenders will be given to him”.
	
	
	In the case of the co-offender, his Honour was not satisfied that he was genuinely remorseful, despite expressions of remorse made in the witness box and to the author of his pre-sentence report.
	
	
	As for the prospects of rehabilitation of the co-offender, his Honour found that the co-offender’s prospects for rehabilitation might be reasonable, given his minimal criminal history, age and family support.
	
	
	To summarise and compare the subjective positions then, each man had not been the beneficiary of privilege or good fortune throughout his life.
	
	
	The applicant had not been properly educated, and had been brutalised as a child. He had been able to maintain employment over the years, and had played at least some role in caring for his ill mother.
	
	
	The co-offender had not been treated so badly as a child, but had developed from an early age a problem with prohibited drugs, and thereafter a problem with gambling, each of which led him to commit the offences under discussion.
	
	
	With regard to each man, his Honour had reservations about finding that each was genuinely remorseful.
	
	
	With regard to each man, his Honour, albeit cautiously, was prepared to find that there were reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, and was perhaps more optimistic in the case of the co-offender.
	


Aspects of the remarks on sentence


	
	As is apparent from the above, there were two significant points of contrast between the two offenders. The first was the difference in their ages as at the date of sentence: 40 years old in the case of the applicant on the day of sentence, and 28 years old in the case of the co-offender. The second was the difference in their criminal antecedents: quite lengthy in the case of the applicant, and minimal in the case of the co-offender.
	
	
	Those differences were quite apparent to his Honour as well. Indeed, throughout the remarks on sentence, his Honour touched upon them more than once.
	
	
	At page 13 of the remarks on sentence, his Honour noted that the applicant is “considerably older than his cousin”, and at page 15 of the remarks on sentence stated that the applicant’s “age is also against him”.
	
	
	At page 14 of the remarks on sentence, his Honour said that, “Unlike his cousin Mr Huckstadt has a serious criminal history”. As well as that, at page 15 of the remarks on sentence, his Honour said that, “Unlike Mr Galvin, Mr Huckstadt does not have a minimal criminal history or strong support from his family”.
	


Sentences imposed


	
	His Honour imposed an aggregate sentence upon each offender.
	
	
	In the case of the applicant, the following indicative sentences were provided. For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis, an indicative head sentence of seven years. For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, an indicative head sentence of three years. For the offence of possessing a prohibited weapon, an indicative head sentence of six months.
	
	
	His Honour applied the utilitarian discount of 25% to the aggregate head sentence. The result was that his Honour imposed upon the applicant an aggregate head sentence of six years and nine months, with an aggregate non-parole period of five years, to date from 5 November 2013. That backdate is not impugned.
	
	
	Turning to the co-offender, the following indicative sentences were provided. For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis, an indicative head sentence of six and a half years. For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, an indicative sentence of two and a half years. For the offence of possessing a prohibited weapon, an indicative sentence of six months.
	
	
	Again, his Honour applied the utilitarian discount to the aggregate head sentence. In the ultimate, his Honour imposed upon the co-offender an aggregate head sentence of five years and seven months, with an aggregate non-parole period of four years and two months, to date from 18 October 2013.
	
	
	I interpolate to say that I respectfully consider that it was an error for the sentencing judge to apply the utilitarian discount to the aggregate head sentences for each offender, rather than to each of the individual indicative sentences, before turning to the expression of principles of totality by determining the aggregate sentence: see JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [39]. That error, however, is inconsequential for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, it is not the basis of a ground of appeal.
	
	
	Secondly, one can, as a matter of mathematics, readily determine what the indicative sentences would have been if the utilitarian discount had been correctly applied to each one. In the case of the applicant: for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis, an indicative sentence of five years and three months; for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, an indicative sentence of two years and three months; and for the offence of possessing a prohibited weapon, an indicative sentence of four months and fifteen days. In the case of the co-offender: for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis, an indicative sentence of four years, ten months and fifteen days; for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, an indicative sentence of one year, ten months and fifteen days; and for the offence of possessing a prohibited weapon, an indicative sentence of four months and fifteen days.
	
	
	Thirdly, a ground of erroneous disparity must inevitably focus on the aggregate sentences actually imposed, not the sentences merely indicated.
	
	
	In short, it can be seen that the aggregate head sentence imposed upon the applicant is longer than the aggregate head sentence imposed upon the co-offender by one year and two months, and the aggregate non-parole period imposed upon the applicant is longer than the aggregate non-parole period imposed upon the co-offender by 10 months.
	


Ground of appeal


	
	One ground was notified and pressed, as follows:
	


The Applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance because of the different sentence imposed on the co-offender.

Submissions 


	
	Counsel for the applicant accepted that it was open to his Honour to impose both an aggregate head sentence and an aggregate non-parole period upon the applicant that were longer than those imposed upon the co-offender. He submitted, however, that the differentiation between the head sentences and the non-parole periods was too pronounced, bearing in mind the equivalence in objective matters, and the broadly similar subjective features.
	
	
	He declined the invitation of members of the Court to identify the quantum of differentiation in the aggregate head sentences and non-parole periods (in terms of months or years) that he would have accepted was within the sentencing discretion available to his Honour. As a result, the Court was unassisted as to the point beyond which counsel submitted erroneous disparity commenced to occur. I also consider that one can infer from that approach that counsel appreciated that answering our enquiries directly would not have assisted his case.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant engaged in a rather complex analysis of the differing indicative sentences that his Honour had provided with regard to each offender, and submitted that, combined with the degree of implicit totality that must be reflected in the aggregate sentences ultimately imposed, they show that his Honour drew an inappropriate distinction between the two offenders.
	
	
	He submitted that the approach of his Honour to the criminal record of the co-offender (namely, regarding him effectively as a first offender) was overly generous. That was said to be because, in his oral evidence in the proceedings on sentence, the co-offender had accepted that he had been in the habit of supplying prohibited drugs for some time before his arrest, quite apart from the matters to which he had pleaded guilty.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that the difference in age between the two men was of no great moment, bearing in mind that the co-offender was not a person who was close to being a juvenile at the time of the alleged offences; on the contrary, he was an entire decade past that point.
	
	
	In short it was said that there should be some downward adjustment in both the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period imposed upon the applicant. If the Court came to that view, affidavits were read on the usual contingent basis that they should be taken into account on resentence.
	
	
	The response of the Crown may be stated concisely. It was that, in all the circumstances, the differentiation in the sentences imposed was perfectly open to Judge Colefax, and no error had been demonstrated by the applicant.
	


Determination


	
	I do not accept the fundamental submission of counsel for the applicant. To my mind, the differentiation in the sentences imposed upon the applicant and the co-offender was well open to the discretion reposed in his Honour. That is so for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, there was an undoubted distinction to be drawn between the two offenders based upon their criminal records. It will be recalled that his Honour approached the co-offender as a man with effectively no criminal record. It was perfectly open to his Honour to take that generous approach to the minimal pre-existing criminality of the co-offender. And it was also quite open to his Honour to contrast sharply the position of the co-offender with that of the applicant who had, after all, committed offences over a period of many years; been imprisoned for some of them; committed offences of violence; and committed two offences against public justice.
	
	
	Speaking generally, an offender who has no, or no meaningful, criminal record can have that taken into account in his or her favour in at least two ways: first, in the form of “credit” for a previously blameless life; and, secondly, by way of a finding that a person who has never offended before potentially has good prospects of rehabilitation. Neither of those considerations applied to the applicant in this case.
	
	
	Secondly, it is true that the co-offender was not aged (for example) 18 years and 3 months at the time of the commission of the offences. Still and all, I consider it well open to a sentencing judge to draw a distinction between, on the one hand, an offender who is in his late twenties (and who can still be described as a young man) and, on the other hand, an offender who is entering his forties (and who must be described as being in early middle age).
	
	
	Thirdly, each of these factors – age and criminal record – has recently been explicitly referred to by the High Court of Australia as legitimately founding differentiation in sentence: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 at [31]; (2011) 244 CLR 462 (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ).
	
	
	Fourthly, this was not a case in which one judge sentenced one offender, and another judge the other. To the contrary, what should happen in the circumstances is exactly what did happen: one judicial officer heard both matters simultaneously, and was in a position to consider the interrelationship between the objective and subjective features of the two offenders in an overarching way.
	
	
	Fifthly, the degree of differentiation between the sentences actually imposed upon the two men was by no means marked: as I have shown, the aggregate head sentence imposed upon the applicant is longer than that imposed upon the co-offender by no more than one year and two months, and the aggregate non-parole period imposed upon the applicant is only 10 months longer than the non-parole period imposed upon the co-offender. And yet it is well-established that, for a ground founded on erroneous disparity to succeed, the asserted disparity must be “marked”, thereby “giving rise to the appearance of injustice”: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [31]-[32].
	
	
	Sixthly, to the extent that his Honour heard from both men in the witness box, his Honour was in a position to form an impression of both of them, an advantage that is very largely unavailable to members of this Court when reading transcripts of proceedings on sentence.
	
	
	Seventhly, it needs to be borne in mind that questions of asserted disparity are not to be resolved by way of rigid mathematical comparison between two or more sentences. Just as a broad discretion is reposed in sentencing judges when they are dealing with a single offender, so also there is no single “right answer” with regard to the degree to which the sentences imposed upon two or more co-offenders should differ. That is a matter of broad evaluative judgment by sentencing judges at first instance, not minute dissection by this Court.
	
	
	Eighthly, seeking to “disentangle” the indicative sentences that underpinned the aggregate sentences actually imposed, and to discern the degree to which principles of totality ameliorated the total period of incarceration of each man is, to my mind, an arcane and inapposite exercise. That is especially the case in light of the (inconsequential) error that occurred here, whereby the utilitarian discount was applied to the aggregate head sentences and not to the indicative sentences. Rather, the task of this Court is to consider whether the distinction actually drawn in the sentences actually imposed was so sharp as to be unavailable to the discretion of his Honour, bearing in mind all of the salient objective and subjective features actually found by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Ninthly and finally, in any event, even if one compares the (notionally discounted) indicative sentences with regard to each offender, the difference between them was not great. Nor indeed was the difference with regard to the implicit partial concurrence that was ultimately afforded to each offender: one year and two months in the case of Mr Galvin, and 9 months in the case of Mr Huckstadt.
	
	
	In short, to my mind, there were two separate bases upon which his Honour was quite entitled to draw a distinction between the applicant and the co-offender, and to reflect that distinction in the aggregate sentences actually imposed. I consider that there is no basis upon which the applicant can experience a justifiable sense of grievance, objectively speaking, when he compares the aggregate sentence imposed upon him with that imposed upon the co-offender: see Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606. For that reason, I do not consider that, examined together, the two sentences demonstrate erroneous disparity; to the contrary, I consider that the moderate level of ultimate differentiation in the two sentences was well within the discretion reposed in the learned sentencing judge.
	
	
	In the circumstances, there is no need for me to refer to the evidence that was read on a contingent basis.
	


Conclusion


	
	The ground of appeal was arguable, and was fully argued before us. Accordingly, leave should be granted, but the appeal should be dismissed.
	


Proposed orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Button J.

		24 February 2016",2016-02-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768845,R v Baptist [2016] NSWDC 83,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Many in the community seem puzzled by the attitude that the law takes to drug use. Many question why harsh penalties need to be imposed on those who use drugs and even those who supply drugs. Those of us who have dealt in the criminal law for many years know all too well the effects of drugs on individual members of the community and the community in general. Drug users often become terrible people. They lie and they cheat, and, more importantly perhaps, they commit significant crimes in order to fund their drug addiction.
	
	
	Few offences which come before the Court for sentence, particularly offences of break, enter and steal and robbery, do not involve a drug user desperate for money to fund their addiction. It is for this reason that when a drug supplier appears for sentence significant and even harsh sentences are appropriate. That will explain the sentence I will announce on the offender who appears for sentence today, Matthew Brian Baptist.
	
	
	He is to be sentenced for supplying a significant quantity of amphetamine, 27.77 grams, which was contained in about a hundred separate pills. He is also to be sentenced for supplying .36 grams of Lysergide. That drug, a significant proportion of the quantity which is described as the commercial quantity, was divided up into 39 separate dosage units.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty to both offences in order to reflect the utilitarian value of those pleas. I will impose upon him a sentence which is 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	The offences came to the attention of police in the following manner. They were at a dance party, called the Midnight Mafia Dance Party held at Sydney Olympic Park. The offender went to a cloak room, where he left his belongings. Police searched one of the bags left by the offender and discovered a significant quantity of currency, $2,695. Police therefore waited for the person who had checked the bag to come and collect it. The offender and another man arrived at 5.15 and collected the bags. Police intervened. The offender admitted that he owned a particular bag. Police then searched the offender and found the drugs that I have referred to.
	
	
	No‑one actually counted the number of pills regrettably. The offender told police that there were 100 tablets in his possession. I will sentence him on the basis that that is an accurate assessment.
	
	
	But that was not the extent of his drug supply activities that evening. He told me that he had supplied to drug‑using friends about 50 tablets already by the time he was arrested. So the offender went to the dance party with about 150 tablets of amphetamine with a significant quantity of LSD, supplied about 50 tablets and had 100 tablets still in his possession which he intended to supply in the future. It is obvious that that was trafficking to a substantial degree. I will return to the significance of that finding in a little while.
	
	
	Along with a lot of other drug suppliers, the offender did what he did to support his own drug habit. He was not in this to fund a champagne lifestyle. He was at a stage of his life where his social life really revolved around dance parties and drug use. He would drink alcohol during the week and on weekends would consume drugs and go to the parties. Of course drugs are expensive, it is one of the reasons people commit crimes to fund their drug habit, and so he found himself in a position where he could not afford to pay for any more drugs. At that stage he had a choice, he could recognise that he just simply could not afford the drugs, or - and this is what he did do - he decided that he would commit a very serious criminal offence, supplying drugs, in order to fund his own drug habit.
	
	
	When we think about moral culpability of offenders we often examine the level of personal choice that goes into a decision to commit a crime. I repeat, the offender had a personal choice to make when he could not pay for his own drugs. Was he to accept reality and simply not use them, or was he, and this is the choice he made, to become a drug supplier? There is no suggestion at all that the offender’s moral culpability should in any way be reduced because of the circumstances he was in when he made that decision.
	
	
	In common with many drug suppliers, since arrest he has improved his life. He claims that he no longer uses drugs. He says that he goes to Narcotics Anonymous. He is being counselled by a psychologist and he accepts what he should have seen before, how his behaviour has affected so many people, not only his family and friends who have all been affected by his arrest and the disclosure of his misconduct, but also the people to whom he supplied drugs. He says, reasonably accurately, that drugs have destroyed his life and what he did when he was supplying drugs to others was to aid in harming their lives as well.
	
	
	The offender had an upbringing which was less than ideal. His father was a drug user. His parents separated and some of the men his mother associated with after separation treated the offender badly. At one stage DoCS were involved. For a while he was a successful motocross rider. That was an activity he enjoyed and was good at, but he gave it up all of a sudden one day because of pressures from his father. He began to use drugs and gradually got to the position that he finds himself in today.
	
	
	The abandonment of the sport of motocross is regarded by Mr Borenstein, the psychologist, as important. He said that motocross gave Mr Baptist stability, purpose and a sense of success, which all but evaporated when he decided to abandon the sport on impulse. It goes without saying that many people give up a sport that they love without resorting to drug use in order to fill the gap.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. He is supported in court today by members of his family. He has a relationship with a young woman, and he has prospects for the future as regards his employment and his desire to start up a spray painting business.
	
	
	Many people would ask what is the point of punishing someone who has achieved so much in recent times. The answer is as I think I expressed at the beginning, to deter others who might think that they should resort to drug supply as a way of funding their own drug use, because of the harm that such behaviour creates.
	
	
	Mr Singh, who appeared for the offender today, conceded appropriately that his client was trafficking to a substantial degree. He also conceded that there were no exceptional circumstances to which attention had previously been paid when courts applied what I will call the rule that those who traffic to a substantial degree must go to gaol full time unless there are exceptional circumstances. Mr Singh submitted that even though such concessions would in the past have meant that his client had to go to gaol full time, the rule was laid down at a time when intensive corrections orders were not available.
	
	
	Given the absence of authority from the Court of Criminal Appeal as to whether the rule still applies now that ICOs are available, it is for sentencing judges like me to determine whether those who traffic to a substantial degree where there are no exceptional circumstances still need to go to full‑time gaol.
	
	
	Mr Singh pointed to a number of circumstances which would suggest that his client should receive the benefit of a sentence much more lenient than full‑time custody. He said that in contrast to many other cases, his client’s behaviour was towards the lower end of seriousness. He suggested that supplying to your friends just to supply your own habit is less serious than approaching total strangers and seeing if they wanted to buy drugs.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence that he only supplied to friends that he had met at dance parties. He was not challenged on that evidence. I will therefore sentence him on the basis that what he said was true. I do have some scepticism as to the accuracy of the evidence though, given the number of drugs found in his possession and the number of pills he was prepared to have admitted to supplying earlier in the evening. Despite that, as I have said, I will sentence him on the basis that he did not supply to strangers, just those who he knew were already drug users.
	
	
	I turn now to the question as to the appropriate sentence. In the event that I have decided that a sentence of two years or less should be imposed or is likely to be imposed, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that an ICO is available. But should one be imposed in the present case, there is no doubt that compared with full-time custody an ICO is lenient. Intensive corrections orders do restrict the liberty of an offender through curfews, community service, monitoring by Probation and Parole, but there is a vast difference between those limitations and the restrictions which apply when someone is sent to gaol full time.
	
	
	Although of course an ICO is a custodial sentence, there is a vast difference in the way that sentence is served when compared to a sentence of full-time custody. That suggests that where general deterrence is required, an ICO may often be insufficient to act as a general deterrent. ICOs have the benefit of course of focussing much more on rehabilitation than is possible in a custodial setting where prisons are vastly overcrowded and resources are stretched. In the present case, to a large extent, the offender does not need rehabilitation, he needs support with his efforts which he has previously undertaken, but that is not a reason not to impose an ICO. Many ICOs are imposed on people who need no rehabilitation at all.
	
	
	In my view having decided that a sentence of two years’ imprisonment or less is likely, it is appropriate to refer the offender for assessment as to his suitability to serve a sentence by means of an intensive corrections order. That of course does not mean that such a sentence will be imposed. A lot will depend on the ICO assessment report which is prepared by the authorities. Should the assessment come back indicating unsuitability, I will have no hesitation in imposing a sentence of full-time imprisonment. Even if the assessment does suggest Mr Baptist’s suitability, there is no guarantee that that is the sentence I will impose. As I have said a lot will depend on the contents of the assessment report.
	
	
	I will therefore continue Mr Baptist’s bail and refer him for assessment as to his suitability to serve a sentence of imprisonment by means of an intensive corrections order.

		23 May 2016",2016-02-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768848,Heath v Regina [2016] NSWCCA 24,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with McCallum J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with McCallum J.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: Nigel Heath seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him after he pleaded guilty in the District Court to two market misconduct offences brought against him by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (in effect, on behalf of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission). The first was an offence of market manipulation contrary to s 1041A(c) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The second was a matched trade offence contrary to s 1041B(1)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	Section 1041A(c) prohibits the carrying out of transactions that have or are likely to have the effect of creating an artificial price for trading in financial products on a financial market. Section 1041B(1)(b) prohibits acts that have or are likely to have the effect of creating or causing the creation of a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price for trading in financial products in a financial market. The penalty (stated in schedule 3 to the Act) for each offence is imprisonment for 10 years or a fine determined according to the greater of the number of penalty units specified in the schedule or, if ascertainable, three times the total value of the benefits obtained (or both).
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced by King SC DCJ as follows:
	



	
	for the matched trade offence, to a term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 25 September 2015 and expiring on 24 March 2017;
	
	
	for the market manipulation offence, to a term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing 3 months later, that is, on 25 December 2015 and expiring on 24 December 2017.
	



	
	The judge directed that, after serving 9 months, the applicant be released on a recognisance release order in the sum of $10,000 without surety to be of good behaviour for a period of 18 months.
	


Proceedings on sentence


	
	The facts relied upon by the Crown at the proceedings on sentence were proved by the tender of an agreed statement of facts. In addition, ASIC provided a statement prepared by one of its lawyers setting out the extent of the applicant’s co-operation in the investigation (which was considerable).
	
	
	The defence material included a lengthy affidavit sworn by the applicant together with two affidavits sworn by his wife, two medical reports and five character references. Mrs Heath’s affidavit addressed matters relating to a serious health condition suffered by their daughter which was relied upon to establish exceptional circumstances of family hardship. The parties also provided lengthy written submissions to the sentencing judge together with schedules of sentences imposed in other market misconduct cases.
	
	
	The Crown did not require the applicant or any of his witnesses for cross-examination.
	


Circumstances of the offences


	
	The agreed statement of facts stated that the applicant has traded in shares in public listed companies for over 20 years. He had previously worked as a solicitor, holding a Bachelor of Laws and a Master of Laws. During the period of the offending, trading in shares and contracts for difference (“CFDs”) was his primary source of income. The agreed facts explained CFDs as follows:
	


CFD trading can multiply gains or losses arising from share price movements, in comparison to trading in the underlying security, because the trading is usually leveraged. This means that CFD investors are required to pay a fraction of the value of the underlying security but can obtain the benefit or detriment of changes in the price of the security. Accordingly, for the same amount of money, CFD investors can purchase a larger number of CFDs than underlying securities and can potentially make correspondingly larger profits or losses from relatively small changes in price. CFD trading effectively magnifies profits or losses.


	
	At the commencement of the offending the applicant had (inter alia) a share and CFD portfolio worth approximately $1.4 million with net equity of about $850,000 and had recently sold a family home for $7.20 million with net equity of about $4.7 million.
	
	
	As at the time of the proceedings on sentence, the applicant traded through nine separate online trading accounts with two brokers (five equities trading accounts with ETRADE Australia Securities Limited and four CFD trading accounts with First Prudential Markets Pty Ltd). It was noted in the agreed facts that ASIC did not assert the accounts were opened for any improper purpose but that the commission of the offences was facilitated by having multiple accounts. Some of the accounts were held jointly with or in the name of the applicant’s wife or various companies but it was common ground that the applicant carried out all transactions on those accounts.
	
	
	In about 2002 the applicant began buying shares in Petsec Energy Limited (known as PSA), an Australian company engaged in oil and gas exploration and production. In about 2012 he also began buying contracts for difference (“CFDs”) relating to those shares. Shares in Petsec have traded on the Australian Stock Exchange (“ASX”) since 1980. The applicant was described in the statement of facts as “a long term accumulator” of shares in Petsec.
	
	
	The agreed facts were that, during the period of offending, the applicant acquired larger volumes of shares and CFDs in Petsec, peaking in October 2012, when he held approximately 2.7 million shares and approximately 2.3 million CFDs with an approximate market value of $673,386.
	
	
	The market manipulation offence was described in the statement of facts in the following terms:
	


[between 16 February 2012 and 19 August 2013], Mr Heath carried out 138 transactions of financial products relating to PSA shares on the ASX that had the effect of creating an artificial price for trading in the ordinary shares of PSA on the ASX, contrary to ss 1041A(c) and 1311(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (“the Act”).


	
	The 138 transactions were summarised in schedule 1 to the statement of facts. Each was an online purchase of shares or CFDs through one of the two brokers. The statement of facts did not provide any context to allow an assessment of the significance of those trades. It did not say whether the shares were thinly traded or provide any detail as to the frequency of trades in those shares. Nor did it explain whether, in each instance, the applicant’s bid must have matched an offer to sell at the same price or whether the ASX system allowed the match of a bid at a specified price with an offer to sell at a lower price.
	
	
	The matched trade offence related primarily to Petsec but also to shares and CFDs in a small number of other public listed companies. That offence was described in the agreed facts as follows:
	


[between 2 July 2012 and 11 October 2013], Mr Heath carried out 30 transactions of financial products relating to the relevant securities (primarily PSA) on the ASX that had the effect of creating a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price for trading in the Relevant Securities on the ASX, contrary to ss 1041B(1)(b) and 1311(1) of the Act.


	
	The 30 transactions were summarised in schedule 2 to the statement of facts.
	
	
	The elements of Commonwealth offences are addressed in chapter 1 of the Criminal Code. The Code specifies that an offence consists of physical elements and fault elements. A physical element can be conduct, a result or a circumstance in which conduct or a result of conduct occurs. The market manipulation offence had two physical elements: a conduct element (carrying out the transactions) and a result element (the transactions had the effect of creating an artificial price for trading in the ordinary shares of PSA on the ASX). The fault element for the result element is recklessness (see clause 5.6(2) of the Code) but that element is able to be satisfied by proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness (see clause 5.4(4) of the Code). The agreed facts did not specify which was relied upon in the present case.
	
	
	The physical elements of the matched trade offence were, similarly, the conduct of carrying out the transactions and a result (that the transactions had the effect of creating or causing the creation of “a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price” for trading in Petsec and other shares). As with the market manipulation offence, the fault element was recklessness but proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness satisfied that element. In respect of the matched trade offence, it was an agreed fact (recorded at paragraph 38 of the statement of facts) that the applicant carried out the matched trades with the intention of creating a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price for trading in the relevant shares. In other words, the fault element for the “result” element was intention. That issue is considered further below.
	
	
	It would have been preferable if the agreed facts had set out the elements of each offence at the outset of the document and clearly particularised the agreed proof of each element. As to the market manipulation offence, to the extent that the statement of facts addressed that issue, it tended to conflate the physical and fault elements of the “result” element of the offence. For example, paragraph 25 of the statement said (emphasis added):
	


During the First Relevant Period, Mr Heath, contrary to s 1041A(c) of the Act, carried out 138 separate transactions of financial products relating to PSA shares on the ASX that had the effect of creating an artificial price for trading in the ordinary shares of PSA on the ASX (“the 138 Transactions”). In particular, each of the 138 Transactions, the details of which are set out in Schedule 1, was carried out by Mr Heath for the sole or dominant purpose of maintaining or increasing the price of PSA shares on the ASX.


	
	That paragraph makes it clear that the applicant acknowledged that his dominant purpose was to maintain or increase the price of the shares and that his trading had that effect. What it does not do is explain or evaluate the extent to which that was achieved.
	
	
	Similarly, paragraph 22 of the agreed facts said (emphasis added):
	


Mr Heath entered into the transactions relevant to the Market Manipulation Offence and the Matched Trade Offence for the sole or dominant purpose of maintaining or increasing the share price for the Relevant Securities. Such an outcome personally advantaged Mr Heath by allowing him to:

avoid Margin Calls;

avoid having to contribute more funds to his CFD Trading Accounts; and/or

increase the Free Equity in his CFD Trading Accounts, which he could use to trade in shares, or maintain or take other CFD positions.


	
	A similar comment may be made about that paragraph. It does not explain the duration or significance of the impact of the applicant’s trading on the share price in the context of the overall volume and frequency of trading in the shares or by reference to the range of share price throughout the relevant period. The actual effect of the transactions on the market was an important part of the assessment of objective gravity.
	
	
	The elements of the offences are of course admitted by the applicant’s plea of guilty. Each physical element is admitted, in terms, in the agreed facts. I do not seek to traverse those matters. My point is to observe that, apart from some arithmetic analysis of the transactions primarily by reference to the circumstance of the applicant (considered below), the agreed facts provided little by way of analysis or explanation of the nature or significance of the effect of the applicant’s trading on the market (as distinct from his purpose).
	
	
	The passage of the agreed facts set out above proved that, to the extent that the applicant’s transactions achieved the object of maintaining or increasing the share price, that would allow him to avoid margin calls; avoid having to contribute more funds to his CFD trading accounts; “and/or” increase the free equity in his CFD trading accounts, “which he could use to trade in shares, or maintain or take other CFD positions”.
	
	
	Considerable detail was provided in relation to those matters, including dollar sums attributed to the notional gain obtained as a result of the applicant’s trading. It is appropriate to set out the relevant passages of the statement of facts in full:
	


Margin Calls and Free Equity

17.   Mr Heath traded CFDs through his four Trading Accounts held with First Prudential Markets Pty Ltd (“FP Markets”). FP Markets is an Australian financial services company that offers CFDs to its clients through a Direct Market Access model (“DMA Model”). Under its DMA Model, FP Markets automatically hedged its exposure to any CFD position executed by a client by taking an equivalent one-for-one position in the underlying shares. Mr Heath was able to see his CFD positions translate to an actual buy or sell order in the underlying shares on the ASX. This hedging mechanism can result in CFD trades having an immediate impact on the price for the underlying shares in the same way as trading in shares directly.

18.   FP Markets required Mr Heath, as a CFD client, to make an initial cash deposit or to have funds available in his account at the time of entering into a CFD, which is referred to as a “Margin”.

19.   The amount of free funds available for a client to enter into new CFD positions, withdraw funds from the account and/or absorb any margin calls made on the account is referred to as “Free Equity”. Mr Heath was able to view, at all relevant times, the amount of Free Equity in each of his CFD Trading Accounts with FP Markets. If Mr Heath’s Free Equity fell below a specified value, FP Markets could require additional funds to be deposited into his account or could require him to reduce his CFD positions (“Margin Call”).

20.   FP Markets continuously calculated a client’s Free Equity in each CFD Trading Account by calculating the difference between the share prices of the underlying shares at the time the contracts were created and until each contract was closed out. For example, where Mr Heath entered into a long position, if the price of the underlying shares increased on the ASX, Mr Heath’s Free Equity immediately rose. Conversely, if the price of the underlying shares fell, the Free Equity simultaneously fell and, depending on his overall Free Equity in a particular CFD Trading Account, Mr Heath may be at risk of receiving a Margin Call. Therefore, the prevailing market price of the underlying shares was directly related to Mr Heath’s Free Equity.

21.   During the Relevant Period, Mr Heath held large volumes of shares and CFDs in PSA, with his peak exposure exceeding 5 million shares (comprised of approximately 2.7 million PSA shares and approximately 2.3 million PSA CFDs). Accordingly, the share price of PSA was central to Mr Heath maintaining Free Equity. The higher the PSA share price, the more Free Equity that was available to Mr Heath, which reduced the likelihood of Margin Calls and allowed Mr Heath to enter into new CFDs. During the Second Relevant Period, Mr Heath received a number of Margin Calls due to falls in the PSA share price reducing his Free Equity.

22.   Mr Heath entered into the transactions relevant to the Market Manipulation Offence and the Matched Trade Offence for the sole or dominant purpose of maintaining or increasing the share price for the Relevant Securities. Such an outcome personally advantaged Mr Heath by allowing him to:

avoid Margin Calls;

avoid having to contribute more funds to his CFD Trading Accounts; and/or

increase the Free Equity in his CFD Trading Accounts, which he could use to trade in shares, or maintain or take other CFD positions.

23.   Mr Heath’s stated purpose for carrying out the trading constituting the Market Manipulation Offence and the Matched Trade Offence was to provide price support for the Relevant Securities (in particular, PSA), and to minimise or avoid Margin Calls.

24.   Since 2002, Mr Heath had been an accumulator of PSA shares. During the Relevant Period (a period of 20 months) Mr Heath’s total PSA shareholding increased month-on-month (with the exception of a small decline in one month only). Mr Heath considered himself something of a ‘champion’ for PSA as a stock. This was Mr Heath’s main motivation for providing price support for PSA across the Relevant Period.

26.   Through the 138 Transactions, Mr Heath caused the price of PSA shares on the ASX to rise:

on four occasions by 1.5 cents, representing increases of between 7.9% and 10.3% of the PSA share price;

on 65 occasions by 1 cent, representing increases of between 4.4% and 11.5% of the PSA share price; and

on 69 occasions by 0.5 cents, representing increases of between 4.0% and 5.0% of the PSA share price.

27.   As identified in Schedule 1, the 138 Transactions had the following features:

the volume of shares traded on each occasion was relatively small, ranging from 5 to 50,000 with an average of 3,221;

the value of the shares traded on each occasion was relatively low, ranging from $1 to $8,750 with an average of $496;

each Transaction caused an increase in the PSA share price, ranging from 4.0% to 11.5% with an average of 5.6%.

most (but not all) of the Transactions resulted in an increase in Mr Heath’s Free Equity, ranging from $40 to $9,437 with an average of $3,386; and

each Transaction resulted in an increase in the market value of Mr Heath’s PSA holding, ranging from $15,878 to $46,928, with an average of $24,009.

28.   As those figures illustrate, in respect of the 138 transactions, Mr Heath purchased small volumes of PSA shares or CFDs, with an average value of $496, in such a way that they caused an average increase in his Free Equity by more than 6 times that amount, namely, $3,386. Further, the 138 Transactions caused an average increase in the market value of his PSA holding by more than 48 times the average value of the Transaction.

29.   Mr Heath undertook each of the 138 Transactions for the sole or dominant purpose of maintaining or increasing the price of PSA shares on the ASX, for the reasons identified in paragraphs 23 and 24 above, and having the effect identified in paragraph 22 above.


	
	The statement of facts also provided a detailed explanation as to how the applicant achieved an impact on price, as follows:
	


29.   (continued) The increase in price was achieved by Mr Heath through the following methods of manipulative trading (as identified in the column headed “Market Manipulation Method” in the table at Schedule 1).

1st Method – Price Support

30.   In relation to 123 of the 138 Transactions, Mr Heath purchased PSA CFDs or PSA shares to maintain or increase the price of PSA shares. On many occasions Mr Heath acted swiftly in response to a fall in the price of PSA shares. Mr Heath’s intention in carrying out these 123 Transactions was to restore the price of PSA shares to its previous level or higher. For example, on 24 July 2013:

at 10:43:12 am the price of PSA shares was 12.5c.

at 10:57:25 am Mr Heath entered an order to buy 1,000 PSA CFDs at 13c (equating to $130). This CFD purchase, entered through FP Markets DMA Model, caused an order to buy 1,000 PSA shares at 13c to be entered onto the ASX. This order traded immediately resulting in a price increase in PSA shares from 12.5c to 13c (or 4.0%).

immediately after that trade, the price of PSA shares fell to 12c due to trades executed by persons other than Mr Heath.

at 11:37:42 am Mr Heath entered an order to buy 1,000 PSA CFDs at 12.5c (equating to $125). This CFD purchase caused an order to buy 1,000 PSA shares at 12.5c to be entered onto the ASX, which traded immediately resulting in a second price increase in PSA shares from 12c to 12.5c (or 4.2%).

immediately after that trade, the price of PSA shares fell again to 12c due to trades executed by persons other than Mr Heath.

at 11:44:52 am Mr Heath entered an order to buy 500 PSA CFDs at 12.5c (equating to $63). This CFD purchase caused an order to buy 500 PSA shares at 12.5c to be entered onto the ASX which traded immediately resulting in a third price increase in PSA shares from 12c to 12.5c (or 4.2%).

at 11:45:51 am, one minute later, Mr Heath entered an order to buy 500 PSA CFDs at 13c (equating to $65). This CFD purchase caused an order to buy 500 PSA shares at 13c to be entered onto the ASX, which traded immediately, resulting in a fourth price increase in PSA shares from 12.5c to 13c (or 4.0%).

at 1:04:17 pm the price of PSA shares fell to 12.5c due to trades executed by persons other than Mr Heath.

at 1:05:00 pm Mr Heath entered an order to buy 1,200 PSA CFDs at 13c (equating to $156). This CFD purchase caused an order to buy 1,200 PSA shares at 13c to be entered onto the ASX, which traded immediately resulting in a fifth price increase in PSA shares from 12.5c to 13c (or 4.0%).

at 2:12:35 pm the price of PSA shares fell to 12c due to trades executed by persons other than Mr Heath.

at 3:06:34 pm Mr Heath entered an order to buy 1,150 PSA CFDs at 12.5c (equating to $144). This CFD purchase caused an order to buy 1,150 PSA shares at 12.5c to be entered onto the ASX, which traded immediately resulting in a six price increase in PSA shares from 12c to 125c (or 4.2%).

the combined value of the above transactions was $683.

31.   The above example does not show all trading in PSA share and CFDs on 24 July 2013. It is included to illustrate a particularly obvious and serious example of the Market Manipulation Offence.

2nd Method – Marking the Close

32.   In relation to 15 of the 138 Transactions, Mr Heath purchased PSA CFDs or PSA shares late in the trading day in order to raise the reported closing price. This practice is known as “marking the close”. For example, on 14 August 2013:

from the time the ASX opened for trading until 4:10 pm the price of PSA shares traded between 10c and 11c. At 4:10 pm the last traded price was 10c and this appeared to be the likely closing price for PSA shares on 14 August 2013.

however, at 4:10:32 pm Mr Heath entered an order to buy 2,500 PSA CFDs at 11c. This CFD purchase caused an order to buy 2,500 PSA shares at 11c to be placed on to the ASX, which traded immediately, and resulted in the share price increasing from 10c to11c. This was the final trade of the day.

Mr Heath’s CFD purchase resulted in the price of PSA shares closing at a price 1c or 10.0% higher than its previous price.

the value of this Transaction was $275, but it resulted in a $32,704 increase in the market value of Mr Heath’s PSA holding and a 47,592 increase in Mr Heath’s Free Equity.


	
	Similar detail was provided in respect of the matched trade offence, as follows:
	


33.   During the Second Relevant Period, Mr Heath, contrary to s 1041B9(1)(b) of the Act, carried out 30 transactions of financial products relating to the Relevant Securities on the ASX that had the effect of creating a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price for trading in the Relevant Securities on the ASX (“the 30 Transactions”). In particular, in respect of each of the 30 Transactions (the details of which are set out in Schedule 2):

Mr Heath effectively controlled or caused both the buy and sell of the transaction (commonly referred to as “matched orders”; and

Mr Heath carried out the transaction for the dominant purpose of increasing or maintaining the price of the Relevant Securities on the ASX.

34.   25 of the 30 Transactions involved PSA shares and had the following features:

the volume of shares traded on each occasion was relatively small, ranging from 200 to 60,000 with an average of 10,143;

the value of the share traded on each occasion was relatively low, ranging from $25 to $5,940 with an average of $1,210;

each Transaction caused an increase in the PSA share price, ranging from 3.1% to 6.9% with an average of 3.9%; and

most (but not all) of the Transactions resulted in an increase in Mr Heath’s Free Equity, ranging from $128 to $4,112, with an average of $1,842.

each Transaction resulted in an increase in the market value of his overall holding ranging from $2,650 to $27,106, with an average of $13,420.

35.   Two of the 30 Transactions involved LRL shares and had the following features:

the volume of shares traded was 30,000 and 100,000 respectively;

the value of the shares traded was $4,650 and $14,500 respectively;

these Transactions caused an increase in the LRL share price of 3.3% and 3.6% respectively; and

these Transactions caused an increase in the market value of Mr Heath’s overall holding by $1,717.

36.   One of the 30 Transactions involved MGY shares and had the following features:

the volume of shares traded was 25,000;

the value of the shares traded was $1,875;

this transaction caused an increase in the MGY share price of 4.2%; and

this transaction caused an increase in the market value of Mr Heath’s overall holding shares by $625.

37.   Two of the 30 Transactions involved OGY shares and had the following features:

the volume of shares traded was 20,000 and 299,500 respectively;

the value of the shares traded was $580 and $8,386 respectively;

these Transactions caused an increase in the OGY share price of 3.6% and 3.7% respectively; and

these Transactions caused an increase in the market value of Mr Heath’s overall holding by $2,857.

38.   Mr Heath undertook each of the 30 Transactions, effectively controlling or causing both the buy and sell side, with the intention of creating a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price for trading in the Relevant Securities on the ASX for the reasons identified in paragraphs 23 and 24 above, and having the effect identified in paragraph 22 above.

39.   Examples of trades constituting the Matched Trade Offences are set out below.

Example 1 – Matched Trades on 19 June 2013

40.   On 19 June 2013:

at 2:12:31 pm the price of PSA shares was 12c.

at 2:28:31 pm Mr Heath entered an order through his FP Markets Trading Account to sell 394 PSA CFDs at 12.5c. This CFD sale caused an order to sell 394 PSA shares at 12.5c to be entered onto the ASX.

at 2:28:33 pm Mr Heath entered an order, through his ETrade Trading Account, to buy 394 PSA shares at 12.5c, which traded immediately with the above sell order.

this first matched trade, which had a value of $49.25, caused an increase in the PSA share price from 12c to 12.5c, or 4.2%. This caused the market value of Mr Heath’s PSA holding to increase by $13,551, and resulted in his Free Equity increasing by $3,482.

at 3:34:04pm the price of PSA shares fell to 12c due to a trade executed by persons other than Mr Heath.

at 3:44:32 pm Mr Heath entered an order through his FP Markets Trading Account to sell 200 PSA CFDs at 12.5c. This CFD sale caused an order to sell 200 PSA shares at 12.5c to be entered onto the ASX.

at 3:44:32 pm Mr Heath entered an order, through his ETrade Trading Account, to buy 200 PSA shares at 12.5c which traded immediately with the sell order.

this second matched trade, which had a value of $25, caused an increase in the PSA share price from 12c to 12.5c, or 4.2%. This caused the market value of Mr Heath’s PSA holding to increase by $13,551 and resulted in his Free Equity increasing by $3,466.

Example 2 – Matched Trades on 12 April 2013

41.   On 12 April 2013:

at 1:00:00 pm the price of OGY shares was 2.7c.

at 1:43:22 pm Mr Heath entered an order, through his ETrade Trading Account, to buy 320,000 CGY shares at 2.8c.

at 1:43:28 pm Mr Heath entered an order through his FP Markets Trading Account to sell 299,500 OGY CFDs at 2.8c. This CFD sell caused an order to sell 299,500 OGY shares at 2.8c to be entered onto the ASX.

this first matched trade, which had a value of $8,386, caused an increase in the OGY share price from 2.7c to 2.8c or 3.7%. This caused the market value of Mr Heath’s OGY holding to increase by $476.

at 1:36:54 pm Mr Heath entered an order, through his FP Markets Trading Account, to sell 20,000 OGY CFDs at 2.9c. This CFD sale caused an order to sell 20,000 OGY shares at 2.9c to be entered onto the ASX.

at 1:44:01 pm Mr Heath entered an order, through his ETrade Trading Account, to buy 20,500 OGY shares at 2.9c, of which 20,000 shares traded immediately with the above sell order.

this second matched trade, which had a value of $580, caused an increase in the OGY share price from 2.8c to 2.9c, or 3.6%. This caused the market value of Mr Heath’s OGY holding to increase by $2,381.


	
	The applicant’s affidavit explained that, whatever he may have been attempting to achieve through his trading, it in fact achieved “no lasting support for PSA whatsoever”. He explained why he had engaged in such a futile exercise:
	


“I had a view of PSA’s “real” value and I became consumed with being PSA’s “champion” and defending the stock through its share price. I realise now (although I did not at the time) that this was quite obsessive behaviour.

I did not think that the share price deserved to fall. Therefore, when I saw that happen, I would purchase more PSA shares or CFDs. In hindsight, my actions were silly in the extreme, as I knew then and I know now that all shares rise and fall and you wait it out until the market sees a stock’s intrinsic value or you sell.”


	
	The Crown did not contest that evidence.
	
	
	The ASIC statement relating to the applicant’s co-operation reveals that, immediately after being contacted by ASIC in relation to its investigation of the offences, the applicant participated in an examination under s 19 of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 (Cth) during which he made “full and frank admissions about the offending referred to in the statement of facts”. The transcript of the s 19 examination was not before the sentencing judge and is not before this Court. The applicant made a deliberate, informed decision not to claim the protection against self-incrimination, with the result that the content of the examination was admissible against him in any subsequent proceedings including criminal proceedings.
	
	
	The statement of co-operation records that the applicant made admissions that his transactions “had the effect of maintaining or increasing the price of securities on the ASX” and that he carried out transactions between accounts controlled by him with the intention of maintaining or increasing the price of securities on the ASX.
	
	
	The applicant subsequently entered into negotiations with ASIC with a view to formally admitting and pleading guilty to “appropriate charges”. During that period, the applicant was represented by a solicitor who worked co-operatively with ASIC to settle the statement of facts.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The applicant relies on 7 grounds of appeal, as follows:
	



	
	The Trial Judge erred by rejecting the undisputed and unchallenged evidence regarding Mr Heath’s lack of knowledge of criminality.
	
	
	The Trial Judge erred by rejecting the agreed evidence of Mr Heath regarding his motivation to provide price support to the Petsec stock.
	
	
	The Trial Judge erred by finding that Mr Heath obtained and/or intended to obtain a financial benefit.
	
	
	The Trial Judge erred by failing to consider all the factors relevant to the objective gravity of the offences.
	
	
	The Trial Judge erred by failing to find exceptional circumstances concerning family hardship.
	
	
	The Trial Judge erred by finding that there was inconsistency between Mr Heath’s plea of guilty and Mr Heath’s evidence.
	
	
	The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	


Ground 1


	
	The first ground of appeal is:
	


The Trial Judge erred by rejecting the undisputed and unchallenged evidence regarding Mr Heath’s lack of knowledge of criminality.


	
	The statement of facts said:
	


Throughout the Relevant Period Mr Heath knew or should have known of the prohibitions against Market Manipulation and Matched Orders. For example, on opening the four FP Markets Trading Accounts on 18 May 2012, 20 May 2012, 5 September 2012, and 14 January 2013, he acknowledged that he had received, read, understood and agreed to FP Markets terms and conditions.


	
	As noted by Johnson J during the hearing of this appeal, the agreed fact was ambiguous by reason of the adoption of the unfortunate formulation “knew or ought to have known”. The appellant’s affidavit relied upon at the proceedings on sentence accepted what he ought to have known but repeatedly asserted that he did not in fact know that his conduct was unlawful. The affidavit explained in detail the applicant’s education and background in trading. In my view, his account was not inherently implausible.
	
	
	As already noted, the Crown did not seek to cross examine the applicant. His affidavit accordingly stood as unchallenged evidence in the proceedings.
	
	
	The applicant accepts, correctly, that a sentencing court is not obliged to accept unchallenged evidence. However, it was submitted that, where the Court is considering rejecting unchallenged evidence (for example on the basis that it is inherently improbable), the witness must be afforded an opportunity to address that proposition. The applicant submitted that, if that proposition is not put to a witness by the opposing party, it is the duty of the judge to put the assertion to the witness before rejecting the evidence.
	
	
	The authority cited by the applicant for that proposition is a civil case: Ghazal v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales (1992) 29 NSWLR 336 at 344-5. The passage cited was from the judgment of Kirby J, who said:
	


The duty to confront a person fairly with the suggestion that a case is false, even fraudulent, cannot be doubted. The duty arises from “common fairness” and the proper administration of justice … in a trial, the duty arises most clearly when what is being suggested is fraud and false testimony on the part of a witness. It is a well-established rule of our legal procedure that such contentions must be clearly identified and not raised accidentally, peripherally and nonchalantly in the course of litigation.


	
	A similar principle has been recognised in the context of criminal proceedings. In O’Neil-Shaw v R [2010] NSWCCA 42, this Court said (at [27] per Basten JA; Howie and Johnson JJ agreeing at [40] and [41]; and see Johnson J’s further remarks at [50]-[51]):
	


It is a basic rule of procedural fairness that a party who does not accept the evidence of a witness should put the alternative view in cross-examination, both so that the witness may respond and so that the court has the benefit of assessing the response: R v SWC [2007] VSCA 201; 175 A Crim R 71 at [12]-[15] (Maxwell P, Kellam JA and Kaye AJA). Where there has been no cross-examination of witnesses to contest their evidence, “judges should in general abstain from making adverse findings about parties and witnesses”: MWJ v The Queen [2005] HCA 74; 80 ALJR 329 at [39] (Gummow, Kirby and Callinan JJ).


	
	Some caution should be applied in the application of authorities in civil cases to the task of fact-finding in sentence proceedings. In civil proceedings, the rules of engagement are determined by the parties according to their pleadings; in criminal proceedings, broader interests are invoked. In sentencing proceedings, the judge is not obliged “passively, and unquestioningly, to accept facts as the basis for sentencing which are presented by the prosecution and/or the accused”. The judge’s sentencing discretion must be exercised in the public interest: Chow v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 at 606; approved in O’Neil-Shaw at [23].
	
	
	It must accordingly be accepted that, in the criminal context, there will be occasions when it will not be appropriate for the sentencing judge to let a matter pass as an accepted fact merely on the basis that the Crown has chosen not to challenge a witness about that fact. Conversely, however, the stakes are high in the case of criminal proceedings. Where a person faces the prospect of a custodial sentence, the content of the duty of procedural fairness is not less than in the case of a civil claim.
	
	
	The applicant’s affidavit setting out his evidence at the proceedings on sentence included repeated references to his absence of knowledge that the conduct with which he was charged was unlawful. At paragraph 56 of the affidavit, he said:
	


While I was not specifically aware of the market manipulation or washing provisions of the Corporations Act, I have generally been aware of matters such as insider trading and market manipulation for over 20 years. However, after 20 years in the market, I should have been more aware of what would trigger those provisions. My somewhat naïve view was simply that market manipulation, or ramping as I knew it, involved driving up the price of a stock and then selling into that price increase. I never did that.


	
	There were several other references to the applicant’s ignorance of any law prohibiting his conduct.
	
	
	In his reasons for sentence, the sentencing judge said:
	


The offender is clearly a highly intelligent man as is demonstrated by his academic achievements and a very experienced trader over a period of some 20 years. He did not give evidence on sentence and I do not accept that he did not understand that what he was doing was in fact committing offences.


	
	The statement that the applicant “did not give evidence on sentence” is not correct. His affidavit was admitted in the defence case at the proceedings on sentence. The judge’s remarks must be taken to refer to the fact that the applicant did not go into the witness box. However, that was due to the election of the Crown not to require him for cross-examination. It was not a situation where an offender had chosen not to expose himself to cross-examination at the proceedings on sentence.
	
	
	There was some debate in the submissions on appeal as to the significance of that finding. The Crown submitted that the judge’s rejection of the undisputed and unchallenged evidence regarding the applicant’s lack of knowledge of criminality was not relied upon by his Honour as an aggravating factor in itself but was rather only the rejection of a matter offered in mitigation. However the finding is characterised, it is clear in my view that it informed, and was informed by, his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. In particular, my assessment of the evidence and the judge’s reasons has persuaded me that his Honour’s rejection of the applicant’s evidence as to his lack of knowledge of criminality was informed by a misapprehension as to the actual impact of the applicant’s trading and the nature of the benefit obtained (considered in detail below).
	
	
	In the circumstances, I do not think it was open to the sentencing judge, without raising the matter, to reject the applicant’s evidence that he did not understand that what he was doing was in fact committing offences. The more difficult question is to determine what flows from that conclusion. The question whether it was open to a sentencing court to make a particular finding is ordinarily determined by reference to an assessment of the evidence before that court. The issue raised in the present appeal is not so much a question of the availability of the finding as of a denial of procedural fairness. Ordinarily, the appropriate course would be to remit the proceedings to the sentencing court for determination according to law. The difficulty in the present case is that to adopt that course would defeat the object of the appeal and visit considerable hardship on the applicant. The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment commencing on 25 September 2015. By the time this appeal was heard on 2 February 2016, he had already served more than four months of his term of imprisonment.
	
	
	As already noted, the applicant had adduced evidence to support a submission that there were exceptional circumstances of family hardship which warranted a more lenient sentence (the judge’s treatment of that issue is the subject of ground 5). The same circumstances prompted Mr Thangaraj SC to submit on behalf of the applicant that a remitter of the proceedings would be a worse result (for the family) than dismissing the appeal. In my view, there is force in that submission. Even if the applicant were granted bail pending the remittal of the proceedings for redetermination in the District Court, and even if that Court, with all the pressure of its workload, were able to determine the matter promptly, the stress and delay inevitably involved in that course would defeat the very object of this appeal and so suffer this Court to become the instrument of an injustice: cf Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [4].
	
	
	Before proceeding to resolve that dilemma, it is appropriate to consider the remaining grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant.
	


Objective seriousness of the offences: grounds 2, 3, 4 and 6


	
	There is a degree of overlap in grounds 2, 3, 4 and 6. It is appropriate to consider the issues raised by those grounds together. They are:
	


2.   The trial judge erred by rejecting the agreed evidence of Mr Heath regarding his motivation to provide price support to Petsec.

3.   The trial judge erred by finding that Mr Heath obtained and/or intended to obtain a financial benefit.

4.   The trial judge erred by failing to consider all the factors relevant to the objective gravity of the offences.

6.   The trial judge erred by finding that there was an inconsistency between Mr Heath’s plea of guilty and Mr Heath’s evidence.


	
	The judge set out the agreed statement of facts in full in his reasons for decision. His Honour then referred to the statement of co-operation, acknowledging that the applicant’s co-operation had significantly assisted ASIC to resolve the matter in an expeditious and less costly manner and accepting that the co-operation was also relevant to the issue of contrition. His Honour concluded, “nonetheless, offences such as these are serious offences”.
	
	
	His Honour did not, in that section of the judgment, identify any specific aspect of the offending in this case or analyse the relative seriousness of these offences by reference to the range of conduct that might fall within the two sections.
	
	
	The judge then turned to consider the subjective case, setting out a careful analysis of the evidence on that issue. His Honour then returned to the question of the kind of conduct involved in such offences, saying (at ROS 27):
	


It is common in relation to matters such as this, involving share or CFD trading, that the offences are committed by persons who hold high positions in the community, whether that be in a private or public capacity, who are highly regarded by those who know them, who love and care for their family and have provided benefits to the community. Those who indulge in this type of conduct are frequently persons of such character who also have the means and the talents to commit offences of this nature. Persons who are not well off financially are of course not in the position to commit offences such as this.

In Khoo v R [2013] NSWCCA 323 the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal endorsed a statement of principle made in relation to the offence of insider trading as provided by s 1043A of the Corporations Act but which is nonetheless applicable to market manipulation offences, which are similar in nature and carry the same maximum penalty. The Court said:

“The acquisition or disposal of financial products by people having the unfair advantage of inside information is criminalised because it has the capacity to unravel the public trust which is critical to the viability of the market. It is, as previously observed by this Court, a form of cheating. The fact that people of otherwise good character and compelling personal circumstances attempt to engage in such conduct emphasises the need for the clear deterrent that insider traders should expect to go to gaol.”

The final sentence of that quote is a statement of principle which is just as applicable to this matter as it is to insider trading.


	
	The passage from Khoo cited by his Honour quoted a statement made by me in the matter of R v Glynatsis [2013] NSWCCA 131; 230 A Crim R 99 at [79]. Khoo and Glynatsis were each cases of insider trading in which the objective seriousness of the offending was plainly higher than in the present case.
	
	
	The judge’s observation that the final sentence of that quote (“that insider traders should expect to go to gaol”) is “just as applicable to this matter as it is to insider trading” suggests that his Honour equated the seriousness of the applicant’s conduct with that of the offenders in Khoo and Glynatsis. It was against that premise that his Honour proceeded to assess the contents of the applicant’s affidavit. After stating that he did not accept that the applicant did not understand that what he was doing was in fact committing offences (in the passage set out above), the judge continued:
	


As to his being a “champion” in particular of Petsec Energy, as though he were some ‘white knight’ supporting the company, I am of the view that his conduct was not some altruistic aider of the company, but indeed his conduct was for the purpose stated in the statement of Facts: that is, that his conduct was to provide price support and in so doing to minimise or avoid Margin Calls that he may have been required to make if the stocks had traded free of his influence.

It is not necessary in relation to offences of this nature that there be any financial gain by the offender. The gravamen of the offence is its effect on a free and open market, uncontaminated by conduct of this nature. What effect his conduct may have had on others is impossible to discern. What effect it may have had in relation to his own accounts, that is what effect it may have had in relation to any Margin Calls that might have been made if he had not indulged in the conduct is also impossible to determine as it is so hypothetical.

Nonetheless, in those circumstances these matters remain serious offences. The conduct in total took place over a period of 20 months – some 18 months in relation to the Market Manipulation Offence and some 15 months in relation to the Matched Trade Offence. He first commenced the Market Manipulation Offence in February 2012 and five months later commenced the Matched Trade Offence.


	
	As to the applicant’s motive, the judge said:
	


I find beyond reasonable doubt that his motive in carrying out the transactions was to increase or maintain the prices of the relevant securities at a level that would avoid him having to contribute more funds to his Trading Accounts or reduce the funds that he would have had to contribute to his Trading Accounts and increase his Free Equity which he could then use to trade in shares, maintain or take other CFD positions or withdraw directly as funds to pay for living expenses.

The offending has also had the effect of protecting the value of the offender’s substantial shareholding in the relevant securities and in particular PSA. During the period he also substantially increased his holding in both PSA shares and CFDs.


	
	As contended by ground 2, the finding as to motive was inconsistent or at least in tension with the agreed fact (at paragraph 24 of the statement of facts) that Mr Heath considered himself something of a “champion” for PSA as a stock and that this was his “main motivation” for providing price support for PSA across the relevant period.
	
	
	The judge’s finding as to motive appears, in turn, to have been informed by his Honour’s assessment of the benefit or potential benefit achieved by the applicant through his trading. The applicant’s evidence was that his trading achieved no lasting price impact on the relevant stocks; that, at the very most, his trading had a short-lived impact on the market and that he did not in fact take advantage of any short term price impact which his trading may have caused. He also said that his debt to asset ratio was never more than 30 to 40% of the net present value of the assets and that he never had a margin call on any of his accounts.
	
	
	The statement of facts does not address every trade in detail. As set out above, the trades were summarised in a schedule, the statement offering “a particularly obvious and serious example” of the market manipulation offence in the trading on 24 July 2013. That example illustrates the fleeting impact of the applicant’s trading. In hindsight, this aspect of the offending could have been made clearer to the sentencing judge. The judge was presented with a vast amount of material which it was simply impractical for his Honour to absorb within the time available to the Court on the day of the hearing.
	
	
	In the result, I am persuaded that the judge overlooked or misapprehended the fleeting impact of the applicant’s trading on the market and the unlikelihood that he would in fact obtain any lasting financial benefit as a result of his trading. That misapprehension in turn informed his Honour’s assessment of several other aspects of the objective seriousness of the offences. As already noted, his Honour was presented with a significant amount of complex material in which the fleeting nature of the impact of the trading may well have been obscured by the detail of other aspects of the offending conduct. Paragraphs 26 and 27 of the agreed facts provided an arithmetic analysis of the percentage increase in price, the volume and value of shares traded on each occasion and the resulting impact on the applicant’s free equity. The level of detail provided on those issues was apt to distract attention from the futility of the applicant’s trading. The “result” element of the market manipulation offence (that the transactions carried out by the applicant had the effect of creating an artificial price for trading in the ordinary shares of Petsec on the Australian Stock Exchange) was satisfied by the agreed fact that the applicant’s trades had that effect. It was also an agreed fact that the applicant undertook each of those transactions “for the sole or dominant purpose of maintaining or increasing the price” of those shares. But, upon analysis, that purpose could never have been achieved by trading at the volume and frequency of the applicant’s trading. An appreciation of that important aspect of the offending was essential for the proper assessment of the matters addressed in the applicant’s affidavit and rejected by his Honour.
	
	
	In rejecting the applicant’s affidavit, the judge said:
	


I do not accept that as an intelligent man with 20 years trading experience he was either naïve or unknowing in respect of his conduct. He was not a champion of PSA but a champion of his own financial interests. It is of some concern that despite the offender’s co-operation and contrition that he continues to bury his head in the sand and claim naivety and lack of insight at the time into the obvious consequences of his action.


	
	The applicant relied upon that passage of the judgment to support the contention made by ground 6 that the judge erred by finding there was an inconsistency between the applicant’s plea of guilty and his evidence. Whether or not his Honour made a finding in those terms, his scepticism appears to have been misplaced.
	
	
	The judge did not identify what he was referring to as the “obvious consequences” of the market manipulation offence. By reference to the material that was before his Honour, that can only have been a reference to the actual impact of the transactions on the share price or the actual financial benefit obtained. In fact, according to the matters explained in the applicant’s affidavit, the consequence of his trading was that it would temporarily maintain or increase the share price but would have no lasting effect. Any consequential impact on the value of the applicant’s equities must have been equally transitory. This was not a case in which the snapshot of a ramped up price was of utility to the applicant for a different purpose or where the share price at any particular time affected some third party obligation (cf Fame Decorator Agencies Pty Ltd v Jeffries Industries Ltd (1998) 28 ACSR 58).
	
	
	In my respectful opinion, it is tolerably clear that the sentencing judge was under the misapprehension that the increase in the applicant’s free equity and the increase in the market value of his share holdings identified in the statement of facts was a lasting benefit of real value to the applicant, reflecting a lasting improvement in his net worth (which is effectively the point raise by ground 3).
	
	
	An assessment of the matched trade offence is more complex. According to the statement of facts, it was an agreed fact that the applicant undertook those transactions “with the intention of creating a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price for trading in [the relevant securities] for the reasons identified in paragraphs 23 and 24 above, and having the effect identified in paragraph 22 above”. In other words, the fault element specified for the physical “result” element of the offence was intention.
	
	
	In the present appeal, it was submitted that the judge overlooked an important aspect of that offence, which was that there were also some trades effected at below market price. There does not appear to have been evidence of that fact at the proceedings on sentence – it was a matter stated from the bar table in submissions (T16.23: the transcript says “at the low market price” but plainly should read “at below market price”). That was said to be a significant factor in the assessment of the applicant’s motive for carrying out those transactions.
	
	
	In his affidavit, the applicant said:
	


Twenty of the 30 transactions were internal transfers of CFDs between FP Markets accounts. This occurred primarily to smooth out margins between those four accounts. I did not think about the washing aspect of it at all. I was very focused on managing our money and ensuring there was sufficient cash flow. I was very careful to make sure that my accounts would not be margin called. You could have a situation where one account was in healthy credit and another had slipped into negative equity. These 20 inter-account transfers were simply an exercise in money management.


	
	In his consideration of that evidence, the judge correctly constrained himself by reference to the agreed fact as to the applicant’s intention. His Honour said:
	


Although the smoothing out of the accounts may have been an additional reason for committing the Matched Trade Offence his conduct was deliberate and not merely reckless. He intended to place himself in a favourable position and he did so at the expense and confidence of the investing community in the market for securities.


	
	On the strength of the agreed facts, that is an unexceptionable description of the nature of that offence. However, the judge’s other remarks as to the “consequences” of the applicant’s conduct (considered above) were made with reference to both offences, indicating that his Honour overlooked the fleeting impact of the effect on price in assessing the matched trade offence as well as in his assessment of the market manipulation offence.
	
	
	For those reasons, I am persuaded that the sentencing judge misapprehended the objective seriousness of both offences. While the foregoing discussion addresses a number of the applicant’s grounds, it is enough to express the conclusion that ground 4 is made out. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to address grounds 5 and 7.
	
	
	Leaving aside the complication created by the success of ground 1, it would follow from the success of ground 4 that this Court must exercise the sentencing discretion afresh.
	
	
	The difficulty is to determine the proper approach to that task, having regard to the applicant’s success on ground 1. For the reasons already explained, I do not think this Court should remit the proceedings to the District Court to make further findings of fact. The interests of justice require, in the circumstances, that this Court should rather proceed to determine the appropriate sentence. Ordinarily this Court would re-sentence the applicant on the strength of the findings of fact made below but that could not fairly include the finding as to knowledge of criminality reached by the sentencing judge without there being afforded to the applicant an opportunity to address the judge’s concerns – that would be an affront to justice.
	
	
	There is no perfect solution to this issue. In the circumstances, this Court in my view can and should take a practical course that accords with the interests of justice. For my part, the resolution is to be found in my analysis of ground 4. Once it is understood that the impact of the applicant’s trading was fleeting and that the applicant did not in fact capitalise on the transitory benefits he achieved, it follows, in my view, that the applicant’s evidence as to his knowledge of criminality was not inherently improbable or inconsistent with the agreed facts or the plea of guilty. Accordingly, in my view, the appropriate course is for this Court to re-sentence the applicant on the strength of its own assessment of that evidence and there is no occasion for further hearing, either in this Court or in the Court below.
	
	
	My consideration of the applicant’s affidavit has led me to conclude that, rather than engaging in a dishonest campaign of price manipulation which he must have appreciated was unlawful, the applicant’s trading was manic, obsessive and ultimately misconceived. By his plea of guilty, he accepted that the effect of his trading was to create a price that was “artificial”. However, the evidence also establishes that his purpose was to maintain or achieve the price he thought the stock was worth, not to ramp it up to a price he believed to be beyond its worth for personal gain. I would accept the applicant’s evidence on that issue, unchallenged as it was by the Crown at the proceedings on sentence.
	
	
	My analysis of the evidence leads me to conclude that the objective seriousness of the market manipulation offence was significantly lower than the sentencing judge assessed it to be. The seriousness of the matched trade offence was higher, since it was admitted in respect of that offence that the applicant intended to create a false and misleading appearance with respect to the price of the relevant securities. In my view, the sentence imposed for that offence should stand, notwithstanding my conclusions set out above.
	
	
	Although it has not been necessary to consider ground 5, the material relied upon concerning family hardship must be considered on re-sentence. Section 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) requires the Court to have regard to “the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependants”. On the present state of the law, the Court must approach that issue on the basis that the degree of family hardship must be shown to be “exceptional” before it can be given any substantial weight: R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; 127 A Crim R 23 at [16] per Spigelman CJ; R v Hinton [2001] NSWCCA 405; 134 A Crim R 286.
	
	
	The Crown accepted at the proceedings on sentence that the circumstances relied upon in the present case were capable of amounting to exceptional hardship. I am persuaded that exceptional hardship has been established. It is neither necessary nor desirable to descend into the detail provided in the evidence. In short, it establishes that the applicant’s daughter plainly needs intensive support from both her parents.
	
	
	At the time of the proceedings on sentence, the daughter was interstate. She is evidently an extremely talented woman. Unfortunately, she suffers from debilitating illnesses that are life-threatening. The evidence provided extensive detail about her condition and treatment. It is enough to record that her parents’ ongoing support remains critical to her wellbeing.
	
	
	The applicant’s other daughter is at school in Sydney where the family otherwise lives. She is now embarking on her HSC year. One of the features of the family circumstances relied upon at the proceedings on sentence was that it was necessary for one parent to be interstate to support the older daughter while the other remained in Sydney to support the daughter doing the HSC.
	
	
	The evidence on re-sentence established that, as feared, the applicant’s period of incarceration has seen a deterioration in the older daughter’s condition and she has, for the time being, had to postpone her studies. It would be open to her to return interstate to resume her studies in the middle of this year, if she is well enough. Those matters, in my view, amount to exceptional circumstances such as to warrant some consideration in determining the portion of the term of imprisonment which the applicant should serve before being released on a recognisance release order.
	
	
	In my view, based on my assessment of the objective circumstances of the offences and the applicant’s subjective circumstances, the sentences imposed in the District Court should be quashed and the following sentences imposed in substitution for them (the total term for the matched trade offence remains the same):
	



	
	for the matched trade offence, to a term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 25 September 2015 and expiring on 24 March 2017;
	
	
	for the market manipulation offence, to a term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 25 December 2015 and expiring on 24 June 2017.
	



	
	In my view, the period of 5 months already served by the applicant is an adequate reflection of the period of the sentence he should actually serve.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	That leave to appeal be granted;
	
	
	That the appeal be allowed;
	
	
	That the sentences passed in the District Court be quashed and, in substitution therefor, that the applicant be sentenced as follows:
	



	
	for the matched trade offence, to a term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 25 September 2015 and expiring on 24 March 2017;
	
	
	for the market manipulation offence, to a term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 25 December 2015 and expiring on 24 June 2017.
	



	
	That the applicant be released today, 25 February 2016, on a recognisance release order in the sum of $10,000 without surety to be of good behaviour for a period ending on 24 June 2017.

		25 February 2016",2016-02-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768853,R v Robert Flaherty [2016] NSWDC 121,"Judgment


	
	Mr Flaherty was found guilty last year by a jury of two serious offences committed some decades ago against a teenage boy. He was then a Catholic Priest and the boy was a parishioner and an altar boy.
	
	
	He had pleaded guilty to other offences against two other boys.
	
	
	I sentenced Mr Flaherty yesterday. I fixed a sentence of two years and three weeks and I fixed a non-parole period of six months. I directed that the sentence commence not yesterday but today. The reason for that direction is that Ms Rowan who appears for him indicated that she would be making a release application under the Bail Act 2013. She has pursued that release application this afternoon. I have a very full list today. I have just heard Ms Rowan and Ms Daleo as Crown Prosecutor on the merits of the release application.
	
	
	It is suggested that the leading current authority is El-Hilly and Melville v R [2015] NSWCCA 146. I think that is right. Hamill J delivered a judgment in which Simpson J, as her Honour then was, and Davies J agreed. With respect, his Honour carefully and helpfully analysed the relevant legislation. This case, like El-Hilly and Melville, involved s 22 of the Bail Act 2013. This case falls within that section because there is an appeal pending in the Court of Criminal Appeal against the conviction which I imposed after the jury verdict and the sentence which I delivered yesterday. The section provides that I am not to grant bail “unless it is established that special or exceptional circumstances exist that justify that bail decision”.
	
	
	Ms Rowan argued that there are such special or exceptional circumstances and Ms Daleo argued that there are not. The section also provides that what I will refer to in a shorthand way as the unacceptable risk test also applies. I did not require Ms Rowan to address me on that because it seems to me that Mr Flaherty who is aged 72 and in very poor health does not pose any unacceptable risk. Ms Daleo did not want to submit otherwise and both agreed that the issue turned on the special or exceptional circumstances which are said to exist to justify the bail decision.
	
	
	Hamill J canvassed the question which has been discussed in the past by the authorities about bail pending an appeal. An obvious issue is the prospects of the success of the appeal. This in turn leads to a further question, how good must those prospects be. Hamill J resolved that issue to my mind, speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal, when his Honour said at [26] that when the merit of the appeal is relevant as part of a combination of factors -
	


“The preponderance of authorities suggest that the question is whether the proposed grounds of appeal are arguable or enjoy reasonable prospects of success.”


	
	That is a far lower threshold than ones previously suggested such as success being “virtually inevitable” or that the appeal is “most likely to succeed”. Hamill J went on to say at [29] that two features frequently arise on these applications. They are:
	


“The merit of the appeal and … the possibility that the applicant will have served their sentence or non-parole period, or a substantial part of it, before the appeal is determined.”


	
	Ms Rowan indicated that inquiries suggest that if notice of appeal is lodged at this stage (there is only a notice of intention to appeal so far), then the appeal would get a call-over during which a hearing date would be fixed and that date might be some three months or so later. The non-parole period which I fixed yesterday expires on 25 August 2016. That would mean that the earliest likely date for the appeal to be heard and determined would be late May or early June. However getting the appeal on that soon would not be guaranteed. There is a question of transcript to be obtained and there could be a delay of a further six to eight weeks. Ms Rowan said there is a real possibility the hearing date could be not until July, August or September. The last month would be beyond the non-parole period.
	
	
	A second factor is her client’s health. As I said in my remarks on sentence yesterday, Mr Flaherty has very poor health. Indeed his treating specialist physician has given him a prognosis of six to twelve months. Significantly that prognosis was offered in September last year.
	
	
	As to the merits of the appeal, Ms Rowan agitated the possibility of what used to be called an “unsafe and unsatisfactory ground”. She referred to various issues which occurred during the trial including directions, tendency and coincidence evidence and a ruling about a judge alone trial. She offered nothing by way of argument as to where any error might be there.
	
	
	However she said there was a second point about the trial. I remember it and it has been pointed out by her in her sentence submissions. There were issues during the trial about her client’s health. He was not able to turn up on one or two days. I recall that at one stage evidence had to be obtained from one of his treating doctors about his ability to come and continue the trial. Later tests reveal that he is likely to be suffering from some form of dementia. Ms Rowan raises the question of whether in the circumstances there might have been a fitness for trial issue that arose. Of course if such an issue arose the judge would be required to embark on a fitness hearing. I do not think that there would be any question here of the bona fides of such an application, given Mr Flaherty’s health record.
	
	
	There is some merit to my mind in that issue. I cannot determine how meritorious it is because I simply have not had time to review the evidence.
	
	
	Ms Rowan argued that there would be a sentence appeal. One ground would be that the sentence is manifestly excessive because of the starting point of four years. I do not myself regard that as a ground having reasonable prospects of success. The two offences where I fixed 4 years as a starting point but then reduced it to two years were particularly serious examples of the crime that I am sentencing Mr Flaherty for. Indeed, as Ms Daleo pointed out, my jump from four years to two years could be regarded as very lenient.
	
	
	There are other issues about whether I had canvassed the authorities regarding remissions. Again I do not think that is an arguable point.
	
	
	Ms Rowan moved on to firmer ground regarding the health of her client. She reminded me of the grave concern that doctors and psychologists have expressed about his health and the impact of a gaol sentence. One of the opinions comes from his treating specialist. There is also the question of his prognosis. On one view of things, although a prognosis of course is not a prediction, it could occur that Mr Flaherty does not survive until the end of his non-parole period.
	
	
	Ms Rowan argued that minds could differ about whether or not this is a case where her client should have gone to gaol. Her argument yesterday was that the sentence should be a prison sentence but that it should be suspended because of his circumstances. I disagreed with her and rejected that argument.
	
	
	Ms Daleo says that that is sufficient and puts an end to it - the fact that minds may differ does not point to error. The fact that a Court of Criminal Appeal judge may err on the side of not sending Mr Flaherty to gaol is not demonstrable of error. However this is where, I say with respect, the relatively low threshold proposed in El-Hilly and Melville becomes relevant - the proposed grounds of appeal “are arguable or enjoy reasonable prospects of success.”
	
	
	I myself considered seriously whether or not I should sentence Mr Flaherty to fulltime imprisonment. I felt comfortable in reaching the conclusion that he had to go to gaol and that he had to serve a period of time in gaol fulltime. However it is open to argument that that was in error. There is a good deal of medical material concerning his fitness and health and there is the prognosis and there is the psychological report about the impact of gaol.
	
	
	In addition there is the very real prospect that Mr Flaherty may not survive the non-parole period. One additional point made by Ms Rowan was to point to the evidence of her client’s dementia and the question of him being in a position to provide instructions for an appeal. I do not place great weight on that submission because an appeal requires less input than does a trial. But nevertheless there is some force in the argument.
	
	
	Ms Daleo on the other hand reminded me of what the High Court had said in United Mexican States v Cabal (2002) 209 CLR 165. That emphasised the serious interference with the due administration of justice involved in ordering a sentence of imprisonment - as I did yesterday - but then to stay the order. I set out the considerations in my judgment in R v Jiao (No 3) [2014] NSWDC 354 at [8]. I think there is a good deal of force in that submission.
	
	
	On the one hand I could refuse the release application and encourage Ms Rowan and her client to consider whether it could be pursued in the Court of Criminal Appeal. On the other hand I am obliged to give this application serious consideration and determine it on its merits.
	
	
	I have determined to permit the release application. I do so because to my mind the merits of the appeal, as pointed out by Ms Rowan, are at the very least arguable. I am not sure that any of them may enjoy reasonable prospects of success. But there is the point about the capacity of her client during the trial. I make no comment about the merits of that point, but I do confirm that I remember the issue arising. Then there is her point about whether I was in error to send her client to fulltime imprisonment given his health and age and prognosis. That might be regarded as erroneous. Both carry enough merit to be described as arguable.
	
	
	For those reasons I propose to grant the application.
	


DALEO: Your Honour on the issue of bail then pending the appeal.

HIS HONOUR: What’s the order that I make?

DALEO: Your Honour I understand there are a series of existing conditions which the Crown would ask to stay.

HIS HONOUR: What is the order that I make it will be conditional I expect but what’s the order?

DALEO: That the offender be granted bail your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Where? What section?

ROWAN: Well pursuant to s 62.

HIS HONOUR: Here it is no s 8 - what is s 62. Yes I remember we talked about that yesterday. No that’s hearing - isn’t it s 8?

DALEO: I’ll call up the Bail Act.

HIS HONOUR: The following decisions can be made under this Act in respect of a person accused of an offence, a decision to release the person without bail, decision to suspend submission to grant bail for the offence.

ROWAN: Thank you your Honour. Well it’s either your Honour s 9 or s 10, sorry s 9. S9 is the decision to release without bail, actually that’s not going--

HIS HONOUR: No.

ROWAN: S 11 decision to grant bail or refuse bail, so your Honour would be granting bail pursuant to s 11.

HIS HONOUR: All right do you agree Ms Daleo?

DALEO: Is your Honour asking if I agree it’s s 11?

HIS HONOUR: Yes that’s what I’m asking whether that’s the power that I have to order, make the order that Ms Rowan has--

DALEO: Yes your Honour, your Honour can grant bail.

HIS HONOUR: I’ll come back to conditions, all right this is the first order.


	
	Under s 11 of the Bail Act 2013 I grant bail to the offender.
	


HIS HONOUR: All right now conditions.

DALEO: Your Honour there were a series of pre-existing terms.

HIS HONOUR: Yes have you got it in writing?

DALEO: I have one copy that’s been marked that I’m--

HIS HONOUR: Has that been shown to Ms Rowan? Can somebody show it to Ms Rowan? If we can reach agreement that’s the best way of doing it.

ROWAN: Yes your Honour I’ll have a look but the question--

HIS HONOUR: No, no have a look. First have a look at the document.

DALEO: Your Honour I understand my friend has no issue with what were the bail conditions to continue.

HIS HONOUR: Has somebody got it in writing so I can read it out?

DALEO: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Right hand it up please.

DALEO: Your Honour can I just indicate we updated it when the reporting conditions were varied.

HIS HONOUR: That’s fine hand it to the court officer.

ROWAN: Well your Honour as I understand it there’s no reporting conditions.

HIS HONOUR: I don’t know. That will become an mfi which my associate will tell me in a moment.

DALEO: They were deleted during the course of the trial your Honour, prior to that I understood it was one day a week.

HIS HONOUR: Really? Does he need to report, really?

DALEO: Your Honour the Crown doesn’t have an issue if your Honour doesn’t want to impose a reporting condition. The other conditions your Honour will see are self-evident as to no approaching individuals and not being with children.

HIS HONOUR: This looks like an AVO.

ROWAN: The start of it is an AVO your Honour and there’s no difficulty with that but it reflects your Honour the same terms as an AVO and there’s obviously no--

HIS HONOUR: So you’re saying the terms of bail are in this document?

DALEO: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Okay but I’ll delete the reporting conditions. I will, so where are the reporting conditions?

DALEO: Your Honour on the bottom it indicated that reporting conditions were deleted.

HIS HONOUR: Right yes.

DALEO: And they don’t need to be reinstated. However your Honour the Crown would ask for an additional bail condition.

HIS HONOUR: What’s that?

DALEO: That the accused diligently prosecute the appeal, the offender diligently prosecute the appeal.

HIS HONOUR: Yes go on.

ROWAN: Your Honour I just wanted to make note that with regard to his not to be the company of any child under the age of 18 years.

HIS HONOUR: Are you asking for a variation?

ROWAN: No that was already varied and I want to make sure that that is reflected, it was varied to exclude the children of--

DALEO: His grandchildren your Honour on the list.

ROWAN: They’re de facto grandchildren and I certainly have no difficulty your Honour with the condition that the appeal be diligently prosecuted.

HIS HONOUR: Were these all conditions? If I was to say that he’s given bail on conditions that were previously that are currently in place with the exception that there is the reporting conditions are deleted and he is to prosecute the appeal, would that order suffice?

ROWAN: I think it would yes your Honour.

DALEO: Yes your Honour just one other matter though which isn’t a question of bail but in situations like this your Honour the Crown is, I ask the court if your Honour would refer the matter to the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The next call over is 3 March 2016. I understand your Honour has the ability to specifically refer this matter to the Registrar.

HIS HONOUR: Bail is granted on the same conditions as were fixed at the conclusion of the trial. I confirm that there are no reporting conditions. An additional condition is that the appeal anticipated in the notice of intention to appeal is to be prosecuted with due diligence. I make an order that the matter be referred to the Registrar at the Court of Criminal Appeal at the next call-over on 3 March 2016.

DALEO: And so therefore the offender’s bail will continue to that date.

HIS HONOUR: Yes that bail continues to the date.

ROWAN: Would your Honour excuse the offender if legally represented?

HIS HONOUR: I excuse the appellant, I excuse Mr Flaherty in person from attending the call-over provided he is legally represented.

ROWAN: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: All right so we’ve got that bail, same conditions as at the conclusion of the trial.

I confirm that the reporting conditions are deleted. I add that he is to prosecute the appeal with due diligence and I add that the bail is continued until 3 March 2016 and I direct that the matter be referred to the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal to the call-over on that date and I excuse Mr Flaherty from having to appear at the call-over provided he is legally represented.

HIS HONOUR: This MFI will be 16.

MFI #16 DOCUMENT

ROWAN: Your Honour I think your Honour indicated that you’d taken out a request for transcripts.

HIS HONOUR: Yes I think if I didn’t I think we have made a request for yesterday’s transcript.

DALEO: Your Honour one matter--

HIS HONOUR: If we haven’t I direct that a transcript of yesterday’s sentence be ordered and made available to me for revision. I direct also that a transcript of my bail decision today be made out and made available to me for revision.

Anything else?

DALEO: Your Honour there was a s 9 bond apparently that your Honour imposed yesterday, I’m not aware of whether it was entered or not.

HIS HONOUR: Nor am I, I assume it was. I assume that Mr Flaherty was taken to Registry to have--

ROWAN: I think the Registry might have - I don’t know - the short is no.

HIS HONOUR: He needs to enter it.

ROWAN: Yes we’ll do that.

HIS HONOUR: He needs to enter the bond and he probably needs to sign a bail undertaking.

ROWAN: I think that’s right.

HIS HONOUR: All right anything else?

DALEO: No your Honour I just wasn’t’ sure if your Honour kept the s 9 bond to start from yesterday or if your Honour adjourned it to start from today.

HIS HONOUR: I don’t know either. My guess is yesterday was the s 9 bond.

DALEO: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: If there’s any doubt I’ll order that it was from yesterday.

DALEO: When he gets to the Registry I’m sure they’ll let him know.

HIS HONOUR: Right is there anything else Ms Rowan, Ms Daleo?

DALEO: Your Honour I understand there’s the material in relation to the child protection offender’s registration that needs to be placed with the court file.

HIS HONOUR: I don’t know what you mean, what material where is it?

DALEO: I have a sealed envelope your Honour, I’m instructed that it’s for the attention of the court, rather than your Honour and is to be placed on the file.

HIS HONOUR: Who is the court if it is not me?

DALEO: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Let me have a look at it please. Do you mind me looking at it Ms Rowan I mean none of us knows what it is.

ROWAN: No, I’d be fascinated if somebody knew what it was.

DALEO: I think it’s paper work your Honour--

HIS HONOUR: It’s from a police officer.

DALEO: Your Honour it’s paper work to place the offender on the offender’s register your Honour. I can indicate your Honour I haven’t seen the document it was provided in a sealed envelope.

HIS HONOUR: I guess that’s so that it wouldn’t be looked at, wouldn’t be a distraction from sentence or conviction. I’m going to mark it for identification 17, along with the envelope that it came in and make it available to counsel to work out what needs to be done. So you both need to look at it this afternoon. If you need a photocopy let my associate know.

MFI #17 DOCUMENT IN SEALED ENVELOPE

DALEO: Perhaps since it was a document that was provided to the Crown I might have it back.

HIS HONOUR: I’m not going to try to guess. I don’t have time to guess what it means so my associate will make it available to each of you to read now and if either of you needs a photocopy of it, just ask the court officer he will go and do it outside.

DALEO: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And if you think that I need to make some further determination it will have to stay around until the next--

DALEO: I don’t believe we do your Honour, I think it’s just an administrative matter.

HIS HONOUR: Nothing else.

		07 July 2016",2016-02-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768855,R v Abousleiman [2016] NSWDC 80,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Offences of domestic violence often cause harm to children who witness such violence. In this case the harm caused to two children was much more direct than simply witnessing violence, they were direct victims of it as well. That is a remarkable feature of the offences for which Mr Youssef Abousleiman is to be sentenced.
	
	
	He was living with a woman by the name of C. She had two children, A who was 4 years of age and J who was 2. C and the offender had been in a de facto relationship for about 8 months. The children were not those of Mr Abousleiman.
	
	
	A dispute arose between C and the offender concerning some telephone calls that were coming through to C’s mobile phone. The offender became angry because she would not answer repeated telephone calls coming to the mobile phone from a private number. Why he would get angry is difficult to determine, but angry he did get. He began yelling at her and while they were in the bedroom in the presence of the two children I have mentioned the offender kicked C in her lower back and struck her with force to her head and face a number of times. As he continued to strike C he came into contact with A and J. Eventually he stopped.
	
	
	About half an hour later C noticed that her children had been injured. The offender told her to go to hospital with the children and he called for a taxi. C and her children attended Canterbury Hospital. They were all found to be injured. C was found to have bruising to her hip and back as well as tenderness and swelling to her face and head. She was walking with a limp and had makeup covering bruising to her face. A was found to have bruising to her head and a 2 x 2 centimetre bluish or purple bruise to her right cheek which was swollen. J was found to have a fracture of his left femur with surrounding swelling.
	
	
	I might say something about the nature of the injury to J. Ordinarily I would have considered that a fractured left femur amounted to grievous bodily harm, but to take that into account would be to breach the rule in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. Accordingly I will sentence the offender on the basis that the fracture was a minor one. That may well have been the case anyway because there is no suggestion that J was significantly in pain or unable to walk after his injury was sustained.
	
	
	The offender was arrested the day after he committed these offences. He was certainly not remorseful at the time he was interviewed by police because he denied all allegations. He was then remanded in custody until he was released on bail and was sent to attend a rehabilitation centre which has had some success.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty in the District Court to three offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. These pleas of guilty came about after negotiations between lawyers acting for him and lawyers acting for the prosecution. In those circumstances I will impose upon him a sentence which is 15% less than it would otherwise have been. The pleas of guilty are also one of a number of factors that have led to me considering the imposition of a different form of sentence from that I would otherwise have imposed.
	
	
	The offender is currently employed as an apprentice spray painter. A very informative reference was tendered from his employer. Informative because the employer not only spoke highly of the man that the offender is today but was also critical of the way he was before, indeed he said:
	


“We were very reluctant to put Joe back on after his was released from rehab in March 2015.”


	
	It appears that there has been a significant change in the offender. He was previously a man who used a lot of drugs. Indeed he told the author of the pre-sentence report that he had smoked a significant amount of cannabis, as was his daily habit, before the offences took place and that he found that under the influence of cannabis he was antisocial, paranoid and angry.
	
	
	There has been evidence tendered today which demonstrates that the offender is no longer using drugs and has successfully completed the rehabilitation program to which he went upon release on bail. This suggests that there are good prospects of rehabilitation. If the offender is able to put his drug using days behind him then it is highly likely that he will also put his offending ways behind him. He does have priors for criminal offences committed in 2007 and 2008 but significantly, although these offences were committed some time ago, there has been no suggestion of any further criminal behaviour.
	
	
	The time that the offender spent in custody before he was released on bail was about three and a half months, and I will take that into account of course. I will also take into account that for six months he was in quasi custody undergoing residential rehabilitation.
	
	
	I note that these matters could have been dealt with in the Local Court and probably would have were it not for other charges initially being laid against the accused. I note there has been some delay, not great, but some delay in finalising these matters which has allowed the offender to demonstrate rather than just promise rehabilitation.
	
	
	It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that the sentences imposed for offences must reflect their objective gravity. Here the objective gravity of the offending was high. The two children were very young indeed. The offender may not have deliberately targeted them with acts of violence but he was certainly reckless in the way he assaulted C and continued to assault her while the children were present. As I mentioned at the beginning of these remarks on sentence it would be bad enough that he was prepared to assault C while her children were watching, but to assault her in such a way that he caused injuries to the children is a matter of grave concern.
	
	
	I am satisfied that a custodial sentence is required, even given that the offender has spent some time in custody and spent some time in quasi custody. A custodial sentence of some form is required to reflect the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. The question becomes how long that sentence should be and if appropriate what form that sentence should take. I am satisfied that a sentence of less than 2 years is appropriate.
	
	
	That brings into play a number of sentencing options. Mr Pickin submitted that a suspended sentence would be appropriate. He said that the Crown would concede that such a sentence was available. I don’t think the Crown did but, even if the Crown had, I would not have imposed a suspended sentence. A suspended sentence in my view would not punish the offender significantly enough to reflect the objective gravity of his misconduct. I am satisfied that the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender is an intensive corrections order should the offender be suitable for such a sentence.
	
	
	Accordingly, I will continue his bail until 27 May 2016. I will refer Mr Abousleiman for assessment as to his suitability to serve a custodial sentence by means of an intensive corrections order.

		18 May 2016",2016-02-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768856,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 26) [2016] NSWSC 141,"Judgment


	
	The Crown seeks to lead evidence of what are said to be admissions made by the accused McNamara when he was detained by the police on 24 May 2014. On that date, the accused was in the presence of Dets. Clingan and Jouni when another officer from the Crime Scene Unit was engaged in photographing the accused and obtaining biometric measurements from him.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Clingan's statement of 8 October 2014 reads as follows:
	


“While this was being conducted the accused spoke to Detective Jouni and I. The accused repeated a number of times 'I've been a goose, look, I've just been a goose. I was a goose' ""


	
	According to Det. Clingan’s statement, the accused then stated that he “had a story to tell but not now” and “not all is as it seems”.
	
	
	Ms Shead objects to the statements attributed to the accused. Although Ms Shead's written submissions were initially limited to objecting to that part of the accused’s statement set out in [2] above, she made it clear at the commencement of submissions that her objection extended to those attributed to the accused in [3] above as well.
	
	
	Given the width of s. 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) Ms Shead conceded that the evidence was relevant. However, she submitted that the evidence should be rejected, pursuant to s. 137, or alternatively s. 135, of the Act. As an alternative submission, Ms Shead put that there had been a breach of s. 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and that, as a consequence, the evidence was not admissible.
	
	
	In support of her primary submission, Ms Shead submitted that the limited probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused in the event that it was admitted. She submitted that such danger arose from the equivocal and ambiguous terms in which the statements were made. She submitted, in particular, that if the evidence were admitted, there was a danger that it would be misused by the jury, or that it would be given greater weight than was warranted in the circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the probative value of the evidence was limited. However, the Crown submitted that the matter was really a question of weight, and argued that Ms Shead had failed to articulate any specific danger which might attract the provisions of s. 137. The Crown further submitted that it would remain open to Ms Shead to make submissions to the jury in relation to the evidence and that, in all of these circumstances, no danger of unfair prejudice of the kind to which s. 137 applies arose.
	
	
	The statements made by the accused are inherently equivocal in nature. In my view, there is a distinct danger of unfair prejudice to the accused if the evidence is admitted. That unfairness, in my view, stems from the attribution, or possible attribution, of an adverse meaning to the statements in circumstances where they are open to a number of interpretations. That is quite different to a question of weight.
	
	
	I am also unable to accept the Crown's submission that any danger of unfair prejudice is capable of being ameliorated by the opportunity for counsel to address the jury in relation to the issue in her closing address. If that were the simple answer, then s. 137 would rarely come into play.
	
	
	For all of those reasons, I am satisfied that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed, and outweighed substantially, by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. Accordingly, the evidence will be excluded.

2768873,Valenti v R [2016] NSWCCA 17,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Beech-Jones J.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I have read the judgment of Beech-Jones J. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes and, subject to what follows, with his Honour's reasons for those orders. What follows are observations concerning Grounds 1, 2 and 3,
	
	
	Justice Beech-Jones discusses at [29]-[32] the procedure that needs to be adopted where a sentencing judge proposes to refer an offender for assessment as to their suitability for an Intensive Correction Order.
	
	
	As Beech-Jones J noted at [32], the procedure for imposition of an ICO has the effect that the sentencing judge will often record the reaching of the conclusion that no alternative to full time imprisonment is warranted at an earlier point, being prior to the referral of an offender for an assessment. However, there is another matter which needs to be determined and recorded at that point, namely, the length of the sentence. As has been made clear in Zamagias at [23]-[32] and by Johnson J in Douar at [70]-[72] the second step of determining the length of the sentence is to be made without regard to the manner in which the sentence is to be served. Once the length of the sentence has been determined the Court is to consider whether any alternative to full time imprisonment is available in respect of that term and whether any available alternative should be utilised.
	
	
	The manner in which the sentence hearing proceeded leaves me with some doubt that this course was followed in the present case. I say that accepting entirely that it is necessary to read the Remarks on Sentence in conjunction with what was said by his Honour during the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	It may be accepted that his Honour had reached the view at the conclusion of the proceedings that no sentence other than a sentence of imprisonment was appropriate. His Honour made a statement to that effect at the conclusion of submissions. At an earlier time, and after the Crown had concluded its submissions, his Honour gave an indication to counsel for Mr Valenti that in his view a suspended sentence or any lesser sentence would be inappropriate. At that point his Honour identified the matters which led him to that prima facie view.
	
	
	When, at the conclusion of submissions, his Honour expressed the view that no alternative other than a period of imprisonment was appropriate he went on to say:
	


“The law provides that, where the term of imprisonment is one of two years or less, the matter may be referred for consideration of an Intensive Correction Order. That is the course I propose to take in this matter.”


	
	When the matter returned to Court for the imposition of the sentence his Honour delivered his Remarks on Sentence where he reaffirmed that a sentence of imprisonment was appropriate having considered the available alternatives. He then said this:
	


“I gave consideration to whether any term of imprisonment could be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order, and a report was sought and has been provided. …

He has been assessed as suitable in those circumstances, and as earlier indicated, I intend to impose a sentence of imprisonment to be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order.” (emphasis added)


	
	It was only after those statements at the time he imposed the sentence, and for the first time, that his Honour indicated the term of imprisonment was to be for 20 months to be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order.
	
	
	The impression I have from that course of events, and having regard to that portion of his Honour's Remarks emphasised above, is that his Honour did not follow the three stage process discussed in Douar. There is no indication in any of the material that his Honour had determined the length of the sentence before considering how that sentence should be served. The only reference at the sentencing proceedings was to the maximum period allowable under s 71(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act.
	
	
	It is understandable in those circumstances why it was submitted on behalf of Mr Valenti that the Sentencing Judge had impermissibly lengthened the term of the sentence to compensate for the perceived leniency of an ICO. However, I agree with Beech-Jones J that such a conclusion is not to be drawn lightly and I do not draw that conclusion. Nevertheless, the impression that was created could have been avoided if the Sentencing Judge had more clearly followed the three stage process where the length of the sentence was clearly determined before the manner of its being served was decided.
	
	
	I am not satisfied, however, that Mr Valenti has established error on the part of the Sentencing Judge, only a doubt as to the course followed.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: On 1 December 2014 the applicant for leave to appeal, Christopher Valenti, was arraigned before a jury panel on an indictment that charged him with an offence under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the “DMTA”) of supplying a prohibited drug, namely cocaine. On 3 December 2014 the jury returned a verdict of guilty.
	
	
	On 2 April 2015 Mr Valenti was sentenced to twenty months imprisonment. Pursuant to s 7(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the “Sentencing Act”) the Court ordered that his sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community (an “Intensive Corrections Order” or “ICO”).
	
	
	Mr Valenti now seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. A number of grounds of appeal are raised but in essence he contends that it was not open to the sentencing judge to find that no penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate for his case (Sentencing Act, s 5(1)), and that otherwise the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. For the reasons that follow, I would reject these contentions.
	


The offence


	
	The following description of the offence is taken from the sentencing judgment. At about 9.00pm on 20 December 2013, police officers attended a bar in Pitt Street, Sydney. A drug detection dog and its handler identified Mr Valenti. Mr Valenti was questioned by police and he handed them a wallet containing twelve small resealable bags. Each of the bags contained an amount of cocaine. The total amount of cocaine in Mr Valenti’s possession was 7.68 grams. On testing it was found to be 53.5% pure. The sentencing judge found that on average each bag had a retail value of approximately $250. When questioned at the scene Mr Valenti denied that he intended to sell the bags and instead stated that he intended to use the drugs himself.
	
	
	As the amount of cocaine seized was in excess of the “trafficable quantity” (3 grams), Mr Valenti was deemed to have the drugs in his possession for the purpose of supply unless he could prove otherwise on the balance of probabilities (DMTA s 29(1)). At his trial Mr Valenti maintained his assertion that the drugs were solely intended for his personal use. The jury did not accept his case. In the sentencing judgment his Honour noted the value of the drugs and also noted that shortly prior to the police attending the bar, Mr Valenti had received an SMS message warning him of their presence. His Honour found that Mr Valenti “had possession of the cocaine divided into twelve separate bags both for his own use, in part, and otherwise for sale, in part”.
	
	
	While it was not the subject of a separate ground of appeal, in his oral submissions senior counsel for Mr Valenti, Mr Ramage QC, queried this finding. However, given the quantity and value of the cocaine and the manner in which it was packed, a finding beyond reasonable doubt that at least part of the cocaine was intended for sale by Mr Valenti was clearly open to the sentencing judge.
	


Sentence proceedings


	
	After the jury’s verdict was delivered on 3 December 2014, his Honour adjourned the proceedings to 13 February 2015. On that day his Honour received a number of favourable testimonials in support of Mr Valenti, a short report from a psychotherapist stating that Mr Valenti was not in “active addiction”, a pre-sentence report and a copy of Mr Valenti’s criminal antecedents. Counsel for Mr Valenti made detailed submissions to the effect that his client should receive a non-custodial sentence.
	
	
	During submissions on 13 February 2015 the sentencing judge indicated that a suspended sentence or any lesser sentence “would be inappropriate”. His Honour noted that Mr Valenti “was, in fact, a supplier and he has at least a previous matter involving prohibited drugs in his history”, and later stated that Mr Valenti was “a person who was actually concerned in the sale of prohibited drugs in a restaurant or nightclub premises”. At the conclusion of submissions the sentencing judge stated that “I am of the view that there is no alternative other than a period of imprisonment that can be appropriately ordered”. His Honour referred Mr Valenti for assessment for an ICO and adjourned the proceedings to April 2015.
	
	
	As stated, on 2 April 2015 his Honour sentenced Mr Valenti. I have already noted the finding his Honour made concerning the form of Mr Valenti’s drug supply. In addition, the following six points should be noted about his Honour’s sentencing judgment.
	
	
	First, his Honour noted that Mr Valenti had two previous convictions for driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood, and a conviction in 2010 for possession of a prohibited drug. For the drug offence he received a two year bond under s 10 of the Sentencing Act. His Honour found that that drug offence “must have been of a relatively minor nature”.
	
	
	Second, his Honour described Mr Valenti’s personal circumstances. As at the date he was sentenced Mr Valenti was twenty-eight years old. His Honour noted that Mr Valenti was single and resided with his parents in the Mosman area and that they were supportive of their son. Mr Valenti had worked for a construction company for four years. He worked six days a week including Saturdays.
	
	
	Third, his Honour found that Mr Valenti’s conduct “must be considered as a serious offence”, but also that given that some of the substance was for personal use, the matter “falls towards the lower end of seriousness for an offence of this nature”.
	
	
	Fourth, his Honour noted that Mr Valenti co-operated with the police when he was apprehended, although he falsely claimed that the whole of the cocaine was for his personal use.
	
	
	Fifth, his Honour found that Mr Valenti represented a low risk of re-offending.
	
	
	Sixth, pursuant to s 81(2) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (the “Administration Act”) his Honour imposed a number of mandatory obligations as prescribed by the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2014 (the “Administration Regulation”), specifically Reg 186, on the ICO. Those obligations included a requirement that Mr Valenti undertake 32 hours of community service per month (sub-reg 186(o)).
	


Grounds 1, 2 and 3: Error in imposition of a sentence of imprisonment and failure to consider alternatives to imprisonment


	
	Ground 1 of the appeal contends that the sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence of imprisonment. Ground 2 contends that the sentencing judge erred in failing to consider and sentence Mr Valenti by way of a good behaviour bond. Ground 3 contends, in the alternative, that the sentencing judge erred in failing to consider and sentence Mr Valenti by way of a suspended sentence.
	
	
	To address these grounds it is necessary to briefly note aspects of the statutory regime governing the imposition of an ICO. Subsection 5(1) of the Sentencing Act provides that a sentencing court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless satisfied “having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate”. Subsection  7(1) provides that a court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than 2 years may make an ICO. Subsection 7(3) provides that s 7 is subject to Part 5 of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	In R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [23] to [32] (“Zamagias”) Howie J discussed the structure of this part of the Sentencing Act prior to the provisions allowing for the imposition of an ICO. His Honour identified the first step as the application of s 5(1). If the sentencing judge concludes that an alternative to imprisonment is not appropriate the sentencing judge then undertakes a “two step approach”. First the judge determines what the term of the sentence should be “without regard to whether the sentence will be immediately served or the manner in which it is to be served” (at [26]), and then they determine whether an “alternative to full-time imprisonment is available in respect of that term and whether any available alternative should be utilised” (at [28]). At the time Zamagias was decided those alternatives included a suspended sentence and periodic detention. Since 2010 they have also included an ICO.
	
	
	The operation of other statutory provisions concerning the imposition of an ICO, including those found within Pt 5 of the Sentencing Act, were outlined and discussed by McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J in R v Pogson; R v Lapham; R v Martin [2012] NSWCCA 225 at [38] to [72]. Of present relevance is s 69(1) of the Sentencing Act which provides that, before imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, a court may refer the offender for assessment as to their suitability for an ICO. However, s 69(2) precludes the court from referring an offender for such an assessment “unless satisfied, having considered all the alternatives, that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate and that the sentence is likely to be for a period of no more than 2 years”. Hence, at the time the sentencing court refers an offender for assessment under s 69(1) it must have formed the relevant opinion under s 69(2). This necessarily means it has formed an opinion under s 5(1) of the Sentencing Act adverse to the offender.
	
	
	Ordinarily a conclusion that no alternative to full time imprisonment was warranted would only find its final expression in the sentencing judgment published at the time sentence is imposed. However the procedure for imposition of an ICO has the effect that the sentencing judge will often record the reaching of that conclusion at an earlier point, being prior to the referral of the offender for an assessment as to their suitability for an ICO. As noted, in this case the sentencing judge announced that conclusion after the completion of submissions on 13 February 2015.
	
	
	The written submissions lodged on behalf of Mr Valenti contended that his Honour failed to give reasons for determining that the sentence of full time imprisonment was the only appropriate penalty. They also emphasised Mr Valenti’s strong subjective case and the supposedly minor nature of his offence as supportive of the conclusion that it was not open to his Honour to reach that conclusion.
	
	
	I do not accept these contentions. In the sentencing judgment his Honour stated as follows:
	


“The community has indicated that such offences must be regarded seriously by providing for a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years. The availability of prohibited drugs whether it be cocaine, heroin, methyl amphetamine or cannabis in the community, and particularly in night clubs and bars, is a serious concern to the whole community, which of course is reflected by the maximum penalty available.

I am of the opinion that in respect of this particular matter, a sentence of imprisonment is appropriate. Having determined when the matter was last before me on 3 December 2014 that a sentence of imprisonment would be imposed, having considered the available alternatives, I gave consideration to whether any term of imprisonment could be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order and a report was sought and has been provided.” (emphasis added)

(The reference to 3 December 2014 in this passage appears to be erroneous. Presumably it should be a reference to 13 February 2015.)


	
	The above observations reveal that his Honour adopted a staged approach to s 5 and s 7 consistent with what was stated in Zamagias (and Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455). Further, in my view it is clear that his Honour considered that the nature of the offending was so serious, especially when one has regard to the maximum penalty available for the offence, that the imposition of anything other than a sentence of full-time imprisonment would not be an appropriate penalty. The comments made by his Honour during the sentencing proceedings on 13 February 2015 are consistent with this.
	
	
	Subsection 5(1) of the Sentencing Act is an important provision designed to direct the attention of the sentencing courts to the need to consider the alternatives to imprisonment (see Martin v R [2013] NSWCCA 24 at [44]). As such, in cases where it is submitted to the Court that a non-custodial sentence is an appropriate penalty, it is at least preferable that sentencing judges explain the basis on which they are satisfied that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. In this case his Honour’s reasons for reaching that conclusion are in my view sufficiently evident from the passage set out above (see [34]). Further, while it would have been open to another sentencing judge to reach a different conclusion, there is in my view no basis for concluding that it was not open to his Honour to reach that conclusion given the maximum penalty for the offence, the finding that at least some of the drugs were intended for sale, and Mr Valenti’s previous conviction for drug possession, albeit a minor one.
	
	
	It follows that grounds 1 and 2 should be rejected. His Honour provided sufficient reasons for reaching an opinion that was adverse to Mr Valenti under s 5(1) of the Sentencing Act, and that conclusion was not shown to be relevantly affected by error. Otherwise, in rejecting the “available alternatives” (see [34]) the sentencing judge was clearly adverting to the possibility of imposing a suspended sentence. I would reject ground 3.
	


Grounds 4 and 5: Error in imposing a sentence of twenty months, a sentence which was manifestly excessive


	
	Ground 4 of the application contends that the sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence of imprisonment of twenty months to be served by way of an ICO. Ground 5 contends that the sentence imposed was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The written submissions in support of these grounds make three related points. First, it is contended that the term of the sentence was unduly harsh and severe, especially when regard is had to the statistics concerning sentences for offences of supplying less than a commercial quantity of cocaine. Second, it is submitted that it is likely that the sentencing judge impermissibly lengthened the term of the sentence to compensate for the perceived leniency of an ICO. Third, it was submitted that the work conditions included in the ICO imposed a particular hardship upon Mr Valenti.
	
	
	The second contention has no substance. A conclusion that a sentencing judge deliberately expanded the term of the sentence to counter some perception that an ICO was lenient is not to be drawn lightly. Nothing in the sentencing judgment suggests that his Honour reasoned in that way.
	
	
	In relation to the third matter, one complaint was that the sentencing judge failed to take into account Mr Valenti’s particular circumstances in deciding to impose a work condition as part of the ICO. This contention was ultimately not pressed when it was pointed out that the sentencing judge was obliged to impose the work condition by the operation of s 81(2) of the Administration Act, and subclause 186(o) of the Administration Regulation. Further, the pre-sentence report that was tendered before his Honour reported that Mr Valenti had told the officer who prepared the report that he worked six days per week and performed unpaid work for his family business, but that he “would make Saturdays available to attend community service”. In submitting on 13 February 2015 that a community service order should be imposed Mr Valenti’s counsel stated that Mr Valenti would attend and comply with any such order despite his work commitments. In addition, as counsel for the Crown submitted on the appeal, a community service order can require an offender to perform up to a maximum of 500 hours community service work. The ICO imposed upon Mr Valenti requires him to perform a total of 640 hours of community service work. The difference between those two figures does not support any argument that the work condition rendered the sentence imposed upon Mr Valenti manifestly excessive.
	
	
	At the hearing of the appeal Mr Ramage QC sought to read an affidavit from Mr Valenti concerning the difficulties he is currently experiencing with complying with the work condition of his ICO. In that affidavit Mr Valenti states that he was initially required to attend community service work on Fridays. To meet that commitment Mr Valenti’s employer deducted that time from his annual leave. Thereafter Mr Valenti undertook community service on Saturdays. Mr Valenti states that in May 2015 he obtained a new position as a project manager. In that position he is required to work sixty-five hours a week and currently works from 6.30am to 8.00am on a Saturday before commencing his community service work. Mr Valenti states that the combined effect of his work commitments and his community service is affecting his physical and mental health. Mr Valenti states that he has not told his new employer that he is performing community service because of a sense of embarrassment and shame.
	
	
	The Crown objected to this affidavit on the basis that fresh or new evidence of this kind was not admissible in this application. In Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 (“Khoury” at [110]) Simpson J noted that “evidence of events or circumstances or facts that had arisen entirely since sentencing cannot be taken into account” by this Court at the point of determining whether a sentence is affected by error such that intervention is warranted “no matter how compelling they may be”. However, her Honour also noted (at [113]) that “too rigid” an application of this principle has the potential to cause injustice and “has led to the development of the sub-set of evidentiary propositions peculiar to the admission of additional evidence in applications for leave to appeal against sentence”. I described the circumstances in which medical evidence obtained after sentence might be admitted on this basis in Turkmani v R [2014] NSWCCA 186 at [65] to [66] and [81] to [83]. How far the “propositions peculiar” to sentence appeals may extend and, in particular, whether they enable the admission of evidence of hardship in complying with the conditions of an ICO that have only become fully evident after sentence is not entirely clear. In R v Tannous; R v Fahda; R v Dibb [2012] NSWCCA 243 at [25], Basten JA stated that the preferable course was not to receive evidence concerning the operation of an ICO in a particular case.
	
	
	In any event, on any view of the principles concerning the admission of material obtained after sentence, Mr Valenti’s affidavit is irrelevant and thus not admissible. The particular hardship that has ensued to him from the necessity to comply with work conditions is a consequence of his decision to accept the position of project manager after he was sentenced and during the term of his ICO. It was otherwise apparent during the course of the sentencing proceedings that one possible, and indeed likely, outcome of the sentence proceedings was that he was required to undertake community service work and that would necessitate a rearrangement of his work commitments or otherwise require him to work long hours. Further, on and after 13 February 2015 it was evident that it was likely he would receive an ICO. In that regard, his counsel is taken to be aware of the effect of s 81(2) of the Administration Act and sub-clause 186(o) of the Administration Regulation. It follows that I would reject Mr Valenti’s affidavit.
	
	
	There remains the contention that the sentence was manifestly excessive especially when one has regard to the Judicial Commission statistics concerning the penalties imposed on offenders convicted of supplying cocaine in an amount less than the commercial quantity (250 grams).
	
	
	The statistics are of no assistance to Mr Valenti. Of the 188 sentences imposed for such offences from 2008, 54% were sentenced to either full time imprisonment, home detention, periodic detention or received an ICO. Of the 16 such cases where the offender pleaded not guilty, ten received a sentence of full time imprisonment, periodic detention or an ICO. In any event the limited utility of such statistics has been extensively discussed in the authorities (see Knight v R [2015] NSWCCA 222). Amongst other matters, in drug cases the statistics do not record the weight and purity of the drug, the role of the offender and the nature of the drug supply operation (see R v Chidiac [2015] NSWCCA 241 at [56] per Price J).
	
	
	As for the overall complaint that the sentence was excessive, in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [59] the plurality stated:
	


“As was said in Dinsdale v The Queen ([2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325) …, ‘[m]anifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion’. And, as the plurality pointed out … in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 605] appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate ‘is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases’. Rather, as the plurality went on to say … in Wong, ‘[i]ntervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons’. But, by its very nature, that is a conclusion that does not admit of lengthy exposition.” (emphasis added)


	
	In circumstances where the maximum penalty for the offence was 15 years and the sentencing judge found that Mr Valenti possessed cocaine intending to sell at least part of the drug then, notwithstanding his strong subjective case, I am not satisfied that there must have been “some misapplication of principle”.
	
	
	It follows that I would reject grounds 4 and 5.
	


Relaxation of work condition


	
	In light of the matters addressed at [42] to [44] above, it is appropriate to note the effect of s 85 to s 87 of the Administration Act. Section 85(1) confers on the Commissioner for Corrective Services a discretion to grant permission for an offender not to comply with a work or reporting requirement. The Commissioner may grant that permission either for health reasons, on compassionate grounds, or “for any other reason the Commissioner thinks fit” (s 85(2)). The Commissioner may grant the permission subject to such conditions as the Commissioner determines (s 85(5)). A right of review of the Commissioner’s decision is conferred on an offender by s 87. In addition, s 86 provides:
	


“86 Direction to make up for work etc avoided

(1)   If the Commissioner grants an offender permission to not comply with a work or reporting requirement, the Commissioner may give such directions to the offender as the Commissioner determines to be necessary to ensure that the offender will undertake work or engage in an activity or program to the extent necessary to make up for the work, activity or program avoided as a result of the permission granted.

(2)   The offender’s intensive correction order is subject to a condition that the offender must comply with a direction of the Commissioner under this section.

(3)   The sentencing court may, on the application of the Commissioner, extend the offender’s intensive correction order by such period as the court considers necessary and appropriate for ensuring that the offender complies with a direction of the Commissioner under this section.

(4)   In determining an application to extend an offender’s intensive correction order under this section, the sentencing court is to give consideration to the following:

   (a)   any hardship likely to be experienced by the offender if the order is extended,

   (b)   the likelihood of the offender’s intensive correction order being revoked if the order is not extended, and any hardship likely to be experienced by the offender as a result,

   (c)   such other matters as the court considers relevant.

(5)   An intensive correction order cannot be extended under this section if the term of the sentence to which the order relates has ended.

(6)   The power of the sentencing court to extend an intensive correction order under this section is limited to one extension of no more than 6 months.

(7)   If an intensive correction order is extended under this section, the term of the sentence to which the order relates is, by this section, extended by the same period.”


	
	At the hearing of this application the Court enquired of Mr Ramage QC whether an application had been made under s 85(1) of the Administration Act on behalf of Mr Valenti for permission to not comply with the work requirement attached to his ICO. Mr Ramage QC indicated that no such application had been made. He submitted that it was his understanding that either the legislative provisions or at least the Commissioner’s practice was such that if the Commissioner did grant permission under s 85(1) then it automatically followed that an offender would be required to make up the work that was avoided as a result of the permission being granted. However, s 86(1) only confers a discretion on the Commissioner to require that the work avoided be made up; it is not obligatory. It may be that as a general practice the Commissioner usually requires that work so avoided be made up, but no authority is conferred on the Commissioner by these provisions to impose a rule that any work so avoided must be made up. Whether the Commissioner will or will not require that any work so avoided will be made up is ultimately a discretionary matter for him or her to consider having regard to the scheme created by, and objectives of, the Sentencing Act and the Administration Act.
	
	
	It follows that it is open to Mr Valenti to make an application for permission not to comply with his work requirement in part or in whole. Even if the outcome of that application was such that the Commissioner did impose a direction designed to ensure that the work is made up, there may be means by which it could be structured so as to avoid Mr Valenti being subject to the physical and mental stress that he refers to in his affidavit.
	


Conclusion


	
	I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

	SIMPSON JA: Pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the applicant seeks orders setting aside the judgment or order of Sides DCJ of 4 February 2016, refusing to grant a stay of proceedings on an indictment pursuant to which the applicant is charged with an offence against s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The applicant also seeks an order granting a stay of the proceedings on the indictment.
	
	
	By Notice of Motion filed in court on 17 February 2016, the applicant seeks interim orders for stay of the proceedings in the District Court. The applicant also seeks an order setting aside an order of the Children’s Court of 10 April 2015, committing him for trial to the District Court on a charge brought under s 52A of the Crimes Act, and an order remitting the criminal proceedings to the Children’s Court for redetermination under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) (“the CCP Act”). The relevant facts and circumstances are fully set out in the reasons for judgment delivered today in related proceedings in the Court of Appeal: JW v District Court of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 22.
	
	
	Section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act provides for appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal against certain interlocutory judgments or orders, by leave.
	
	
	Section 3(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides:
	


“(1)  The Supreme Court shall for the purposes of this Act be the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the court shall be constituted by such three or more judges of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct.”


	
	No direction as to the constitution of the court has been made by the Chief Justice. Section 22 of the Criminal Appeal Act identifies certain powers that may be exercised by a single judge of the court. It does not appear that that section requires a direction of the Chief Justice.
	
	
	The orders sought in the applicant’s Notice of Motion do not come within any of the powers mentioned in s 22. Accordingly, it is not within my power to grant the orders sought. The Notice of Motion is dismissed.

2768880,R v Gordon (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 291,"EX TeMPORE Judgment (REVISED)


	
	Following the argument yesterday and the further argument today, I rule that the concluding portion of paragraph 33 at page 13 of the statement of Leading Senior Constable Griffith of 21 February 2014, is inadmissible. Accordingly I reject the - I’ll call it stanza, because that’s essentially what it is - I reject the stanza commencing “The three large blood stains” and concluding “Daniel Cotter”.
	
	
	As I indicated yesterday I will give leave to the learned Crown Prosecutor to re-introduce the content of that stanza in an admissible form, subject to as proposed yesterday and at the service on Mr Watts of learned counsel for the defence of a supplementary report containing the substance of the additional evidence in chief that the Crown proposes to lead on that topic. I make this ruling because I am of the view that the expression “The rock was most likely used on a minimum of three applications to bludgeon the head of the deceased Daniel Cotter” is not substantially based upon Leading Senior Constable Griffith’s undoubted expertise but as a conclusion of primary fact which is property a matter for the jury to draw inferences about or not, on the basis of the whole of the evidence they hear. That is not to say that Senior Constable Griffith is not qualified to express opinions about the content of that stanza.
	
	
	I wish to add that I was persuaded by the arguments of the Crown Prosecutor that what I thought was impermissible blending of matters of assumption scientific fact and opinion is when considered in the whole context of the whole report not a difficulty. However be that as it may I think for the reasons I have rehearsed that stanza is inadmissible. During the course of discussion with counsel it has been indicated that an anticipation of obtaining supplementary evidence from the expert in admissible form the Crown will open the case indicating that his opinion is that the pattern of blood stains and hair on the three facets of the boulder are consistent with forceful contact between the head of the deceased and the boulder on three occasions.

2768881,AC v R [2016] NSWCCA 21,"Judgment


	
	HIDDEN J:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J: The Appellant stood trial before her Honour Judge Huggett and a jury of twelve on the following charges:
	


Count 1:   Sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years;

Count 2:   Sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years;

Count 3:   Common assault;

Count 4:   Aggravated indecent assault on a child under the age of ten years;

Count 5:   Common assault;

Count 6:   Assault occasioning actual bodily harm;

Count 7:   Assault occasioning actual bodily harm;

Count 8:   Sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years;

                 In the alternative:

Count 9:   Aggravated indecent assault on a child under the age of 16 years;

Count 10:   Assault occasioning actual bodily harm;

Count 11:   Common assault.


	
	Counts 1-7 involved the Appellant’s step daughter TF and counts 8-11 involved the Appellant’s daughter MC.
	
	
	The Appellant was found guilty of counts 1-6 and 10. He was found not guilty of counts 7-9 and 11.
	
	
	The Appellant was sentenced by Judge Huggett to an aggregate term of imprisonment for 22 years commencing 8 June 2014 and expiring 7 June 2036 with a non-parole period of 15 years expiring 7 June 2029.
	
	
	The Appellant now appeals and seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	


Ground la:   The judge erred in permitting use of evidence to prove tendency.

Ground lb:   The use of tendency evidence caused a miscarriage of justice.

Ground 3:   The verdicts in respect of counts 5 and 6 are unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence and/or the verdict in respect of count 7.

Ground 4:   The verdict in respect of Count 10 is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.


	
	A further ground, Ground 2, appealing against the admission and/or use of context evidence causing a miscarriage of justice has been abandoned. There is no application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed.
	


The offences


	
	Count 1 concerned an incident at Quakers Hill between 1 March 2005 and 1 April 2006 when TF was aged three or four years and the Appellant put his penis into TF’s mouth and required her to perform fellatio on him. In the course of TF’s interview with the police TF said that the Appellant had required her to perform fellatio on him on a number of occasions over a period of time. Count 1 was referable to the first time it was alleged this had happened.
	
	
	Count 2 involved the Appellant requiring TF to insert a hair brush into the anus of her twin sister AF with the Appellant assisting TF to do so. The incident took place between 1 July 2004 and 8 February 2005 at Marayong. At that time AF was aged three years.
	
	
	Count 3 was associated with count 2. For TF to insert the hairbrush into AF’s anus the Appellant put his hand over TF’s hand and forced her to insert the hairbrush. The touching of TF’s hand by the Appellant was asserted to be the common assault.
	
	
	Count 4 took place between 1 July 2005 and 15 June 2008 at Quakers Hill. It involved the Appellant holding a hairdryer to TF’s bottom when she had no pants on at the time. The hairdryer was turned on very hot and TF said it was painful. It was the touching of the naked bottom which constituted the act of indecency.
	
	
	Counts 5, 6 and 7 were of a similar nature. TF said that at various times and in various places the Appellant stood on or jumped on her stomach. This caused her pain and on two occasions it caused her to defecate in her pants. These counts all amount to assault and the pain and the defecation are said to amount to the actual bodily harm in respect of counts 6 and 7.
	
	
	Count 8 was alleged to be the insertion by the Appellant of a hose into the anus of MC at Lane Cove between 29 September 2011 and 8 October 2011. At the time MC was aged three years and MC was under the Appellant’s authority.
	
	
	Count 9 was charged in the alternative to Count 8. If the jury was not satisfied that there was actual penetration of the anus by the hose the use of the hose near the naked bottom of MC would amount to assault with an act of indecency.
	
	
	Count 10 concerned repeated hitting by the Appellant of MC because she had broken her brother’s toy car. This offence was said to have occurred between 29 September and 8 October 2011.
	
	
	Count 11 was said to be an assault by holding a cigarette lighter against MC’s leg and burning her leg. This assault is said to have occurred within the same timeframe as count 10.
	


Factual background


	
	AF and her twin sister TF were born to their mother AKF on 1 July 2001. Subsequently in 2003 AKF met the Appellant through an internet chat room. AKF decided to relocate to Sydney in June 2004 to be near to the Appellant. However, although AKF and the girls spent most of the time at the Appellant’s house, for a period of time they maintained two separate households with the Appellant living at Nairana Drive, Marayong and AKF living at Eastern Road, Quakers Hill. The Appellant had a daughter E from a previous relationship, and E stayed with the Appellant on alternate weeks.
	
	
	On 9 February 2005 AF died aged three years and seven months. The cause of her death was determined to be peritonitis. The autopsy showed that AF had an anal laceration.
	
	
	In March 2005 the Appellant, AKF and TF moved into a house together at Gwydir Avenue, Quakers Hill. Subsequently, the Appellant and AKF had three children, M born 28 March 2006, SC born in August 2007 and MC born 2 September 2008.
	
	
	TF first made complaint to her great grandmother, BD, on 16 June 2008, the day she travelled to Darwin with her great grandparents. The day after they arrived she made statements to her grandmother, ST, and her grandmother’s fiancé, Stephen, to the effect that the Appellant had made her say and do naughty things. ST contacted AKF who travelled to Darwin. Contact was made with the Northern Territory police and a number of recorded interviews with TF were made.
	


Grounds 1a and 1b - Tendency evidence


	
	On 12 November 2013 the Crown gave an amended tendency notice pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The tendencies sought to be proved in respect of the Appellant were tendencies to act in the following ways:
	


(a)   To insert objects into the anuses of very young children;

(b)   To inflict violence on very young children;

(c)   To burn very young children with a cigarette lighter;

(d)   To sexually assault very young children.

            (“the amended tendency notice”)


	
	The evidence intended to be adduced was identified as being in the following:
	


(1)   Recorded interview of [MC] dated 12 October 2011;

(2)   Recorded interview of [TF] dated 27 June 2008;

(3)   Recorded interview of [TF] dated 2 July 2008;

(4)   Recorded interview of [TF] dated 13 October 2011;

(5)   Recorded interview of [TF] dated 13 June 2012;

(6)   Statement of AKF dated 14 June 2012;

(7)   Statement of ST dated 13 June 2012;

(8)   Statement of Leanne Fraser 14 October 2013.

In respect of each document the particular parts of the document were specified.


	
	Each of the recorded interviews listed above and an additional interview with MC on 12 June 2012 was played at the trial. MC and TF were cross-examined.
	
	
	It is necessary, first, to detail the course of events which culminated in the directions the Trial Judge gave to the jury in relation to tendency evidence. The course taken appears to have been been influenced by the concern of the Judge and the parties that the trial would not finish before Christmas.
	


(a) The procedure followed


	
	There was no opposition by defence counsel to all of the counts charged being heard in the one trial. Nor did he object to the Crown leading context evidence which consisted of uncharged acts. Nor did counsel for the defence object to the tendency evidence being led although not as tendency evidence. However, defence counsel said that he opposed the evidence being used as tendency evidence against each complainant and as between counts.
	
	
	The Trial Judge suggested that it was not necessary to rule on the tendency evidence until after it was heard by the jury. A ruling could then be given and directions given to the jury. The Crown Prosecutor said that she could open in a limited way on the evidence and not make mention of tendency. Then, when the tendency evidence had been ruled upon by the Judge, and if it was allowed, she (the Prosecutor) could explain to the jury in her closing address how the tendency evidence was relied upon. Defence counsel agreed to that course.
	
	
	The trial then took place. After the close of the defence case argument took place on 12 December on the Crown’s amended tendency notice. The only matter raised by defence counsel was the issue of concoction and fabrication. Nothing was said on the matter of similarity of the acts relied upon or about the relationship between particular tendencies alleged and particular counts charged. During the course of that argument her Honour said that she would endeavour to complete the tendency direction “and perhaps the context direction” before the following morning,
	


and perhaps try and email it to you, you both can see that before the addresses commence so that everyone is clear as to what the direction would be and the way the jury could use it and the way they cannot use it. So perhaps we can – if any of you wish to say anything when you see that. If it’s not before your addresses, you will certainly see it before it’s delivered in the summing-up so everyone will know and be in agreement as to what is being said.


	
	That night, the Trial Judge provided to the parties a draft context and tendency direction by email. That document became MFI 14. The Crown Prosecutor told her Honour the following morning (Friday 13 December) before she commenced her address that she did not have it. The Trial Judge provided a hard copy of it at morning tea during the Crown’s closing address but prior to the Crown dealing with the tendency issue. MFI 14 appeared to accept the four tendencies identified by the Crown in the amended tendency notice.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury all that day. In the afternoon she dealt with the tendency evidence briefly. She referred to the four tendency areas contained in the amended tendency notice.
	
	
	At 8.55am on Monday 16 December the Trial Judge emailed to counsel a further document headed “Tendency Direction”. This document became MFI 16. The significant difference from MFI 14 was that the Judge reduced the four tendency areas to two. The first was roughly similar to paragraph (a) in the amended tendency notice. It was to assault young children sexually by inserting objects into or close to their anuses. The second was roughly similar to paragraph (b) which was refined to a tendency to assault young children physically by stepping or jumping on their stomach and by hitting them on the buttocks. At the start of proceedings on 16 December the Crown said that she had not received MFI 16 and defence counsel said that he had not looked at it in detail. The Judge did not inform counsel of the significant change made before defence counsel commenced his address.
	
	
	After the morning tea adjournment, and when the jury had been sent home because a juror was unwell, the Trial Judge raised the change she had made in MFI 16. Shortly before the trial was adjourned on that day it was agreed that counsel should look at MFI 16 overnight and raise any matters with the trial judge the following day.
	
	
	On the following day defence counsel said that the only thing that concerned him were references to count 11. That appears to have been satisfactorily explained and defence counsel said he had nothing further to say. Neither counsel appears to have given any consideration to the fact that the Crown had addressed on four areas of tendency.
	
	
	Defence counsel completed his address but said nothing at all about tendency evidence. Her Honour then summed up to the jury.
	
	
	In her summing up on 17 December the trial judge made clear to the jury that tendency evidence could be relied on in two areas only. The first was the tendency to assault young children sexually by inserting objects into or close to their anuses. Her Honour related that tendency evidence to counts 2, 4 and 8/9. The second tendency was one to assault young children physically by stepping or jumping on TF’s stomach and by hitting MC or slapping or smacking or striking MC on her buttocks. This tendency evidence was related to counts 5, 6, 7, 10 and 11. The judge did not correct what the Crown had said in her closing address. Counsel for the Appellant sought no correction or redirection.
	
	
	After the jury was sent out to consider its verdict on 19 December her Honour delivered her judgment on the tendency evidence. As the trial judge explained in her judgment, that was done to avoid a lengthy voir dire prior to the jury being empanelled and in circumstances where Christmas was fast approaching.
	


(b)   The tendency judgment


	
	Consistently with her summing-up, the use of the evidence for tendency purposes was confined to the two areas referred to in MFI 16 ([30] above). The trial judge noted that there was no opposition to the Appellant being tried on all charges in the one trial and said that his counsel did not oppose evidence of “other acts” on the part of the accused which were not the subject of the tendency notice nor charged on the indictment. Further, defence counsel requested, and the trial judge acceded to the request, that no direction about tendency evidence be given at the time the evidence was led.
	
	
	Her Honour considered first the submission that both the probative value of the tendency evidence and the possibility of prejudicial effect had been affected by the risk of concoction. It was the defence case that the allegations had all been made as a result of the fabrication and concoction by the complainants’ mother AKF and/or their grandmother ST.
	
	
	Her Honour first considered whether the evidence demonstrated that the risk of concoction and rehearsal as regards either complainant was reasonable and real or whether it fell into the category of speculative or conjectural risk (following Colby v R [1999] NSWCCA 261).
	
	
	Her Honour considered the timing of the initial complaint by TF in relation to the circumstances of AKF (concerning her relationship at that time with the Appellant) and the location of her grandmother ST in Darwin together with the alleged motivation she had for bringing about the fabricated evidence, namely an allegation made against her husband Stephen by the Appellant, that Stephen had inappropriately touched TF. Her Honour also considered the age of MC and the timing of her visit to the doctor in relation to her access visit with the Appellant and what the doctor observed in terms of bruising on her.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded from all this that the risk of concoction and rehearsal as regards both complainants was neither reasonable nor real but fell into the category of speculative or conjectural risk.
	
	
	Her Honour considered that the evidence sought to be led as tendency evidence had significant probative value. When her Honour then considered each of the tendencies put forward she was of the view that tendencies (a) and (d) were really one and the same thing, that is, a tendency to assault young children sexually by the insertion of objects into their anuses. Further, her Honour thought that a tendency to act in the way asserted in (c) had not been established because there was only one allegation capable of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. That occasion formed the basis of count 11 and her Honour held that count 11 would fall within the tendency asserted in (b).
	
	
	Her Honour concluded in relation s 101(2) that where there was no objection to a joint trial of all the counts the prejudicial effect of the evidence was slight or minimal.
	


(c)    Submissions


	
	In this Court the Appellant submitted that, beyond the Sentencing Judge saying that “similarity is not required"" although it ""does assist in establishing significant probative value"", her Honour did not otherwise address the questions of similarity in the acts or the circumstances in which they occurred in determining whether the evidence had significant probative value for the purposes of s 97(1) of the Evidence Act.  This submission was directed to the second permitted tendency, namely to inflict violence on very young children. The Appellant accepted that the acts the judge permitted to be used to prove a tendency to assault very young children sexually (inserting objects in or near the anus) were relevantly similar, and that this first area of tendency evidence was properly allowed.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that the evidence of conduct permitted to prove a tendency to assault physically comprised such highly disparate acts as stepping or stomping on a child's stomach (counts 5, 6 and 7), smacking a child's bottom (count 10), and burning a child's leg with a lighter (count 11). The Appellant submitted further that it was not alleged that the conduct occurred in similar circumstances which otherwise established the probative value of the evidence. Reference was made to what was said by Hoeben CJ at CL (Adams & Hall JJ agreeing) in O’Keefe v R [2009] NSWCCA 121 at [60] and [63] about the generality of the tendency relied upon and how such generality would impact on the balancing exercise when having regard to prejudicial effect.
	
	
	The Appellant submitted that when considering whether the tendency evidence was prejudicial, her Honour failed to consider the evidence of “other acts” which was admitted at the trial. The result was, it was submitted, that the jury was required to perform the highly artificial task of employing tendency reasoning confined so as to exclude extensive evidence of multiple other acts that were indistinguishable in nature from the acts in respect of which tendency reasoning was permitted. Counsel drew attention by way of comparison with what was said in Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136, a case where there were no uncharged acts.
	
	
	In relation to the second ground concerning the use made of the tendency evidence, the Appellant pointed to what the Crown said in her closing address:
	


And the fourth tendency that the Crown relies on is that the accused has a tendency to sexually assault young children, namely to perform fellatio upon [TF], to force a broken hairbrush into [AF’s] anus by holding the wrist of [TF] who was holding the hairbrush in her hand. And to place a hairdryer inside or around [TF’s] anus and to place a hose inside or around [MC’s] anus. (emphasis added)

In addition the Appellant pointed to the fact that the Crown addressed on four tendencies whereas the Judge identified only two but did not correct the Crown’s statements including the statement that the Appellant had a tendency to assault young children sexually comprising acts of fellatio. Accordingly, the Appellant submitted, the prospect that the jury may have employed tendency reasoning with respect to evidence of such acts in determining the counts relating to offences of sexual assault could not be excluded.


	
	Whilst accepting that rule 4 applied because of the way defence counsel conducted the trial, the Appellant submitted that the use of the other evidence for tendency purposes caused a miscarriage of justice in that the Appellant may have lost a real chance of acquittal.
	
	
	The Crown drew attention to the fact that the course adopted at the trial was agreed to in all respects by defence counsel. The Crown submitted that the real issue at the trial was the issue of concoction and fabrication particularly as a result of the intervention of the mother and grandmother of the complainant TF. The Crown submitted that counsel for the Appellant wanted the evidence of all the other acts which was led at the trial. His only concern was whether it was allowed to be relied on for tendency purposes as opposed to context.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to r 4 and what was said in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [80]-[82] and Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229 at [72] concerning attempts at an appeal to put forward matters not dealt with at the trial.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that her Honour gave the jury clear directions about which counts the asserted tendencies could be used for. In relation to the first tendency her Honour had said it was only relevant to counts 2, 4 and 8/9. No complaint was made about the directions her Honour gave. The jury acquitted in relation to counts 8/9 and cannot, therefore, have taken into account the evidence on those counts to reach their verdicts on counts 2 and 4.
	
	
	Similarly, in relation to the second tendency, her Honour confined it to counts 5, 6, 7, 10 and 11. The jury acquitted in relation to counts 7 and 11 and could not therefore have taken into account that evidence in respect of counts 5, 6 and 10. The Crown submitted that, if the second tendency should not have been permitted because it was at too high a level of generality, there was no miscarriage of justice particularly when the jury discriminated between the counts in their verdicts.
	


(d)   Consideration


	
	It should first be said that the procedure adopted in relation to the tendency evidence was unsatisfactory. Although the parties seemingly knew by the time the Crown commenced her final address that the Judge was minded to permit the evidence that had already been led to be relied upon as tendency evidence the precise evidence that could be so used had not been identified. Indeed, the Crown had every reason to think from the contents of MFI 14 that the Judge was prepared to allow the four tendencies in the amended tendency notice.
	
	
	The Crown addressed on the basis of the four tendencies set out in the amended tendency notice. The Judge only reduced the areas to two after the Crown had completed her address. When the Judge summed up to the jury she did not draw the jury’s attention to the fact that, although the Crown had addressed in relation to four tendencies, her Honour had confined the evidence to two tendencies. Although the Judge’s directions to the jury were clear, and there is no appeal in respect of them, jurors paying close attention to what had been said to them by the Crown and the Trial Judge might have wondered about the inconsistency in that regard.
	
	
	Before saying anything further about the procedure followed (the complaint in Ground 1b), it must first be determined if her Honour wrongly allowed the evidence to be used as a tendency to assault young children physically.
	
	
	As has been noted, the Judge spent most of her judgment on the issue of concoction and fabrication because that was the only matter seemingly argued by defence counsel. Nevertheless, where the use of the evidence as tendency evidence was opposed the Judge was required to determine whether the evidence had significant probative value and whether that probative value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect. Although her Honour determined that the evidence had significant probative value she provided no reasons for that conclusion. She simply noted, when dealing with concoction and fabrication that the presence of similarity, whilst not required, assisted in establishing significant probative value. The difficulty was that, at those two points in her judgment, her Honour had not determined what tendencies she would allow. That tended to undercut her determination that the evidence had significant probative value as tendency evidence.
	
	
	Moreover, her Honour’s determination on the balancing exercise was also undertaken before identifying what tendencies were to be allowed. Prejudicial effect was dismissed on the basis that there was no objection to a joint trial on all counts, and on the basis that directions would be given during the summing up on how tendency evidence could be used. However, even if the matter of prejudice could be dealt with by directions, and in the ordinary case Sokolwskyji v R [2014] NSWCCA 55 suggests it cannot, the matter was compounded in the present case by the course of events I have earlier described, particularly the absence of any correction by the trial judge of what the Crown said in her address concerning four tendencies.
	
	
	Whereas the first tendency relied upon had some specificity about it, inserting objects in or close to the anuses of young children, the second tendency had some measure of generality. It was described to the jury in the Judge’s summing-up as
	


a tendency to physically assault young children by stepping and/or jumping on [TF’s] stomach and by hitting [MC], or slapping or smacking, striking [MC] on her buttocks as alleged in Counts 5,6,7,10 and 11, because of course Counts 5,6, and 7 relate to allegations by [TF] about the stepping or jumping on her stomach; Count 10 refers to an allegation of the assault of [MC] occasioning actual bodily harm, bruising to her buttocks area; and count 11 is an allegation alleging an assault upon [MC] involving a cigarette lighter and her leg.


	
	It can be seen, therefore, that the physical assaults were (a) stepping and/or jumping on a child’s stomach; (b) slapping, smacking or striking a child’s buttocks; and (c) holding a cigarette lighter to a child’s leg. Generally speaking, the closer and more particular the similarities are to the acts constituting the offence or offences charged, the more likely it is that the evidence will have significant probative value: O’Keefe v R [2009] NSWCCA 121 [60]; BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303 at [108]. However, that is not a necessary requirement: R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 338; (2009) 201 A Crim R 451 at [38], [41], [44] and [125]. In Ford Campbell JA (Howie and Rothman JJ agreeing) said at [38] that one of the errors made by the trial judge in that case was:
	


…the judge’s apparent view that the tendency evidence must itself show a tendency to commit acts that are closely similar to those that constitute the crime with which a particular accused is charged. That is not so. All that a tendency need be, to fall within the chapeau to section 97(1), is ‘a tendency to act in a particular way’.


	
	In Hughes v R [2015] NSWCCA 330 the Court said:
	


[182]   Thus, in summary, the law in this State is that whether the Court thinks that evidence has significant probative value for the purposes of s 97 involves an assessment by the Court as to whether a jury could treat it of importance in supporting an inference of guilt of the accused on the count charged. It is an assessment of the capacity of the evidence to have that effect. In undertaking that task, the Court must consider, having regard to the evidence adduced, whether there is a real possibility of an alternate (sic) explanation consistent with innocence.

[183]   In making the assessment whether evidence tendered as tendency evidence has significant probative value, regard will inevitably be had to similarities in the conduct relevant to the offence. That is different from requiring that the conduct bear similarities to the conduct with which the person is charged. This was emphasised by the Court in Saoud where Basten JA observed, at [44], that “the nature of the similarities will depend very much on the circumstances of the case”.


	
	Although the acts in the three categories identified above at [58] differ from one another, they are all examples of physical assaults of young children as the Crown alleged. Each is an act which the jury could treat of importance in supporting an inference of guilt on the counts to which that particular act was not otherwise referable. For the issues in relation to counts 5, 6, 7, 10 and 11 they were of significant probative value.
	
	
	The balancing exercise in relation to prejudice was an easier one because the evidence of these matters, as well as the evidence of uncharged acts, was led without objection. The cross-examination by defence counsel suggested a forensic reason for not having objected to this evidence. Any prejudice could arise only from the jury being able to consider each such act as a tendency to act in a particular way on a count in respect of which that evidence had not been led. In that way, the Appellant’s position was better protected by limiting the way the evidence could be used. In my opinion, there was no error in the Trial Judge’s determination that the evidence could be relied upon as tendency evidence.
	
	
	The present case can be distinguished from Sokolwskyji. The admissibility of the tendency evidence in that case was disputed. There was undoubted prejudice if it was led as is made clear at [48]. In the present case the evidence was led unopposed in relation to each count. It was only the use of the evidence for other counts that was the issue. As has been noted, it was not opposed as tendency evidence because of any lack of similarity of the acts to one another but only on the basis of concoction and fabrication. Defence counsel said nothing about the use of the evidence as tendency evidence in his address. The Judge gave clear directions as to its use, and those directions are not criticised nor challenged.
	
	
	It is instructive to examine the verdicts on the counts to which this tendency is said to be relevant. The jury were told that it related to counts 5, 6, 7, 10 and 11. Mr Gartelmann for the Appellant said that it also applied to count 3 because that is an assault count also. Count 3 was a technical assault, that is, the touching of TF’s hand while the Appellant assisted her to insert the hairbrush into AF’s anus that constituted count 2. The jury convicted on count 3 consistently with the conviction on count 2.
	
	
	Counts 5, 6 and 7 were the three counts involving the Appellant jumping on TF’s stomach. The fact that the jury acquitted on count 7 but convicted on counts 5 and 6 points strongly to the fact that the jury did not misuse the tendency evidence. In any event, these three counts involved the same or a very similar act. As between those counts the evidence was of significant probative value which easily outweighed any prejudice from the inclusion of the two other categories of assault evidence. In any event, the jury acquitted on count 11 (the cigarette lighter count), with the result that this evidence could not have been used to convict on counts 5 and 6.
	
	
	The remaining count was count 10. Determination of that matter involved a consideration of the evidence of MC, AKF, Dr Shaker, the Appellant and Dr Wearne (the paediatrician), together with the contemporaneous photographs. The detail of this is provided later when Ground 4 is considered. An issue on count 10 was the assertion by the Appellant that he only smacked MC once with her nappy on and his explanation for some of the bruising, namely, that she had a fall when she climbed out of her cot. When assessing those matters the jury may well have used the tendency evidence to reject the Appellant’s explanation.
	
	
	In my opinion, her Honour correctly determined that the second category of evidence was tendency evidence, the probative value of which substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect it may have had on the Appellant, and correctly instructed the jury on its use. For reasons which follow I do not, in any event, consider that a miscarriage of justice resulted from the use to which the evidence was put nor from the procedures followed at the trial.
	
	
	The matters referred to in paragraphs [25], [26], [27], [32], [33] and [34] above concerning defence counsel’s conduct at the trial, together with the acknowledgement by Mr Gartelmann at the hearing of this appeal, mean that in the first place r 4 applies. What is now complained of suggests a very different approach from that which was adopted at the trial. In that way, it can be understood why there was different emphasis in the judgment of the Trial Judge on the tendency evidence and why, to some extent at least, procedural matters unfolded in the way they did. The question is whether there has been a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	A number of matters, some mentioned already, point to there being no miscarriage of justice by reason of the tendency evidence. First, evidence of uncharged acts was led without objection as context evidence. In answer to a question from the Trial judge about whether the uncharged acts concerned other acts of fellatio, counsel for the defence responded:
	


Yeah other acts of fellatio. The Crown will be leading, what I apprehend is, context evidence. Whilst we resist tendency, there is a broad array of allegations which pertain to - would come under the heading of cruelty to children such as trying to put the child in a bin or a garbage bag, locking two children in a boot.

The exchange then continued:

CROWN PROSECUTOR: …The child does make an allegation in one of the interviews that the father wrapped - this is {MC] “He wrapped her up”--

DENNIS: “In sticky tape, sticky tape all over my mouth, sticky tape all over me, tried to put me in the oven, flushed my head down the toilet”.

 


	
	The interviews with the complainants contained other material of physical assaults such as the Appellant kicking TF in the neck (Interview 2/7/08 A 43 and 67) and throwing MC in a hot shower and making it hotter and hotter while she was in it (Interview 12/6/12 A 123). It is not now contended that this evidence should not have been led or allowed. The evidence was not qualitatively different from the evidence of physical assaults relied on as tendency evidence.
	
	
	Secondly, there was no opposition to all the counts being heard together. That necessarily resulted in all the evidence pertaining to each count being heard together. During argument Mr Gartelmann agreed with Adamson J, correctly in my opinion, that the giving of a tendency direction could, in the circumstances of the evidence being led, only have minimised the risk of the jury wrongly using all of the evidence as tendency evidence. Any prejudice to the Appellant by reason of the admission of all the evidence in a trial on multiple counts was thereby reduced. That was particularly so where there is no criticism of the Judge’s directions.
	
	
	Thirdly, as noted earlier, the jury’s ability to distinguish between the counts in the verdicts it reached points strongly to the conclusion that the jury heeded the directions given to them and did not thereby misuse the evidence. The matter is demonstrated most clearly by the acquittal on count 7.
	
	
	Finally, whilst acknowledging that the way the trial proceeded was unfortunate and unsatisfactory, the fact that the Judge did not refer to what the Crown had said regarding tendency evidence had the considerable advantage of not reminding the jury some four days later of the conflict in what was said. In addition, the jury was told in that summing-up that they must apply the law as her Honour directed them. If the jury remembered that the Crown had said things about tendency evidence inconsistent with what the Judge directed them, no note was sent to the Judge about the matter. All of that suggests that the way the trial proceeded did not disadvantage the Appellant.
	
	
	I would reject Grounds 1a and 1b.
	


Ground 3:   Unreasonableness of the verdicts for counts 5 and 6


	
	Counts 5, 6 and 7 each related to an alleged act of stepping/jumping on TF’s abdomen. The jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of counts 5 and 6, and a verdict of not guilty in respect of count 7. Counts 6 and 7 charged assault occasioning actual bodily harm because on the occasions that constituted those counts the complainant said in substance that she defecated as a result of the Appellant’s acts.
	
	
	Count 5 was alleged to have occurred after 1 April 2006 when TF began sharing a room with E following MC’s birth and before 15 June 2008 when TF went to Darwin. The evidence was to be found in TF’s 13 June 2012 interview. The offence is said to have occurred when TF was sleeping in the bottom bunk and the Appellant would stand on her tummy whilst he kissed E (in the upper bunk) good night.
	
	
	Count 6 was alleged to have occurred after 5 March 2005 when the family had moved into Quakers Hill with a playroom and before 1 April 2006 when MC was born. The evidence was contained in TF’s interview of 2 July 2008. It was alleged that the Appellant pushed TF on the floor in the playroom when it was her room and stepped on her belly causing her to defecate.
	
	
	Count 7 was alleged to have occurred after 1 July 2007 and before 15 June 2008 when TF went to Darwin. The evidence was contained in TF’s 13 October 2011 interview. TF said she was in her room but the Appellant grabbed her by the arm and took her into the hallway where he put her on the ground and stood on her tummy.
	
	
	TF was interviewed on 27 June 2008, 2 July 2008, 13 October 2011 and 13 June 2012.
	
	
	The Appellant drew particular attention to the time of reporting each of the incidents and to the lack of supporting evidence from ATF or ST after the complaint. In the Appellant’s written submissions it was said that the jury did not accept TF’s evidence in relation to what occurred that constituted count 7 because they found the Appellant not guilty of both the offence charged and the alternative of common assault. However, at the hearing of the appeal, the Appellant accepted that the complainant’s evidence of this event was vague as the Crown asserted. For example, the complainant had difficulty isolating the last time the Appellant jumped on her – that was how this count was particularised.
	
	
	The principles in relation to unreasonable verdicts have been comprehensively analysed in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 especially at [23] and [34]. Subsequently, in R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; (2009) 74 NSWLR 299 Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreed) said:
	


[135]  …But it seems to me that, where the circumstance said to create unreasonableness is inconsistency, then a new dimension is added to the conventional M test. The issue is not only whether the verdict was open “upon the whole of the evidence”. It is whether the verdict was open on the whole of the evidence, and having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, including the circumstance that the jury acquitted on one or some counts, whatever (if anything) can be discerned as the explanation for the acquittals, and whatever insight can be gained into the jury’s thinking and reasoning. It is only where the only reasonable explanation for the acquittals is doubt about the Complainant’s veracity that an appellate court would be obliged to take the approach taken in Jones (and in Norris).

[136] In my view an appellate court ought to exercise caution before concluding that the explanation for differential verdicts is compromise. Inherent in that conclusion is the further conclusion that the jury has acted contrary to its duty, and contrary to the instruction it has been given. The criminal justice system depends upon its faith in juries adhering to their obligations, as explained to them, and acting in conformity with those obligations: …


	
	In Dungay v R [2010] NSWCCA 82 Giles JA (RS Hulme and Latham JJ agreeing) said:
	


[9] Gleeson CJ and Hayne and Callinan JJ said in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [34], in relation to asserted inconsistency of verdicts, that “[t]he ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury’s decision”. Unreasonableness is determined according to the test in the joint judgment of Mason CJ and Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 493, namely, whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Their Honours said in MFA v The Queen at [35] that this test “must be applied in deciding whether a conviction on one or more counts of sexual offences, when the accused was acquitted on other counts, is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”.

[10] In TK v R [2009] NSWCCA 151 it was pointed out that M v The Queen also recognised that a verdict must be set aside if on any other ground there was a miscarriage of justice. It was suggested that where the unreasonableness is because of asserted inconsistency of verdicts there is a “new dimension added to the conventional M test”, going beyond the quality of the evidence and extending to the significance for the guilty verdict of the verdict of acquittal: see at [119]-[135] per Simpson J, Latham J agreeing at [204]. The wider inquiry “include[s] matters outside the evidence, such as the impact on the reasonableness of the verdict of guilty of what may be discerned to be the explanations for the acquittals”: at [128].

[11] It is not necessary to explore whether there is truly an addendum to the test derived from M v The Queen, or only an additional dimension within that test. Consistency or inconsistency of verdicts will always come down to what was open to the jury upon the whole of the evidence. Examination of the evidence, with an appreciation of how it was presented and left to the jury, will reveal whether there is a rational explanation for a verdict of guilty on one count and a verdict of not guilty on another count. In MFA v The Queen, for example, it was held at [36] that there was an explanation in the evidence of the differences between the verdicts, and that it was therefore open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of guilt on two counts notwithstanding unwillingness to convict on the other counts.

[12] If a rational explanation cannot be discerned, it can be said that it was not open to the jury upon the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in coming to the guilty verdict, or it can be said that there was otherwise a miscarriage of justice. The formulation will rarely be of moment, and is not in the present case. Ultimately, as Wood CJ at CL pointed out in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at [237], on reviewing the entirety of the case the court may maintain a comfortable satisfaction as to the guilty verdict upon the evidence separately considered concerning it.


	
	In Osland v R [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316 McHugh J said:
	


[120] When there is no legal or technical inconsistency in the verdicts, a conviction can only be set aside where the inconsistency in the verdicts demonstrates that no reasonable jury who had applied their minds to the evidence could have arrived at the two different verdicts. In such a case, the Court of Criminal Appeal sets aside the conviction because it is unsafe or unsatisfactory.


	
	Although the three incidents in these counts involved similar behaviour on the part of the Appellant they were similar incidents at different locations and at different times. Count 5 occurred when TF slept in the bottom bunk and E slept in the top bunk. Count 6 occurred in the playroom at Quakers Hill and did not involve E. Count 7 took place in the hallway where the Appellant had placed her.
	
	
	I have read the interviews and the cross-examination. It was clearly open to the jury to convict on any one or more of the counts. There was no particular reason why the jury should necessarily be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all or any of the counts. None was connected to the others except that the Appellant performed a similar act on her stomach. Certainly TF was less certain about the events that comprised count 7 in her interview. She was firm in her evidence in cross-examination regarding the events comprising counts 5 and 6, and she was definite that neither her mother nor her grandmother told her to tell the interviewer about these matters. The jury had the advantage of seeing the interviews and observing TF when she was cross-examined. The jury also had evidence from Dr Marks who provided a medical explanation for the defecation and for the fact that even a man of the Appellant’s size and weight would not necessarily leave external bruising on the child’s stomach.
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann said that the issue was not one of credibility but of whether the evidence was sufficient to establish the events beyond reasonable doubt. But credibility and reliability are both significant as the jury was told by the Trial Judge. If the jury were satisfied TF was both credible and reliable her account of what happened on those two occasions was capable of proving the matters beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The delay by TF in reporting these incidents was a matter for comment by defence counsel in his final address. He pointed out to the jury that the events that make up count 5 were not raised by TF until her fourth interview, and the events making counts 6 and 7 were only raised in her second interview. They were matters that might have affected the credit of TF. Nevertheless, they were not determinative matters at least for counts 5 and 6. A late complaint, even for an adult, is only one matter to be taken into account.
	
	
	There is no legal or technical inconsistency by reason of convictions on counts 5 and 6 on the one hand and an acquittal on count 7 on the other hand. That acquittal does not make the verdicts on counts 5 and 6 unreasonable. It is enough to note the uncertainty in TF’s evidence about the events of what was supposed to be the last occasion on which the Appellant stood on her stomach to understand why the jury may not have been persuaded beyond reasonable doubt on that count.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Ground 4:   The verdict in respect of count 10 was unreasonable


	
	This count concerned an allegation by MC in her interview of 12 October 2011 that the Appellant put her on a change table where he took off her nappy and smacked her “bum” (as she said). He did this because she broke her brother’s toy car.
	
	
	The complainant’s mother gave evidence that the day after MC returned from her access visit with the Appellant on 7 October 2011 she was covered in bruises which were half way down her back, all over her bottom, on her hips and on her belly. The complainant’s mother and the police took photos of the bruising on 8 October 2011.
	
	
	In cross-examination MC agreed that during the access visit she had fallen down after climbing onto some chest of drawers and got a big scrape to her back as a result of the fall. She agreed that some of the bruises her mother photographed had come from that.
	
	
	The paediatrician who examined her on 13 October 2011 gave evidence of faded bruises to the back and buttocks. Collectively “they were far in excess” of what would normally be expected from usual childhood activity. They could have been caused accidently or non-accidentally or a combination but on balance it was more likely non-accidental. The bruises to the back were consistent with a fall from a chest of drawers.
	
	
	The Appellant gave evidence that he smacked MC once on the bottom whilst she was wearing a nappy and it was not very hard. He denied it caused any bruising. He said she had fallen of the chest of drawers.
	
	
	From this evidence the Appellant submitted it was not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant’s act of smacking MC occasioned any injury constituting actual bodily harm. The Appellant submitted that it would be necessary to establish that a particular bruise was caused by the act of smacking on the bottom. The Appellant submitted that an examination of the whole of the circumstances gave rise to a reasonable doubt as to his guilt in respect of Count 10.
	
	
	The Crown case in respect of this count was that when MC was staying with the Appellant in September/October 2011 he punished her for breaking her brother’s car. He put her on the change table, took off her nappy and repeatedly hit her (Crown opening T 79). MC had spoken of the incident in her first interview of 12 October 2011 where she described the Appellant smacking “my bum” (A 111). In her second interview of 12 June 2012 MC demonstrated the hitting by the Appellant by hitting herself, and when asked where he hit her she said “Everywhere on me” (A197).
	
	
	MC’s mother, AKF, gave evidence that the day after she picked MC up from the airport following the visit to the Appellant, when she was bathing her, she saw that she was covered in bruises half way down her back, all over her bottom, on her hips and on her belly. They were dark and blotchy and there were multiple bruises. She took photos which became Exhibit 6. She asked MC about the bruises and MC said that “My daddy just smacked me” with his hand because she was naughty. AKF said the bruising was not there when AKF handed MC to the Appellant. She took MC to be examined by a doctor at Bendigo (Dr Issa Shaker) and took her to the police station where more photos were taken.
	
	
	In cross-examination MC said:
	



	
	She didn’t remember her brother’s car breaking nor being told by the Appellant that she was naughty for breaking it;
	
	
	She didn’t get smacked after her brother’s car broke;
	
	
	She remembered when she went home her mother took some photos of some bruises on her;
	
	
	She did not remember falling off drawers at her father’s house nor at her mother’s house and she did not remember getting bruises from jumping off drawers at her mother’s house;
	
	
	Sometimes she would climb out of the cot and down some drawers at her father’s house;
	
	
	She got a big scrape on her back from falling down after climbing out of the cot and that was where “some of the bruises” came from that were photographed by her mother;
	
	
	She remembered telling the policeman that the last time she stayed with her father he smacked her on the arm;
	
	
	Her father did not make the bruises anywhere on her;
	
	
	She fell off the slide at her father’s house and that caused “one bruise” about the size of 20 cents;.
	
	
	The bruises she had were not made by her mother, her grandmother or her mother’s boyfriend Michael, and none of those persons smacked her.
	



	
	A statement by Dr Issa Shaker was read. Dr Shaker had examined MC on 8 October 2011 and noted bruising on both arms, both hips, both buttocks, abdomen and marked bruises on lower back.
	
	
	Dr Wearne, a paediatrician, examined MC on 13 October 2011. He observed faded bruises on her back and buttocks. He was shown photos taken by AKF and the police on 8 October. His evidence was this:
	


Q. The bruising shown in the photographs reported to have been taken on 8 October 2011 you state could either be accidental or non-accidental in origin, is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. You go on to say or it could be a combination of the two?

A. Yes.

Q. Some accidental, some non-accidental, is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. You go on to say however the extent of the bruising suggests to you that on balance it’s more likely to be of a non-accidental origin or in other words child physical abuse, is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Can you explain, please, how you come to that conclusion, Dr Wearne?

A. If each bruise is taken separately I could not say if this was accidental or non accidental. However in total, from the number of bruises in this child and their extensiveness and their number, I would have to say that knowing children’s bruises from normal childhood activities this was far in excess of what I would normally expect even in a very active, healthy three year old.


	
	In cross-examination he gave this evidence:
	


Q. Photograph 4 is a photo of the child from the back including an image of the child’s buttocks and lower back, is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Sir, if I could ask you to look immediately above the right buttock.

A. Yes.

Q. Sir, do you see any linear bruises in that region?

A. Not well in this view. They’re a series of irregular bruises and I wouldn’t describe that as a linear bruise, no.

Q. Do you see anything of a linear nature above the left buttock?

A. There is - if you take about the midpoint between the buttock crease and the left side of the child’s body there is a bruise with a more or less straight upper edge, I see that.

Q. Are you able to comment whether or not that is consistent with a child impacting with the hard edge of a blunt surface, such as a chest of drawers or part of a chest of drawers?

HER HONOUR: That particular one on--

DENNIS: Yes.

WITNESS: Bruises arises as a result of blunt trauma and it’s conceivable if the child went against a straight object that could be of accidental origin, yes.

DENNIS

Q. In the lower back region above the buttocks there is a number of bruises, correct?

A. Yes, yes.

Q. Are any of those bruises consistent with this scenario, that the child falls from a chest of drawers that are perhaps as tall as 1 or 1.2 metres and lands on a hard object such as a toy?

A. I mean that is possible, yes.

Q. Could I ask you this, in terms of the shapes of all of the bruises that you’ve seen is there anything that - over and above what you have already told us is there anything about the shapes of the bruising that gives any indication how they were inflicted or how they were suffered?

A. No. In this series of bruises in films one to 11 I could find no particular imprint that would allow me to make any comment about the nature of the

blunt force which had been applied.

Q. So for example there is nothing about the bruises themselves that tells you that this must have been produced by a smack from an adult male hand?

A. No. But what I said before is that I find the number and the extent of the bruises make it unlikely, in my opinion, to be totally explained by accidental injury.


	
	The Appellant gave evidence that he smacked MC once with her nappy on because she broke her brother’s car. He denied that he had smacked MC “all over”. He also gave evidence that she had a fall when she climbed out of her cot and slide down the front of a chest of drawers. From that fall he said (T 544):
	


She had a bruise on her from that - on her back.

Q. You noticed something on her back did you?

A. Yes I did.

Q. What did you notice?

A. She had some small scrapes where I’d assume she slipped down, down the front of the drawers or down the drawer.

…

Q. Sir, just before the break, I was asking you about - or you were telling us about [MC’s] fall and you told us something about some marks on her

back?

A. Yes that’s right.

Q. Did you notice anything else?

A. She had a bruise as well from sliding down the drawers I assume, probably.

HER HONOUR: Well perhaps if you could

DENNIS: I don’t press that part.

Q. Just what you saw not what you assume. What did you see?

A. Yeah just a small bruise.


	
	It may be accepted that the evidence given by MC in cross-examination tended to weaken the effect of the material in the two interviews that formed the evidence in chief. If there had been nothing else, it would not be difficult to conclude that the verdict on that count was unreasonable because of the requirement for proof beyond reasonable doubt. However, the evidence went much further. The extensive bruising was observed and photographed very shortly after MC was returned to her mother. She was examined by a doctor that day who made similar observations to those MC’s mother gave evidence about. The paediatrician concluded that all of the bruising could not have come from accidental causes and that conclusion remained even if the jury accepted from his evidence in cross-examination that some of the bruising could have come from a fall. Similarly, even if the Appellant’s evidence was accepted about MC falling from the cot and scraping her back on the chest of drawers, that explanation did not account for much of the bruising that was observed.
	
	
	The jury were entitled to use the tendency evidence in the second category when assessing the Appellant’s evidence that he smacked MC once with her nappy on. The jury were entitled to accept the mother’s evidence, despite her credibility problems highlighted in cross-examination concerning her lies to the police at the time of AF’s death, that MC did not have the bruising when she was handed over to the Appellant. Acceptance of such evidence was made easier by the evidence of MC that neither her mother, her grandmother nor her mother’s boyfriend Michael had smacked her, by the mother’s immediate reporting of the matter and by the absence of any evidence to explain all of the bruising. The jury saw the interviews with MC and observed her cross-examination.
	
	
	I am comfortably satisfied from reading all of the material that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty of count 10.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders.
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	ADAMSON J:   I agree with the orders proposed by Davies J, for the reasons given by his Honour. In respect of grounds 3 and 4, I am satisfied, in all of the circumstances, that the verdicts of guilty in respect of counts 5, 6 and 10 were open to the jury. I am satisfied that the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt the appellant's guilt of these offences.

		26 February 2016",2016-02-25 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768883,R v Gordon [2016] NSWSC 290,"EX TeMPORE Judgment (REVISED)


	
	Mr Donald Gordon is standing trial for the murder of Mr Daniel Cotter, said to have occurred on 6 or 7 November 2013 at a property that has been referred to as Collum Collum Station, some one and a half hours from Grafton where the Court is sitting. The Crown case in short terms is that the deceased was killed by the infliction of blunt force trauma resulting in a transverse fracture of the skull and a very significant traumatic injury to the brain. The evidence that the jury will hear includes the expert forensic pathology evidence of Professor Lyons but who will also speak of the significance of multiple significant injuries to the limbs and torso of the deceased. These include what he will say are “drag marks” on the deceased’s torso.
	
	
	Without, for the purpose of this decision, summarising all of the relevant facts which are in one sense quite complex, it is important to point out that the body of the deceased was found on the morning of 7 November 2013 lying in a ditch beside a dirt access road near a cottage on the property.
	
	
	When he was found his body, especially his face and head, was very bloodied. He was lying face up in the ditch next to a large rock or boulder which was also bloodied. Upon subsequent scientific inspection the boulder was found to also have matted, or embedded, hair in the blood stains. These large blood stains matched the blood of the deceased. Scientific evidence will suggest that the underside of the boulder, that is to say the aspect of the boulder resting on the ground at the time the deceased’s body was discovered, showed traces of DNA consistent with the DNA of the accused.
	
	
	The Crown case that the accused bludgeoned the deceased is entirely circumstantial and it will be for the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of the whole of the circumstances, actually proved by evidence the jury find acceptable. It is sometimes said it will be necessary for the Crown to exclude all reasonable hypotheses arising out of the circumstances proved consistent with the innocence of the accused.
	
	
	It is effectively common ground that the accused and the deceased in company with others had been, to use an ordinary expression, partying for a very long time, drinking copious alcohol, possibly smoking cannabis (there was cannabis found on the body of the deceased when it was discovered) over many hours on the afternoon and evening of 6 November 2013 including at the cottage at Collum Collum Station. The partying consisted of drinking, singing and playing guitar.
	
	
	During the evening there had been friction on a number of occasions between Mr Gordon and Mr Cotter. However the occupant of the cottage who will be called as a witness in the case made a statement to the police indicating that when they left in the accused’s vehicle late that night to drive home, they seemed to be on good terms. They did not get very far. For having passed through the gate to the home paddock and then travelled a little further along the altercation seems to have re‑erupted. From admissions made by the accused on the night to his brother, and to Police when he spoke to them the next day, it seems that the deceased had attempted to get out of the car and that in circumstances, which are somewhat obscure and need not be gone into at the moment, was run over by the accused. From forensic inspections of the underside of the vehicle, when he was run over, he went under the car and may have been dragged along for a short distance. Photographic evidence shows tyre marks diagonally to the line of travel on the road, probably pointing at the ditch.
	
	
	After these events occurred the accused returned to the cottage where he made the admissions about having done something to Mr Cotter and eventually an ambulance was called. I will not go into the detailed facts as to the actions of each other person thereafter. There is a lacuna in the direct evidence as to how Mr Cotter came to be in the ditch, how the blood got on the boulder, and indeed how the boulder got to the place where the police found it on the morning of 7 November 2013.
	
	
	It is that lacuna which will need to be filled if the prosecution is to prove beyond reasonable doubt by an inferential reasoning process on the part of the jury that the accused bludgeoned the deceased to death. The Crown have tendered on this voir dire crime scene photographs – or a selection of them – and they strike me as being very clear. The proximity of the ditch to the road is obvious and the tyre marks are clearly visible. From aerial photographs an overview of the rural location can be garnered.
	
	
	A number of markers were put out by investigators in accordance with the usual practice to mark points of potential significance at the scene. They were marked A to H. The photographs show various aspects of the markers and there are a number of individual photographs which show the relative location of all of them, apart from A which was near a gate and H which is said to mark the place where the boulder rested before it found its way into the ditch. That is at the top of a short embankment, on the other side of the ditch from the road. I am also informed that the evidence at the trial will include photogrammetry which will show the scale and position of these various things and provide the jury with an overview.
	
	
	The Crown has applied for the jury to attend a view. The proposal is that the crime scene will be recreated, as depicted in the photographs. That is to say that each marker will be replaced in its position as depicted in the photographs and there is evidence that this is possible having regard to steps taken by police to preserve the scene including putting steel pegs in the ground under the position of some of the markers.
	
	
	Obviously, over a period of getting on for two and a half years things have changed and, in particular, I am told there was heavy rain last year and the vegetation is lusher than that depicted in the photographs. The learned Crown Prosecutor submits that the understanding of the jury as to the rather confined space where all of the events leading to Mr Cotter’s death took place, and the relativity of each relevant location to the others in spatial terms will be much better understood by the jury than can be inferred from the two dimensional photographs even with the assistance of witnesses who were there when the investigation took place.
	
	
	A significant issue in the case relates to how the deceased came by the significant skull and brain injury which killed him and the Crown puts its case on alternative bases. Its preferred case is that after running him over, the accused dragged or tipped the deceased into the ditch, lifted the rock which apparently weighed about 21 kilograms from the top of the slope and used it to strike him forcibly two or three times, probably three. And it was by that deliberate or voluntary act of the accused that the fatal injuries were inflicted and the blood and hair transferred to the boulder.
	
	
	It will also be put to the jury that if they cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that matter, that: the admitted action of the accused running the deceased over caused all of the injuries including the fatal injuries; they would be satisfied that the accused drove the vehicle at the deceased deliberately; and that from that deliberate act they would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he actually had the intention of inflicting really serious personal injury on the deceased. These matters would be sufficient to constitute the crime of murder.
	
	
	Bearing in mind that the prosecution carries the usual heavy onus, according to the criminal standard of proof, Mr Watts argues that there is a danger that the inspection, as it is put in s 53 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), might be unfairly prejudicial, misleading or confusing to the accused. He does not argue that it might result in an undue waste of time. It would probably take the best part of a day but the trial is set down for four weeks and proportionally it could not be said that there would be a waste of time.
	
	
	The argument is really based upon the changes, the questions about whether or not the crime scene can be reliably recreated and perhaps the inability of the defence to satisfy itself of the relative accuracy of the recreation before the jury see the crime scene. These are all valid arguments.
	
	
	I am satisfied that it is appropriate that the view be held. In making this decision, I have had regard to the provisions of s 53(3) of the Evidence Act. Arrangements will be made for the parties to be present. No demonstration or experiment will be permitted but an inspection will be carried out which I am of the view, as the Crown argue, may assist the jury in resolving the issues of fact that I have outlined and in understanding the other evidence that will be lead at the trial.
	
	
	I think there is some danger of the type that Mr Watts relies upon but, in my view, any unfairness can be obviated by the explanation in evidence of the process taken by the prosecution to recreate the scene of the events before the inspection. Mr Watts will, of course, have the opportunity to cross-examine on those issues. And by providing adequate directions to the jury before they attend the view about the risk of error in recreation, the natural growth of other vegetation which may affect matters and, of course, the usual admonition to keep an entirely open mind until all of the evidence and argument is finalised.
	
	
	Although there have been some alterations to the scene, it seems to me that from what I have been told that they are not material in the sense that the character of the place has changed in a way which might be misleading . As I have said, no experiment or demonstration will be conducted and I am satisfied that arrangements can be made for the logistics of getting the jury there and back.
	
	
	Any questions that the jury wish to ask at the scene will be required to be reduced to writing and will be vetted by me with the assistance of Counsel before being permitted to be asked.
	
	
	I order that an inspection of the scene at Collum Collum Station be carried out during the trial on Tuesday, 8 March 2016 subject to conditions which will be further discussed with Counsel before the view takes place.
	
	
	I direct that Counsel confer with one another to attempt to agree upon the appropriate conditions to be posed in relation to the conduct of the view.

		06 March 2017",2016-02-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768884,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 29) [2016] NSWSC 165,"Judgment EX-TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	Yesterday the Crown called Jessica McNamara to give evidence. Ms McNamara is the daughter of the accused McNamara and has given evidence of observations she made, of both of the accused, on 20 May 2014 when they were in the lounge room of the premises that she shared with her father. That was the same day on which the deceased was killed. Accepting the Crown case, and accepting the evidence which has been given thus far, Ms McNamara's observations took place only a matter of hours after the deceased was shot.
	
	
	Part of the evidence of Ms McNamara was that she observed the accused Rogerson to be sitting in the lounge room of the premises, in the course of which he is alleged to have said that McNamara, ""had really lovely lovely girls"", that ""he had such nice daughters"" and that ""they were really lovely lovely girls, lovely lovely daughters"", (see T1439 L50 and following).
	
	
	Ms McNamara went on to say (commencing at T1440 L24) that when those words were said by Rogerson he was ""touching his right pocket of his trousers"" with his right hand and ""was touching it and it was like a tapping, rubbing motion"".
	
	
	Commencing at T1440 L41 Ms McNamara was asked what part of his body Rogerson was touching. She nominated his right pocket. She said that she was less than a metre away from Rogerson at the time. When asked (at T1441 L4) to describe what she saw Rogerson touching she answered ""it was like a lump"".
	
	
	The transcript then records the following question (at T1441 L8):
	


“Q. Are you able to describe the colour of the pants that he was wearing?”


	
	Mr Thomas objected. With the benefit of the running transcript that we have in this trial I noted (at T1441 L14) that the question was ""Can you describe the colour of the pants he was wearing?"" Mr Thomas then observed that he had ""thought"" that he heard the Crown Prosecutor say ""something else"". I allowed the question as it was transcribed. McNamara said she was unable to recall anything further.
	
	
	As I understand it, and subject of course to whatever further evidence may be given in the trial, the Crown will ultimately put to the jury that Ms McNamara's observations are consistent with Rogerson having a gun in the right pocket of the trousers that he was wearing on that day. The Crown will ask the jury to infer that the lump that Ms McNamara described was a gun. The Crown may call in aid of that submission the fact that there is evidence of gunshot residue being located in the pocket of trousers Rogerson was wearing at that time.
	
	
	Upon the resumption of proceedings this morning, Mr Thomas raised an issue as to that passage of the transcript at T1441 to which I have referred at [5]. He informed me that both he and Rogerson (the latter having the use of a “hearing loop” in Court for the purposes of following the proceedings) had heard the Crown Prosecutor use the word ""gun"" when asking that question.
	
	
	When the matter was raised by Mr Thomas, the Crown denied using the word ""gun"". Ms Shead indicated that she had heard a sound consistent with a ""G"". Unbeknown to me, although the proceedings are not being sound recorded, there is in fact a recording made of the proceedings for the benefit of the court reporters who are undertaking the preparation of the transcript. With the consent of all parties, the recording of what appears at T1441 was made available to counsel for each of the accused, as well as the Crown. I also listened to that part of the recording.
	
	
	As I indicated on the resumption of the proceedings after that opportunity had been given to all of the parties, I heard the Crown make a sound consistent with the letter “G”. I did not hear the word ""gun"". The word that I heard, which appeared to start with a “G”, was not distinct but it sounded to me to be a word of more than one syllable. Having listened to the recording several times, what I heard was consistent with the word ""garment"". That interpretation would seem consistent with the import of the question that was being asked, namely, the Crown seeking a description of the colour of the trousers that Rogerson was wearing at the time.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor indicated that having had the benefit of listening to the recording, the word that he heard sounded like the word ""garment"" although he accepted that it was somewhat indistinct.
	
	
	The Crown went on to explain that he had been on notice that there may be some issue about whether or not Rogerson was wearing long or short pants at the time and that what he was attempting to do, in fairness to Mr Thomas and Rogerson, was to lead the evidence in as neutral a form as possible. I should say, to the extent that it may have been suggested in argument, that I do not perceive any impropriety whatsoever on the part of the Crown.
	
	
	Ms Shead having heard the recording informed me that she had heard the word ""garment"", although she too agreed that it was indistinct.
	
	
	Mr Thomas acknowledged the poor quality of the recording but told me that Rogerson had instructed him that he heard the word ""gun"". Rogerson has not given evidence on this application. Mr Thomas asserted, in direct terms, that he also heard the word ""gun"". I infer that he made that assertion after having had the benefit of hearing the recording. If so, it can only be said that Mr Thomas' account of what he heard is generally at odds with the account of the other parties. It is also at odds with what I heard.
	
	
	Mr Thomas submitted that even if the word ""garment"" had been used, there remained a possibility that some of the members of the jury may have thought that they heard the word ""gun"".
	
	
	In these circumstances, Mr Thomas made an application that the jury be discharged. He submitted that there was a risk that at least some of the members of the jury heard a sound consistent with that made by the letters ""gu"", and that this gave rise to what he submitted was the very real prospect that they heard, or at least thought they heard, the word ""gun"". Mr Thomas pointed out that his objection to the question was immediate, and that this was consistent with he having immediately perceived that the word ""gun"" was used.
	
	
	The Crown opposed the application that the jury be discharged. The Crown submitted that on the evidence before me both Mr Thomas and Rogerson had been conclusively proved to be wrong about what was said. The Crown pointed, in particular, to the context in which the question was being asked and submitted that the suggestion that the word ""gun"" had been used was completely at odds with that context.
	
	
	Ms Shead, took no particular position in relation to the application. However she pointed out that if what was heard was indistinct on the recording, but if a conclusion were reached that the word ""gun"" had not been used, the jury (being closer to the Crown Prosecutor) would have been in a better position to hear what the Crown had actually said. That submission, in my view, has some force.
	
	
	In my view there is no risk of the kind postulated by Mr Thomas. I am satisfied on the evidence which has been placed before me (namely the recording) that whatever word was used by the Crown Prosecutor it was not the word ""gun"". The Crown Prosecutor, in asking the question at T1441 L8, was seeking to obtain a description of clothing. It would seem to me, although one does not have to reach a definitive conclusion about it, that the inherent likelihood is that the word ""garment"" was in fact used. That appears to me to be consistent with the import of the question that was being put.
	
	
	Further, and although the recording is not entirely clear, what can be said is that the word that the Crown used starting with the letter G had more than one syllable. That is completely inconsistent with the use of the word ""gun"". Accepting that to be the case, and for the reasons that Ms Shead pointed out, the members of the jury being closest to the Crown Prosecutor were in a far better position to hear what was said. For the reasons that I have outlined, I am satisfied on the evidence that the word ""gun"" was not used.
	
	
	As a consequence, I am satisfied that the jury did not hear that word. For all of those reasons, there is no danger of unfair prejudice to the accused Rogerson which would warrant the jury being discharged, and the application is refused.
	
	
	The recording of the relevant question at T1441 L8 will be Exhibit 1 on this application and a copy of it will be preserved in the event that it is required to be listened to at some other time. It would seem clear that there will have to be some errata noted in respect of the question which is recorded in the transcript at T1441 L8 because what is recorded at that line does not accurately represent what was said. That, of course, is not in any way a criticism of the court reporters who have done an impeccable job in providing a transcript to the court. The limited errata which are noted each day, and the generally minor nature of those errata, is testament to the reporters’ accuracy.

		15 June 2016",2016-03-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768887,R v Merrick (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 164,"Judgment


	
	On 29 February 2016 the accused, Ross Albert Merrick, was arraigned before me on an indictment charging him with the murder of Marika Ninness. He entered a plea of not guilty.
	
	
	The incident that gave rise to the charge occurred late at night on 7 December 2013 at Greenhills. At the time, the accused and the deceased were involved in a de facto relationship.
	
	
	There does not appear to be any dispute that the accused had some sort of physical contact with the deceased that night, with the result that she fell to the ground, subsequently dying from the injuries she sustained. The issue is whether the accused’s actions amount to murder, or manslaughter.
	
	
	In support of the charge the Crown seeks to lead evidence which has been described as “context evidence” and “relationship evidence”. The accused objects to this evidence being given. The question of its admissibility was determined in the absence of a jury on 29 February and 1 March 2016.
	
	
	On 1 March 2016 I made rulings as to the admissibility of the disputed evidence. These are my reasons for those rulings.
	


The Disputed Evidence


	
	It is necessary to set out in some detail the evidence the Crown seeks to lead, and also to refer to evidence which the accused relies upon to place the disputed evidence into its overall context.
	


The Evidence Sought to be Led by the Crown


	
	Prior to the commencement of the trial the Crown provided the accused’s legal representatives with a list of the witnesses from whom context and relationship evidence would be led, together with the relevant paragraph numbers of each witness’s statement. That list was tendered as Voir Dire Exhibit B. Additionally, authorities setting out relevant principles of law were provided.
	
	
	There is a dispute as to whether the information provided by the Crown to counsel for the accused was adequate to put the accused on notice as to precisely what evidence was to be led and for what precise purpose it was to be led. The Crown maintains it gave adequate advice to the accused’s representatives; the converse position is asserted by Ms Evers, for the accused.
	
	
	It is neither possible nor necessary to resolve that dispute. I am satisfied that the nature and substance of the Crown case was disclosed to the accused many months ago, and that the accused’s counsel has been given adequate time, at least this week, if not earlier, to properly address the evidentiary issues.
	
	
	For the purposes of the determination of the admissibility of the disputed evidence, the Crown tendered a volume of material, collectively marked Voir Dire Exhibit A. The exhibit contains the statements of those witnesses nominated in the list of witnesses previously provided to the accused.
	
	
	The accused’s counsel also tendered a volume of material containing statements of witnesses which, it was said, provided necessary context to the impugned evidence.
	


The Crown Evidence

Jackson Blackie


	
	Jackson Blackie is the teenage son of the deceased. He met the accused after his mother commenced her relationship with the accused in 2013. Jackson Blackie witnessed an incident between the accused and deceased in October 2013 that was indicative of a violent relationship. What he saw and heard is set out at [13] – [15] of his statement of 2 October 2014. On an occasion in October 2013 the witness heard an argument between the accused and the deceased whilst at the home the couple had leased. He was in another room at the time. Soon after, the accused spoke to him and said,
	


“Me and your mum were arguing. I tried to rip her out of the bed. I mustn’t have known my own strength and I must have pulled her out too hard. She is upstairs crying”.


	
	Jackson Blackie also had a conversation with his mother in November 2013 during which the deceased intimated that her relationship with the accused was at an end, and the couple was doing no more than seeing out the lease of the rental property in which they resided, before separating.
	


Felicity Freeman


	
	Ms Freeman knew the deceased as a very close friend for some 17 years prior to 2013. Ms Freeman had employed Ms Ninness for about five years prior to the latter’s death.
	
	
	Ms Freeman met the accused in about April 2013, after he had begun the relationship with the deceased. She later became aware of some disharmony between her friend and the accused, evidenced by the accused “de-friending” the deceased and her circle of friends on the social networking site, Facebook.
	
	
	In August 2013 Ms Freeman assisted the deceased to move into a house she had leased with the accused. At the time, she queried why the deceased was moving in with a man with whom she quarrelled constantly and the deceased replied that she loved the accused. Ms Freeman later had a number of conversations with the deceased in which the deceased spoke of ending her relationship with the accused.
	
	
	On 3 November 2013 the deceased sent a series of text messages to Ms Freeman in which she complained of the accused having “rag dolled” her around a bedroom, causing her head to go through a wall. She said she planned to drive herself to hospital, although she later told her friend that she was not seen at Maitland Hospital, and the accused was going to take her to another hospital and acknowledge having hurt the deceased.
	
	
	Later in November 2013 Ms Freeman received a threatening text message from the accused. She subsequently spoke with the deceased and warned her about the possible consequences of living with a violent individual. She also kept a record of text exchanges with the deceased about her relationship with the accused.
	
	
	On 22 November 2013 the deceased told Ms Freeman by text message that she had broken up with the accused, although she was later equivocal about it, and was still in his company when Ms Freeman hosted her work Christmas party on 7 December 2013.
	
	
	On one occasion the deceased told Ms Freeman that she had warned the accused that, if he hit her, he would kill her.
	
	
	In a statement of 6 November 2014 Ms Freeman referred to an exchange of text messages between herself and the deceased in late October 2013 when the deceased told Ms Freeman that the accused was to see a psychologist in relation to his feelings about the deceased, or “why he’s gone fucking nuts over me”.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to lead the records of the text messages sent by the deceased to Ms Freeman, in which the deceased reflected on her relationship with the accused.
	
	
	The statement also provides some information about cocaine use by the accused, and his familiarity with martial arts.
	


Karleen Jones


	
	Ms Jones met the deceased in 2010 and the two became friends, regularly speaking on the telephone or via social networking sites, and seeing each other frequently. She met the accused in April 2013 and understood him to be the deceased’s new boyfriend.
	
	
	From about June 2013 Ms Jones noticed that the relationship between the accused and deceased had deteriorated, with frequent verbal arguments between them. On one occasion after a football match, when driving home, Ms Jones saw the accused hit the deceased in the back of the head, and also the seat headrest, whilst sitting behind her in the car. Ms Jones heard the accused call her a “stupid fucking bitch”.
	
	
	After that, the deceased frequently spoke to Ms Jones about the accused and the way he spoke to her. She told Ms Jones that the accused had threatened to kill her or her estranged husband, David Blackie, if she returned to Mr Blackie.
	
	
	In late October or early November 2013 Ms Jones noticed that the deceased appeared to be injured. After initially stating that she had hurt herself on an amusement park ride, the deceased complained that the accused had thrown her up against a wall and she believed that she had concussion. She complained of pain in her “tailbone”, a likely reference to the coccyx.
	
	
	On 4 December 2013 Ms Jones had a conversation in which the deceased, through tears, told her that she feared for her life and wanted to leave the accused, but could not as he may hurt her. She said she planned to leave him as soon as their joint lease expired.
	


Adam Debenham


	
	Mr Debenham met the deceased in about 2011 through his partner, Ms Jones. In May or June 2013 he was introduced to the accused by the deceased. He accompanied Ms Jones, the accused and the deceased to the same football match referred to by Ms Jones, and observed the accused to berate the deceased for much of the drive home. He saw the accused strike the back of the headrest of the driver’s seat, in which the deceased was sitting.
	
	
	Mr Debenham witnessed the accused use cocaine on an occasion.

	Ms Beukers had known the deceased since childhood. When the deceased left her husband, she initially moved with her children to live with Ms Beukers, remaining there for about 6 months, prior to moving into a house with the accused later in 2013.
	
	
	On an occasion in May or June 2013 the deceased telephoned Ms Beukers from Port Macquarie, asking her to come and pick her up. The deceased complained that the accused had accused her of flirting with another man, and had then left the venue the couple had been at to go home, leaving her stranded. Ms Beukers did not drive to Port Macquarie as asked, and later received a text message from the deceased, who said she had made her way to the accommodation she was sharing with the accused.
	
	
	After that, Ms Beukers frequently saw the deceased speaking to the accused on the telephone and arguing with him.
	
	
	On 27 October 2013 the deceased sent a text message to Ms Beukers and told her that the accused had thrown her against a wall and “knocked [her] out cold”. She complained of pain in her tailbone. In a subsequent telephone conversation the deceased said that she and the accused had argued about a woman with whom the accused had been involved, and the accused had “snapped” and thrown her against a wall.
	
	
	Ms Beukers referred to the relationship between the accused and deceased as increasingly volatile thereafter. The deceased confided in her that she planned to leave the accused but needed to save money in order to do so.
	
	
	On 7 December 2013 the deceased told Ms Beukers that the accused was “racking up”, an expression she understood to refer to cocaine use. Ms Beukers referred to the accused’s persistent use of this drug, and his heightened levels of aggression when affected by it.
	


Kristy Hardy


	
	Ms Hardy worked with the deceased and had done for about two years prior to the deceased’s death.
	
	
	After commencing her relationship with the accused the deceased confided in Ms Hardy that the accused was very controlling, and was preventing her from seeing Mr Blackie. She also said she had had to change the passcode on her telephone as the accused had been checking her text communications.
	
	
	On the day of the Melbourne Cup race in 2013 the deceased told Ms Hardy that the accused had assaulted her a few days before, having picked her up and thrown her against a wall, putting her head through the wall and knocking her out. She complained of having hurt her tailbone. Ms Hardy saw that the deceased was in pain.
	
	
	On 4 December 2013 Ms Hardy suggested to the deceased that she return to her estranged husband. The deceased responded,
	


“I’m too scared of what Ross would do to me. He told me that if I left he would leave me with nothing and that I would have to pay the rent on my own. He also told me that if I left he would kill me and Dave.”


	
	On the day of her work Christmas party Ms Hardy noticed that the deceased attended the function for only a very short time. She told Ms Hardy that the accused objected to her attendance and there had been an argument about it.
	


Amy Cole


	
	Ms Cole first met the deceased in October 2011 and the two became friends. They saw each other regularly.
	
	
	Although Ms Cole never met the accused, she had some telephone exchanges with him on 3 October 2013, when the accused contacted her to see if she knew where the deceased was. He subsequently sent her some text messages in which he referred to the deceased as a “pathetic houso cunt rag”.
	
	
	In November 2013 the deceased told Ms Cole that she had hurt her tailbone when she fell down some stairs.
	
	
	On 26 November 2013 Ms Cole saw the deceased. The deceased told her friend that she saw no future in her relationship with the accused and intended to return to her husband. She said that she had to see out the lease on the property she and the accused rented before she could move. Ms Cole thought her friend was worried about the accused’s possible reaction to the termination of the relationship.
	


David Blackie


	
	Mr Blackie was married to the deceased and the couple had three children together. They separated in early 2013 and the deceased moved out of the marital home with the children. Subsequently, Mr Blackie found out that the deceased had commenced a relationship with the accused.
	
	
	Mr Blackie maintained contact with the deceased although he found it difficult to do that during those times when the accused was in the local area, during periods of leave from a fly in – fly out job he held in Western Australia. The deceased told Mr Blackie that the accused did not want her to have contact with him.
	
	
	In late October or early November 2013 the deceased told her husband she had a sore tailbone, which she said was because a “random” had pushed her into a wall in a pub.
	
	
	About three weeks or so before her death the deceased told her husband,
	


“If I leave him now he’ll come after me or someone I love. He knows where you live so I can’t move there.”


	
	The deceased said that she would have to remain living in the house she and the accused leased until the lease ended.
	


Charnie Braz


	
	Ms Braz was the sister of the deceased. Although Ms Braz lived interstate she and the deceased maintained close contact and a close relationship.
	
	
	Ms Braz met the accused on two occasions, in July 2013 and October 2013. On the first occasion Ms Braz thought her sister and the accused seemed happy; on the second she thought the relationship was less happy.
	
	
	At 6.48 am on 22 November 2013 the deceased sent her sister a text message saying that she had broken up with the accused. In a subsequent telephone conversation the deceased said that the accused lost his temper quickly, had mood swings, monitored her movements, and spoke to her badly. She said she was not going to put up with his behaviour any more.
	


Greg Hodges


	
	Mr Hodges came to know the deceased through his trade as a mechanic. In November 2013 he saw the deceased at his place of business and observed that she seemed to have difficulty in walking and appeared to be in pain. When he asked the deceased how she came to be injured, she said she had fallen. Mr Hodges did not accept her account and pressed her for detail, but she would say no more. When Mr Hodges saw the deceased a few days later, she still showed signs of being in pain, and he again pressed her as to how she was hurt. The deceased told Mr Hodges that her boyfriend had thrown her against a wall.
	
	
	On 4 December 2013 the deceased took her car to Mr Hodges to have some work done on it. Mr Hodges saw that she had bruising to her neck and arms. The deceased asked him,
	


“Greg, can you do me a favour? […] Can I borrow some money? I need to get out of home and away from my boyfriend before I get killed.”

Constable James Oram


	
	Constable Oram is an electronics evidence specialist with the State Electronic Evidence Branch of the NSW Police. He examined the deceased’s Apple iPhone 5 and SIM card and extracted data from both. A schedule to his statement sets out some of the information extracted from the phone, including text exchanges between the accused and deceased on the day the deceased was fatally injured, and summaries of other text messages between the deceased and others.
	
	
	The messages summarised and also later set out in full includes an account given by the deceased to her friend and employer on 27 October 2013 of an assault upon her by the accused, during which she was rendered unconscious and left with a possibly broken tail bone. A series of messages on the subject followed.
	
	
	On 15 November 2013 text messages were exchanged between the deceased and Ms Freeman and the accused and Ms Freeman about a salary error connected with the deceased’s wages. On 21 November 2013 the deceased sent a message to the same witness saying she had broken up with the accused and intended to return to her husband. A series of text messages were exchanged on the subject.
	
	
	Communications between the accused and deceased are also extracted, and the Crown relies upon a number of them, as set out in the list which is part of Voir Dire Exhibit B.
	
	
	Broadly, these messages show running arguments between the accused and the deceased, often using offensive and derogatory language, on 11 May 2013, 12 May 2013, 18 May 2013, 19 May 2013, 15 November 2013, 16 November 2013, 19 November 2013, 21 November 2013, 22 November 2013, 23 November 2013, 24 November 2013, 25 November 2013, and 28 November 2013. A recurrent theme is the accused’s asserted hatred of the deceased’s husband, and his refusal to countenance any contact between the deceased and her husband. They appear to show a volatile and abusive relationship between the accused and deceased, which the deceased tried repeatedly to end, although later reconciling with the accused.
	


Brett Lovett


	
	Mr Lovett is an ambulance officer. He was called to attend the Greenhills Shopping Centre, arriving at the car park there at 12.06 am on 8 December 2013. He saw the deceased lying unconscious in the arms of a woman who identified herself as a nurse. The deceased had a wound behind her left ear which was bleeding heavily. She was unresponsive to all stimuli.
	
	
	The accused was standing nearby. He seemed upset and agitated (though sober), and volunteered to Mr Lovett,
	


“It was me, we had been drinking and taking coke since 3 o’clock today. We had an argument, she got in my face. My military training kicked in and I elbowed her in the face.”

Matthew Ross


	
	Mr Ross is also an ambulance officer, and was working with Mr Lovett on 7 – 8 December 2013. He also spoke with the accused after arriving at the shopping centre car park. The accused told Mr Ross that he and the deceased had an argument and he had elbowed her to the face. He confessed to having been using cocaine since 2 pm.
	
	
	The deceased was treated at the scene and then taken to the John Hunter Hospital.
	


The Evidence Tendered by the Accused


	
	Counsel for the accused tendered a volume of statements and other material which, in the main, forms the balance of the Crown brief of evidence. The exception appears to be a report from Dr Peter Ellis, a forensic pathologist to be called in evidence by the accused.
	
	
	As I understand it, there is no dispute about the admissibility of this material; it simply supplies information about other aspects of the evidence available to the Crown and, it is suggested, is necessary to place the impugned evidence in the overall context of the case to be mounted against the accused.
	
	
	It is not necessary to summarise all of this evidence, particularly so since the Crown Case Statement forms part of the material before the Court and that document largely performs that function. It is, however, of some use to refer to some aspects of the evidence
	
	
	Included in the tender are statements made by witnesses at the George Tavern at Greenhills, where the accused and deceased had been drinking on the night of 7 December 2013. Witnesses noted the accused to be aggressive and “looking for a fight”, and to subsequently engage in an argument with the deceased. He was observed to slam his glass onto the bar before demanding of the deceased, “Are you fucking coming or not?”
	
	
	The accounts of those in the car park who saw the accused strike the deceased differ in some respects, as is to be expected of observations of a fast moving and disturbing event.
	
	
	Adellemaree Thomson noticed the deceased walking across the car park alone, and then saw the accused approach her. The deceased ignored him, and the accused acted in an aggressive manner, sufficiently so that Ms Thomson kept watching the pair, as she thought something was going to happen. She watched as the male waved his arms in an apparent attempt to get the woman’s attention, before using all his body weight to throw what was described as a “right handed hook punch” which appeared to strike the deceased in the face. She collapsed instantly to the ground.
	
	
	Ms Thomson was called to give evidence at committal, and did so on 14 July 2015. She gave details of where she was when she observed the accused and deceased, and of the blow she saw struck, which she described as “more a straight punch” (T9:27), “like a jab” (T9:30) to the right cheek. The accused used his fist (T14:15).
	
	
	William George saw a man and a woman arguing as they walked up Molly Morgan Drive at Greenhills. He thought the woman was trying to get away from the man; he heard her yelling “go away” and “leave me alone”. He saw a lot of hand gesturing and, when next he looked at the couple, the woman was on the ground.
	
	
	Madelyn Butt did not see the blow, but saw an obviously injured woman on the ground with the accused standing over her. He told Ms Butt, “I’ve elbowed her in the face and now look at her”. Referring to the fact that he had “served”, meaning his military duties in Iraq, the accused later said, “she got in my face and it was just an instant reaction.”
	
	
	The accused also told Adam Kuskunovic that “we had an argument and I hit her with my elbow”. Mr Kuskunovic had seen the accused and the deceased apparently arguing, with arms waving around, before he saw the woman fall to the ground. The accused was standing with his back to the witness at the time.
	
	
	To Judith Kuskunovic the accused said, “I have done this before. I should not have done this. She is a lovely person. She has three children.” He continued,
	


“She was waving her hands around in the air and I just hit her.”


	
	Senior Constable Alan Ballardie was called to attend the Greenhills Shopping Centre car park, arriving there at about 12.45 am on 8 December 2013, after the ambulance that took Ms Ninness to hospital had left.
	
	
	After making some inquiries, Senior Constable Ballardie cautioned the accused, who then told the officer that he got into a fight with the deceased who, he said, had been “yelling and waving her arms.” When she “jumped at” the accused, he claimed to have “elbowed her” in self defence. He said that, although she had not been about to hit him, she “surprised” him, and his military training “took over.”
	
	
	The accused was arrested and taken to Maitland Police Station. He claimed to be too intoxicated to be interviewed. He did, however, provide an account of how Ms Ninness came to be injured, telling the custody manager,
	


“I don’t know how this could’ve happened. We were both at the pub and we had been drinking, both of us. We had an argument and when we left the pub, she was going off. I mean she was in my face and she was waving her hands around my face and arguing, so I swung my arm up and I hit her once. She just fell to the ground and she wasn’t moving. I leant down and there was some blood, and then this Melissa or Malinda (or similar name) came along. She must have my car keys.”


	
	The accused was later charged with assault type offences and released.
	
	
	On arrival at the John Hunter Hospital Ms Ninness was noted to have sustained a massive brain injury. She had a hyperacute right convexity subdural haematoma with significant mass effect and mid-line shift. An urgent trauma craniotomy was performed, with evacuation of the haematoma.
	
	
	Intracranial pressure continued to rise however, and a further contusion developed to the brain. Further surgery was required.
	
	
	Despite this, Ms Ninness did not recover, and her Glasgow Coma Score never rose higher than 4. There was no evidence of neurological recovery.
	
	
	On 21 December 2013 Ms Ninness died from the injuries she sustained on 7 December 2013.
	
	
	The accused was arrested and charged with her murder that same day. After being cautioned, the accused said,
	


“It was all an accident. I bought her an engagement ring. I wanted to marry her.”

The Submissions of the Parties


	
	The Crown contends that the evidence, establishing the nature of the relationship between the accused and the deceased, is admissible as relevant evidence: s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	Broadly, the Crown submits that the impugned evidence is admissible to provide the proper background and context in which the charged offence occurred, and to allow the jury to assess the evidence with knowledge of the relevant facts.
	
	
	The Crown contends that the evidence of the volatile and abusive relationship between the accused and the deceased in the months and days preceding the fatal incident, and of threats made by the accused to the deceased, goes directly to proof of the mental element of the charge, and also to proof of the dangerousness of the act of striking the deceased, as contemplated by the alternative charge of manslaughter.
	
	
	It is submitted that the evidence is additionally relevant to a proper assessment by the jury of the accounts that the accused has given to others of his actions on 7 December 2013. It could rebut the accused’s claim that “it was self-defence”, and that his military training “kicked in” unconsciously.
	
	
	The Crown has referred the Court to Wilson v The Queen [1970] HCA 17; (1970) 123 CLR 334, R v Clark [2001] NSWCCA 494; (2001) 123 A Crim R 506, R v Andrews [2003] NSWCCA 7, and R v Do (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 111.
	
	
	The accused submits that the disputed evidence has no relevance at all to proof of the charge of murder, or its alternative, and fails to meet the test at s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995. Ms Evers argues that, since the accused does not dispute that he came into physical contact with the deceased immediately before she fell to the ground late on the night of 7 December 2013, any evidence (other than very general evidence) that relates to events prior to the couple’s attendance at the Georges Tavern on 7 December 2013 is irrelevant and inadmissible.
	
	
	Ms Evers further submits that, even if it is relevant, the evidence is so unfairly prejudicial that it must be excluded: ss 135, 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	No complaint is raised by reference to the hearsay provisions of that Act.
	
	
	The accused has referred the Court to DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272; (2008) 200 A Crim R 206, Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95; (2006) 171 A Crim R 463, JDK v R; R v JDK [2009] NSWCCA 76; (2009) 194 A Crim R 333, Regina v ATM [2000] NSWCCA 475, and Regina v Frawley [2005] NSWCCA 66; (2005) 152 A Crim R 336.
	


Consideration

Context Evidence


	
	The question of the admissibility of relationship or context evidence is now the subject of a significant body of jurisprudence. The parties have referred the Court to some of the relevant decisions; there are many more.
	
	
	Wilson v The Queen [1970] HCA 17; (1970) 123 CLR 334 involved a domestic murder. In that decision the High Court concluded that the nature of the relationship between the appellant and his wife was relevant to the questions to be decided by the jury. Evidence of enmity could assist the jury in determining whether the account advanced by the appellant as to the circumstances of his wife’s death were credible (at [337] per Barwick CJ). Such evidence, going to the conduct of the accused person, would extend to any act of the accused where proof of the act was relevant to whether the accused did the act charged (at [338] per Barwick CJ). Evidence of that nature was held to be admissible where it tended to explain an event, or assist a jury to assess the credibility of differing explanations for the occurrence of the event.
	
	
	Menzies J (at [344]) said that the jury should not be shut off from evidence which could throw light upon the nature of the relationship between the accused man and his wife. To do so would require the jury to determine the issues in the trial in a vacuum.
	
	
	Evidence of a hostile or violent relationship between the protagonists has generally been held to be admissible, not to show that the accused person was of bad character, or had a violent nature (tendency evidence), but as part of the background of the relationship, and as showing the atmosphere in which the charged event occurred, an atmosphere which could render it less likely that the charged offence occurred in the way the accused person asserted it had: R v Clark [2001] NSWCCA 494 (2001) 123 A Crim R 506; R v Garner (1963) 81 WN (Pt 1) NSW 120.
	
	
	Where the relationship is capable of explaining the accused’s conduct, or of making the accused’s account of that conduct less likely, evidence of it is admissible.
	
	
	That can be demonstrated by looking at evidence of the relationship between the protagonists from the opposite perspective: that is, if the relationship between the accused and the deceased had been an unswervingly loving and devoted one, where the accused was both careful and solicitous of his partner, would evidence of that fact be relevant to the determination of the charge before the Court? Clearly it would be of great relevance, since it would be capable of rebutting the Crown’s case of a deliberate and forceful assault with an intention to do harm.
	
	
	In this case, the Crown must prove not just the actus reus but also the mental element of the offence, that is, an intention to do grievous bodily harm or to kill.
	
	
	Although Ms Evers does not concede it, there is clearly an issue about both the physical and the mental aspects of the charge. The onus will fall on the Crown to prove to the requisite standard both facts in issue: the nature of the blow struck to the deceased by the accused; and the accused’s intention at the time the blow was struck. The Crown relies upon the disputed evidence as relevant to both.
	
	
	In my view, evidence of the nature of the relationship between the accused and deceased in the period leading up to the incident is plainly relevant to both facts in issue.
	
	
	Whilst the accused does not dispute some physical contact between him and the deceased prior to the deceased falling to the ground on 7 December 2013, his concession falls far short to an admission of having murdered Ms Ninness, or even to unlawfully killing her. Ms Evers characterised her client’s acknowledged act as similar to what might be done to wave away an insect annoyingly buzzing about one’s face; such an act does not import any force, or any intent to kill or harm. It is unlikely to be an act that could be regarded as dangerous.
	
	
	The accused’s admissions to others to having struck Ms Ninness are not, as was submitted by his counsel, consistent, and there is little clarity there. To Mr Lovett, the accused said he had elbowed the deceased in the face because she got in his face and his military training kicked in. He said something similar to Mr Ross, stating he “struck her with [his] elbow”. To Ms Butt the accused said he had elbowed the deceased in the face, that being an instant reaction because Ms Ninness was “in his face”. He told Mr Kuskunovic that he hit the deceased with his elbow, and Mrs Kuskunovic that he just hit her. The accused raised the issue of self-defence with Senior Constable Ballardie, saying the deceased jumped at him and he elbowed her, his military training having taken over. There was another account to the custody officer at Maitland Police Station of having swung his arm up and hitting the deceased. There is some footage of the accused apparently demonstrating what he had done. On his arrest on 21 December 2013 the accused said that it had been an accident.
	
	
	It will fall to the jury to assess these comments and determine what, if anything, the admissions prove. To ask the jury to undertake that task in a complete vacuum, knowing nothing about the relationship between the accused and the deceased apart from what was observed of them by others on 7 December 2013 at Greenhills, would in my view be quite wrong, and completely artificial. The jury could be left with an unrealistic and misleading picture of the relationship between the accused and the deceased.
	
	
	It would give the jury no context against which they could assess the credibility of the accused’s various assertions about how the deceased came to be injured. It would also give no context to what appears to be his case at trial, that being that he did no more than wave the deceased away, the gesture being an instinctive movement induced or influenced by his former service in the Armed Forces, one which was without any intention to harm or kill, and without any force.
	
	
	I do not regard it as an answer to that proposition to suggest that the Crown’s case is not a circumstantial one and evidence exposing the nature of the relationship between the accused and deceased is therefore incapable of informing the jury’s assessment of the evidence. It is true that the Crown’s case is not wholly circumstantial: there is evidence of a dispute between the accused and deceased at the tavern that night; and evidence of some sort of continuing altercation between them as the deceased walked up Molly Morgan Drive. There is evidence from one witness, Ms Thomson, that the accused struck the deceased by punching her forcefully, although the capacity of that witness to observe the events of which she gave evidence at committal is challenged by the accused. Indeed, Ms Evers has indicated that a surveyor is to be called in the defence case to give evidence that, it is suggested, will cast significant doubt upon the reliability of Ms Thomson’s evidence.
	
	
	However, an important feature of which there is no direct evidence is the accused’s state of mind; the Crown can only ask the jury to draw an inference about what the accused intended when he came into contact with the deceased at the relevant moment. Necessarily, the jury would be aided in determining what inference can and should be drawn by evidence of the broader relationship between the accused and Ms Ninness, evidence which goes beyond the events of 7 December 2013.
	
	
	The starting point must be to ask, is the evidence is relevant.
	
	
	The evidence is capable of establishing the nature of the relationship between the accused and deceased so that the evidence is not assessed in a context divorced from reality. It can inform the jury’s consideration of the accused’s intention when he had contact with the deceased immediately before she dropped to the ground. It can assist the jury to assess the credibility of the accused’s assertions about what happened to the deceased. It is capable of rebutting the accused’s case. The evidence must, therefore, be relevant. It is admissible pursuant to s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	In HML v R [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 245 ALR 204, an authority referred to in oral submission by Ms Evers, and which considers (in the context of a sexual assault allegation) the admissibility of relationship evidence, the High Court referred to the role of common sense in the application of the law. The statement is apposite,
	


“In Director of Public Prosecutions v Boardman in a passage later cited with approval in this Court, Lord Cross of Chelsea said that there are cases in which to exclude evidence of the kind presently in question would be an affront to common sense. The law must apply a more definite test, but common sense and relevance are closely related. A jury's assessment of some kinds of evidence is likely to be based more upon common sense than upon scientific method” (at [6], per Gleeson CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, citations omitted).


	
	The accused submits that, even if the evidence is relevant, its probative weight is slight, and readily outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to him in admitting the evidence. Reliance is placed on ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	Those provisions are as follows.
	


“135   General discretion to exclude evidence

The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:

(a)  be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or

(b)  be misleading or confusing, or

(c)  cause or result in undue waste of time.

……..

137   Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.”


	
	Section 135 provides for the Court to exercise its discretion to exclude evidence if the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of one or more of the considerations set out in s 135(a) – (c).
	
	
	I have already concluded that the evidence is relevant, that is, it has probative value. The principle facts in issue in this trial are the nature of the contact between the accused and the deceased that caused her to drop to the ground, and the accused’s intention at the time. The disputed evidence is of direct relevance to both facts in issue. It is my conclusion that the probative value of the evidence is very high.
	
	
	The accused argues that the evidence is unfairly prejudicial, and would result in a waste of the time necessarily spent in cross-examination of the particular witnesses.
	
	
	I do not regard the latter as warranting the exclusion of the evidence. Whilst it will be necessary for counsel to explore the evidence with the relevant witnesses, and time will be taken in that exercise, I would not characterise that time as having been wasted. It will be time spent probing considerations of relevance to the facts to be decided by the jury. In those circumstances, I am unable to conclude that the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of the Court’s time being wasted.
	
	
	Nor am I able to conclude that the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. Any evidence which may have the capacity to prove a charge against an accused person is prejudicial, but the prejudice is not necessarily unfair. Ms Evers did not identify the way in which her client would be unfairly prejudiced, and I am content that appropriate directions can be given to the jury as to the basis of the admission of the evidence, and how it may be used, which would address any potential danger of unfairness.
	
	
	I would not exercise the Court’s discretion to exclude the evidence pursuant to s 135.
	
	
	Section 137 requires the Court to exclude the evidence if the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. I have concluded that the evidence has substantial probative value. For the reasons already stated, I do not consider the value of the evidence of the relationship between the accused and deceased to be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	I do not, however, draw that conclusion in relation to all of the evidence advanced as context or relationship evidence.
	
	
	Evidence which goes beyond a capacity to directly illuminate the relationship between the accused and deceased, such as the nature of the relationship between the accused and some of those associated with the deceased, has some relevance, but it is not high. There is, in my view, a danger of potential prejudice to the accused, in circumstances where the value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of prejudice.
	
	
	Accordingly, the following evidence is rejected,
	



	
	Evidence connected with the accused’s supposed act in slashing the tyres of a bicycle owned by Jackson Blackie;
	
	
	Evidence connected with the accused’s abusive comments to the deceased’s employer after an error in the calculation or payment of the deceased’s salary; and
	
	
	Evidence connected with the accused’s supposed hatred of David Blackie, except insofar as the evidence is of a threat made to Mr Blackie coupled with a threat made to the deceased.
	



	
	It will be necessary for counsel to use care when leading evidence from the relevant witnesses, or cross-examining them, so that comment straying into inadmissible evidence is not invited.
	
	
	Because the parties have expressed some reservation in applying these rulings to the volume of text messages sought to be led by the Crown (and supplemented by the accused) I have set out a list of text messages which are admissible consistent with my reasons in an annexure to the judgment.
	


Evidence of Cocaine use by the Accused


	
	The Crown seeks to lead evidence of the accused’s use of cocaine on the day of the incident leading to the death of Ms Ninness, insofar as it may be relevant to the question of the accused’s capacity to form an intention. It was submitted that the evidence could be placed before the jury, in fairness to the accused.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused has specifically disavowed any intention to raise intoxication as relevant to proof of the offence charged, or its alternative.
	
	
	On that basis, the Crown does not press the evidence and, insofar as it is necessary for me to do so, I reject it.
	
	
	Although the evidence may have some relevance to the accused’s aggressive demeanour on 7 December 2013, I do not think it adds in any material way to proof of the Crown case, and there is a danger that a jury may misuse the evidence. The probative value of the evidence is so slender that it is necessarily outweighed by that danger.
	
	
	Should the accused’s concession as to his sobriety and the lack of any relevance to his state of mind prove misplaced, or be withdrawn or diminished in the course of the trial, this aspect of the evidence and its admissibility can be reconsidered.
	


**********

ANNEXURE A


	
	It is noted that, in light of the rulings the Court has made as to the admissibility of evidence of text messages exchanged by the accused and deceased, the accused proposes to lead a further large volume of text messages. The Crown does not object to that course.
	
	
	Unfortunately, the Crown’s text material, Voir Dire Exhibit A, is differently referenced to the defence material, Voir Dire Exhibit 16. It is therefore necessary to reference both exhibits in the following lists.
	
	
	Because the text evidence proposed to be led by the accused is so voluminous, it is simpler to list those messages which are excluded from evidence, than those which are admitted, by reference to the numbering in Voir Dire Exhibit 16.

		01 April 2016",2016-03-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768893,Lee v Cho [2016] NSWDC 36,"Judgment


	
	These are my reasons for granting the defendant’s application pursuant to rr 13.4(1)(b), 14.28(1)(a) and 14.28(1)(b) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) and s 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) for dismissal of these proceedings.
	
	
	The plaintiff, at that time self-represented, commenced proceedings on 13 November 2015 against the defendant, a Uniting Church Minister, for an unspecified number of publications he is said to have made to members of the congregation “in June 2013 or thereabouts”, “around that period of time” and “at a later period, including… 2015”. The plaintiff did not attach the contents of any of these publications, even though two were asserted to be in writing. Contrary to r 14.30 UCPR, only one set of rolled-up imputations for all these publications is pleaded (in paragraph 7 of the statement of claim). There is a reference to an asserted failure to apologise despite “the request made by the plaintiff’s solicitor by letters [sic]” but the plaintiff had no solicitor, and no particulars of these claimed requests are provided.
	
	
	It is hard to imagine a more defective pleading. Not only were most of the publications the subject of the claim for defamation statute-barred, but their contents were a mystery.
	
	
	Prior to the first return date of these proceedings, Mr Tassell, who appears for the defendant, wrote to the plaintiff carefully pointing out all of the pleading and particularisation errors (including the limitation issues), suggesting he obtain legal advice, and adding that this legal advice should include the redrafting of the statement of claim. He also stated that, if no amended pleading was provided on 17 December 2015, he would ask the court to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim summarily.
	
	
	The plaintiff took some of Mr Tassell’s advice, in that consulted a solicitor, and Ms Lin of Counsel appeared on the plaintiff’s behalf on the first return date, 17 December 2015. However, despite Mr Tassell’s careful explanation of the many problems in the statement of claim, no amended pleading was provided either to him or to the court. Instead, an adjournment was sought.
	
	
	Mr Tassell’s unsuccessfully asked the court to hear his application for summary dismissal of the proceedings in accordance with the notice of motion he had served on the plaintiff. His client’s application was, however, not heard by the judge conducting the Defamation List on 17 December 2015. Instead, the following orders were made:
	


“(1) Grant leave to Plaintiff to file Notice of Appearance within 7 days.

(2) Plaintiff is to serve draft ASOC on defendant, together with a NOM to extend time, on or before 11/2/16.

(3) SOFD in Defamation List on 25/2/16 at 9.30am.

(4) Reserve costs of today.”


	
	The making of these orders was a considerable indulgence to the plaintiff, given the grossness of the pleading errors, and they were orders that the plaintiff and his legal advisers failed to comply with at their peril.
	
	
	There was no compliance with any of these orders, as the affidavit of Mr Tassell sworn 24 February 2016 (Exhibit 2) makes clear.
	
	
	On 15 February 2016, there being no Appearance filed (either by the solicitors instructing Ms Lin on 17 December 2015 or anyone else), Mr Tassell sent the following letter to the plaintiff at his home address:
	


“Dear Mr Lee

SAM CHO ATS HYUNG SUP LEE

DISTRICT COURT OF NSW PROCEEDINGS NO. 2015/334575

Our ref RT:JE:150991

We note that we act for the defendant, the Reverend Cho.

These proceedings were listed in the Defamation List in the District Court of New South Wales on 12 [sic] December 2015. On that date a barrister, Ms Lin, appeared for you and advised me and then the Court that you had instructed a solicitor who would be filing an Appearance on your behalf and that you would be making applications to amend your Statement of Claim and for an extension of time to bring the proceedings out of time.

The presiding Judge made the following orders:

1. Grant leave to the plaintiff (that is you) to file an Appearance within seven days.

2. The plaintiff is to serve a draft Amended Statement of Claim on the defendant together with a Notice of Motion to extend time on or before 11 February 2016.

3. The proceedings were stood over for further directions in the Defamation List at 9.30am on 25 February 2016.

4. The costs of the appearance on 17 December 2015 were reserved.

According to the Court’s record no Appearance has been filed. We have not been served with any Appearance.

Further, we have not been served with any draft Amended Statement of Claim or Notice of Motion to extend time.

In the circumstances we advise that we will seek to have your proceedings dismissed with costs when the matter comes before the Court on 25 February 2016. In that regard, we advise that on 25 February we will ask the Court to hear the Notice of Motion that we served on you by our letter of 2 December 2015, a further copy of which is enclosed.”


	
	There can be no doubt that the plaintiff understood this letter, because Mr Tassell had the forethought and consideration to include a translation of this letter into the Korean language (Exhibit 2, Annexure A, page 2).
	
	
	Mr Tassell asked the court to deal today with the Notice of Motion which had not been determined on the previous occasion. He submitted that, in addition to the plaintiff’s total failure to plead any cause of action in accordance with r 14.30 UCPR, the plaintiff’s failure to comply with the orders made on 17 December 2015 was, in the circumstances of the majority of the claim already being statute-barred, a step too far.
	
	
	Ms Lin, who appeared for the plaintiff on both occasions, relied upon the material set out in the affidavit of Daniel Koh, the solicitor for the plaintiff, sworn on 24 February 2016. She asked the court to grant a further adjournment of three weeks so that an amended statement of claim and an application to commence proceedings outside the limitation period can be drafted, and so that better medical evidence of the plaintiff’s mental and physical health problems can be obtained than is currently available.
	
	
	Mr Koh’s affidavit is before the court. It is, however, of limited assistance. Mr Koh deposes to having “only recently commenced to act for the Plaintiff” without indicating the date. However, his activities to assist the plaintiff have not included compliance with the remaining orders. While Ms Lin submitted that the court could take some comfort from the filing of a Notice of Appearance “yesterday” (i.e. 24 February 2016), it is clear from Mr Koh’s affidavit that the extent of his activities on behalf of the plaintiff has consisted of consulting the plaintiff’s treating physician, Dr Bhar, and psychiatrist, Dr Moorthy and, on an unknown date, briefing a barrister other than Ms Lin to draft an application for leave to commence proceedings out of time.
	
	
	Judging by the medical evidence Mr Koh has been able to obtain, that application is unlikely to be successful. Both those medical practitioners provided Mr Koh with short reports on 16 February 2016. Mr Koh acknowledges frankly that neither of these reports addresses the relationship between the plaintiff’s health problems and the reasons which would have prevented him from initiating proceedings earlier.
	
	
	I have no information as to whether Mr Koh has been able to obtain the texts of any of the matters complained of. I understand that counsel has been asked to draft an amended statement of claim but that will not be possible until the texts of the matters complained of have been obtained.
	
	
	The precise period of the adjournment sought is uncertain. Ms Lin seeks the court’s indulgence for a further adjournment of at least three weeks. Mr Koh states in his affidavit (without explaining why) that he hopes to obtain further medical reports in two weeks. However, in paragraph 12 of his affidavit, Mr Koh asks for “further time” to file a notice of motion and evidence in support in relation to the application to extend time pursuant to s 14B Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) without specifying how long that would be. It is unclear whether this is in addition to, or overlapping with, the application for further time to obtain further medical reports, the texts of the matters complained of, and the amended statement of claim.
	
	
	Even if the plaintiff’s amended pleadings and notice of motion were served promptly, the practical reality is that these could not be heard for several months, in circumstances where the defendant still does not know the contents of any of these publications he is asserted to have made.
	
	
	Having noted the relevant factual background and the orders the parties seek, I set out the parties’ submissions and the relevant principles.
	


Strike out applications and curable defects


	
	Ms Lin first submitted, and I agree, that the general rule is that, where a pleading defect can be cured by an amendment, the court should grant leave to amend rather than take the drastic step of striking out the whole proceedings, particularly where the errors in pleading have been committed by a litigant in person: Mann v Carnell (1999) 149 FLR 298.
	
	
	Ms Lin next submitted that, whether the plaintiff is a litigant in person or not, where the pleading defects are considerable, leave to amend could be granted on terms. The orders of 17 December 2015 did not impose any such terms and gave the plaintiff generous and unconstrained leave.
	
	
	Ms Lin also submitted that it would be a futility to strike out the proceedings, in that some of the “2015” publications would still be within time. Considerations of efficiency under ss 57(1)(c) and 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) should be taken into account.
	
	
	Finally, Ms Lin submitted that I could take comfort from the fact that her instructing solicitors were now on the record and that the likelihood was that future orders would be complied with. The plaintiff should not be penalised for one failure to comply.
	
	
	Mr Tassell, relying upon Bi v Mourad [2010] NSWCA 17, Coren v Master Builders Association of New South Wales Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 244, Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd [2015] NSWCA 334 and Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2015] NSWCA 375, first submitted that delay in commencing and prosecuting defamation proceedings falls into a different category from other litigation. Where a plaintiff has been a “reluctant gladiator” (Bi v Mourad at [31]) both in the commencement and prosecution of proceedings, the court should not grant further indulgences. Where the circumstances were extreme, it should not be necessary for an opposing party to be obliged to collect a series of failures to comply before being able to ask the court to strike out proceedings. There had only been one failure to comply in Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1850 and in Coren v Master Builders Association of New South Wales Pty Ltd the plaintiff had simply failed to answer a request for particulars, yet in both cases the court had been prepared to strike out the relevant claim.
	
	
	Mr Tassell also pointed to the plaintiff’s failure to offer any personal explanation for the delay in amendment of the claim (Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University (2009) 239 CLR 175 at [99] – [102]; Vilo v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Sperling J, 17 November 1995)). His solicitor’s affidavit offered no additional information beyond claims that the plaintiff and his wife suffered from depression and ailments of the kind commonly found in persons of advancing years.
	
	
	As the nature of the publications (save for the contents of the rolled-up set of imputations) and dates were unknown, the issue of prejudice was uncertain, but it would appear that at least some of these publications were slanders. In those circumstances, the prejudice caused to the defendant by the plaintiff’s failure, despite Mr Tassell’s prompt and helpful correspondence on this subject, to identify the matters complained of was both significant and ongoing.
	


Conclusions


	
	Defamation actions are easy to bring, and both difficult and expensive to defend. The considerations set out in ss 56-60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) of fundamental importance when determining an application for summary dismissal (Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd at [42] – [43]), as are the reasonableness or otherwise of the explanation (at [40]) and issues of prejudice (at [40]).
	
	
	While the remedy of summary dismissal is an extreme one, I am satisfied, on the facts of this case, that it is the appropriate order to make. Mr Tassell’s careful and prompt correspondence meant that the plaintiff was on notice from the first that if he did not amend his completely hopeless and largely time-barred pleadings, the defendant would bring an application to strike them out. The plaintiff added insult to injury by failing to comply with any of the generous orders made by this court on 17 December 2015. The plaintiff does not even come before the court today with a proposed amended pleading, or the texts of the matters complained of, and it has been necessary for me to determine this application knowing little more than that the plaintiff says he was defamed on an unknown number of occasions by the defendant over the past three years. That is an unacceptable way to conduct litigation, for the court as well as for the opposing party.
	
	
	The plaintiff should not be entitled to any further indulgences from this court, including a further adjournment of a claim which he has already shown reluctance to prosecute. Accordingly the proceedings are dismissed with costs of the proceedings payable by the plaintiff on the ordinary basis.
	


Orders


	
	Proceedings be dismissed pursuant to rr 13.4(1)(b), 14.28(1)(a) and 14.28(1)(b) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) and s 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	Plaintiff pay defendant’s costs of the proceedings

2768894,R v Gordon (No 4) [2016] NSWSC 312,"EX TeMPORE Judgment (REVISED)


	
	Before the jury were discharged this morning, Senior Constable Aliesha Vercoe was giving her evidence in chief. She is a police officer attached to the forensic services group and is a crime scene examiner whose duties include the examination, recording, and interpretation of scenes of alleged crimes and other incidents. Her duties extend to the collection, preservation and, in some cases, forensic examination of physical evidence from such scenes.
	
	
	At the conclusion of yesterday’s proceedings the learned Crown Prosecutor indicated that he proposed to call evidence from Senior Constable Vercoe involving first, a demonstration of the ease with which her personal protective equipment can be donned and discarded, and, secondly, of her usual practice in carrying out the process of examining, recording, collecting and preserving items of interest at a crime scene.
	
	
	Mr Watts objects to evidence in that form. He objects to the proposed demonstration on the grounds of relevance and if I am against him on that, alternatively he applies to have the evidence excluded as unfairly prejudicial. So far as the evidence of her usual practice is concerned, he objects to that on the grounds of relevance and argues that the witness should be restricted to giving evidence of what she now actually recalls of events that she saw, heard or otherwise perceived during her attendance at this particular crime scene.
	
	
	A major issue in the case is whether the accused, Mr Gordon, struck the deceased, Mr Cotter, a number of times with a large rock weighting approximately 21 kilograms found at the crime scene during Senior Constable Vercoe’s inspection. She took samples of blood and conducted other testing at the scene in relation to this boulder and I am informed that other expert evidence led later in the trial will demonstrate that the red fluid on the boulder is blood, and it is the blood of Mr Cotter. Samples taken from parts of the rock not blood stained revealed the trace DNA of Mr Cotter, Mr Gordon and of a third person.
	
	
	I should interpolate that Mr Gordon accepts that he did injure Mr Cotter on the evening of 6 or 7 November 2013 by running him over with his car but he denies bashing him with the rock. DNA testing and the like was carried out in relation to the motor vehicle and I am informed that an expert will say that there was a mixture of DNA on the steering wheel, handbrake and gear shift being a mixture of the DNA of Mr Gordon and Mr Cotter. The Crown will argue the jury should accept that matter was deposited on those things after Mr Gordon handled the body of Mr Cotter after bashing him with the rock.
	
	
	There is an issue whether the traces of DNA of Mr Gordon, in particular on the rock, were deposited there as a result of the phenomenon of secondary transfer. In this regard Mr Watts has made clear that he proposes to cross-examine Senior Constable Vercoe, as he did at the committal proceedings, to expose facts which the jury might think suggest that she could have been the source of secondary transfer of Mr Gordon’s DNA onto the rock.
	
	
	This cross-examination will proceed on a number of fronts, if one has regard to what was put to her at the committal. There is the obvious difficulty for any witness remembering precisely what happened on a given workday. To my mind that is understandable given that to a person in her position the events which the jury might find extraordinary are a matter of routine. It is easy to understand why a person in that type of job would have difficulty recalling what happened on a given job. Moreover it was put that as she cannot recall, she could not be sure that on this job she observed the strict practice that should be followed for the purpose of preserving the evidence in an uncontaminated state. This line of cross-examination no doubt is to lay a foundation for putting to the jury that they should have a doubt about it.
	
	
	Other matters include the fact that she arrived there in the afternoon, the job took several hours and as she went through the process of her work night was falling. She was under some pressure to finish the job and that that pressure might have led to mistakes or departures from preferred practice.
	
	
	Now, I doubt very much whether the Senior Constable will accede to those propositions but we shall see. But whether she does or not, the fact that she is tested in that way will again leave it open to learned counsel to submit to the jury that they cannot be sure about these things which may therefore give rise to a reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of Mr Gordon in what is, at least so far as the question of whether he bashed Mr Cotter with the rock is concerned, an entirely circumstantial case.
	
	
	I have taken this time to define the issue because the fundamental question of admissibility in all court proceedings is the question of relevance. Section 56 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) provides the basic rule that evidence that is relevant in the proceeding is admissible in the proceeding and evidence which is not, is not admissible. Relevance is defined broadly. Evidence is relevant which, “if it were accepted could rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding”. However one puts it, a fact in issue in the proceeding is whether the DNA of Mr Gordon was deposited on the rock because he used to bash Mr Cotter or by misadventure during the course of the forensic examination carried out by the police.
	
	
	As a broad proposition, the evidence which demonstrates that there are protocols which are followed to guard against the obvious, and therefore very foreseeable possibility, of accidental contamination during the course of the investigation is relevant because the existence of those protocols coupled with other evidence is capable at least indirectly of proving or disproving the fact in issue in this case, that is, the question of secondary transfer during the investigation.
	
	
	Obviously if the officer could say, “I remember this case very well and I can tell you that I punctiliously followed every step in the protocol in actual fact on that day” there could be no difficulty with the admission of that evidence. It would be direct evidence based upon her actual perception of events that occurred on the day. However that is not the end of the matter. Courts are familiar with the phenomenon of persons engaged in ongoing tasks which to them by virtue of their repetition are not memorable giving evidence. The problem presented by the argument in this case is not novel.
	
	
	In Connor v Blacktown District Hospital [1971] 1NSWLR 713, Jacobs JA (as his Honour then was) at page 716 said:
	


“In my opinion, to say that evidence of practice is admissible to prove that a certain state of affairs existed on a particular day is to put the matter too broadly. I cannot give evidence of what other people did on a particular day because I have observed them doing it on other days. The particular rule is that I can give evidence of what I did on a particular day even though I have no distinct recollection of the particular day if it was part of my practice to do the act regularly.” [Emphasis added.]

Asprey JA put it somewhat differently at page 721 but largely to the same effect:

“To prove that an act has been done, it is admissible to prove any general course of business or office whether public or private according to which it would ordinarily have been done. That being a probability that the general course would be followed in the particular case.” [Emphasis added.]

Mason JA (as his Honour then was) agreed with the approach of Asprey JA.


	
	There is a slight difference between the formulations of Jacobs JA, on the one hand, and Asprey JA, on the other hand. Jacobs JA seems to suggest that the witness can say “I did this on that day because I always do it”. On the other hand Asprey JA says that one can give evidence of one’s general course of office which itself gives rise to “a probability that the general course would be followed in the particular case”.
	
	
	The difference may be slight but it is important. Evidence of a witness that “I believe I did this because I always do it”, is of its nature inscrutable and, therefore, difficult to test. In my view the proper approach is that of Asprey JA, agreed to by Mason JA, which essentially treats evidence of practice as a species of circumstantial evidence. Evidence of practice lays a foundation for an inference that the practice was followed on a particular day. That is the proper basis of its admissibility. This seems to have been the approach adopted by Priestley JA, in WorkCover Authority of NSW v Billpat Holdings Pty Ltd (1995) 11 NSWCCR 565 where his Honour referred to “circumstantial evidence, including the worker's statement of his habit of using seat belts, which supported an inference that he probably was wearing the seat belt at the relevant time” [Emphasis added.]
	
	
	This basic principle which goes to admissibility, that is to say relevance, necessarily applies equally in civil and criminal cases although so far as criminal cases are concerned one would naturally have to have regard to the provisions of ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). However it seems to me that there is no particular difficulty with allowing the officer to give evidence of her usual practice in the way I have outlined.
	
	
	I would not however permit her to give evidence that because this was her usual practice she believed she did it on the day or she must have done it on the day or some other formulation which is really a conclusionary statement rather than evidence of what she saw, heard or otherwise perceived.
	
	
	The learned Crown has argued that what I propose was the approach approved without question, certainly in the joint judgment, in the High Court in The Queen v Evans (2007) HCA 59; 235 CLR 521. Their Honours in that judgment accepted that the father and the brother of the accused ought to have been permitted to give evidence as to what his usual work practices were as to when he attended work, which would have provided effectively an alibi, if accepted; cf Connor at p 716.
	
	
	Their Honours recognised that such evidence is open to challenge on many different bases, in the end resolving that whether the challenges worked is essentially a jury, and not an admissibility, question.
	
	
	I will permit evidence of usual practice to be given by the witness but not of her belief that she complied with it on the day.
	
	
	Next is the demonstration. This is to consist of a demonstration of the ease with which, as I have said, the usual protective clothing worn by crime scene examiners can be donned and later discarded. The ease with which something can be done is itself a relevant consideration when the jury are pondering the question whether it was in fact done on a given day. It is also circumstantial evidence.
	
	
	As the decision in Evans amply demonstrates, and all the Justices agreed with Heydon J about this, evidence by way of demonstration is a very familiar part of the process of eliciting evidence in courts of law in civil and criminal matters. In personal injury cases witnesses suffering back injuries are frequently asked to demonstrate how far they can bend forward. In criminal cases distances are often described in evidence by reference to the unspecified distance between the witness box and the bar table, or the back of the courtroom. As the judgment of Heydon J amply demonstrates, all of these matters are in fact matters of demonstration. Evans also stands for the proposition that s 53 of the Evidence Act and accordingly s 192 relate only to out of court demonstrations. They are not intended to cover the type of simple every day demonstrations that I have referred to.
	
	
	At [204] Heydon J pointed out by reference to the New Zealand case of The Queen v Barker [1989] NZ8C751; 3NZLR635 at 638, that:
	


“Demonstrations are frequently given in the witness box both by ordinary witnesses and by professional witnesses such as medical or pathological experts. It is common for an ordinary witness by physical actions to support oral evidence of an observed action.”


	
	I am satisfied that what is proposed from the officer falls into that category. It is not proposed I hasten to add that the officer having donned her protective outfit will sit in the witness box and give the rest of her evidence resplendent in it. I make this observation because Mr Watts has legitimately referred to the dangers of the “white-coat effect”: namely, that the evidence may be imbued with an unjustified air of authority imparting a degree of persuasiveness in the minds of the juror to which it may not be intrinsically entitled. On this basis he argues that I should exclude evidence of the demonstration because it may be unfairly prejudicial. That is to say, that the jury might use it in reasoning to their conclusions in the manner I have suggested as clothing the witness’s evidence with uncalled for, with an unjustified air of authority.
	
	
	Whilst this danger should always be guarded against there are, I think, answers to it. The demonstration is short, it will not be persisted in beyond the legitimate forensic purpose of demonstrating the ease with which the outfit may be donned and discarded. Accordingly, there will be little opportunity for the “white-coat effect” to work its insidious magic. Moreover, as in the case of all witnesses who give technical or expert evidence, the jury will be given directions designed to ensure that they treat the evidence in the same way as all other evidence in the case; that is to day to the extent to which it is contested it is to be evaluated and adjudged by them, according to their common sense; and it is not to be given any special authority just because it is technical or expert evidence.
	
	
	Whether such a direction is called for might depend in this particular case upon the course of the evidence next week, but that is something no doubt counsel and I will be alert to.
	
	
	For these reasons under s 192A Evidence Act 1995 and subject to the conditions I have expressed, I rule that the evidence of her usual practice and a demonstration by Senior Constable Vercoe are admissible.

2768895,Alawadi v Widad Kamel Farhan trading as The Australian Arabic Panorama Newspaper (No. 2) [2016] NSWDC 37,"Judgment

Background


	
	This is an application by the defendant for summary dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim for defamation pursuant to s 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and r 12.7 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”). It was first listed before me for argument on 19 November 2015, and should be read in conjunction with my findings of 30 November 2015 in Alawadi v Widad Kamel Farhan trading as The Australian Arabic Panorama Newspaper [2015] NSWDC 279 (“Alawadi v Widad Kamel Farhan ”).
	
	
	The orders I made in that judgment were of two different kinds. The first group of orders consisted of the dismissal of three of the eight matters complained of. These were the first and second matter complained of, as they were commenced outside the limitation period and no application had been brought to extend the limitation period, and the third matter complained of, commenced one day prior to the expiry of the limitation period and hopelessly particularised.
	
	
	This judgment deals with the second group of orders I made, in relation to the remaining publications, namely the fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth matters complained of (the seventh matter complained of has since been abandoned) and the plaintiff’s response to the second group of orders, which gave the plaintiff a further opportunity to particularise the claims for identification and extrinsic facts.
	
	
	The reasons for my permitting the plaintiff this additional opportunity should briefly be stated. When this application first came before me, counsel for the plaintiff relied upon two affidavits of his instructing solicitors (Ms Audisho and Mr Putrus) frankly acknowledging errors and oversights in the conduct of the matter, and blaming themselves for delays. Additionally, Mr Walton of Counsel (who had been briefed to settle the statement of claim), made acknowledgements as to his own inexperience in defamation proceedings, including that this was the first defamation action in which he had been briefed. For these and other reasons, I took the view that the drastic step of striking out the whole of the proceedings without permitting the plaintiff to put his house in order would be premature. Instead of striking out the claims, I made orders for the provision of proper particulars of extrinsic facts and identification for the remaining causes of action.
	
	
	The plaintiff has now complied with the orders I made. Exhibits 1, 1A and 2 set out the facts and matters relied upon by the plaintiff in relation to each of the four remaining publications. The question is whether, with these added particulars, the remaining causes of action should be struck out on one or more of the bases identified by Ms Amato in her very able written and oral submissions.
	
	
	Ms Amato, for the defendant, renewed her application for the summary dismissal of the remaining four on the following bases:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s continued failure to provide any explanation for his delay in commencing and prosecuting these proceedings, beyond relying upon the admissions of Mr Putrus and Ms Audisho: Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2015] NSWCA 375.
	
	
	The inadequacy of the particulars of extrinsic facts and identification: Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 335 at [17]-[19]. This claim relies upon the specific concessions made by Mr Rollinson in relation to the fifth matter complained of, but is put in relation to all the claims.
	
	
	The expiry of the limitation period for all but one of the remaining matters complained of (i.e. the eighth matter complained of in the statement of claim).
	
	
	Ostensible (rather than actual) prejudice.
	
	
	The principles of proportionality of costs identified by Macfarlan JA in Ghosh v NineMSN Pty Ltd [2015] NSWCA 334 at [44].
	


The extrinsic facts relied upon by the plaintiff


	
	The extrinsic facts relied upon by the plaintiff may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff provides services described as “spiritual” (i.e. supernatural) therapy services, based in part on Islamic teachings, from his home in Sydney. He has advertised those services in the Arabic language in radio broadcasts since 2006 and advertised them in the newspaper for which the defendant is an editor, as well as other newspapers, since approximately February 2002. The plaintiff charges for these consultations fees which generally range between $1,000 to $5,000. The plaintiff relies upon:
	



	
	The “Spiritual Services Fact”;
	
	
	The “Islamic Spiritual Services Fact”;
	
	
	The fact that he provides these services in Sydney, at a prestige location, in a home office in a particular format and for a particular price;
	
	
	That these services are unique.
	



	
	The uniqueness of the plaintiff’s services are pleaded as follows in the Statement of Particulars filed on 9 December 2015:
	


“1 (ix) The plaintiff is:

a. the only provider of Islamic Spiritual Services in Sydney.

b. the only, or at least the most prominent, provide of Islamic Spiritual Services who advertises:

i. on radio, in Arabic; or

ii. in Arabic-language newspaper.

(The Uniqueness Facts)”


	
	The plaintiff provides the following particulars of identification of specific people who identified the plaintiff (Statement of Particulars filed on 9 December 2015, paragraph 3):
	


“3 The people, currently known to the plaintiff to have identified the plaintiff as a consequence of reading the 4th matter complained of are the following persons:

(i) Ms Akabar Ghobar of Greystane, Sydney NSW.

(ii) Mr Sabah Al Nashi of Preston, Sydney NSW.

(iii) Mr Lahib Hermiz of Bossley Park, Sydney NSW.”


	
	The four remaining matters complained of are as follows:
	



	
	The fourth matter complained of, namely the publication in Panorama on 10 July 2014 – The publication dated 10 July 2014 headed “Real Stories: The Hidden was greater”, which was translated by a NAATI accredited translator on 8 August 2014, a copy of which translation is Annexure D to the statement of claim.
	
	
	This publication describes the circumstances in which a gentleman identified as “Mr M L” consulted the plaintiff professionally about family problems, describing the treatment afforded to him by the plaintiff in satirical and disparaging terms.
	
	
	The fifth matter complained of, namely the publication dated 2 October 2014 – The publication dated 2 October 2014 headed “Consul General in Sydney Refutes the Allegations recently propagated and prejudicing the Consulate General in Sydney”, which was translated by a NAATI accredited translator on 20 October 2014 and which is Annexure E to the statement of claim.
	
	
	This publication, Mr Rollinson acknowledges, contains no reference whatsoever to magic or to treatment of any kind. It is an article about the Consul General refuting allegations that he personally backed and supported the activities of a person who “in the past weeks” had published photographs of himself with the Consul in support of claims that the Consul General personally backed him and supported his activities, a claim the Consul disputed.
	
	
	The sixth matter complained of dated 6 November 2014 – The publication dated 6 November 2014 headed “The Iraqi Ambassador in Australia seeks the help of a juggler to decode the talismans of the Embassy’s scandals in Canberra”, translated by a NAATI accredited translator on 15 November 2014, which is Annexure F to the statement of claim.
	
	
	This publication relates to the Ambassador for Iraq to Australia, Mr Muayyad Saleh’s involvement in a “scandal” in the Iraqi Embassy in Canberra, and in particular to a “brawl” with the First Secretary, Ms Layla Ahmed Kadhim. Mr Saleh is described as consulting a “magician” to “silence and muzzle the information media”. It is illustrated with a cartoon of a man in a mask, wearing gloves, and dressed in formal attire, including a bow tie and tails
	
	
	The eighth matter complained of dated 21 May 2015 – The publication dated 21 May 2015 headed “The Moaning of the People’s Playground. Any threat I receive increases my determination, insistence… even madness”, translated by a NAATI accredited translator on 25 May 2015, which is Annexure H to the statement of claim.
	
	
	This publication is written by a person identified as Tareq Al-Haris, who thanks persons for letters and messages he/she received from persons “who supported my previous article”, which article specifically stated “To hell with information media represented by a sorcerer and swindler”. There is a six month gap between the sixth and eighth publications and the phrase “To hell with information media represented by a sorcerer and swindler” does not appear in the 6 November 2014 article.
	


Has identification been sufficiently particularised?


	
	I propose to deal out of turn, both with the matters complained of and with Ms Amato’s submissions, by reason of an important concession made by Mr Rollinson in the course of argument, namely that the fifth matter complained of, the publication of 2 October 2014 contains no reference whatsoever to “magic”, “magicians” or any service, unique or otherwise, offered by the plaintiff.
	
	
	On that basis, Ms Amato made an application that the contents of the fifth matter complained of be struck out by reason of failure to comply with the requirements for proper particulars of identification as enunciated by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd.
	
	
	The particulars for the fifth matter complained of are as follows:
	


“The 5th Matter Complained Of

Particulars of Identification: Extrinsic Facts

1 The plaintiff relies on the following extrinsic facts:

(i) The plaintiff provides Services described as spiritual (i.e. supernatural) therapy services (the Spiritual Services Fact).

(ii) Prior to 2 October 2014, the plaintiff had prominently published on a Facebook site multiple photos of himself together with the Iraqi Consul General:

a. On 12 April 2014, three (3) photographs of the Consul General and the Plaintiff together with other people at the Assyrian Sports & Cultural [sic] were published on the Plaintiff's Facebook page.

b. On 14 April 2014, a photograph of the Consul General, a lady and the Plaintiff at the ‘Assyrian Sports & Cultural Club’ was published on the Plaintiff’s Facebook page.

c. On 17 April 2014, two (2) photographs of the Consul General, the Plaintiff and other people at the Assyrian Sports & Cultural Club were published on the Plaintiff’s Facebook page.

d. On 30 August 2014, the Plaintiff was ‘tagged’ (i.e. his name added as a label) on a photo of the Consul General and six (6) other people including Reverend Yousif Al Jazrawi and the Plaintiff during a visit to the Iraqi Consulate.

(iii) The plaintiff had prior to 2 October 2014 said on radio that he had an association with the Iraqi Consul General, on the following occasions (on the following radio stations):

a. In or about late March 2014 on ‘FM 2000’ on Monday between 10.00am and 12.00pm. This segment was replayed on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday between 3.00pm and 4.00pm.

b. In or about mid-April 2014, on ‘FM 2000’ on Monday between 10.00am and 12.00pm. This segment was replayed on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday between 3.00pm and 4.00pm.

c. In August 2014, on ‘FM 2000’ on Monday between 10.00am and 12.00pm. This segment is replayed on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday between 3.00pm and 4.00pm.

d. In or about September 2014, on ‘FM 2000’ on Monday between 10.00am and 12.00pm. This segment is replayed on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday between 3.00pm and 4.00pm.

(iv) Pictures showing the plaintiff together with the Consult [sic] General were published in Arabic language newspapers prior to 2 October 2014, including in in [sic] the El telegraph Newspaper, Al Iraqia and the El Herald (the latter, published on 26 April 2014).

(v) That the defendant had already criticised the plaintiff in the 4th matter complained of (the Campaign Fact).

Particulars of Identification: Additional facts, matters and circumstances

2 The plaintiff was identified by those readers of the 5th Matter Complained of, who were aware of:

(i) The Spiritual Services Fact and one or more of the other extrinsic facts particularised above in 1(ii)-(iv); and

(ii) The Spiritual Services Fact and the extrinsic fact pleaded in 1(v) above (together with the particulars of identification above in connection with the 4th matter complained of, set out at paragraph [2] at page (3) above).

Particulars of Identification: Specific people who identified the Plaintiff

3 The people, currently known to the plaintiff to have identified the plaintiff as a consequence of reading the 5th matter complained of are the following persons:

(i) Ms Akabar Ghobar of Greystane, Sydney NSW.

(ii) Mr Sabah Al Nashi of Preston, Sydney NSW.

(iii) Mr Lahib Hermiz of Bossley Park, Sydney NSW.

(iv) Mr Ghassan Dandachli of Greenacre, Sydney NSW.”


	
	The absence of any reference to magic or to the plaintiff’s profession means that the only basis upon which the plaintiff can say he is identified is that he was shown in photographs with the Consul. Any claim for identification based on the fourth matter complained of and/or the particulars of spiritual services must, as Mr Rollinson acknowledged, fall away entirely.
	
	
	This means that, on the issue of identification, all that the plaintiff can point to is that he was photographed with Mr Dawood and these photographs appeared on Facebook (there is no suggestion that the text accompanying those photographs played any role in identification).
	
	
	The difficulty the plaintiff has, in relying upon the Facebook photographs, is the long time gap between the publications on social media and the matter complained of. Ms Amato submitted that the nature of social media is such that the publication of a photograph even one or two weeks beforehand, let alone six months beforehand (as is the case here), must rob the content of any such identifying fact of all of its immediacy and most of its relevance to subsequent identification.
	
	
	Taking these delays into account, the only “photograph” with any immediacy to the publication of this matter complained of is that on 30 August 2014 (approximately a month before publication of the matter complained of), the plaintiff was “tagged” (i.e. his name was added as a label) on an existing photograph of the plaintiff and six other persons during a visit to the Iraqi Consulate. This means that the only particular upon which the plaintiff is able to rely upon for this publication is that a photograph of the plaintiff in the Consul’s office with a number of other persons was tagged a month beforehand.
	
	
	What would the ordinary sensible reader make of this fact? The Court of Appeal explained the requirements in relation to the ordinary sensible reader in Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd at [17]-[19] as follows:
	


“[17] Secondly, for a plaintiff to succeed he or she is required to prove that not only were there readers of the article who, on the basis of the extrinsic facts of which they had knowledge, believed it to be referring to the plaintiffs, but also that those persons were ""ordinary sensible readers"" who could reasonably have come to that conclusion (Steele at 374).

[18] Whether identification has been established at trial is a question of fact, in the case of a jury trial, for the jury. Whether the evidence is capable of establishing it is a question of law (Knupffer v London Express Newspaper Ltd [1944] AC 116 at 121). Thus it is a question of law for the judge ""to decide whether on the evidence an ordinary sensible man could draw an inference that the article referred to the plaintiff"" (Universal Communication Network v Chinese Media Group (Aust) Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 1; Aust Torts Reports 81-932 at [43] quoting Morgan v Odhams Press Ltd [1971] 1 WLR 1239 at 1245). Unless an affirmative answer can be given to the question of law, the case should not, in the case of a jury trial, be left to the jury (Steele at 364 - 5).

[19] On the assumption that the present plaintiffs' pleading and particulars defined the ambit of the evidence that they would be able to lead at the trial, the analogous question of law of whether the plaintiffs' allegations were, if proved by evidence, capable of proving the identification element of the plaintiffs' cause of action was able to be determined prior to the trial, with a view to dismissal of the proceedings if the answer was in the negative. This was the course taken by the primary judge, utilising the provisions of UCPR Pt 28 allowing for separate determination of questions arising in proceedings. As explained by Hunt J in Love v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 112 at 122 and following, in the defamation context, as in others, this procedure is distinct from the court's jurisdiction to strike out proceedings as manifestly groundless (or indeed to give summary judgment) where the principles stated in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69; 112 CLR 125 (and more recently in Spencer v The Commonwealth [2010] HCA 28; 241 CLR 118) are applicable. That jurisdiction is presently to be found in UCPR Pt 13, concerned with summary disposal, and UCPR r 14.28, concerning the striking out of pleadings.”


	
	In the present case, the mere fact that the plaintiff appears in a photograph with the Consul General Mr Dawood, in his office, a month beforehand, is insufficient, without more, for the ordinary sensible reader to come to the conclusion that the plaintiff was identified or identifiable in the matter complained of.
	
	
	There are other problems with the particulars of identification. Although the names of the persons identifying the plaintiff are provided, the facts and matters which led them to identify the plaintiff are not set out. The plaintiff in his affidavit refers to conversations with these persons, but these conversations cast no light upon how it is that these persons arrived at such a conclusion, or when they did so. If they did so on the basis of the “magic” particulars of identification (i.e. by importing facts which are not able to be relied upon) that identification would not be valid.
	
	
	Applying the test in Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd, the plaintiff has failed to establish that he can be identified in the 2 October 2014 publication. The fifth matter complained of should accordingly be struck out.
	
	
	In the event that I have erred in this finding, I note that I would have applied my findings in relation to the other four grounds relied upon by Ms Amato for the remaining publications.
	
	
	As I am dealing out of turn with the adequacy of particulars of identification, I next propose to consider the remaining three publications, although the same application was not made in relation to each of these by reason of the failure of Mr Rollinson to make a similar concession.
	


The publications of 6 November 2014 and 21 May 2015


	
	Each of these publications refers to a “magician”. However, there is no suggestion that anyone called on the plaintiff’s professional services as a magician or caster of spells.
	
	
	The publication of 6 November 2014 gives a series of very precise description of a meeting on Saturday 1 November 2014 (“last Saturday”) at “one of the grand hotels of Sydney” (not the plaintiff’s place of business) between Mr Saleh and others for the purpose of discussing how to deal with a dispute he was having with the First Secretary of the Consulate, Ms Kadhim. The identity of the “magician” is described as having been kept a secret, but being common knowledge because a number of photographs show him “at several functions and in full detail”.
	
	
	The services of this “magician” were employed to “silence and muzzle the information media” or alternatively to help the Consul to obtain someone to defend him “in case of need or necessity”. What is being talked about here is magic of a very different kind to that practised by the plaintiff in the course of his professional activities.
	
	
	The publication of 25 May 2014 similarly refers to “intruders on the information and media field including the sorcerers, the magicians, the swindlers and the illiterates who do not know the difference between the subject, the object and the predicate” and to the “information media represented by a sorcerer and a swindler” in relation to Mr Saleh’s activities.
	
	
	I am satisfied that each of the matters complained of is not describing the actual performance of spiritual services, but is making remarks of a generalised sarcastic nature by describing attempts to muzzle the media concerning Mr Saleh’s activities by a media “magician”.
	
	
	The particulars of readers who identified the plaintiff, set out at pages 8 and 10 of Exhibit 2, are of no assistance. These merely state that those persons who are identified by name and suburb each read each of the matters complained of and, by some unidentified process, identified the plaintiff. The only other additional information that I can glean from these particulars is that two of the same names appear as the readers who identified the plaintiff in both publication.
	
	
	Finally, I note that the publication of 6 November 2014 contains a cartoon of someone who appears to be a magician wearing formal evening attire, including what appear to be a long coat, cummerbund and “tails” of the kind not uncommonly worn by magicians. The plaintiff does not suggest that he wear such attire when performing his services, and there is no claim by the persons who assert they identified the plaintiff that they did so by reason of this cartoon resembling the plaintiff’s appearance in any way. I also note that he appears to be wearing a mask. There is no suggestion that the plaintiff wore any of this attire in the course of providing his services to his clients.
	
	
	In addition, any claim that the 21 May 2015 matter complained of can rely upon any material set out in the publication of 6 November 2014 (the “Campaign Fact”) is not adequately explained, beyond the commonality of the reference to Mr Saleh. Any claim for identification in the eighth matter complained of by reason of the plaintiff being identifiable in the sixth matter complained of must also fail.
	
	
	Particulars of magic aside, the particulars of identification based on photographs and contact between the plaintiff and Mr Saleh (entitled “Ambassador Public Association Facts”) are particularly weak for each of these publications. The plaintiff can only point to photographs of himself with the Ambassador on the plaintiff’s Facebook page on 9 April and 22 July 2013 and to a radio interview with the Ambassador on 9 April 2013. This is a gap of over one and a half years for the first publication, and over two years for the second publication, which, not only in the circumstances of the nature of social media but generally, is so distant as to be incapable of constituting identification.
	
	
	The test imposed by Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd is a very high one. Only in plain and obvious cases would a court strike out proceedings on the basis that identification has not been established.
	
	
	Nevertheless, as is the case with the fifth matter complained of, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has failed to establish any of the particulars of identification have any connection, whether temporal or otherwise, with the identity of the plaintiff in the matter complained of. Conformably with the principles in Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has failed to establish particulars of identification capable of identifying him in either the sixth or the eighth matter complained of.
	
	
	In the event that I have erred in this regard, I note my findings in relation to these publications on the remaining bases put forward by Ms Amato as is set out below.
	


The fourth matter complained of


	
	As I indicated in my earlier judgment, this publication clearly identifies an unnamed provider of services of the kind provided by the plaintiff. It is replete with references to the provision of services described in the particulars of identification. Identification is adequately pleaded in relation to this claim.
	
	
	This brings me to a consideration of the bases upon which Ms Amato submits that, whether or not adequate particulars of identification have been supplied, the proceedings should be struck out and dismissed.
	


Delay – The “reluctant gladiator”: Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2015] NSWCA 375


	
	Part of my earlier reluctance to dismiss these proceedings initially arose from the circumstances in which an appeal from McCallum J’s judgment in Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2015] NSWSC 893 had been heard and reserved at the time I was hearing this application. That judgment has since been handed down and the Court of Appeal has endorsed her Honour’s careful analysis of the circumstances in which a “reluctant gladiator” (who has been “less than frank both in seeking directions from the court and in his explanation for his subsequent failure to comply with those very directions” may result in dismissal of the whole claim: Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2015] NSWCA 375.
	
	
	In the course of affirming the judgment at first instance, the Court referred to s 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), Bi v Mourad [2010] NSWCA 17 and Ghosh v NineMSN Pty Ltd [2015] NSWCA 334, decisions relied upon by Ms Amato. Nevertheless, the court reiterated that “dismissal of proceedings is a remedy of last resort and that it is an extreme measure” (at [17]; Hans Pet Constructions Pty Ltd v Cassar [2009] NSWCA 230 at [52] per Young JA) because dismissal of proceedings involves a rejection of the plaintiff’s case without the merits being adjudged.
	
	
	Ms Amato has cited a series of factors indicative of the plaintiff either himself or through his legal advisers being “less than frank” in relation to these proceedings. This include the curious reliance upon the essential nature of Arabic documents contained in what the statement of claim refers to as “Schedule @@@”, a series of advertisements which, it now transpires, have little or nothing to do with identification. Secondly, Ms Amato notes that these advertisements, initially argued to be central to the plaintiff’s case, were not in the possession of the plaintiff’s legal representatives when proceedings were commenced, as well as now being wholly disregarded.
	
	
	There are other unexplained issues, such as the claim that the translator required long periods of time to translate material, although the dates on translations of the matters complained of show that these were prepared within days of publication for each matter complained of.
	
	
	Where there is delay of a substantial nature in the commencement of proceedings, as has been the case here (two matters being statute-barred), absolute frankness to the court is essential. The delay in these proceedings is, however, short, and largely explained by the oversights and delays of the plaintiff’s solicitors.
	
	
	I am of the view, however, that the circumstances in which lack of frankness would result in the dismissal of a claim would have to be extreme. Courts have traditionally been reluctant to strike out claims because of misconduct by a party. For example, it was irrelevant, in Raja v Van Hoogstraten [2002] All E R 74, that the defendant’s employees were convicted of murdering the plaintiff in reprisal after he commenced proceedings (the defendant’s conviction for manslaughter was overturned on appeal). Similarly, it was irrelevant, in Powell v Boladz [2003] All E R 131; Powell v UK (2000) 30 EHRR CD 362 that police had clear evidence of destruction of documents and forgery by medical staff to defeat claims for medical negligence and defamation (at [33] - [34]); these were issues for the trial (at [52]).
	
	
	While I note that the courts in Australia took a sterner view of destruction of documents in Palavi v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2012) 84 NSWLR 523 and Palavi v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 274, that does not open the door to a generalised claim that lack of frankness with the court should result in the case being dismissed at a summary level.
	
	
	Accordingly, I would not be prepared to strike out, either individually or collectively, the remaining four claims in these proceedings, on the basis of the principles explained by McCallum J in Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I note that McCallum J in Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation had what her Honour referred to as compelling evidence of lack of frankness with the court. In the present case there is evidence of delay and incompetence, both by the plaintiff and his legal representatives, but the plaintiff has not been cross-examined on his affidavit and I do not propose to make adverse credit findings in those circumstances.
	


The expiry of the limitation period


	
	The nature of defamation proceedings is such that applications for amendment are commonly made after the one-year limitation period has expired. While delay is a factor to take into account in the bringing of such applications, the fact that a limitation period has now expired as a result is not, of itself, a separate basis for the summary dismissal of proceedings. It is merely another indicia of delay.
	


Prejudice


	
	The circumstances in which a complaint of prejudice could be made have been dealt with in a series of decisions under the repealed legislation. The most commonly cited of these is Hoser v Hartcher [1999] NSWSC 1060 where the plaintiff commenced proceedings and thereafter took no steps for more than three years, during which time he was in prison on a charge of perjury. The defendant, a Minister in the government at the time of publication of the matter complained of, was no longer the Minister at the time the proceedings were reactivated; the party of which he was a member was no longer in power, the department had been reorganised and witnesses and documents were unavailable. None of this evidence of actual prejudice was persuasive to the court.
	
	
	It will be seen from this decision that a very high degree of prejudice is required for proceedings to be dismissed. Where the claim is ostensible prejudice (as is the case here) proceedings which are otherwise capable of going forward should be dismissed. It may, however, be a factor of some weight where other and greater factors come into play.
	
	
	This brings me to the final issue, namely the ambit of s 60 and of proportionality.
	


Proportionality


	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff is incapable, on his second attempt of providing particulars of identification sufficient to identify him in three of the four remaining publications. However, it is now common, in Australia, for defamation proceedings to be brought for publications to only one person, as was the case in Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon (2011) 243 CLR 298; there were three District Court trials (one of which was a s 7A jury trial and one a retrial on limited issues) and four appeals, and the costs for the $5,000 damages awarded seem hard to justify. (In addition to being a publication to only one person, the proceedings were commenced outside the limitation period and an application for extension of time had to be brought: Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon (No 2) [2007] NSWDC 7).
	
	
	Apart from these limited publication issues, the challenges to the claims brought by the plaintiff do not fall within the very limited bases upon which proportionality issues should be determined in accordance with the warnings of Macfarlan JA in Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd. In the absence of legislation mirroring s 1 Defamation Act 2013 (UK), there is little that a court can do.
	
	
	There is, however, an additional argument in support of proportionality. I propose to strike out the fifth, sixth and eighth matters complained of on the basis that the plaintiff has failed, despite being given a final opportunity to do so, particulars which are sufficient to enable the plaintiff to be identified. I have given consideration as to whether, in circumstances where six of the plaintiff’s claims have been struck out and one abandoned, the issue of proportionality should be applied to the remaining publication.
	
	
	It is not to the plaintiff’s credit that he brought two statute-barred claims, or that he had to abandon a third claim, or that I have struck out another four claims. That does not, however, render the sole remaining claim an abuse of process. I would not strike out the fourth matter complained of on this basis.
	
	
	A second basis for proportionality issues arises from the fact that the fourth matter complained of is unusually accurate in its facts, in that the accuracy of most if not all of the statements of fact is relied upon as being capable of identifying the plaintiff. If the statements of fact are accurate, how can the publication be actionable?
	
	
	What gives rise to the defamatory stings is the interpretation by the author of those facts, in that he paints a picture of the plaintiff performing a ridiculous and embarrassing witchcraft ritual and then grossly overcharging for it.
	
	
	It may well be that, at trial, defences such as honest opinion have a strong prospect of success, this being a factor relevant to proportionality. However, the mere fact that a plaintiff appears to have a weak case, or is likely to be awarded nominal or even contemptuous damages, does not warrant the striking out of the whole of the proceedings, and I accordingly decline to do so.
	


The future conduct of this litigation


	
	What further orders should be made in these proceedings? Should the plaintiff be granted leave to amend the statement of claim in order to delete the six claims which have been struck out, as well as the claim which has been abandoned, and/or to provide the proper particulars of identification of the sole remaining claim?
	
	
	The plaintiff has to date carefully avoided any application for leave to amend in any way. Taking into account the history of these proceedings, I am not prepared to grant leave of a general kind, or indeed any kind, without hearing from the parties. The plaintiff’s current inadequate pleadings make it impossible for me to do more than to note that one of his eight claims has survived summary dismissal. What is to happen next (including any argument as to the form and capacity of imputations) will be a matter for the parties to make appropriate submissions.
	


Costs


	
	I have not been addressed on the issue of costs.
	
	
	The plaintiff has had seven of his eight claims struck out. In view of the significant success the defendant has had in this litigation, I have made a costs order in the defendant’s favour, with liberty to apply. This will enable the parties to bring such applications for costs as they may consider appropriate.
	


Orders


	
	The plaintiff’s claims for defamation arising from the fifth matter complained of (paragraphs 15 – 16 of the statement of claim), the sixth matter complained of (paragraphs 17 – 18) and eighth matter complained of (paragraphs 23 – 24) are struck out and dismissed.
	
	
	Plaintiff pay defendant’s costs, with liberty to apply in relation to specific costs orders.

2768896,R v Gordon (No 3) [2016] NSWSC 308,"EX TeMPORE Judgment (REVISED)


	
	Under s 53B(b) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) I am empowered to discharge a member of a jury if it appears to me that the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because, inter alia, of any reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the juror or any similar reason. This is a discretionary decision.
	
	
	Earlier today I was informed by the sheriff that a juror had contacted her to pass on certain information previously unknown to him that he had learnt about his relationship with the deceased. The juror has since reported for jury service and has sent to me a note which I have marked Jury Note 2, which sets out the circumstances.
	
	
	It is unnecessary for me to read the note onto the record however I am satisfied that the information obtained by the juror was obtained by him in the circumstances he sets out in his note and those circumstances do not involve any aspect of misconduct on the part of the juror. The simple fact of the matter is that he has learnt that he is a relative, as I say, of the deceased. This came up when a member of his family knowing he had been required for jury duty contacted the juror’s father and passed on the information. It is the juror’s belief that he has not met the deceased during his lifetime.
	
	
	As I remarked during argument about whether the juror should be discharged, it is an important maxim, more than a mere aphorism, that justice should not only be done but must be seen to be done. The latter aspect of justice being seen to be done is always counted as extremely important in our courts of justice as an aspect of the open justice principle. There is no reason to believe that the juror involved has any actual bias or prejudice in the case or would be unable in substance to bring an impartial mind to bear to the issues to be decided in this murder trial. But applying the reasonable bystander test, a reasonable bystander sitting in the back of the court knowing something of the case and knowing these facts would question whether one could truly impartially sit in judgment on a person accused of murdering a blood relative. Applying this test I am of the view that there is what is referred to in law as apprehended bias. Given that one issue in this case is whether the acts or conduct of the accused amount to murder or manslaughter in law, that apprehension of bias could be seen as capable of having a practical impact upon the particular juror’s vote.
	
	
	I stress there was no suggestion of misconduct on his part however the interests of the administration of justice require that the juror be discharged. I should add that counsel are in agreement that in the circumstances the juror concerned should be discharged,
	


(See transcript for procedure adopted dismissing the juror concerned.)


	
	The next question that arises for determination, and upon which I have already heard counsel, is whether I should order that the reduced jury now of 11 members should continue.
	
	
	Under s 22 of The Jury Act 1977, where the circumstances which have occurred here today, and in criminal proceedings, the reduced number does not fall below ten, the Court is empowered to order that the trial continue.
	
	
	Mr Watts of counsel who appears for Mr Gordon has moved for a discharge of the whole jury and the learned Crown Prosecutor agrees that that is the appropriate course in the circumstances of this case. This is a murder trial, the most serious crime known to our criminal calendar other than the crime of treason. If convicted Mr Gordon will doubtless be imprisoned for decades. The seriousness of the matter is a most relevant consideration to the exercise of my discretion. As Mr Watts points out the expectation, “the normal thing”, in our criminal justice system is that persons accused of serious crimes will be tried by a jury of 12 of their peers. That needs to be qualified by the terms of the legislation, of course, which now permit juries of less than 12 members to decide these cases in particular circumstances.
	
	
	However, there is much force in what Mr Watts submits. As the Crown has pointed out we are at a very early stage of the proceedings. The jury were empanelled only yesterday, we have had the opening addresses and the first witness, a crime scene examiner, is still in chief. I am informed that there is another jury panel available on Monday. Although there will be some delay and the matter may extend beyond the Easter break because of it, it seems to me that the interests of justice for the reasons advanced by both counsel, which I accept, requires that the jury be discharged and that the Court start afresh with a new jury panel on Monday.
	
	
	In the meantime there are some interlocutory and evidential rulings that counsel and I can be engaged upon, so that the time will not be entirely wasted.
	
	
	However, even if there was nothing to do between now and Monday the significance of the matters I have referred to; the seriousness of the charge; the importance of the matter to the accused and of course to the community; and the small amount of time wasted strongly suggest that the better course is to discharge the jury. I will make that order after I have explained the position to the remaining jurors.

2768899,AB [Peter Wayne Graham Scott] v R (No 2) [2016] NSWCCA 28,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL and with his Honour's reasons.
	
	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
	


Factual Background

Peter Wayne Graham Scott (the appellant) was convicted of a number of counts in three trials before Judge Huggett DCJ. On 2 May 2014 her Honour sentenced the appellant in relation to the counts in all three trials to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of 14 years with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months to date from 13 March 2014. Her Honour specified indicative sentences for each of the counts for which the appellant was sentenced.


	
	After the three trials, the appellant was found guilty of a total of 14 counts (now 13) of sexual assault and supplying stupefying drugs to five young boys, through his association with them as a teacher at their school, between 1984 and 1986. The counts comprised the following:
	



	
	Three counts of causing to be taken a stupefying drug with the intention of homosexual intercourse (s 38 Crimes Act 1900) which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life.
	
	
	Four counts of homosexual intercourse by a teacher upon a pupil (s 78N Crimes Act 1900) which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years.
	
	
	Two counts (now one) of homosexual intercourse with a male above the age of 10 years but under the age of 18 years (s 78K Crimes Act 1900) which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.
	
	
	Two counts of indecent assault upon a person under 16 years and under authority (s 61E(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900) which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 6 years.
	
	
	Two counts of indecent assault (s 61E(1) Crimes Act 1900) which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 4 years.
	
	
	One count of act of indecency which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 2 years.
	



	
	The indicative sentences imposed by her Honour totalled in excess of 35 years.
	
	
	By proceedings in this Court (AB v R [2015] NSWCCA 315) the appellant appealed against his conviction in respect of four counts relating to offences against GM. His appeal against conviction in three of those counts was dismissed, but he was successful in respect of count 6 on the first indictment, being a conviction for the offence of homosexual intercourse with GM who was then above the age of 10 years but under the age of 18 years, namely 15 years, contrary to s 78K Crimes Act 1900. The indicative sentence imposed for this offence was 3 years.
	


Re-sentence of appellant


	
	Because the appellant was successful in relation to his conviction for this offence, it is necessary for him to be re-sentenced. Accordingly, when judgment was handed down in the primary appeal, the parties were directed to provide written submissions on re-sentence. Those of the appellant were received on 1 February 2016 and those of the Crown on 15 February 2016. This judgment relates to the re-sentence of the appellant.
	
	
	The appellant was born on 13 November 1950 and was aged 63 when sentenced. He had been in a relationship with his de facto wife for 32 years and had one daughter born in 1986. Before these offences, he was a person of good character and her Honour found that his prospects of future offending were low.
	
	
	It is clear from the indicative sentences and from the aggregate sentence actually imposed, that there was a considerable amount of concurrency involved in the sentences. Nevertheless, it is accepted, as was submitted on behalf of the appellant, that the quashing of the conviction for count 6 on the first indictment should result in a genuine and not merely symbolic reduction in the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	However, in re-sentencing it needs to be kept in mind that the counts involving GM (the first indictment) and SS (the second indictment) were found by her Honour not to be isolated incidents of the sexual and drug offences committed by the appellant against those boys, thereby depriving him of leniency. Her Honour found beyond reasonable doubt that the offences committed against those two victims were aggravated due to the substantial harm caused to them as disclosed by their Victim Impact Statements (sentence judgment 20-21).
	
	
	It should be noted that GM was older when the events in count 6 took place than in the earlier counts on indictment one and was also generally older by comparison with the other victims.
	
	
	It should be noted that the appellant was convicted of the offences in each case following a trial and that an unchallenged finding was made by her Honour that there was no evidence of remorse or contrition.
	
	
	By reference of the whole of her Honour’s sentence judgment, it is not possible to discern the weight which her Honour gave to particular offences or individual indicative sentences in arriving at the aggregate sentence and non-parole period she imposed. It can, however, be inferred that each indicative sentence was notionally reduced substantially.
	
	
	Seven of the fourteen indicative sentences were greater than that indicated in respect of count 6 on the first indictment. This demonstrated, as did the description of the offences themselves, that the offence the subject of count 6 was in the mid range of seriousness in the list of the appellant’s offences. In making that observation, I am of course mindful of the fact that because this Court has to re-sentence, it is necessary for the Court to approach the sentencing of the appellant afresh. Since her Honour’s finding of special circumstances has not been challenged, it is also necessary to have regard to that when re-sentencing.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	The sentence imposed by Huggett DCJ on 2 May 2014 is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the appellant is sentenced to imprisonment with an aggregate non-parole period of 7 years commencing 13 March 2014 with a balance of term of a further 6 years.
	



	
	RS HULME AJ: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2768903,R v Merrick (No 3) [2016] NSWSC 181,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	During the course of evidence and immediately prior to a witness, Ms Cole, being called to give evidence-in-chief, counsel for the accused takes objection to a portion of the witness’s statement. It is set out at [6] of the statement of 4 January 2014. The Crown has indicated that most of that paragraph is not sought to be led and Ms Evers, counsel for the accused, had been advised of that.
	
	
	The portion as I understand it that the Crown contends is relevant is a portion in which the witness indicates that the accused sent her a message in which he stated,
	


“I’m going back to sleep anyway. Getting up for the gym at half three. Another woman deserve me more than that pathetic houso cunt rag.”


	
	As I understand it from the context of that communication, the person referred to in that way was the deceased.
	
	
	There is another sentence which is general referring to messages sent suggesting the deceased was likely to cheat on him.
	
	
	This issue has already been fully aired before the Court. There was two days of litigation as to the admissibility of context and relationship evidence and I have already given a full judgment as to the admissibility of that material. As I recall it, some of the text messages already admitted into evidence have the accused referring to the deceased as a “houso cunt from Raymond Terrace”. That may not be the exact wording, but my recollection is that there is a text to that effect. That will be in evidence.
	
	
	I see no distinction between the current evidence and any other relationship evidence and I admit the evidence of the specific message on the same basis that I have previously admitted other relationship evidence. Given that there is a judgment published to the parties, I do not propose to go into the basis of the admissibility for present purposes.
	
	
	As to the last sentence of [6], unless the Crown is proposing to particularise messages that the accused is said to have sent to this particular witness about the faithfulness or otherwise of the deceased, I would not admit that evidence. It amounts to someone’s summary of what appears to be a number of messages and it may not be particularly accurate. The specific messages subject to their content, are likely to be admissible, but I do not regard someone’s summary of them as having the same relevance and probative value.

		01 April 2016",2016-03-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768905,Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Steadman [2016] NSWSC 174,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By summons filed on 9 February 2016, the Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales (the plaintiff) sought an extended supervision order (ESO) under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (the Act) in respect of the defendant for a period of three years. The plaintiff also sought an interim supervision order (ISO) against Robert Steadman (the defendant) pursuant to s 10B of the Act pending the final hearing of this matter and an order pursuant to s 7(4) of the Act appointing two psychiatrists to examine the defendant and report to the Court on the examinations.
	
	
	The orders are opposed by the defendant, for whom Mr Averre appeared.
	


Evidence


	
	The plaintiff, for whom Mr Denman appeared, relied on the following evidence:
	



	
	Affidavit of Valentino Musico sworn 9 February 2016, including VM-1 (marked Exhibit A);
	
	
	Affidavit of Valentino Musico sworn 26 February 2016;
	
	
	Affidavit of Azam Bulbulia affirmed 19 February 2016, including AB-1 (marked Exhibit B);
	
	
	Oral evidence of Cornelius Van Ryn, who gave evidence and was cross-examined.
	


The applicable law

The Act


	
	Section 3 of the Act provides:
	


“Objects of Act

(1)  The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high-risk sex offenders and high-risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.

(2)  Another object of this Act is to encourage high-risk sex offenders and high-risk violent offenders to undertake rehabilitation.”


	
	The legislative purpose of the Act is protective, not punitive. The protective purpose is fundamental: Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340 at [21]; Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Quinn [2007] NSWSC 873 at [10]; Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 (Tillman) at [10].
	
	
	Section 5B provides:
	


“High risk sex offender

(1)  An offender can be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2)  An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3)  The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence.”


	
	In Cornwall v Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 374 the Court of Appeal said at [21]:
	


“The expression “a high degree of probability” indicates something “beyond more probably than not”; so that the existence of the risk, that is the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt...”


	
	Section 5C confers power on this Court to make an ESO in respect of a high risk sex offender. Implicit in s 5C is that the supervision imposed by an ESO is sufficient to counter what would otherwise be an “unacceptable risk”. Supervision can only be regarded as “adequate” if it is effective to reduce the risk such that the offender no longer poses an unacceptable risk.
	
	
	Section 5I(1) provides that an application for a high risk sex offender ESO may be made only in respect of a supervised sex offender. A person who is under supervision (under an ESO) is, relevantly, a supervised sex offender: s 5I(2).
	
	
	Section 7 deals with pre-trial procedures and what is to occur following the preliminary hearing (the present hearing). It relevantly provides:
	


“(4) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must make orders:

(a) appointing:

(i) 2 qualified psychiatrists, or

(ii) 2 registered psychologists, or

(iii) 1 qualified psychiatrist and 1 registered psychologist, or

(iv) 2 qualified psychiatrists and 2 registered psychologists,

to conduct separate psychiatric or psychological examinations (as the case requires) of the offender and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations, and

(b) directing the offender to attend those examinations.

(5) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is not satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must dismiss the application.”


	
	Section 9 provides that the following are to be taken into account in determining whether to make an ESO:
	


“(a)  the safety of the community,

(b)  the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7 (4) [court-appointed experts] to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination,

(c)  the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,

(d)  the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence,

. . .

(e)  any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,

(f)  the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,

. . .

(h)  the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

(h1)  the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,

(i)  any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order) or serious violence offences (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).


	
	Section 10 provides that an ESO can be made for a total of five years. Section 10A provides for an ISO to be made in certain circumstances. The decision whether to make an ISO is to be made by reference to the same considerations as apply to an ESO. Section 10A provides:
	


“Interim supervision order—high risk sex offender

The Supreme Court may make an order for the interim supervision of an offender if, in proceedings for an extended supervision order, it appears to the Court:

(a) that the offender’s current custody or supervision will expire before the proceedings are determined, and

(b) that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order.”


	
	Section 11 provides for the conditions that may be imposed on an ESO. Mr Denman confirmed (in response to the defendant’s request) that the plaintiff did not seek, in respect of the ISO, conditions other than those contained in the first ESO, save for the following additional condition as follows:
	


“The defendant’s Departmental Supervising Officer (DSO) is permitted to tell the family of the defendant’s spouse he wed in October 2015 about his criminal history.”


	
	These proceedings are to be conducted as civil proceedings: s 21.
	


Background facts


	
	If the threshold test in s 5B is met, the list of matters to be considered is contained in s 9. Before addressing these matters, I propose to set out a narrative derived from the evidence adduced by the plaintiff.
	
	
	Although I use the term “evidence”, I note that the evidence tendered by the plaintiff has not been tested, except to a very limited extent by the cross-examination of Mr Van Ryn. The defendant has not given evidence himself, or adduced any other evidence. All that is required for the purposes of deciding whether to make an ISO is that it must “appear” to the Court that the ESO will expire before the proceedings are determined (which is common ground) and “that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of” an ESO: s 10A.
	
	
	Accordingly, the following narrative ought be read with the qualification that it sets out the matters alleged in the supporting documentation. The facts in the narrative ought not be regarded as findings of fact, except on the limited basis required for the purposes of deciding, in accordance with s 10A, whether to make an ISO.
	
	
	As the matters the subject of the narrative touch on personal details of those associated with the defendant in a personal capacity, I have decided not to use the real names of his partners, their children or associates in these reasons.
	


Birth and offending while a minor


	
	The defendant was born in 1944. His criminal history began in 1953 with offences of stealing. The first conviction of present relevance was a conviction in 1958 (when he was 14) for indecent assault on a female aged six years. In 1960 he was committed to a psychiatric institution for treatment following a charge of indecent assault on an 11-year old female (when he was 16) which was replaced with a charge of common assault. Both of these offences constituted “serious sex offences” as defined by the Act.
	


First marriages and relationship history


	
	The defendant was married for the first time in the 1960’s and had three children. After about five years this marriage ended in divorce. He remarried in about 1980. His second wife died in 1991. At some time prior to March 1993 the defendant formed a de facto relationship with a woman, who had a daughter, AV1.
	
	
	In electronically recorded interview AV1 said that in March 1993 she woke up one night in bed to discover that the defendant had his hands down the front of her underpants and was touching her on her vagina. According to AV1, he said: “If you let me touch you more I’ll give you a horse for your birthday.” She did not tell her mother what had happened until about June 1993. At that time her mother was planning to marry the defendant. Subsequently, and notwithstanding the charge, AV1’s mother resumed her relationship with the defendant and they became engaged to be married again. The defendant was acquitted of the charge with respect to his alleged conduct in respect of AV1.
	
	
	During the school holidays in September 1993, V3, one of AV1’s friends, was staying overnight at AV1’s place. One evening the children had been watching television in the bedroom the defendant shared with AV1’s mother. AV1 had fallen asleep in the bed, woken up and moved to a bunk bed in another room, leaving V3, AV1’s mother and the defendant in the same bed. V3 woke up to find the defendant’s hand down her underpants and his middle finger in her vagina. V3 started screaming and hitting him, after which she went to the bunk bed where her friend, AV1, was sleeping.
	
	
	As a result of these events, the defendant was charged with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. This charge proceeded by way of indictment in the District Court in 1994. The defendant was convicted. He was sentenced by Armitage DCJ to a minimum term of two years with an additional term of eight months. His appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed.
	
	
	The defendant was released to parole in on 17 November 1996 on an 8-month parole order. Although he was generally compliant with reporting (according to a pre-sentence report prepared in 2011), he refused to engage in any “interventions” in the community and maintained his innocence.
	
	
	Some time after his release from gaol the defendant formed a de facto relationship with a woman who, in 1998, became his third wife. The defendant’s third wife had two daughters: one, who was herself the mother of five daughters (including V4, V5 and V6)); and a second, TC, who was disabled. The defendant’s third wife was not aware of the defendant’s previous offending.
	


The index offences


	
	At Easter 2007, the defendant and his third wife went to visit her grandchildren on the North Coast of New South Wales. They took TC with them. They stayed in a caravan at the rear of the house where the defendant’s third wife’s daughter lived with her family (including V4, V5 and V6).
	
	
	The transcripts of recorded interviews with V4, V5 and V6 were tendered. In addition to matters that concerned the index offences, the transcripts included the girls’ versions of other (uncharged) sexual acts alleged to have been perpetrated against them by the defendant as well as reference to alleged offending against other children during the same period. I allowed the transcripts of uncharged acts to be admitted into evidence, over the defendant’s objection. The conduct described by the victims and alleged victims (each of whom was a young girl to whom the defendant had access through family relationships) was largely opportunistic in the context of a family situation. For example, the defendant drove one of the victims to the tip to fossick for toys and asked her not to wear underpants. He assaulted her while they were there and took photographs of her vagina and asked her to take a photograph of his erect penis.
	
	
	According to V5’s statement, the defendant’s conduct affected several girls, as demonstrated by the following passage in the transcript:
	


“A   Um, that I know all the girls have been touched by him.

Q398   All your sisters?

A   Yes. But mum only knew there was only three of us but there was actually five, seven seats in the car. She couldn’t put all of us girls. And I know they’ve all been touched. And [V5’s youngest sister] real close to him ‘cause all [V5’s youngest sister] been saying, When I grow up I, ‘cause she’s in love with pop.

Q399   Yeah.

A   She says, When I grow up I want to sex poppy and marry him.

Q400   And how old’s [V5’s youngest sister]?

A   Only 5.”


	
	V5 also said in the interview:
	


“A 424   Um, um, well, well we’ve all been told not to tell about they’ve been touched. And he keeps on saying um, I won’t tell any, I won’t tell anyone things that you tell me which I haven’t told him anything.”


	
	The defendant was arrested on 11 July 2007 and remained in custody pending his trial.
	
	
	On 22 October 2008 the Director of Public Prosecutions presented an indictment in which the defendant was charged with the following counts:
	


“1.   Between 28 February, 2007 and 2 May 2007 at P2 in the State of New South Wales did assault V4 and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on V4 a child then under the age of 10 years, namely 9 years.

2.   Between 28 February, 2007 and 2 May 2007 at P2 in the State of New South Wales did assault V5 and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on V5 a child then under the age of 16 years, namely 10 years.

3.   Between 28 February, 2007 and 2 May 2007 at P2 in the State of New South Wales did assault V6 and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on V6 a child then under the age of 10 years, namely 9 years.”


	
	The defendant pleaded guilty to the three counts. The following extract is taken from the statement of facts:
	


“7. The incidents detailed below came to light as a result of the following sequence of events:

a.   During the holiday period V5 was looking at pictures on the offender’s computer and saw pictures of her younger sister V4 engaging in inappropriate activity with the offender.

b.   V5 then approached her sister V4 telling her what she had seen and V4 them [sic] complained to her of what the offender had been doing to her.

c.   A few days after the offender had left the children’s place, V5 and V4 then told their mother what had happened.

d.   V3 – 5M at first confronted the offender and her mother about the children’s allegations and the offender said that the children had made it up.

e.   DOCS were contacted by V3 – 5M and statements were then obtained by the Police.

Count One – S. 61M(2) Indecent assault of a person aged under 10

8. This alleged offence involves the complainant, V4 when she was aged 9. The offence involved the offender touching, or playing with, the vaginal area of the complainant with his hand or hands whilst on a trip to the P2 dump with the offender.

Count Two – s. 61M(1) – indecent assault of a person aged under 16 years

9. The complainant, V5 was ten years of age. The offender touched V5 on her vagina when she was sitting on a chair facing the offender’s computer whilst her parents were not present.

Count Three – S. 61M(2) Indecent assault of a person aged under 10

10. The offender had V6 then aged 9 years accompany him in his van to the P2 tip at which location he pushed her down so that she was lying on the seat. The offender then fondled her genital area.


	
	A further matter (possession of child pornography contrary to s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act) was included on the Form 1 in the following terms:
	


“Expert Police examined the seized hard drive and a number of images were retrieved, including a picture of the offender’s penis with a child’s hand on it.”


	
	An offender intake data form in respect of the defendant (which was filled in when he was admitted to Wellington Gaol in February 2009) recorded much of the relationship history set out above. On 23 February 2009 he underwent a Static-99 assessment (an instrument designed to help predict sexual and violent recidivism in sexual offenders) and scored 6, which placed him in the high risk category.
	
	
	In April 2009 the defendant was assessed by Professor Greenberg, a forensic psychiatrist, who prepared a report for the sentence hearing on 6 April 2009. Professor Greenberg opined that the defendant probably suffered from paedophilic disorder and that he would benefit from Custody-Based Intensive Treatment (CUBIT).
	
	
	On 17 April 2009 Judge Williams imposed a sentence of five years and five months imprisonment with a total non-parole period of four years and two months, to date from 11 July 2007, being the date on which he was taken into custody.
	
	
	In the remarks on sentence, Williams DCJ said, of the defendant’s third wife:
	


“23. [The defendant’s] wife during a telephone interview stated, despite his plea of guilty, that he was not guilty of any offences against her grandchildren and if there was any inappropriate behaviour at all, it was the fault of her daughter and grandchildren. She stated that the children were overtly sexual in nature and often masturbated for attention. This attitude to the offending by [the defendant’s] wife is of serious [sic] to the service as his primary support within the community is from her and he has limited contact with other family members. Discussions with his family indicated [the defendant] has been less than forthcoming about the agreed facts in this matter.”


	
	The sentencing judge also said:
	


“32. What is of particular concern in the present case is firstly [the defendant’s] previous history of sex offending and secondly that on this occasion [the defendant] was apparently engaged in taking inappropriate photographs of the victims and keeping them on his computer, part of presumably some sort of plan to interfere with them. Apart from the question of general deterrence, individual deterrence would appear to be a significant and necessary component of any sentence imposed.

…

34. It is of concern that like so many such offenders, [the defendant] has been reluctant to accept responsibility as has indeed his wife, for his actions and to recognise and accept the need for intervention if he is not to offend again.”


	
	The defendant’s wife continued to support the defendant throughout most of his sentence. However, in about early 2011, TC told her mother that the defendant had been sexually abusing her for years, including before they were married. This led to their divorce on 10 May 2011. A probation and parole pre-release report dated 29 June 2011 said:
	


“His former wife advised this revelation was the turning point for her in her attitudes to [the defendant], making her see a pattern in his sexual offending and making her accept his guilt in the current offences against her grandchildren. Enquiries indicate the [defendant’s third wife’s] change of mindset has enabled her to reconcile with her son and daughter-in-law, who are the parents of his victim.”


	
	The report concluded:
	


“[The defendant] has a history of sexual offending against children. He is currently in custody for an offence against his former step daughter. Since being in custody his marriage has dissolved following further allegations of sexual offending against another female relative, the outcome of which is uncertain. He has no identifiable pro social supports in the community at this time and has no suitable post release accommodation. In addition to this [the defendant] maintains his innocence in relation to his sexual offending and is resistant to engaging in appropriate intervention for his offence, most particularly the CUBIT program. Without appropriate post release accommodation and his failure to acknowledge or address his offending, [the defendant] poses a risk to the community if released at this time. Therefore, his release to Parole is at this time not recommended.”

The first application for an ESO


	
	On 21 June 2011 a risk assessment report was prepared for the purpose of determining whether an application for an ESO ought be made under the Act, as the defendant’s sentence was due to expire on 10 December 2012. The assessment was conducted by Patrick Sheehan (senior specialist psychologist) and Danielle Matsuo (Acting Director Sex and Violent Offender Programs). The defendant was assessed as remaining in the moderate-high risk category of sexual offending relative to other male sexual offenders.
	
	
	On 10 September 2012 the defendant was released from custody on parole. At first, he resided in a Community Offender Support Program (COSP) facility. On 19 September 2012 he was registered under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 (NSW).
	
	
	On 22 November 2012 the defendant was charged with failing to comply with his reporting conditions under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act as he had a mobile phone with internet access which he had not disclosed to police. He explained that he thought that he was complying with the relevant reporting condition when he told police that he had a new phone. There was no allegation that he had in fact used the Internet for illicit purposes.
	
	
	In 2012, prior to the defendant’s release, orders were obtained from this Court, appointing Drs Allnutt and Roberts to examine the defendant and report to Court. Both experts considered him to pose a high risk of sex offending. Dr Robert’s expressed his opinion in the following summary:
	


“In my opinion, of those people who fall into the category of people being at moderate to high risk of engaging in future offences of a sexual nature, Mr Steadman would be considered to be at the higher end of that range. Individual factors which may be amenable to change through therapy or behavioural modification are less likely to prove amenable to change in Mr Steadman’s case. Having regard for the fact that he is either insightless, in psychological denial or dishonest with respect to his offending behaviour, he is unlikely to perceive benefit in restrictions placed upon him with the aim to moderate risk and he is not expected to avail himself of therapeutic opportunities aimed at moderating risk. His level of risk is therefore not expected to diminish in the way that might be expected in an offender who has acknowledged his propensity to aberrant behaviour and sees logic in restrictions placed on movement or contact and would seek to participate in therapy aimed at mitigating future risk.”


	
	Dr Roberts opined that an ESO of the maximum duration was called for. He noted that the defendant had not availed himself of any therapy and was “insightless”. Dr Roberts also observed of the defendant that:
	


“He has a propensity to abrogate responsibility for his behaviour and consistently assert that the allegations against him have been unfounded.”


	
	The plaintiff’s first application for an ESO against the defendant was made in 2013 and was granted by Button J who made an ESO against him which commenced on 7 March 2013 for a term of three years: Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Steadman [2013] NSWSC 170. In those proceedings the defendant did not oppose the making of an ESO for that duration; the plaintiff contended that it should be for the maximum duration of five years. His Honour was satisfied that the defendant had a “chronic tendency to commit sexual offences against female children that has existed for well over 50 years” ([68]). His Honour also said, at [72]:
	


“I consider that there is certainly a risk to the community that the defendant may inveigle himself into sustained contact with children, either directly or (perhaps more likely) indirectly by way of, for example, a relationship of friendship or affection with an older person with grandchildren, and take the opportunity to commit serious sexual offences against them.”

The conditions of the first ESO


	
	Of present relevance the first ESO contained the following conditions:
	


“[6]   The defendant must notify the Departmental Supervising Officer of any change to the schedule at least 24 hours in advance, unless a shorter period is approved by the Departmental Supervising Officer.

. . .

[19]   Should the defendant enter into a relationship with another person (“the other person”), involving sexual or intimate contact, he must notify the Departmental supervising officer at the earliest opportunity. The Departmental supervising officer may disclose the defendant’s offence history to the other person if the officer is satisfied that to do so is necessary or desirable in the interests of the safety of the other person or any child of or related to that person, or who from time to time be in that person’s care, custody or control.”


	
	Condition 22 provided that the defendant was not to approach or have contact with a child under the age of 16 years, or attend certain nominated locations such as schools, playgrounds and day-care centres, unless he has prior written permission of the Department and is in the presence of an “appropriate adult”, being a person previously approved in writing by the Department for the purposes of the condition.
	


The defendant’s conduct during the period of the first ESO from March 2013 to present


	
	From at least 21 April 2013, the defendant began to complain about the anklet he was required to wear as a condition of the ESO (to provide continuous monitoring of his whereabouts). He said that it was not working for various reasons. The case notes (sometimes referred to as OIMS – Offender Integrated Management System – notes) prepared by Community Corrections officers are redolent with issues concerning the anklet, its charging and its operation. Such complaints have been a consistent theme and have been characterised as “diversionary tactics”, in that they are raised to thwart attempts by therapists to engage in a deeper discussion about the reasons for his offending behaviour and his proclivities. For the initial period of his ESO he was required to submit movement schedules to the Department of Corrective Services setting out where he would be at any given time.
	
	
	On 23 April 2013 the defendant attended his first appointment at Forensic Psychology Services (FPS), as required by a condition of his ESO. His psychologist was Craig Baird. From the outset, the defendant consistently and persistently maintained that he had been falsely accused and wrongly convicted. From that time onwards he gave elaborate explanations as to how and why he had been wronged.
	
	
	On 20 May 2013, in the Waverley Local Court, the defendant was acquitted of the charge of failing to comply with reporting conditions (arising from the charge in November 2012 referred to above).
	
	
	In a counselling session on 24 May 2013, the defendant raised that he suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of assistance he provided for the Granville train disaster as a reason for his aversion to attending appointments in the city or travelling by train in any circumstances. At several consultations it became the main topic of discussion. On 22 July 2013 Mr Baird recorded that, although the defendant asserted that he had been diagnosed with PTSD, an earlier report had noted that there was no official documentation to that effect. It was decided that he ought be referred to another psychologist with a view to determining the existence (or otherwise) of PTSD and appropriate treatment.
	
	
	In August 2013 the defendant moved out of the COSP facility to a private address in Rossmore. On 20 August 2013 the Community Corrections officers conducted an unscheduled home visit at the defendant’s new residence. There was discussion about the defendant’s inadequate response to therapy. The following was also noted:
	


“- The offender then spoke about how the only reason he even went to custody was because the Police offered him a really good deal to reduce the sentence from 15 years to 2 years in goal [sic] but only gave him 10 minutes to decide. The offender now believes they only did this because they did not have a case against him and if he had better legal advise [sic] he would have handled things differently.

- The offender went on at length to discuss the issues with legal aid in his case, the Police and Prosecution, the strength of the witnesses and Corrective Services. The offender appears to blame everybody around him for his circumstances and holds no accountability for his own actions and decision making.”


	
	When Community Corrections officers visited the defendant at home they noticed that in relatively close proximity to the granny flat where the defendant lived there was a pool which was used by children (a fact which he did not disclose to the officers). Indeed, the pool was about 20ms from the vegetable patch which the defendant looked after. This led to the placement of an electronic monitoring boundary and a written direction (given on 13 October 2013) that he not associate with the neighbours.
	
	
	On 13 October 2013 the defendant was interviewed at his home by a Community Corrections officer. The note about the portion of the interview which related to the defendant’s offending history read:
	


“During the interview the offender made a reference to his offending and indicated that he was innocent of all charges. The offender was asked if he denies that he has ever committed a sexual offence against a child. The offender replied with “I have never done anything against a child that would be considered illegal” adding “all I ever done was to bathe his children and grandchildren, something that his wife also done so why is she not in this situation”. For clarity the offender was asked the same question, has [sic] ever committed a sexual offence against a child he replied ‘No’”


	
	In October 2013 the defendant’s landlord, Tony (not his real name), approached him to renovate a nearby property in return for reduced rent. The two became friends.
	
	
	On 9 December 2013 Mr Baird noted that the defendant continued to be “fundamentally opposed to openly engage in treatment”. At the conclusion of the consultation, Mr Baird told the defendant that he would not continue working with him if he did not focus on the treatment.
	
	
	On 16 December 2013 the Community Corrections officers visited the defendant and met Tony. After Tony left, the defendant confirmed that he had not told him that he was subject to an ESO. The defendant told Community Corrections officers that he could not recall if Tony had any grandchildren. However, the officers later learned (in about February 2014) that Tony not only had three grandchildren but they lived with their father next door to the defendant’s residence. On 16 December 2013 the defendant told the officers that he would “go to the grave” claiming his innocence. He blamed the “poor legal aid team and two bad barristers for the fact that he was found guilty”.
	
	
	On 10 January 2014 Mr Baird noted, in the clinical notes of his consultations with the defendant:
	


“Bob wished to stress the point that he has only been accused of sexual offending by close family members and as a consequence of this can’t understand why I’m asking him to develop a self-management plan as he has no contact with close family members anymore. I reminded Bob that one accusation was made by a stranger during a break and enter. Bob acknowledged this but added that he was only 14-15 years old at the time, adding that all his “adult” accusations have been made by family members.”


	
	By February 2014, the friendship between the defendant and his landlord had developed to the point where Tony, who was unaware of the defendant’s history or the ESO, invited the defendant to his home. On at least some of those occasions, Tony’s grandchildren were present. The Community Corrective officers told the defendant that he must either disclose his history and ESO to Tony, or move house. Eventually, on 7 February 2014, the defendant was given a written direction to disclose to Tony that he was subject to an ESO. On 9 February 2014 the defendant informed Tony of this matter. The Community Corrections officer spoke with Tony directly to make sure that he understood the potential risks to his grandchildren. When the officer spoke with Tony on 13 February 2014, he told them that he did not have the “heart to evict [the defendant]”, in part because Tony was grateful for the renovations the defendant had performed on his properties, including the one to which the defendant was about to move.
	
	
	In February 2014 the defendant began seeing Raymond Hudd, psychologist, in lieu of Mr Baird for the purposes of obtaining treatment for PTSD. At about this time the defendant moved to the property in Austral which he had been renovating for Tony. The defendant constructed an aviary on the property in which he housed several birds, including chickens.
	
	
	As is revealed by the supporting documentation, the sessions with Mr Hudd were not productive. Indeed, in March 2014, Mr Hudd told Community Corrections that the defendant was the “most difficult sex offender he has been required to deal with”.
	
	
	In April 2014 a Community Corrections officer made an unscheduled visit to the defendant’s home. In the course of the discussion about treatment, the defendant’s attitude to his offending was raised. The officer made the following note:
	


“The offender became confrontational talking over and swearing at the author. The offender stated again and again that “you will never get me to say I did it” (meaning the sex offending), the offender was reminded that he did as he plead guilty (index offence) the offender stated something along the lines of he took a deal he did not plead guilty.”


	
	In early September 2014 a Community Corrections Officer suggested that the defendant might socialise at a club, either the local bingo club or a bird breeders club. He mentioned that he used to sing for the elderly in their retirement homes and he would consider this.
	
	
	On 7 October 2014, following discussions between Corrective Services and FPS, approval was given for the defendant to join a local bowling club. According to Kay (not her real name), she and the defendant met in October 2014 at Karaoke in Wallacia. Kay looked after four of her grandchildren on a regular and extended basis, including two girls under ten years of age. Three of the grandchildren whom Kay looked after were the children of her son Bill (not his real name), who worked full-time and needed his mother’s assistance to look after his children, including before and after school, as his own marriage had ended.
	
	
	On 13 October 2014, Mr Hudd contacted Mr Baird to inform him that the sessions with the defendant had ended and that he did not consider there to be any benefit in any future sessions. The note recorded:
	


“He [Mr Hudd] stated that he believes the offender may be suffering from PTSD however he had not been able to administer any formal testing as the offender will not divulge any information about this childhood or the offence. He stated the offender is very suspicious and often goes on a rant and tangents.

He stated that he has attempted to administer formal PTSD testing however the offender has not completed testing and will not complete the tests.”


	
	The defendant and Kay soon became good friends and a relationship between them developed around Christmas 2014. Notwithstanding the terms of condition 19 of the first ESO, the defendant did not disclose this relationship to Community Corrections.
	
	
	On 2 January 2015 the defendant made an unscheduled deviation to Kay’s residence, which then became the subject of an exclusion zone.
	
	
	On 23 and 30 January 2015 the defendant deviated from his scheduled movements by visiting Kay’s home.
	
	
	On 1 February 2015 the defendant was seen affectionately kissing a woman, who was later identified as Kay. She waited in the defendant’s car while he went to Aldi. He subsequently drove her to her home (a movement which was not included in his schedule of movements) and then returned to his own residence. The Community Corrections officers followed him home and noted that there were signs of a female in the spare bedroom (women’s shoes under the bed, a pink dressing gown).
	
	
	On 2 February 2015 a Community Corrections officer visited the defendant at home. The officer noticed cigarette butts in an ashtray, which aroused his suspicions as he knew that the defendant did not smoke. He asked the defendant about a deviation to his scheduled movements on the previous day. He said that he had visited a friend whom he had met at karaoke and that she was a “friend”. He gave her first name but refused to provide her last name. He admitted that she had come to his home but said that she had come with a number of friends from karaoke. The defendant was reminded of the terms of condition [19] of the ESO, to which he responded that he and this woman were “just friends”.
	
	
	On 2 February 2015 the defendant was given a written warning about the deviations from his scheduled movements on 23 January, 30 January and 1 February 2015. It was noted that he was detected at Kay’s address.
	
	
	In February and March 2015 the defendant and Kay were sighted together regularly. For example, he was seen with her in the centre of the Trash and Treasure Markets at Camden Valley Way. Kay was seated in a wheelchair with her foot bandaged and the defendant was pushing her around. Although the defendant was regularly questioned by Community Corrections officers about this relationship he maintained that they were just friends with common interests. The defendant did not, at that stage, mention Kay’s grandchildren.
	
	
	On 8 March 2015 the defendant was asked why he had left his property earlier that day without notifying the electronic monitoring unit. He said that he had had friends to stay for the weekend and they had gone to the markets that morning and he had to take them home. He told Community Corrections that he knew that it was the wrong thing to do but he “felt he had no choice as the friend does not know that he is monitored”. On 9 March 2015 he was issued with a final written warning regarding the deviation from his schedule.
	
	
	On 13 March 2015 Community Corrections officers visited the defendant at home. Kay was sitting on the front porch, smoking. The defendant told the officers, who observed a walking frame, that Kay had Parkinson’s and diabetes. The defendant continued to deny the relationship. He informed the officers that although he had not yet told Kay about the ESO, he would do so.
	
	
	On 21 March 2015 Community Corrections officers spoke to the defendant who was again seen with Kay. The defendant told the officers that Kay did not even know that he had been in custody. He also reported that she had many problems and that he really only saw her on the weekend as she minded her grandchildren during the week. He denied that he had visited her place. The notes recorded:
	


“He continued to talk about how hard done by he was and had been due for a review and was perhaps going to let her know after that. He stated that he was thinking that he may have electronic monitoring reduced/ anklet off and author asked if perhaps he thought he would never have to tell. He did not reply. Concluded the lengthy discussion with informing the offender that perhaps it is time to inform his friend. Offender was not very happy.”


	
	On 24 March 2015 the defendant told the Community Corrections officers that he had told Kay that he was on an ESO and that “she understands about his circumstances”. On 29 March 2015 the Community Corrections officers spoke with Kay. The notes record that “she did not have any issue and would continue to support the offender” and “she is aware offender is not to have any contact with children unless supervised”. She asked them whether the defendant could come to her place as she “has some health issues and may require the assistance of the offender”.
	
	
	In April 2015 it was mooted that the defendant be permitted to attend Kay’s residence; however, this proposal was not approved by the Community Corrections manager on the basis that Kay’s son, Bill, was unaware of the defendant’s circumstances (prior convictions and ESO) and there was a possibility that Bill’s children (Kay’s grandchildren) would be there. However, approval was given for him to spend the weekend at her place. The defendant was given a written direction dated 8 April 2015 that he was not to approach or have contact with a child under the age of 16 years, or attend certain nominated locations such as playgrounds, day-care centres, unless he had prior written permission of the Department and was in the presence of an “appropriate adult” being a person previously approved in writing by the Department for the purposes of the condition.
	
	
	On 26 April 2015 Community Corrections officers encountered the defendant in Casula Mall. He was pushing Kay in a wheelchair. Kay explained that she needed to be pushed in a wheelchair because her left leg was in constant pain.
	
	
	On 5 May 2015 Kay spoke to Community Corrections officers and expressed a wish that the defendant be permitted to attend her home on her birthday and mother’s day. Both visits were approved. The notes record:
	


“-    [Kay] spoke of her knowledge of the offender’s past and claimed that she is like a mother to the children as the biological mother has left due to relationship issues.

[Kay] assured manager and writer that she would not let anything happen to the children. [Kay] spoke of how the granddaughter never leaves her side and the two boys are always with the father [Bill]. They are also at school during the weekdays.

ESO manager raised the issue that the father of the children [Bill] is currently unaware of [the defendant’s] past offending and hence approval cannot be given for the offender to visit [Kay’s] house at any time. Visitation to [Kay’s] house must be prior approved to which both [Kay] and [the defendant] stated they understood.”


	
	In May 2015 the requirement that the defendant submit schedules of his movements to the Community Corrections was lifted. On 24 May 2015 Community Corrections officers made an unscheduled visit to the defendant’s home. They found him in Kay’s company and were told that she had just been diagnosed with cancer. The couple informed the officers that they intended to marry in a few months. On 26 May 2015 the defendant was given a written direction in similar terms to the earlier one that he not associate with children except with prior Departmental consent and in the presence of an “appropriate adult”. He was also directed that he was permitted only to attend Kay’s residence in order to pick her up and drop her off as required but that he was not to stay there.
	
	
	On 1 June 2015 the defendant confirmed that he had not yet told Kay’s son about the ESO.
	
	
	On 7 June 2015 Kay told Community Corrections officers that she was having difficulty performing household chores as Bill had been away and that the defendant was helping her with these. When Community Corrections officers visited the defendant at home on 21 June 2015, Kay told them that they had set a wedding date of 2 October 2015 and that they were “just looking for the right time” to tell her son of the defendant’s antecedents and his ESO. On 5 July 2015 Community Corrections officers encountered the defendant and Kay at Casula Mall. She told them that her granddaughter was doing a “child protection awareness course” at school and Kay “spoke of the benefits of this”.
	
	
	On 15 July 2015 the defendant told Community Corrections officers that they were no closer to telling Kay’s son, Bill, due to his “personal issues”. A summary Community Corrections note dated 25 July 2015 recorded:
	


“CP approved. Noted that Robert’s relationship with [Kay] is serious and the two are considering getting married later this year. Given that she has young grand children living with her, this is concerning regarding access. It would appear that [Kay’s] son (father of the children) is still unaware of [the defendant’s] offending history and thus he [the defendant] cannot be at the home when the children are there. This needs to be closely monitored to ensure that he is not trying to linger around the home to have access to the children. Ongoing contact with his partner is to continue to gauge his behaviour. Noted that she is currently unwell and he must understand that he cannot go to her home whenever he feels she requires his assistance. Noted completion report prepared. Continue as outlined.”


	
	The case note for 26 July 2015 recorded in part:
	


“Continues to deny his offence and claims he only pled guilty as he believed he would have been released as time served. He has made mention on several occasions that he believed legal aid was the cause of his incarceration.

- Programs and services

His response to programs has been poor and he has not attended or completed FPD or CUBIT whilst in gaol. He claimed PTSD after being involved in the Granville train disaster however nil records of him being involved exist. He has attended private psychology (PTSD) however this ceased due to psychologist stating noting [sic] more could be done with the offender due to his negative attitude towards intervention. During his time in custody and in the community he has maintained his innocence.”


	
	The case note for 30 July 2015 recorded that the defendant needed to travel to the Family Court in Armidale in August 2015 for the purposes of a property settlement with his ex-wife (his third wife).
	
	
	On 30 August 2015 the defendant was informed that the plaintiff was intending to apply for a further ESO when his current ESO expires. He was told that the reasons for the application included: his continued denial of the offence; his refusal to engage in counselling; and the concern about his relationship with a woman who had young grandchildren in her care and whose son (Bill, the children’s father) was unaware of the defendant’s offences or ESO.
	
	
	On 3 October 2015 the defendant and Kay married.
	
	
	On 6 October 2015 a risk assessment report on the defendant was prepared by Samuel Ardasinski and Danielle Matsuo, forensic psychologists. They identified the following risk factors: sexual deviance; denial and resultant problems with self-awareness and insight; refusal to participate in treatment; social isolation; and being in a relationship which may give the defendant access to female children. They concluded:
	


“CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Mr Steadman is a 71-year old man whose risk of sexual reoffending is estimated to be in the Moderate-High risk category relative to other men who have offended sexually. It was further determined that, in certain high-risk situations, Mr Steadman’s risk of future sexual violence would increase and that he may pose a significant sexual violence risk if left unattended with female children. It is understood that Mr Steadman has entered into a new intimate relationship, and that there is an 8-year old female grandchild living in the same house as his fiancée, along with her adult son and two male children. While under supervision during the course of his Order, Mr Steadman has a condition that he never be left alone in his fiancée’s home, and that he is always in the company of his fiancée whilst visiting that residence on weekends. This is because the children’s father is, to date, unaware of Mr Steadman’s offence history and therefore the potential risk he poses.”


	
	As referred to above, the case notes prepared by Community Corrections officers contain many references to the defendant’s complaints about the anklet and, in particular, the need to charge it and difficulties with charging. A note dated 14 October 2015 recorded:
	


“-    It would appear that this habitual complaining of the electronic equipment may be a tactic that the offender uses to steer the conversation away from the issues that need to be monitored.

The offender was asked about the health of his partner and reported that further tests have been conducted such as an MRI and it would appear that she does not have bone cancer. He further reported that she has been busy looking after her three grandchildren as her son continues to work long hours with his employment.”


	
	A further risk management report dated 20 October 2015 was prepared by Mr Van Ryn, a Community Corrections officer responsible for the defendant. Mr Van Ryn noted that, as at the date of the report, Kay did not believe that the defendant was guilty of any offences and shared his view that he was wrongly accused. He described their living arrangements: they live separately during the week, while she has care of the grandchildren (before and after school) but live together on the weekend. At that stage they had not disclosed either his history or the ESO to her family. He noted:
	


“The offender’s partner has stated that she will not leave her grandchildren in the company of the offender without another adult being present however this assertion must be balanced against the fact that she also supports Mr Steadman in his belief that he was wrongly accused of child sex offences and that he is innocent.”


	
	When addressing the risk of future offending, Mr Van Ryn noted that:
	


“Mr Steadman’s wife’s refusal to divulge the offender’s criminal history and current situation to the parents of her grandchildren raise significant concerns that even when in company of other adults, these adults would not be able to adequately assess risks and take preventative action as required.”


	
	On 24 October 2015 Mr Van Ryn conducted an unscheduled home visit to the defendant. Kay was also there. Mr Van Ryn raised with the defendant that the electronic monitoring revealed that he had spent more than an hour at Kay’s residence on several occasions notwithstanding that permission extended only to dropping her off and collecting her. The defendant said that such quick intervals would tend to raise the suspicions of Kay’s son, who lived at the house. Mr Van Ryn noted:
	


“Mr Steadman was informed that this decision will not be reviewed until [Kay’s son] has been informed of his offences so that he can make an informed decision as to who has access to his children. Both the offender and [Kay] were displeased with this direction, however stated that they would comply.

[Kay] asked whether she was considered to be a responsible adult and was informed since her talk with the psychologist attached to the ESO team that there were questions in regards to whether she would be objective about the risk posed by the offender. [Kay] stated that she thinks that there has been a misunderstanding and that she believes her partner accepts the charges however believes in second chances.

The offender continued to protest his innocence. . .”


	
	On 26 October 2015 Community Corrections received a call from the Department of Community Services (DOCS) in which DOCS expressed its concern about the defendant’s attending Kay’s residence at all and wanted him to be directed not to attend. Community Corrections directed the defendant not to attend Kay’s residence. The case note recorded that the defendant became very upset and accused the officer of denying him his right to see his wife. He was told that he was not permitted to see her at home or when she was around her grandchildren and that the reason for this was that he and his wife refused to inform the parents of the children of his offending history. The defendant became angry and ended the phone call.
	
	
	On 29 October 2015 Community Corrections decided to allow the defendant to attend Kay’s house for a few minutes to pick her up and drop her off. It was noted that the defendant had signed up with the Mt Pritchard Community Club and that there was a children’s gym and a swimming pool on the premises.
	
	
	On 5 November 2015 the defendant told Community Corrections that he intended to tell Kay’s son about his offending history and the ESO that day but he wanted permission to have the discussion at her house. Permission was refused. Before the disclosure to Bill occurred, Department of Family and Community Services (FACS) (the successor to DOCS) independently contacted Bill and told him that the defendant was a person of interest to them because of his long history of harming young children. Bill told FACS that he was unaware of the history and that now that he knew he would not allow the defendant to have any contact with his children. Bill also said that he would ask his mother (Kay) about her knowledge of her new husband’s (the defendant’s) offences.
	
	
	Bill told his former partner (the mother of the children) about the defendant’s offending. She then told Bill’s brother, who went straight to Kay’s house and told her to divorce the defendant straight away or he would have nothing more to do with her. Kay chose to continue her relationship with the defendant; as a consequence, she became estranged from one of her sons (Bill’s brother).
	
	
	A Community Corrections case note dated 22 November 2015 said:
	


“It appears that he has groomed his new partner to believe that he is innocent of his most recent crimes and he has not divulged his paedophilia behaviours and offences throughout his life to her. It appears his recent behaviours are similar to previous relationships where he has accessed and offended against his partner’s children and grandchildren.”


	
	A Community Corrections case note dated 25 November 2015 recorded that the defendant blamed Community Corrections for the delayed disclosure to Bill because they would not permit it to occur at Kay’s house. When the defendant was reminded that the need for such a disclosure had been raised five months previously, he blamed Kay and said that she wanted to defer disclosure because her son was already under too much stress from work.
	
	
	The defendant sought approval to attend Kay’s house on Christmas Day. Bill confirmed that he would ensure that his children were not left in the defendant’s company at any time during the day. The defendant was granted permission to attend from 10am to 2pm and was directed not to have any physical contact with the children.
	
	
	The defendant and Kay wanted to travel to western New South Wales in early 2016 and stay in caravan parks along the route. Permission for him to go was refused on the grounds that Kay had not been approved as an “appropriate adult” for the purpose of supervision around children.
	
	
	On 17 February 2016 Mr Van Ryn interviewed Kay at her home for the purposes of risk assessment. She was asked to describe her health problems, which she confirmed did not presently require hospital admission. She said that she did not take naps during the day. When asked what her attitude was to the defendant’s offending behaviour she said (according to the OIMS note):
	


“[Kay] stated that she believed [the defendant] was guilty. She is aware that Robert has been convicted of child relates [sic] offences on more one [sic] occasion. Has found information of past offences on google. When probed further [Kay] stated that she knew [the defendant] had been convicted of raping children (intercourse) and that he had touched children inappropriately. [Kay] Further [sic] stated that she would kill [the defendant] if he did anything to her kids (meaning her grandchildren).”


	
	Kay also informed Mr Van Ryn that Bill will be moving with his fiancée to Newcastle in December 2016 and that she intended to move in with the defendant when that happened. She said that the defendant wanted to move to Gilgandra but that she wanted to stay in the local area near her doctors and the hospital.
	
	
	Mr Van Ryn also interviewed Bill on the same occasion as he was home at the time. When asked about the defendant’s criminal history Bill said:
	


“Overall it’s bloody disgusting you can look it up on google there are over 20 offences, it fills an A4 page. [Bill] says that he believes [the defendant] is guilty and that he would never level [sic, let] him alone with his children at any time.”

Whether an extended supervision order ought be made

Whether the defendant is a “high risk sex offender”


	
	The defendant meets the definition of “sex offender” in s 4 of the Act, having been sentenced for a “serious sex offence” (aggravated indecent assault on a child under the age of 10). The sentence imposed was five years and five months with a total non-parole period of four years and two months.
	
	
	In these circumstances he is a “high risk sex offender” if I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision: s 5B(2).
	
	
	The ESO granted by Button J will expire at midnight on 6 March 2016, before these proceedings are determined.
	


Section 9: the matters to be taken into account


	
	I shall address each of the matters in s 9(3) in turn, in so far as each is relevant. However, I propose to address safety of the community (s 9(3)(a)) in a compendious way at the end since many of the other factors also concern this matter.
	


Section 9(3)(c) and (d): assessments prepared by other psychiatrists or psychologists and statistical likelihood of re-offending


	
	As referred to above, the defendant was assessed by reference to Static-99 in 2009, at which time he was assessed as being moderate to high risk. I note that he was able to answer affirmatively to the question whether he had ever lived with a lover for at least two years. While in other cases an affirmative answer to that question may properly be regarded as reducing the risk, in the present case I do not regard it as having that effect because of the defendant’s pattern of offending (which is addressed in more detail below in the context of s 9(3)(h)).
	
	
	In June 2012 Mr Sheehan considered the defendant to fall within the moderate to high risk category and did not regard his increasing age as mitigating the risk in any material way. Dr Allnutt in 2012 considered him to be at high risk for serious sexual recidivism. The most recent report, of Mr Ardanski and Ms Matsuo, sets out their opinion that the defendant’s present situation is “high risk” and that although the risk of re-offending is “moderate”, his lack of treatment during the ESO and the similarity between his current personal situation and the previous context in which his offending occurred presented a high risk.
	


Section 9(3)(d1): any report prepared by Corrective Services as to the extent to which the defendant can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community and s 9(3)(f): his level of compliance with parole conditions and the first ESO


	
	The defendant was regarded as generally compliant with reporting for parole in the period from his release to parole on 17 November 1996 (according to a pre-sentence report prepared in 2011), although he refused to engage in any “interventions” in the community and maintained his innocence.
	
	
	As to his level of compliance with the ESO, the lengthy recitation of a narrative largely derived from the OIMS notes provides a picture of the defendant as a man who resents any management or intervention by Community Corrections. He showed himself on occasions to be prepared to mislead the officers who were responsible for his monitoring. For example, he appears to have deliberately downplayed his relationship with Kay until such a time as he had engendered such hope for the future and affection in her (as well as a degree of physical dependency, having regard to her difficulties with mobility) that she married. Moreover, the defendant prevaricated for many months about telling Bill, who eventually learned the truth only when FACS told him.
	
	
	Although the defendant has been subject to electronic monitoring, he has frequently complained about the device, allowed it to exhaust the charge and not answered his mobile phone when officers have called.
	
	
	Mr Van Ryn’s report referred to these matters as well as the Community Corrections’ concerns about his living arrangements and his continual denial of the offending conduct and the need to manage the risk. He has been compliant to an extent with the ESO and has not been “breached”. However, he has sought to test the boundaries of several conditions, particularly those that relate directly to the risk (failure to inform Community Corrections of his relationship with Kay; deferring telling Kay or Bill of the ESO or his offending conduct; and visiting Kay’s house and staying for longer than permitted).
	


Section 9(3)(e): participation in treatment or rehabilitation programs and the level of the offender’s participation


	
	The defendant attended FPS consultations with Mr Baird and also attended Mr Hudd to obtain treatment for PTSD. His participation was indifferent in both. He appears to have no insight into the effect of his criminal conduct on others and refuses to acknowledge either his guilt or his responsibility. There was no active engagement with the therapy. I accept the clinicians’ reports that he engaged in diversionary tactics on a regular basis. His preparedness to blame others (his legal team, his family, etc.) does not augur well for any prospect of rehabilitation.
	


Section 9(3)(g): the level of the defendant’s compliance with obligations under Child Protection legislation


	
	The only matter relied on by the plaintiff was the defendant’s alleged failure to comply with reporting conditions relating to a new phone with Internet capacity in 2012. He was acquitted of the charge. There is, accordingly, nothing to suggest that he has not complied with his obligations under this legislation.
	


Section 9(3)(h): the defendant’s criminal history and pattern of offending


	
	The defendant’s criminal history as set out more fully in the narrative above spans several decades. Age does not appear to have diminished his sexual urge. He remains lacking in insight.
	
	
	The defendant’s past offending has involved his obtaining access to young girls through (age-appropriate) women with whom he has been in apparently intimate relationships. Such women have been either the mother (in the case of the earlier offending in 1993) or the grandmother (in the case of the index offences in 2007) of the victims.
	
	
	The children under the care of their mother or grandmother (as the case may be) appear to have been lulled into a false sense of security by their mother or grandmother’s relationship with the defendant. With respect to the 1993 offences, the reason V3 was in the same bed as the defendant was that her friend, AV1, had been comfortable to watch television there as her mother (the defendant’s then partner) was also in the bed. In relation to the offences in 2007, the defendant was apparently able to engage in conduct (not all of which was charged) with several young girls in the context of a family environment where the defendant was called “Poppy” by his then wife’s grandchildren.
	
	
	Although no judgment can be made whether the defendant entered into the relationships with the mother or grandmother of his victims with a view to obtaining access to young girls to whom he was sexually attracted, this has been the effect of such past relationships. He has recently married Kay, a woman who has caring responsibilities for her grandchildren, and who, though the grandmother, effectively stands in the position of mother. But for the ESO and the constant surveillance and enforcement of its conditions by the Community Corrections officers, the defendant’s relationship with Kay would have given him unfettered access to young girls: those in her care and any of their friends who might visit them.
	
	
	It is also noteworthy that the defendant has demonstrated a substantial capacity to affect the judgment of the women with whom he is intimate. His third wife preferred to lose contact with her daughter and grandchildren and align herself with the defendant, notwithstanding his plea of guilty to serious sexual offences involving them. It was only when TC, her own daughter, told her of the sexual assaults which the defendant had perpetrated against her, that the defendant’s third wife was prepared to acknowledge that his claims of innocence were false.
	
	
	Kay, his fourth wife, was induced to believe that the defendant was innocent of all of the offences with which he had been convicted (and to some of which he had pleaded guilty). For a significant period she preferred to keep her own son, Bill, in the dark about the defendant’s criminal history, than disclose it and jeopardise her own relationships both with Bill and with the defendant. Kay has lost contact with her second son (Bill’s brother) as a consequence of her continued association with the defendant, on whom she depends for physical assistance and support. In the course of Mr Van Ryn’s interview on 17 February 2016 (less than a fortnight before the preliminary hearing) Kay indicated that she accepted that he was guilty of the offences for which he has been convicted. However, she has earlier said that she believes in “second chances”, which provides little assurance that she would be willing to control the defendant, even if she were able to do so.
	


Section 9(3)(h1): the views of the sentencing court


	
	The concerns of Williams DCJ are set out above. They relate principally to the defendant’s lack of insight, pattern of offending and ability to groom his partner to take his side in the face of what might be regarded as overwhelming evidence (including his plea of guilty).
	


Section 9(3)(i): any other information


	
	I have referred to the transcripts of interviews with children who spoke of the defendant’s conduct at about the time of the index offences. I have taken these matters into account with respect to the pattern of offending conduct referred to above, with allowance for their weight (since they were not the subject of charges and were not tested at trial).
	


Section 9(3)(a): the safety of the community


	
	Mr Averre has put on behalf of the defendant that the risk posed to the public is largely confined to Kay’s grandchildren since his history does not include random, impulsive acts against children in public areas. He submitted that, in these circumstances, the risk will effectively be reduced, if not removed, by Bill’s imminent move to Newcastle. He also relied on Kay’s growing awareness of the reality of the risk posed by the defendant (and her acceptance of his past guilt) as an additional protective factor.
	
	
	Mr Averre referred to Mr Van Ryn’s evidence that he considered Kay to be an “appropriate person” for the purposes of the conditions of his existing ESO (although Mr Van Ryn accepted that he did not have the authority to make such a decision). Mr Averre submitted that, in these circumstances, Kay’s presence (which ought be inferred would be continuous, having regard to their marriage) would provide an adequate protective mechanism even were no ESO to be ordered. He also referred, as an additional protective mechanism, to the Child Protection legislation (Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 and Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004 (NSW)), pursuant to which the defendant was registered. He submitted that, for these reasons, although there was a risk, I ought not be satisfied that it was an unacceptable risk.
	
	
	The safety of the community in the present case is, in substance, the safety of young girls to whom the defendant is sexually attracted, and in particular those who are within a family circle to which the defendant belongs. The defendant has apparently no insight into the danger he poses and is unwilling to restrain himself from indulging his sexual urges. The safety of the community would appear to be jeopardised except to the extent to which he can be controlled by external forces. Absent an ESO, there are no readily identifiable external forces that would apply, or be effective, to restrain the defendant. The Child Protection legislation does not include surveillance or electronic monitoring of the sort available under an ESO.
	
	
	Moreover, the defendant has shown remarkable skill in insinuating himself into the affections of women who, by reason of their standing as mothers or grandmothers, have close relationships with (and play caring roles with respect to) young girls. Although Kay’s attitude appears (from the supporting documentation) to have changed somewhat, I do not consider that she would necessarily provide any real protection for girls in the defendant’s presence, having regard to her undoubted love and devotion to him, as well as her physical infirmities. Although access to Kay’s grandchildren is likely to be much diminished when Bill moves his family to Newcastle, it cannot reasonably be contemplated that Kay will not have contact with her grandchildren, particularly as she has performed the role of mother for them for some years.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having considered the factors in s 9(3) of the Act addressed above, in the context of the narrative of facts, it appears to me that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an ESO on the basis that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am persuaded that it is appropriate, and necessary, to protect the safety of the community, to order an ISO pursuant to s 10A of the Act for the maximum period of 28 days permitted under s 10C of the Act.
	
	
	I am obliged, in these circumstances to make orders under s 7(4) of the Act appointing relevant experts to conduct examinations and report to the Court for the purposes of the final hearing at which the Court will determine whether to make an ESO in respect of the defendant, and, if so, for what period.
	
	
	As referred to above, the plaintiff accepts the defendant’s proposal that the conditions of any ISO be those of the first ESO subject to the further condition referred to above authorising the DSO to tell Kay’s family about his criminal history. I am satisfied that these conditions are appropriate for the purposes of the ISO.

	I make the following orders:

		09 March 2016",2016-03-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768913,R v Jordan [2016] NSWDC 164,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: It is undeniable that a strong predictor of whether a particular person will commit crimes is whether that person’s parents had a history of offending. One might have hoped that a child seeing parents waste large parts of their lives in custody, parents who live out their lives measured in court dates, release dates, head sentences and non-parole periods, might mean that children of such parents do all they can to avoid following in the footsteps of those parents, but matters, of course, are not as easy at that. The upbringing a child has significant impacts on their behaviour, and a child who like Liam Jordan who appears for sentence today, was brought up by parents who demonstrated regular offending, who modelled regular drug use and who failed to set behavioural boundaries will often end up, as Mr Jordan has, before courts facing sentence which necessarily involves them serving sentences of imprisonment just like their parents did.
	
	
	Not all of us have the same background, not all of us have the same opportunities in life and so in deciding the moral culpability of any particular offender it is important to understand the nature of that offender’s background.
	
	
	When we talk about moral culpability we often consider questions of personal choice. To what extent has the offender chosen to commit these offences? Some people, people like Mr Jordan, have less ability to choose law abiding lifestyles than those who are brought up by parents who do not commit crimes, who do not use drugs and who do set proper behavioural boundaries.
	
	
	I have started these remarks on sentence that way, because of the link between Mr Jordan’s background and what brings him before me today.
	
	
	Problems started for Mr Jordan even before he was born. His mother was a drug addict and so when born he needed immediate treatment. His parents, he believed, loved him, but really set no effective boundaries apart from requiring that he have good manners. He was brought up by whichever parent happened not to be in custody at any particular time. His father was a drug addict too and served sentences of imprisonment on a regular basis. Eventually his mother abandoned the family and he was left to be brought up by his father.
	
	
	At one stage he was taken into foster care. As I understand the psychologist’s report, tendered on behalf of Mr Jordan today, his foster parents did their best, but Mr Jordan’s behavioural problems were such that when his father got out from custody at one stage they did not stop Mr Jordan from leaving their care and returning to live with his father. He was about 14 years of age at that time, and after he left his foster carers he never returned to any formal schooling. His last education was thus when he was in year 9. But, of course, the inevitable occurred, his father was returned to custody after committing some other offence and Mr Jordan was forced to live on the streets. It is in that context that a lot of the matters on his criminal history must have occurred. He told the psychologist that a lot of that offending was simply a result of needing to steal to survive, to obtain food and the necessities of life.
	
	
	He has a history of drug use, which is not surprising given his background, but has been able to abstain from time to time. It was one particular relapse that led to him committing the offences that I will now describe.
	
	
	Mid-morning on a Saturday in June last year the offender broke into the home of a 46 year old woman. Whilst in the home he found that woman’s handbag, took it and stole it. In her handbag were a mobile phone and several bank keycards. A little while later she noticed her handbag was gone and reported the theft to police. A little while after he had stolen that handbag he was seen going through it in the backyard of another home. When he heard a nearby noise he appeared to be startled and ran away.
	
	
	What I have just described has led to the offender pleading guilty at an early opportunity to an offence of aggravated enter dwelling house with intent to steal, the circumstance of aggravation being he either knew or was deemed known that the premises were occupied. Attached to that offence is the matter on the Form 1, stealing from a dwelling. That relates to the actual handbag that was stolen after Mr Jordan broke into the house intending to steal.
	
	
	Ordinarily one might have expected to see a charge of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely, of stealing. It is puzzling that the charges that the Crown has preferred against Mr Jordan have effectively split-up his offending into aggravated enter dwelling house with intent to steal, with the actual stealing on a Form 1. The explanation appears to be that by doing so the standard non-parole period is avoided. Such creative charge bargaining on behalf of the DPP does it no credit whatsoever. Crown Prosecutors, trial advocates and solicitors from the DPP should not obtain pleas of guilty at the cost of bringing discredit onto the criminal justice system by such creative charge bargaining.
	
	
	There is another matter on the Form 1 too, and that is a matter of entering enclosed lands without lawful excuse, that, of course, relating to the time that the offender spent in someone else’s backyard going through the handbag he had stolen nearby.
	
	
	Shortly after he ran off, as I have described earlier, he broke into other premises. He was observed by a witness to be in the backyard of a house in Glebe, to open a closed window and to climb inside. The eyewitness called police, who arrived while the accused was actually in the premises. He began climbing out the window in full view of police. He was challenged and ran away. Eventually he was caught, but denied any wrongdoing when interviewed by police.
	
	
	Mr Kozanecki said that these offences were offences at the low end of the range of offences of that type. I do not agree. They are entirely normal, standard, middle of the range offences of break and enter with intent to steal or aggravated break and enter with intent to steal. Indeed, judges and magistrates see so many offences of this type that we tend to begin to regard them as normal, but that is to ignore the serious consequences of offences of the type I have just described. It is notorious that those who have the security of their homes broken are as a result more fearful, less confident, and, to put matter bluntly, less happy about their lives. What to people like Mr Jordan is a simple entry in a premises and the theft of a handbag is to the victim of such offences a very serious matter. Alarms are installed, bars are put on windows and people become less confident in their lives.
	
	
	There are wider consequences as well, the community in general suffers through higher insurance premiums, all of us putting on extra security in our homes, and it is for these reasons that significant penalties are provided for the offences for which I must sentence Mr Jordan, 14 years for the aggravated form of the offence and ten years for the unaggravated form of the offence.
	
	
	I mentioned before that the offender pleaded guilty. He did this at an early stage and so the sentence I impose upon him will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been. He has been in custody from the day of his arrest, the day he committed these offences, 27 June 2015. Not all of that pre-sentence custody was referrable to these matters. He did one month for an unrelated matter and so I will date the sentence of imprisonment, which Mr Kozanecki concedes I must impose upon his client, from 27 July 2015.
	
	
	I mentioned Mr Jordan’s prior offending. He does have a lengthy record for one so young, but this is the first significant time he will spend in custody.
	
	
	Not surprisingly perhaps, given his background, the psychologist describes him as being anxious, depressed and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. These are significant factors affecting Mr Jordan. Nevertheless it is appropriate for a significant level of general deterrence to be built into the sentence I will shortly announce.
	
	
	The connection between Mr Jordan’s drug use and his offending is obvious. Indeed, he claims to have no memory of these offences, having consumed ice and then Xanax shortly before he committed the offences. That circumstance is of particular relevance when one looks at his prospects for rehabilitation. They are intricately bound up with the prospects of him ceasing to use drugs in the future. I should emphasise there is nothing to suggest that he has been using drugs since he went into custody. There are no disciplinary matters on his custodial history and no suggestion that he has failed any urine tests that he has been required to undergo. I note also the sentiments he expressed to the psychologist in which he expressed remorse for his conduct and empathy towards the victims of it.
	
	
	Mr Kozanecki, I think I have already mentioned, concedes that imprisonment is appropriate and made no suggestion that that imprisonment would be other than fulltime imprisonment. He asked me to make a finding of special circumstances, which I will, based on the need for Mr Jordan to be assisted with his drug problems upon his release from custody. As I mentioned, if he can deal with his issues regarding drugs, the chances of him committing further offences in the future are significantly reduced. So it is thus not only in his interests, but also the community’s interests, that he be given the benefit of an extended period of supervision on parole.
	
	
	Mr Kozanecki submitted that the appropriate sentence to impose upon his client was one which minimised his time in custody as way of minimising his exposure to other more significant criminals, which would simply perpetuate his exposure to poor role models, a situation which has existed for all of Mr Jordan’s relatively short life.
	
	
	There also needs to be an element of personal deterrence. Mr Jordan needs to understand that if he continues to offend he will continue to go to gaol just as his parents did.
	
	
	Of recent times his father has apparently turned the corner. It is now seven years since he served a custodial sentence and has had stable accommodation for five. That is very much to his credit and Mr Jordan is rightfully proud of his father for what he has achieved, but he has only achieved that at a very late stage of his life. Mr Jordan has the opportunity to achieve something similar at a much younger stage of his life. If he does his life will be better for it. I have done what I can to encourage Mr Jordan to make the decision upon his release from custody that he is not going to go back to gaol. I have done what I can to give him support which will assist him in that regard, but ultimately it is up to him. If he commits further offences I will send him to gaol and so will everyone else. If he does not his life will be better for it.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. I would have imposed on the aggravated break and enter with intent to steal a sentence of imprisonment of three years, and on the break and enter with intent to steal a sentence of imprisonment of two years. The aggregate sentence is one of consisting of a non-parole period of two years to date from 27 July 2015 and a head sentence of three half years. The non-parole period will expire on 26 July 2017, on which day Mr Jordan is eligible to be released to parole.

		09 August 2016",2016-03-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768922,Shane Kovacs v R [2016] NSWDC 19,"Judgment


	
	Shane Kovacs (the appellant) appeals against the severity of the sentence imposed on him by the Chief Magistrate Judge Henson on 8 December 2015 at the Downing Centre Local Court.
	
	
	The appellant had pleaded guilty of 3 counts of sexual intercourse with a person aged between 14 and 16 years contrary to section 66C(3) Crimes Act 1900. The offences were committed in September and October 2014 when the victim was 14 years of age and each involved penile vaginal intercourse. The maximum penalty for each count was 2 years imprisonment when dealt with summarily. On indictment the maximum penalty was 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The Chief Magistrate imposed the following sentences of imprisonment:
	



	
	Count 1 8 months with a non-parole period of 4 months to date from 8 December 2015;
	
	
	Count 2 10 months with a non-parole period of 6 months to date from 7 April 2016; and
	
	
	Count 3 14 months with a non-parole period of 8 months to date from 7 October 2016.
	



	
	The effective term of imprisonment imposed was one of 2 years (less one day) with a non-parole period of 18 months. At [31] of the Chief Magistrate’s remarks on sentence he made a “limited finding of special circumstances”. The individual sentences imposed reflected that finding however, the effective term of imprisonment did not. That approach is inconsistent with the authorities: R v Attard [2004] NSWCCA 376 at [21], Fina’i v R [2006] NSWCCA 134 at [33] - [40] and Parkes v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [14].
	
	
	The appellant was granted appeal bail on 8 December 2015.
	


Court’s power to deal with the appeal


	
	The severity appeal is a rehearing of the evidence in the Local Court proceedings and fresh evidence may be given: Section 17 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.
	
	
	The Court may determine the severity appeal:
	



	
	by setting aside the sentence, or
	
	
	by varying the sentence, or
	
	
	by dismissing the appeal: s.20(2) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001
	


Agreed facts


	
	The Agreed Facts can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	In about April 2014 the victim created a profile on an online dating and introduction service known as ""Zoosk.” In her profile she stated she was 19 years of age. The appellant made contact with the victim through the website’s messaging service. They exchanged contact details and commenced contact via Skype.
	
	
	The appellant and the victim began communicating daily. About one month later, the victim informed the appellant that she was in fact 14 years old. The appellant ceased contact with her. About one week later the victim contacted the appellant on Skype to say goodbye. The appellant told her that he could not stop thinking about her and they resumed online contact, including video calls on Skype.
	
	
	They met in person at about the end June 2014 at a cinema in Chatswood. The victim was accompanied by a school friend. During the movie the appellant and the victim held hands, she placed her head on his shoulder and they hugged and kissed.
	
	
	The appellant and the victim thereafter went out a number of times together. On occasions the victim brought friends with her. They went jogging together at a local oval about twice per week. Their relationship became more physical. The appellant discussed with the victim progressing their relationship to include sexual relations via Skype and they exchanged information about their lack of sexual history.
	
	
	On a date in September 2014 after they met to go jogging, the appellant asked the victim if she was ready to progress their relationship and she agreed. They got in his car and drove a short distance to a quiet street. In the back of the car they had penile vaginal intercourse (Count 1). The appellant wore a condom.
	
	
	On 24 September 2014 whilst jogging the appellant asked the victim if she wanted to have intercourse again. At about 1.30am the next morning the victim left home without telling her parents and met the appellant a short distance from her house. They got in his car and drove a short distance. In the front of the car they had penile vaginal intercourse (Count 2). The appellant wore a condom. The appellant returned the victim to her house at about 3.00am.
	
	
	About one week later on a Sunday night, the victim let the appellant into her home. They had penile vaginal intercourse in the downstairs bathroom (Count 3).
	
	
	On 29 October 2014 the victim’s mother discovered the relationship between the victim and the appellant and made a complaint to the Police.
	
	
	The appellant was arrested on 3 March 2015 and charged with a number of offences.
	


The Appellant’s evidence


	
	The appellant relied on the following documents:
	



	
	Medical records from Liverpool Hospital dated 16 February 2016, 19 October 2015, 5 August 2015, 10 November 2014, and 7 November 2014;
	
	
	Report of Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, dated 29 August 2015;
	
	
	Letter to the Magistrate dated 10 November 2015;
	
	
	Letter of suitability to participate in group treatment program from Jessica Pratley psychologist dated 28 September 2015;
	
	
	Character references from Angie Kovacs, Steve Kovacs, Matthew Carrier, Peter Chan, Andrew Troy, Stuart Marks, Thanh Tran, and Stacey Madden.
	



	
	A presentence report dated 20 October 2015 and a presentence psychology consultation document were prepared and received by the Court.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence before me on 18 February 2016 and was cross-examined. He was supported in Court by his mother, his aunt, his stepsister, his sister’s boyfriend and a long-standing friend.
	
	
	The appellant’s case can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The appellant is presently 29 years of age and lives with his sister. He is employed as a sound engineer. He has a long history of stable employment.
	
	
	The appellant subscribed to Zoosk looking for a serious relationship. He had only been on two dates previously. By the time the victim told him her real age he had already formed a strong bond with her and he had been lonely for so long that he could not bring himself to stay away from her. He thought that they had both benefitted from the relationship because they had both suffered from depression at an earlier time.
	
	
	After being charged he has spoken with family, friends and his therapist and now realises that the victim was not mature enough to have an intimate relationship with him. He has not had any contact with the victim and does not intend to do so, whether there is an apprehended violence order in place or not.
	
	
	After the offences but before he was charged he sought counselling to deal with his feelings. He was given a Mental Health Care Plan by his general practitioner and undertook counselling with a psychologist. He was prescribed antidepressants and initially his condition was unstable causing him to act impulsively, for example by punching walls. He did not want to be dependent on the medication but he has subsequently settled on a combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. During the course of treatment he was diagnosed as suffering from a borderline personality disorder. He was told that this was likely to exaggerate his emotional response to any given situation.
	
	
	He was an involuntary patient at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital for 3 days in December 2014 after an episode of self harm. He was admitted as an involuntary patient at Liverpool Hospital for 2 weeks in April 2015 after suffering suicidal ideations for 3 days. He was admitted to Royal North Shore Hospital on 27 September 2015 for 5 weeks following a suicide attempt.
	
	
	The appellant has investigated undergoing sex offender rehabilitation treatment in the community with his psychologist. He is currently on waiting list to enter the program. His acceptance to the program is dependent upon the outcome of these proceedings.
	
	
	Dr Furst took a history that his parents separated when he was about 7 years of age. He has one sister and three younger half sisters who he is close to. The appellant had negative memories of his childhood and had increasing low self-esteem and depressive symptoms by his mid teens. He continued to suffer from mood swings in his early 20s as well as having a poor self-image resulting in feelings of stress, agitation and frustration. The appellant has had a number of episodes of deliberate self harm since November 2014 when the criminal investigation began. He has had panic attacks up to several times a day since that time. The appellant has been seeing a psychologist regularly from November 2014.
	
	
	Dr Furst’s opinion is that the appellant has suffered chronic dysthymia (a low-grade long-standing depressive mood disorder). He has subsequently developed an Adjustment Disorder with depressed and anxious mood as a result of being charged with the offences before the Court, although it could also be suggested that he has borderline personality traits. Dr Furst did not believe there was any element of paraphilia in his psychological presentation. Dr Furst is of the opinion that his chronic dysthymia and underlying personality disorder probably contributed to the poor judgement he displayed when engaging in a sexual relationship with the victim who was underage.
	
	
	The appellant presents a high risk of self harm, including suicide, should he receive a custodial sentence. Dr Furst was of the opinion that the appellant was a low risk of reoffending in a sexual or nonsexual violent manner. I infer from his report that Dr Furst was of the opinion that the appellant would still benefit from a sex offender treatment program, irrespective of whether he received a custodial sentence.
	


Objective Seriousness of the Offence


	
	The courts have repeatedly emphasised the extremely serious view that has to be taken towards matters of this kind: R v JVP (NSWCCA unreported 6 November 1995).
	
	
	The ages of victims and a range of criminality of the offenders may vary greatly, rendering a wide range of sentences appropriate. The sentencing legislation does not permit the Court to deal with these offences by way of an Intensive Corrections Order or by ordering that any period of imprisonment be served by way of home detention.
	
	
	The most significant matter which determines where a particular offence is to be placed in the spectrum is the degree to which the offender is seen to have exploited the youth of the victim: R v Sea (NSWCCA unreported 13 August 1990).
	
	
	In this case, the appellant knew the victim’s age and actively sought to pursue an intimate relationship with her for a number of months that culminated in the commission of the offences. There was an obvious power imbalance in the relationship. The appellant was 28 years of age and there was a significant age gap.
	
	
	There is nothing in the facts to support the conclusion that the appellant was a “sexual predator” or that he sought to persuade the victim by deception or flattery. The victim was vulnerable, by reason of her age and lack of maturity and that presented the appellant with the opportunity to commit the offences.
	
	
	I do not accept the characterisation of the relationship by the appellant as a significant and/or mature, and in any event that would not be a mitigating factor.
	


Deterrence


	
	The abhorrence with which the community regards the sexual interference with children and the emphasis attached to general deterrence in sentencing offenders is reflected in the authorities: for example R v BJW (2000) 112 A Crim R 1 at [20].
	
	
	Custodial sentences in some cases of sexual assault on children are essential if the courts are to play their proper role in protecting young people from sexual interference by adults: R v Fisher (1989) 40 A Crim R 442 at 445.
	
	
	General deterrence may be attributed less weight in cases where the offender suffers from mental condition because such an offender is not an appropriate person to be made an example of: Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [53]-[54]. The authorities do not mandate an entire disregard of general or specific deterrence by the sentencing judge. The extent of the reduction depends on the circumstances of the case: Palijan v R [2010] NSWCCA 142 at [27], R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81, R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 and R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91.
	
	
	The factors that are relevant to the assessment include the nature and extent of the mental condition suffered, whether the offender acted with knowledge of what they were doing and the gravity of their actions and whether the community require protection from the offender by reason of the mental condition suffered.
	
	
	At the time that the offences were committed, the appellant’s mental condition was not as evident as it became in about November 2014 when the criminal investigation began. At that time the appellant was acting with knowledge of what he was doing  and should have been well aware of the gravity of his actions, having a younger sister about the same age as victim. I accept that as a person with a borderline personality disorder he may have found it more difficult to end the relationship but the causal connection between his mental condition and the offending conduct is weak. No more than a small reduction in the weight to be afforded to general deterrence is appropriate.
	
	
	There is some need for specific deterrence in this matter. Whilst the appellant now recognises why his relationship with the victim was wrong, in his evidence he continued to seek to justify it by reference to his subjective circumstances, ie his lack of a serious relationship in the past.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	There are no relevant aggravating factors.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	The appellant does not have any prior convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The appellant was a person of good character: section 21A (3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The appellant tendered references from a number of people known to him. Each of the referees attested to his good character. He has always been gainfully employed.
	
	
	The appellant is unlikely to re-offend: section 21A(3)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This is the opinion of both Dr Furst and the Corrective Services psychologist, based on an actuarial assessment of risk factors.
	
	
	The appellant has good prospects of rehabilitation: section 21A(2)(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The appellant has referred himself for significant treatment since being charged with the offence and has been prepared to undergo a sex offender treatment program.
	
	
	The appellant has demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the appellant has demonstrated genuine contrition and remorse.
	
	
	The appellant entered a plea of guilty at an early stage of the proceedings before the Local Court: sections 21A(2)(k) and 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The appellant is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32]. I agree with the Chief Magistrate that the appropriate discount for the plea was 20%.
	


Consideration


	
	I have considered section 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I am satisfied that having considered all possible alternatives that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.
	
	
	The appellant was sentenced to a term of less than 2 years imprisonment by the Chief Magistrate. There being no appeal against inadequacy by the Crown and in the absence of a Parker direction from me, he can be considered for a suspended sentence.
	
	
	The factors to be taken into account in my view are as follows.
	
	
	First, he will find custody more onerous than other people by reason of his mental condition. It is likely that he will serve any custodial sentence on protection and under close supervision to avoid the risk of self harm.
	
	
	Second, he has suffered significantly as a result of these proceedings. He has suffered suicidal ideations and been admitted as an involuntary patient on 3 separate occasions since November 2014.
	
	
	Third, he has been reporting daily since he was charged.
	
	
	Fourth, he is employed and that is beneficial for the treatment of his mental condition and sex offender programs are available to him in the community.
	
	
	The offences committed are objectively serious, there is a need for general deterrence, there is a need for denunciation of the offending conduct, and there is a need for retribution. Whilst the subjective circumstances of the appellant are persuasive and almost compelling they are necessarily subsidiary to the duty of the Court to ensure that a punishment of appropriate severity is delivered.
	
	
	The penalty imposed by the Chief Magistrate being one of full-time imprisonment was appropriate.
	
	
	If I had sentenced the appellant at first instance I would not have differentiated between the terms of imprisonment for each of the offences. I would have started with a head sentence of 15 months for each offence, reduced to 12 months after the applicable discount. I have not given a Parker direction to the appellant and I will not increase the head sentences imposed by the Chief Magistrate for counts 1 and 2, but will reduce the head sentence imposed for Count 3 to 12 months. I have also come to a different view as to the application of the principle of totality, resulting in a reduction of the overall head sentence compared to that imposed by the Chief Magistrate.
	
	
	I find that there are special circumstances because this will be the appellant’s first time in custody, the circumstances of his incarceration are likely to be onerous and he will benefit from a longer time on parole to allow for treatment of his mental condition and to participate in a sex offender’s rehabilitation program in the community, if necessary.
	
	
	The Chief Magistrate was right to make the sentences partly cumulative and partly concurrent. However, the sentences ultimately imposed did not reflect the express finding of special circumstances that was implicit in the sentences imposed for each count.
	
	
	In order to avoid the same complexity, it is appropriate for the Court to impose an aggregate sentence pursuant to section 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The appropriate overall term of imprisonment is 2 years and 1 month. That term of imprisonment will be discounted by 20% in recognition of the plea of guilty.
	
	
	The sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed are:
	



	
	Count 1      8 months imprisonment.
	
	
	Count 2      10 months imprisonment.
	
	
	Count 3      12 months imprisonment.
	



	
	Taking into account all of those matters the appropriate aggregate sentence is 1 year and 8 months imprisonment with a non parole period of 10 months.
	


The orders I make are as follows


	
	The appeal against severity is allowed.
	
	
	I set aside the sentences imposed by the Chief Magistrate.
	
	
	In lieu thereof I impose an aggregate sentence of 1 year and 8 months imprisonment with a non parole period of 10 months to date from 4 March 2016.
	
	
	I direct that the offender is to be released to parole on 3 January 2017.
	
	
	I note the appellant is of high risk of suicide and self harm.
	
	
	I direct that a copy of Dr Furst's report be forwarded to the Department of Corrective Services forthwith

	HOEBEN CJ AT CL:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   On 19 August 2013 the Applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of having sexual intercourse with a person above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that he was in the company of Donna O’Neill at the time, contrary to s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 12 years.
	
	
	On 7 March 2014 he was sentenced by Judge Maiden in the District Court to a non-parole period of four years and six months commencing 22 July 2013 and expiring 21 January 2018 with an additional term of one year, four months and six days expiring on 27 May 2019.
	
	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal on two grounds as follows:
	


1.   The Sentencing Judge erred in the finding relating to the objective seriousness of the offence.

2.   The Sentencing Judge erred in setting the non-parole period.

The facts


	
	There was an Agreed Statement of Facts at the sentencing hearing. The following facts are largely taken from the Sentencing Judge’s summary of those facts.
	
	
	On 19 February 2011 the complainant, who was then aged 15 years, had been asked to baby sit the children of the Applicant and his partner (the co-offender). The complainant was the daughter of friends of the Applicant and the co-offender, and there was a close relationship between the families of the complainant and the Applicant. The complainant had been the regular baby sitter for the Applicant and the co-offender.
	
	
	The Applicant and the co-offender had made an arrangement before the services of the complainant had been engaged to socialise that night at a local club. During that afternoon, the Applicant directed the co-offender to text the complainant with these words, ""Kenny wants to know if you would like to have a threesome tonight."" The complainant responded, ""Tell him no"". The Sentencing Judge concluded from the Agreed Facts that it may have been contemplated by the Applicant that despite the complainant's young age she would be provided with alcohol so that she may have been intoxicated and thus open to his suggestions.
	
	
	The complainant cared for the children during the evening, including bathing them and putting them to bed. The Applicant and the co-offender arrived home shortly after 1am. The complainant was still awake and was handed money for the baby sitting.
	
	
	After having a shower the Applicant went into the lounge where he had an argument with the co-offender. He then approached the complainant and said, ""If you don't have sex with me I'll hit Donna (meaning the co-offender) and you"". At that time the complainant walked into the bedroom of the Applicant and the co-offender because of her fear of a physical assault by him.
	
	
	In the bedroom the Applicant took off the complainant's clothing. The co-offender started kissing the complainant. The Applicant told the co-offender to take the complainant’s bra off, and she did so. The Agreed Facts then say this:
	


The offender asked the co-offender to start “doing stuff” to the victim but she replied, “No”.

This statement was interpreted by the Sentencing Judge in a particular way that becomes relevant for the first ground of appeal. I will return to it when discussing that ground.


	
	The Applicant then began kissing the co-offender and fondling her. He then kissed the complainant and put his hands down her underwear and then said, ""Oh, let's take these off."" He pulled the remaining clothing off the complainant and then inserted two of his fingers inside her vagina and moved them around inside of her. He then commenced to have penile vaginal intercourse with the co-offender and was kissing the complainant on the mouth and sucking her breasts whilst doing this. The co-offender also kissed the complainant as well as the Applicant. The co-offender also sucked the complainant’s breasts.
	
	
	The complainant attempted to move her body away and look away from both of them but during this time she was pulled back towards the Applicant. The Sentencing Judge commented at this point that it was clear at this time that the complainant was in fear for herself and what was happening to her. His Honour said that it was difficult to imagine the distress that she must have been suffering and attempting to endure.
	
	
	After ten minutes the Applicant took his penis out of the co-offender’s vagina and the co-offender performed fellatio on him. The Applicant then put his penis inside the complainant's vagina and commenced having sexual intercourse with her. The co-offender left the bedroom and went to the toilet. When she returned she said to the Applicant, “I thought you’d be done by now”, to which he replied, “No”. Shortly thereafter the Applicant had penile/vaginal intercourse with the co-offender, and then again had penile/ vaginal sex with the complainant.
	
	
	After another matter of minutes, the co-offender re-entered the bedroom, lay on the bed and turned the television on. At this point the Applicant ejaculated inside the complainant’s vagina. The co-offender asked him words to the effect, ""Where did it go?"" and the Applicant replied, ""In [the complainant]"". The co-offender said, “Well, you better hope the pill works and she doesn’t get pregnant.” He said, “No, she won’t”. The Sentencing Judge observed at this point that the sex at this time was unprotected and there was no doubt that on this second occasion of penile vaginal intercourse that the Applicant had no regard for the safety and welfare of the complainant.
	
	
	The complainant left the room and went to sleep in one of the Applicant’s children's rooms. She was followed by the Applicant who asked her, in an abrupt way, if she wanted to have sex again. The complainant told him to go away, which he did.
	
	
	The next day the co-offender said to the complainant (the Applicant was not present), “Would you like to do it again?” to which the complainant replied, “Don’t ever mention it to me again”. The Sentencing Judge said that this highlighted the distress that the complainant had suffered and was suffering at that time.
	
	
	On 14 March 2011 the complainant made complaint to her mother and to the police.
	


Remarks on sentence


	
	His Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the matter at the highest end of the range for such offences. By reason of the submissions made on behalf of the Applicant in respect of ground 1 it is necessary to set out exactly what his Honour said in that regard. He said:
	


In terms of the objective seriousness of this matter, the court is of the view that this must be at the highest end of the range for such offences. Section 66C(4) carries a maximum term of 12 years imprisonment. It is a statutory offence which mirrors other sexual matters where the complainant/victims are of different age, that is under 14 years. In those involving victims of a younger age, there is an increased penalty.

It should be borne in mind that in respect of the offence of aggravated indecent assault, section 66M(2) [scil. 61M(2)] of the Crimes Act, that particular offence carries a maximum sentence of ten years and parliament has recommended that there be a standard non-parole period of eight years. There is no such standard non-parole period here.

In respect of this matter there were, in the court's finding, a number of actions by this offender that amounted to indecent assaults, for which he was not charged, those matters being part of the overall criminal offending which involved penile vaginal sex.

The authorities, of which there are relatively few, have involved ordinarily cases where the offender is well known to the child. Often they are matters involving the step-father and/or another male person with a young female where there is a degree of affection which results in sexual behaviour between the victim and the person involved. Cases such as EIP v R [2011] NSWCCA 224 are matters involving that sort of case and what, in the finding of this court, severs this case or differentiates this case from that case is that this was a matter which involved a threat to the complainant initially, where the behaviour continued for a lengthy period of time, notwithstanding it was part of the one overall event and it was done in terms of what might be seen by a reasonable member of the public in circumstances of perversion, that is of two adults having or one of their number having sex with a minor, involving fellatio and other acts during the time that the incident occurred.


	
	His Honour then went on to consider the subjective circumstances of the Applicant. His Honour noted that he was then aged 29, that he was in a de facto relationship with the co-offender and that they had three children together. The Applicant was employed and had no prior criminal record.
	
	
	His Honour referred to a pre-sentence report from Ms Lauren Sanders which recorded that the Applicant said that he was unable to recall what had occurred on the day in question because of his intoxication. He blamed his behaviour on his consumption of alcohol. His Honour did not accept that explanation. In that regard his Honour drew attention to the planning that was involved in the text message.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge found that the Applicant did not have any understanding of his actions and the damage it had caused to the complainant. His Honour noted the terms of the Victim Impact Statement from the complainant.
	
	
	By reason of the Applicant having no criminal record, having work experience, his relationship with his wife and children, and that he was previously well thought of by others, his Honour found special circumstances.
	
	
	His Honour found as a result of Ms Sanders’ report that the Applicant was at low to moderate risk of offending. However, his Honour was unable to assess whether or not the incident was what might be described as a “once only” matter.
	
	
	His Honour found that there was a need for general deterrence as well as specific deterrence.
	
	
	Finally, his Honour noted that the evidence showed that the Applicant suffered from no disability nor any intellectual or psychological defect that could give any explanation for his offending behaviour. That left his Honour with the view that what was done was done purely for his sexual gratification.
	


Ground 1:   Objective seriousness


	
	The Applicant submitted that in assessing objective seriousness the Sentencing Judge took into account irrelevant considerations. These considerations were the uncharged offences of aggravated indecent assault and the taking into account of a more serious offence of aggravated sexual assault contrary to the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that the offence under s 66C(4) does not include an element of lack of consent or knowledge that the complainant was not consenting. If an offence under that section is committed in circumstances of lack of consent and knowledge that the complainant is not consenting it gives rise to the more serious offence under s 61J where the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment. The Applicant submitted that by his Honour finding the Applicant had committed offences of aggravated indecent assault it was implicit that he considered that the complainant was not consenting and that the acts occurred in circumstances where the Applicant knew she was not consenting. Similarly, the Applicant submitted that his Honour found that the fondling occurred in circumstances where the Judge found that the complainant was not consenting and the Applicant knew she was not consenting.
	
	
	The Applicant pointed to the fact that the Sentencing Judge referred to how the complainant was in fear for herself and what was happening to her. The Sentencing Judge also said that the offence involved a threat initially to her.
	
	
	From these matters it was submitted that the Sentencing Judge was dealing with the sexual intercourse on the basis of a more serious offence under s 61J. In that way the assessment of objective seriousness was arrived at erroneously.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Sentencing Judge’s reference to the indecent assaults was relevant to how the offence was committed in company. By referring to the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period for the offence of indecent assault, the Sentencing Judge was explaining the seriousness of some of the other sexual activity.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Sentencing Judge did not expressly find that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse with the Applicant although his Honour erroneously included that the complainant showed her reluctance to engage in sexual activity with the co-offender. This was the matter referred to at [11] above. The Crown submitted that when the Sentencing Judge determined the objective seriousness at the highest end his Honour said that the initial threat to the complainant amongst other factors differentiated the case from one where there was a “degree of affection” between an offender and a complainant.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that if the totality of the remarks by the Sentencing Judge meant that, in effect, he concluded that the complainant was not consenting, his Honour was entitled to rely on that conclusion so long as his Honour did not also make a finding that the Applicant knew the complainant was not consenting in terms of s 61HA(3) of the Crimes Act. Reference was made to Hogan v R [2008] NSWCCA 150.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that had his Honour sentenced the Applicant for an offence contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act the starting point would have been much higher than a term of six years and six months, his Honour’s starting point for the sentence he imposed. Not the least reason for that was that the standard non-parole period for an offence under s 61J is ten years.
	
	
	In Bakewell v R (Court of Criminal Appeal, 27 June 1996, unrep.) the applicant had been charged with an offence under s 61J arising out of sexual intercourse he had engaged in with a 13 year old girl. An arrangement appeared to have been reached and the charge under s 61J was withdrawn with the applicant pleading guilty to an offence under s 66C. The applicant submitted on the appeal that the sentencing judge fell into error by taking into account as an aggravating feature of the s 66C offence the fact that the complainant was not consenting to intercourse and that the intercourse occurred in circumstances of the use of force.
	
	
	The sentencing judge based his remarks and findings on the content of a statement of the complainant, the content of which was not in dispute. The transcript at the sentencing hearing disclosed that the sentencing judge was alerted to the fact that the applicant was charged with the lesser offence under s 66C and that the element of consent was immaterial.
	
	
	Justice Studdert (with whom Gleeson CJ and McInerney J agreed) said (at p.7):
	


His Honour’s task was a difficult one requiring considerable care not to take into account material that converted the offence charged with (sic) the more serious one under s 61J. That the Judge recited the facts such as would have supported the more serious offence does not necessarily constitute error, and indeed it seems to me that it was proper that he should recite the facts correctly. It does not follow from such recital that his Honour sentenced the applicant by reference to the additional elements of the aggravated offence contemplated by s 61J. The Judge did not say he was taking into account, in fixing a sentence, those aggravating elements.


	
	Ultimately, the appeal in that case was upheld only because the sentencing judge had placed before him a psychological appraisal of the complainant that assessed her on the basis that the intercourse had not been consensual.
	
	
	In Hogan v R the appellant appealed (inter alia) against the sentence imposed on him in respect of his conviction of an offence contrary to s 66C. One ground of appeal was that the trial judge erred in sentencing the appellant by taking into account the complainant’s lack of consent as being relevant to sentencing in circumstances where, by doing so, that factor would have rendered him liable for a more serious offence contrary to the principles in De Simoni.
	
	
	The sentencing judge in that case said in her remarks on sentence:
	


A submission was made by Mr Hancock, [the appellant’s] counsel, that I ought not take into account in considering the factual circumstances and the objective seriousness of this offence because consent is not an element of this offence. But I think that the factual circumstances of the offence, particularly given the range of offences which can be covered by this offence can be taken into account. For example this offence could cover a situation where two teenagers close in age had consensual sexual intercourse. And I think that that situation is to be distinguished from the situation here which was that [TD] was fourteen years old, [the appellant] was, at that stage, twenty-nine years old, she was affected by alcohol and she was not a willing participant in the act which occurred.


	
	The appellant in that case contended that by taking the complainant’s lack of consent into account the court was in effect sentencing him for an offence against s 61J.
	
	
	Justice Beazley (with whom Johnson and McCallum JJ agreed) said:
	


[77]   In my opinion, her Honour has not offended the principle stated in De Simoni. In the first place, she was conscious that consent was not an element of the offence. Indeed, that had been a matter of submission to her Honour. Rather, it is apparent that her Honour considered the question of whether or not TD was a willing participant was relevant, having regard to the wide range of offences that may be covered by the section. It is also apparent that her Honour’s reference to TD not being a “willing participant” was made so as to gauge the relative seriousness of the offence in this case, as against other offences which might be charged under the section.


	
	In the present matter the Sentencing Judge made two and possibly three references to matters that related to the complainant’s lack of consent to the sexual activity described. One was the threat initially made by the Applicant to the complainant set out at [10] above. The second finding is set out in the first sentence in [13] above.
	
	
	The third is arguably what appears at [11] above. The Sentencing Judge summarised this aspect of the matter in this way:
	


In the bedroom the offender took off the complainant's clothing and there was what might be described as fondling initially and during the initial fondling, which would have amounted to an indecent assault, the complainant said the word ""No"".


	
	The statement in the Agreed Facts is set out at [11] above. The Applicant submitted that his Honour correctly understood the Agreed Facts as saying that it was the complainant who said “no”. That was supported from the surrounding facts which showed that the co-offender continued to participate in the sexual activity.
	
	
	I accept that the Agreed Facts are somewhat ambiguous, but it is not necessary to reach a final view on who said “no” to the Applicant. I do not consider the finding by the Sentencing Judge, if properly made, advances the submissions of the Applicant that his Honour has assessed the objective seriousness for some offence other than the one charged. Even if all of those references disclose that the complainant was not consenting to what took place, I do not consider that error has been shown by the Sentencing Judge’s references to those matters. The matter is not distinguishable from the way the sentencing judges had dealt with the matter in Bakewell and Hogan.
	
	
	It was necessary for the Sentencing Judge to set out all of the details surrounding the offending so that a proper assessment of the objective seriousness could be made. There were two acts of penile/vaginal intercourse and one act of digital/vaginal intercourse. There was no particularisation of which act constituted the offence. Whether the complainant was a willing participant, notwithstanding her age, was relevant, as Hogan makes clear, to the level of objective seriousness.
	
	
	A reading of the Remarks on Sentence as a whole leaves me in no doubt that the Sentencing Judge was aware that he was sentencing in respect of an offence against s 66C and not an offence either contrary to s 61J or s 61M. His Honour contrasted offences under s 66C with the offence of aggravated indecent assault under s 61M. He referred to the different maximum penalty and to the fact that the offence under s 61M carried a standard non-parole period of eight years whereas there was no such standard non-parole period under s 66C. His Honour made reference also to the fact that a number of the actions of the Applicant amounted to indecent assaults “for which he was not charged”. However, his Honour understood those matters as being part of the overall criminal offending.
	
	
	Nowhere does his Honour say or imply that the surrounding facts elevated the offence to one contrary to s 61J or s 61M. His Honour was, however, entitled and required to have regard to them for assessing the objective seriousness of the offending against s 66C.
	
	
	Had his Honour been sentencing under s 61J, as the Applicant submitted, it would have been necessary for his Honour to identify not only a lack of consent on the part of the Complainant but also knowledge on the part of the Applicant that the Complainant was not consenting. The Applicant submitted that his Honour went further than finding no consent and found that the Applicant must have known the complainant was not consenting. The Agreed Facts are silent about the matter. His Honour does not say anything about the Applicant’s knowledge or belief in that regard despite mentioning the matters relating to the Complainant’s lack of consent.
	
	
	Further, I accept the Crown’s submission that if his Honour had in fact been sentencing for an offence against s 61J a starting point of six years and six months for the whole sentence in the face of a standard non-parole period of ten years, even on a plea of guilty, would have needed some justification in the Remarks.
	
	
	In my opinion, this ground is not made out.
	


Ground 2:   The non-parole period


	
	The Sentencing Judge said that in his view the matter should carry a head sentence of six years and six months. From that period he discounted the sentence by 10% for a late plea of guilty which left the sentence at five years, ten months and six days. His Honour made a finding of special circumstances because the Applicant was a person with no record, had work experience, was in a relationship with his partner to whom he had children and was previously thought of well by others.
	
	
	His Honour then said:
	


Having found special circumstances, there is to be a non-parole period of four years and six months.


	
	Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) provides that the balance of the term of a sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period unless the court decides that there are special circumstances. The non-parole period in the present case was 77% leaving the balance of the term at 23%.
	
	
	It seems clear that this was an error by the Sentencing Judge. As the Crown submitted, it could reasonably be expected that if his Honour had intended to shorten the balance of term when compared to the standard ratio period he would have explained why he had done so: R v Lupton [2003] NSWCCA 200 and R v So [2004] NSWCCA 362. It is clear that his Honour intended to provide for a longer parole period. The Crown accepted that this was so.
	
	
	I would uphold ground 2.
	


Re-sentence


	
	In the circumstances, this Court is required to exercise its independent sentencing discretion when it re-sentences the Applicant: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [43].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was nothing in the available material to justify any adjustment to the non-parole period. However, the Crown conceded at the sentencing proceedings that it could not disagree with the finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The Applicant pointed to a number of matters including the fact that this was the Applicant’s first time in custody, that there was a need for an extended period on parole to assist his rehabilitation for problems associated with alcohol, and because he was said to be on protection in custody because of the nature of the offence charged. The Applicant relied on the combination of these matters.
	
	
	The only evidence concerning the custodial arrangements for the Applicant was contained in an affidavit tendered at the hearing of the appeal by the Solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions. That affidavit annexed a letter from the Manager of Security at Kirkconnell Correctional Centre where the Applicant is held. The letter disclosed that the Applicant was housed in the compound area of the Correctional Centre in unit style accommodation mixing with the rest of the population. He was enrolled to do certain courses in the Correctional Centre. There was nothing to indicate any restrictions as a result of the custodial arrangements.
	
	
	In my opinion, the highest special circumstances can be put is that this is the Applicant’s first time in custody and the pre-sentence report lists as one of his criminogenic needs, alcohol/drug problems. The report went on to say that the Applicant would benefit from a period of supervision by Community Corrections including referral for sex offender related programs and treatment, and referral for alcohol related counselling/programs and/or treatment.
	
	
	In the event that only ground 2 was upheld, the Applicant did not contend that there should be any variation to the head sentence. In my opinion, an appropriate adjustment of the statutory ratio is to provide for a non-parole period of four years and one month being 70% of the overall sentence.
	
	
	Finally, it is necessary to say something about the selection by the Sentencing Judge of an overall sentence that referred to a period of six days in addition to the years and months specified. This Court has said more than once that it is inappropriate to provide for a sentence in that form. Where the application of some discount produces such a result the sentence should ordinarily be rounded up or down to the nearest month as is appropriate.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal granted.

(2)   Appeal upheld.

(3)   Quash the sentence imposed by Judge Maiden in the District Court on 7 March 2014. In lieu thereof sentence the Appellant to a non-parole period of four years and one month commencing 22 July 2013 and expiring 21 August 2017 with an additional term of one year nine months expiring 21 May 2019.

2768928,R v Brown [2016] NSWSC 176,"Judgment


	
	On 29 July 2015 Brian McGarvie Brown (the Applicant) was arraigned on an indictment together with his co-accused Wade Basanovic and Michael Basanovic on two counts as follows:
	


1.   On 15 January 2013 at Wetherill Park in the State of New South Wales did murder Zeljko Mitrovic;

2.   On 15 January 2013 at Wetherill Park in the State of New South Wales caused grievous bodily harm to Michael Bell with intent to cause    grievous bodily harm.


	
	The Applicant, along with the co-accused, entered a plea of not guilty to each count on the indictment.
	
	
	A jury was duly empanelled but was later discharged that day through no fault of the Applicant. I granted a certificate pursuant to s 6A(1)(c) of the Suitors Fund Act 1951 (NSW) in relation to the discharge of that jury.
	
	
	On 4 August 2015 the Applicant and the co-accused were again arraigned and again entered pleas of not guilty to each count on the indictment. A jury was then empanelled and the trial commenced on that day.
	
	
	In the Crown prosecutor’s opening to the jury it was put against the Applicant that he was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased and was similarly liable for the offence in relation to Michael Bell. The Crown case relied particularly on the presence of the Applicant at the shooting of the deceased and Michael Bell by Wade Basanovic.
	
	
	After the Crown closed its case both co-accused, Wade Basanovic and Michael Basanovic gave evidence. Their evidence did not support the Crown case against the Applicant.
	
	
	On 24 August 2015 Mr Terracini SC for the Applicant applied for a direction that the jury acquit the Applicant on each offence charged on the basis that there was no case to answer against his client. On 25 August 2015 I directed the jury that they should find the Applicant not guilty on both counts charged. My reasons for doing so appear in R v Basanovic and ors (No. 5) [2015] NSWSC 1197. At the time Mr Terracini immediately indicated a possible costs application. That application was subsequently formally made after the conclusion of the trial of the co-accused.
	
	
	The relevant provisions of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW) are as follows:
	


2 Certificate may be granted

(1)   The Court or Judge or Magistrate in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may:

(a)   where, after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, a defendant is acquitted or discharged in relation to the offence concerned, or a direction is given by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further proceedings be taken, or

(b)   where, on appeal, the conviction of the defendant is quashed and:

(i)   the defendant is discharged as to the indictment upon which he or she was convicted, or

(ii)   the information or complaint upon which the defendant was convicted is dismissed,

grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings.

(2)   For the avoidance of doubt, a certificate may be granted in accordance with subsection (1) (a) following an acquittal or discharge of a defendant at any time during a trial, whether a hearing on the merits of the proceedings has occurred or not.

(3) …

3 Form of certificate

(1)   A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate:

(a)   if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and

(b)   that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.

(2)   (Repealed)

3A Evidence of further relevant facts may be adduced

(1)   For the purpose of determining whether or not to grant a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the reference in section 3 (1) (a) to all the relevant facts is a reference to:

(a)   the relevant facts established in the proceedings, and

(b)   any relevant facts that the defendant has, on the application for the certificate, established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate, and

(c)   any relevant facts that the prosecutor, or in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, has established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate that:

(i)   relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made, and

(ii)   were not adduced in the proceedings.

(2)   Where, on an application for a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the defendant adduces evidence to establish further relevant facts that were not established in those proceedings, the Court or Judge or Magistrate to which or to whom the application is made may:

(a)   order that leave be given to the prosecutor in those proceedings or, in the absence of the prosecutor, to any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, to comment on the evidence of those further relevant facts, and

(b)   if the Court, Judge or Magistrate think it desirable to do so after taking into consideration any such comments, order that leave be given to the prosecutor or to the person representing the Minister to examine any witness giving evidence for the applicant or to adduce evidence tending to show why the certificate applied for should not be granted and adjourn the application so that that evidence may be adduced.

(3)   If, in response to an application for a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the prosecutor or, in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application adduces evidence to establish further relevant facts that were not established in those proceedings, the Court or Judge or Magistrate to which or to whom the application is made may:

(a)   order that leave be given to the defendant to comment on the evidence of those relevant facts, and

(b)   if the Court or Judge or Magistrate think it desirable to do so after taking into consideration any of those comments, order that leave be given to the defendant to examine any witness giving evidence for the prosecutor or that authorised person.


	
	The Applicant accepted that the onus is on him to establish that in light of the evidence now available it would not be reasonable to institute proceedings and that he has not unreasonably contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that there were no prospects of a conviction on the available evidence at the outset of the trial or at least by the conclusion of the trial. There was a lack of evidence in the Crown case that the Applicant was a party to a joint criminal enterprise in relation to the shooting of the deceased and the other victim. The Applicant submitted that there was no evidence before the Court to establish any act or omission by him that contributed or might have contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings and that was unreasonable in the circumstances.
	
	
	Mr Terracini submitted, and the Crown did not dispute, that the case is a stronger one for costs because Mr Brown’s verdict was a directed one. Although, as Mr Terracini accepted, that does not necessarily result in a conclusion that it was not reasonable for the prosecution to institute the proceedings, he submitted that in this case such a conclusion was justified.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that as there was no evidence given by the Applicant at the trial and he exercised his right to silence at the time of his arrest there was no basis to suggest that the Applicant would or could have given an exculpatory account of his involvement in the matter. As a result s 3(1)(b) of the Act had no role to play in the consideration of the matter.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the relevant facts for the application under s 3(1)(a) were the relevant facts established in the proceedings.
	
	
	The Crown noted the reliance by the Applicant on what was said in Mordaunt v Director of Public Prosecutions [2007] NSWCA 121 and noted the somewhat different approach taken in AB v Director of Public Prosecutions [2014] NSWCA 122 by Basten JA at [11] and Sackville AJA at [62].
	
	
	In Nadilo v DPP (1995) 35 NSWLR 738 Kirby P said (at 743):
	


The Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (the Act) is reforming legislation with a beneficial purpose designed to confer valuable privileges upon persons who succeed in criminal prosecutions. The Act overcomes the normal rule that, by the Royal Prerogative and by the common law, the Crown neither seeks nor pays costs in criminal proceedings: see Attorney-General of Queensland v Holland (1912) 15 CLR 46 at 49; Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 556; Ex parte Hivis; Re Michaelis (1933) 50 WN (NSW) 90 at 92; Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472 at 479.

The Act should therefore be given a beneficial construction. Its provisions should not be narrowly construed so as to defeat the achievement of the Act's general purposes. But those purposes must be derived (in circumstances of disputed interpretation) from the words in which parliament has expressed itself.


	
	When considering s 3(1)(a) of the Act Hidden J in R v Cardona [2002] NSWSC 823 said at [3]:
	


… A helpful summary of authorities on the approach to that question is to be found in the judgment of Simpson J in R v Hatfield [2001] NSWSC 334 at paras 8-11. Although reference was made in submissions to material in the possession of the Crown prior to the trial, it is sufficient for present purposes to consider whether it would not have been reasonable for the prosecution to have instituted the proceedings in the light of the evidence as it emerged at the trial. As Hunt J (as he then was) put it in R v Dunne (unreported, 17 May 1990), I must “put myself in the hypothetical place of the prosecution possessed of knowledge of all the facts which have now become apparent”, examining the matter “with the knowledge gained from such an omniscient crystal ball …” (at p 3). It follows that the grant of a certificate would involve no reflection upon the conduct of those having responsibility for the prosecution.


	
	In addition, a useful summary of the principles and of the approach of courts in earlier applications is to be found in the judgment of McColl JA (Beazley and Hodgson JJA agreeing) in Mordaunt notwithstanding the doubt cast on them by Basten JA in AB at [11], a doubt apparently not shared by the other members of the Court in AB.
	
	
	Relevantly for the present application I note especially what McColl JA said at [36(e)] requiring the judicial officer to find what are all the relevant facts, and what was said at [36(k)] that the fact that a court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction is not necessarily indicative of unreasonableness.
	
	
	The Crown has not sought to adduce any further evidence on the application and accepts that the relevant facts for the application are the facts established in the proceedings. Further, the Crown points out that omitted from my judgment, where I gave reasons for directing the jury to acquit the Applicant, was the fact that the co-offender Michael Basanovic paid for the Applicant (as well as Wade Basanovic) to leave the country on the morning after the shooting.
	
	
	I otherwise set out both the evidence adduced by the Crown and evidence given by the co-offenders at [6] - [11] of my judgment. Although in that material I noted that the Applicant left the country the next day by buying a one-way air ticket to Chile, I accept that it was Michael Basanovic who provided the funds for that air ticket.
	
	
	It is necessary to have regard to what emerged during the evidence of the co-offenders in addition to what the Crown knew when the proceedings against the Applicant were instituted. The Crown made the further submission that because the co-offenders were convicted it is clear that their evidence was not accepted as a truthful account by the jury. So much may be accepted, but the non-acceptance of their evidence does not result in a conclusion that Mr Brown was somehow involved in the enterprise in respect of which they were convicted. Nor is it easy to isolate matters that the jury must have disbelieved to have convicted. It is reasonable, however, to infer that, contrary to the evidence of the co-offenders, Michael Basanovic must have known that Wade took the gun to the deceased’s premises.
	
	
	In my opinion, the Applicant demonstrates that if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, all of the evidence that emerged at the trial it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings. My principal basis for that conclusion is to be found in the reasons I provided in Basanovic (No 5) at [12] to [14]. The evidence went only as high as showing that there was an agreement for Mr Brown to go to the premises with the co-accused. There was nothing at all to show what the purpose was for the meeting with the deceased. There was no evidence to show that the Applicant knew that either of the co-accused owned a gun nor that Wade Basanovic was carrying it into the meeting.
	
	
	If the jury accepted Wade’s evidence that in the car after the shooting the Applicant said, “What the fuck was that?”, that remark pointed to ignorance on the Applicant’s part of the enterprise which the jury found existed between Wade and Michael Basanovic. Nor can the payment by Michael of Wade’s airfare to South America be seen as other than neutral. It is consistent with Michael Basanovic ensuring both Wade and the Applicant were away from either or both of the deceased’s compatriots in the Hells Angels and the authorities, given that the Applicant was present at the killing.
	
	
	This conclusion of unreasonableness should not be seen, as Hidden J said in Cardona, as any reflection on the conduct of those responsible for the prosecution.
	
	
	I agree with the Crown’s submission that the exercise of his right to silence provides no basis for suggesting that the Applicant would or could have given an exculpatory account of his involvement. Section 3(1)(b) has no real relevance to the present consideration. If the exercise of his right of silence contributed to the institution or continuance of the proceedings, such exercise must be regarded as reasonable.
	
	
	Submissions were made concerning s 42 of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1979 (NSW) which provides:
	


Discretion of court or tribunal as to costs

A court or tribunal which may order the payment of costs in proceedings before it shall, where a legally assisted person is a party to any such proceedings, make an order as to costs in respect of the legally assisted person as if he or she were not a legally assisted person.


	
	Mr Terracini directed my attention to Australian Postal Commission v Dao (No 2) (Court of Appeal, 29 October 1986, Unrep), Richards v Kadian (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 373 and Polley v Johnson (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1301 as demonstrating that despite Mr Brown being on legal aid, the costs are to be assessed on a commercial basis. That is not an issue for my determination. If I am satisfied of the matters in s 3 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act the matter then becomes one for decision by the Director-General of the Attorney-General’s department. It is at that point that s 42 is relevant.
	
	
	For the reasons earlier expressed I grant a certificate pursuant to s 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW) as follows:
	


Whereas at the Supreme Court of New South Wales at Sydney on 25 August 2015, Brian BROWN appeared in respect of a charge of murder and in respect of a charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

And whereas on 25 August 2015, Brian BROWN was acquitted of each offence charged.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967, I grant to the said Brian BROWN this certificate relating to the above mentioned charges.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 3 of the Act, I certify, for the reasons given on 7 March 2016 that in my opinion:

a)   if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted been in the possession of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings; and

b)   that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.

I certify that I made no order for costs against the informant, prosecutor or complainant.

		08 March 2016",2016-03-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768929,Bajouri v R [2016] NSWCCA 20,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The Applicant was charged with one count of having intentionally caused grievous bodily harm (s 33(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) and one count of common assault (s 61) arising out of an incident at the Collingwood Hotel, Liverpool on the evening of 23 May 2012. He was committed to the District Court at Campbelltown for trial and pleaded guilty to both counts on the day fixed for commencement of the trial, 28 April 2014.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence against s 33(1)(b) is 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The maximum penalty under s 61 is 2 years imprisonment. On 14 October 2014 his Honour Judge Haesler SC imposed, for the s 33(1)(b) offence, a non-parole period of 5 years with a balance of term of 3 years. For the common assault a fixed term of 3 months was imposed, to be served concurrently.
	
	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence for the more serious charge on the following grounds:
	


“1    His Honour erred in finding the principal offence aggravated in accordance with s 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) in circumstances where the only material supporting such a finding was the Victim Impact Statement of Mr Sermatovsky (sic).

2    A miscarriage of justice has arisen in the absence of fresh evidence, now available to the Applicant.”

The facts of the offence


	
	The victim, Mr George Sermetovski, purchased a drink from a bar in the poker machine area of the Collingwood Hotel at about 11pm on Wednesday 23 May 2012. At that time the Applicant, Ahmad Bajouri, and three friends, Abdul Hamze, Fadi Arnaout and Mohammad Masri, were in that area. All four were apparently well affected by alcohol. Belligerent remarks were made, by one of the Applicant’s associates, gratuitously to Mr Sermetovski. Subsequently Masri attacked Mr Sermetovski and pulled him to the ground. This caused one of the hotel staff to request the aid of an off-duty security guard, Mr Fonua, to intervene. Mr Fonua came into the poker machine area from the pool room and asked the Applicant and his associates to remain calm.
	
	
	Mr Sermetovski and Mr Fonua then retired from the poker machine area to the pool room. The Applicant and his associates followed them about two minutes later. Mr Fonua stood between Mr Sermetovski and the four aggressors as the latter shouted at him to “bring him outside”. Mr Fonua left the pool room and went outside. He assessed that unless he did so a fight would inevitably ensue in the pool room. The Applicant, his three associates and Mr Sermetovski also exited the pool room.
	
	
	Outside the hotel the Applicant assumed a fighting stance against Mr Fonua. The latter raised his fists defensively. The Applicant kicked Mr Fonua in the right leg three times, for which the common assault charge was laid. Mr Sermetovski was present during this as an onlooker. At 11:16pm as Mr Sermetovski stood with his arms folded in front of him looking at Mr Fonua and with his head turned away from the Applicant, the latter moved next to Mr Sermetovski and without warning punched him once to the middle of his face.
	
	
	The punch caused Mr Sermetovski to fall to the ground. He did not move again during the further assaults upon him, which followed. After felling Mr Sermetovski the Applicant “jumped towards Mr Fonua” then walked close to the left side of the victim, who was lying on his back either unconscious or stunned, and stomped on his face. Hamze pushed the Applicant away from the victim towards the Hume Highway. Shortly afterwards the Applicant and his associates left the hotel in a vehicle driven by Arnaout. In the period immediately before the Applicant’s first assault upon Mr Sermetovski his associates, in particular Hamze and Arnaout, had attempted unsuccessfully to calm the Applicant down. This occurred both inside and outside the hotel.
	
	
	Using a witness’s identification of the number plate of the vehicle in which the Applicant and his associates had left the scene, police were able to arrest Hamze and Arnaout the next day. They were released without charge. The Applicant then surrendered himself to police at Liverpool Station at 11:20pm on 24 May 2012, accompanied to the station by Hamze and Arnaout. When interviewed by police and also on later occasions the Applicant has acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily before the incident. He claimed not to recall how much alcohol he had consumed but said that he was told by his father-in-law he had drunk an entire 700 mL bottle of scotch whiskey. He later informed his psychologist that he had consumed a further 7 drinks at the Collingwood Hotel.
	


The victim’s injuries


	
	Mr Sermetovski’s injuries, for which he was treated as an inpatient at Liverpool Hospital over 12 days included the following (as set out in the statement of agreed facts which was before the sentencing judge):
	


“● A fracture of the skull with an overlying scalp haematoma and a small amount of bleeding inside the skull (a small extra axial haemorrhage) – all situated at the back of the head.

● A fracture of the right orbit (eye socket) including the orbital floor (lower side), medial (nose) and lateral (ear) side walls.

● Comminuted (fragmented) fracture of the orbital process of the right zygomatic bone with displacement medially (nasally) into the orbit.

● Right zygomatic arch fracture.

● Left superior orbital fracture with extension of fluid (blood) into the left frontal (forehead) sinus, fractures of the inferior (lower side) and medial (nose side) orbital walls with a depressed fragment within the medial wall.

● Bilateral multiple fractures of the maxillary bones (cheekbones).

● Bilateral comminuted fracture of the medial and lateral pterygoid plates (situated behind the cheekbones).

● Bilateral comminuted fractures of the nasal bones and fracture of the nasal septum (the bone in the mid line of the nose).

● A left comminuted fracture of the clavicle.”


	
	In short, numerous of Mr Sermetovski’s facial bones were fractured. His face was smashed, consistently with the Applicant having stomped upon it with considerable force whilst Mr Sermetovski lay face upwards. Some of the fractures required internal fixation with a plate and screws. These will remain in place permanently. For some of the other fractures arch bars had to be fitted for a period of 8 weeks. The procedures for repair to the victim’s face were restricted to his jaw movements so that he was confined to a liquid diet for 6 weeks after admission to hospital.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge had before him a Victim Impact Statement, dated 2 October 2014, which contained the following significant points:
	



	
	Mr Sermetovski was extremely distressed when he regained consciousness in hospital by the extent to which his face had been disfigured by the injuries and by the shock that his family experienced seeing him in that condition.
	
	
	He struggled to breathe in the early stages of his recovery and suffered excruciating pain for 13 days until major facial surgery could be undertaken.
	
	
	Mr Sermetovski was unable to return to work for several months. He spent most of that period at home indoors and suffered depression, anxiety and a sense of insecurity which discouraged him from venturing out of his home. He lost around 20 kilograms of body weight during this period, whilst bedridden.
	
	
	During the recovery period Mr Sermetovski’s family supported him financially (as he was unable to work) and physically (as he could not care for himself or run errands as an independent adult).
	
	
	Prior to the assault Mr Sermetovski had been an eager sportsman who had actively enjoyed outdoor activities in company with friends. As at 2 October 2014 “it is still taking me time to return to doing these things that I used to love. Many of the activities that I once did with ease I am still unable to do at my full capacity due to my injuries”.
	
	
	The home that Mr Sermetovski had lived in with his family for the preceding 25 years was close to the location of the assault. He and his family relocated because of the fears and disturbed memories which were associated with the incident.
	
	
	Mr Sermetovski’s business was adversely affected because of his inability to attend to clients’ requirements during the recovery period.
	
	
	Mr Sermetovski was still, as at 2 October 2014, experiencing flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety attacks and depression which he attributes to the attack on himself. He also suffers regular headaches and has memory loss, pain around his head and face, extreme pain and sensitivity around the jaw and teeth, blackouts, dizziness, nausea and difficulty breathing through his nose. He expects to require further surgery.
	



	
	The Applicant weighed 130 kilograms at the time of the assault. With this weight behind the stomping on the victim’s face it is not surprising that such severe and extensive damage to the facial bones was inflicted.
	


Applicant’s background


	
	The Applicant was born 4 May 1982. He is now married with three children (born in 2010, 2012 and 2014). At the date of the offence he was 30 years old. He migrated to Australia from Lebanon as a very young child with his parents, in 1984. The Applicant is the seventh child in a family of 11.
	
	
	At 15 years of age he secured a football scholarship to attend St Gregory’s College at Campbelltown. He completed his HSC there. He was an average student but excelled at Rugby League, playing both for his school and for Wests Juniors.
	
	
	After leaving school in about 2001 the Applicant played first grade Rugby League for Wests Tigers for 12 months and then obtained a contract with the South Sydney Club for 2 years. He played for 1 year of this contract, 2003, during which time he purchased a home. However on 17 February 2004 the Applicant was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident which ended his Rugby League career. This in turn forced him to sell his home and to move back to live with his mother.
	
	
	The injury sustained on 17 February 2004 was whiplash which caused significant soft tissue damage to his cervical spine. He suffered protrusion of the discs at the C5/6 and C5/7 levels resulting in chronic neck pain, headaches, numbness in the arms (presumably from nerve root compression or irritation at the cervical spine) and other neurological symptoms. A May 2007 MRI scan of his neck showed multi-level degenerative changes in the cervical discs resulting in narrowing of the spinal canal, to varying degrees, through the cervical vertebra.
	
	
	Prior to the motor accident on 17 February 2004 the Applicant was an elite athlete at 93 kilograms body weight. Following that event he suffered chronic pain and his physical activities were severely curtailed. He lost condition and gained weight. He also lost self-esteem and suffered intermittent depressed mood. The Applicant commenced to abuse alcohol from about early 2005. However, as at 5 September 2005 Dr Parmagiani, psychiatrist, did not consider him to be depressed. The doctor found him to be a “psychologically resilient individual” but thought it would take him 2 – 3 years to adapt psychologically to the loss of his physical capabilities.
	


Criminal history 2005 – 2008


	
	On 12 March 2005 at age 22 years the Applicant committed offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault, destroying property, refusing to quit a registered club and affray. The relevant events followed him being required by staff of the Mount Pritchard Community Club to leave. The Applicant, in company with two associates, assaulted security staff by punching and kicking. The Applicant punched no less than three security guards in the face or head, with multiple blows in the case of two of the victims. The Applicant and his associates were part of a large group of 12 – 15 men who then threw bricks, rocks and other items at the security staff until police arrived, at which time the assailants fled.
	
	
	On conviction in July 2005 the Applicant was dealt with extremely leniently, with fines and a bond of 2 years which required him not to drink alcohol to excess. He gave evidence in the sentence proceedings for the present charges to the effect that he did not consider he had an alcohol problem in March 2005. He did not take any alcohol counselling. Nor, apparently, did he observe the term of his bond that he should not drink to excess.
	
	
	On 17 February 2006, aged 23 years, the Applicant committed offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault at the Guildford Leagues Club. The Applicant and his associates were asked to leave the premises on account of unruly behaviour. Whilst being escorted towards the foyer by a member of the Club Staff the Applicant pinned the staff member against a poker machine and punched him in the face. The Applicant and his associates then together attacked this man. The Applicant kneed him in the head and after he had fallen to the ground continued to knee and punch him. After two other staff members came to the aid of the first, the Applicant punched all three of them to the face or head with sufficient force, in the case of two of them, to knock them to the ground. Again considerable (we would suggest quite possibly excessive) lenience was shown for these vicious attacks on Club employees performing their duties. Suspended sentences of 6 months were imposed on each charge with bonds requiring psychiatric guidance to be followed, medication to be taken and rehabilitation to be sought.
	
	
	On 13 April 2008 at aged 25 years the Applicant committed further offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault and failing to quit licensed premises. He attended PJ Gallagher’s Hotel in Parramatta with three friends. Having made a sexual advance to a female staff member after pestering her for her phone number and for information as to the time she would finish work, the Applicant was asked to leave. A male staff member directed the Applicant to the exit. The Applicant, well affected by alcohol, punched the staff member in the face without warning. Suspended sentences of 6 months with bonds were again imposed.
	


Applicant’s further medical and accident history 2008 – 2010


	
	By November 2007 the Applicant suffered psychological symptoms which were subsequently diagnosed (by Dr Berecry, psychiatrist, who commenced treating him from 19 February 2008) as severe depression. He complained of panic attacks from that date occurring initially two to three times per week but diminishing to a frequency of weekly by mid-2008.
	
	
	By July 2008, in consultation with Dr Berecry the Applicant acknowledged an awareness that “alcohol tends to potentiate his underlying grief and anger at his losses because of” the first motor vehicle accident.
	
	
	On 12 August 2008 the Applicant underwent surgery on his cervical spine at the C6/7 level. According to a report of Dr Abraszco, a Neurosurgeon and Spinal Surgeon, dated 21 January 2013, the Applicant has said that his operation on 12 August 2008 was successful and eliminated all significant neck pain. He was able to return to work but not to playing rugby league.
	
	
	He was injured in a further motor vehicle accident on 13 May 2010 which, according to Dr Abraszco, increased the size of a disc protrusion at the C5/6 level. Within a few days of this accident a further operation was carried out to fuse the C5 and C6 vertebrae. Dr Abraszco considered that the second motor vehicle accident had also aggravated the Applicant’s pre-existing lower back pain, which apparently dated from the first accident.
	


Further violent offence in 2011; continuing alcohol abuse


	
	On 30 May 2011, at age 29, a further incident resulted in a charge against the Applicant for an offence of violence. In the waiting area of the Liverpool Police Station the Applicant and his brother commenced a verbal altercation, in Arabic, with a third party, followed by an assault upon this person. The offence was dealt with by a fine of $500.
	
	
	As at 27 October 2014 Ms De Santa Brigida, counselling psychologist, recorded that at the time of the subject offence the Applicant was taking Valium, Cipramil (anti-depressant) and Mycardis (to reduce blood pressure). Ms De Santa Brigida recorded the Applicant’s acknowledgment to her that during “the past 12 months he has started to experience alcoholic blackouts”. She attributed his history of violent offending as “secondary to his complicated psychiatric and psychological [disorders] following his first [motor vehicle accident] in 2004”. In her opinion he had commenced to “seek solace in alcohol, as a means of coping with chronic pain, depression and the loss of his professional career” following the first accident.
	
	
	Testing of the Applicant’s liver function by Ms De Santa Brigida showed that he continued to drink alcohol to excess 2 years after the incident out of which the charges arose (during which period he had been remanded on bail). The learned sentencing judge accepted the Applicant’s evidence that, whilst he continued to drink heavily, he had since the subject incident refrained from going out to licensed premises.
	


The Remarks on Sentence


	
	The learned sentencing judge fairly observed that whilst the Applicant’s abuse of alcohol appeared to be linked to his injury sustained in the motor vehicle accident of 2004, he would “need to come to grips with his alcohol addiction, both in his own interests and that of the community”. It was evident at the time of sentencing that despite alcohol abuse having led to the Applicant repeatedly committing very serious crimes of violence over several years and despite him having been given every chance by the courts (through the imposition of very lenient penalties) he had, by 23 May 2012, on his own admission, done nothing constructive about getting on top of his alcohol problem. Even his consultations with Dr Berecry commencing on 19 February 2008 appear only to have been prompted by him having been charged with the offences of 13 February 2008.
	
	
	With respect to the Applicant’s record his Honour correctly stated that he:
	


“is not to be punished again for those crimes, but his record denies him the lenience often shown to first offenders. It also means that more emphasis must be given to denunciation, community protection, and here, specific deterrence. He was made aware he had a problem with violence and alcohol years ago. He did nothing about it.”


	
	His Honour allowed a 10% discount on the penalty which would otherwise have been imposed, on account of the utilitarian aspects of his belated plea. The plea was also accepted as showing remorse. Without that discount the sentence would have been a non-parole period of approximately 5 years 7 months with a balance of term of 3 years 4 months, for a total of 8 years 11 months (for the principal offence).
	


Ground 1 – account taken of the effect on the victim


	
	His Honour summarised the effect of the Victim Impact Statement as follows:
	


“the memories of what was done still haunt [Mr Sermetovski]. He still feels vulnerable. He suffers from bouts of depression. He endured a major operation in which he could not eat and had to drink through a straw. He has had to relocate his home. He is anxious. His business suffered significantly. Many of the activities he was able to do with ease are now impossible to him. There was significant and lasting impairment and physical, emotional and economic harm was suffered by him” (emphasis added).


	
	Section 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence include the circumstance, if it applies, that “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”.
	
	
	Counsel for the Applicant has correctly submitted that before such an aggravating factor can be taken into account it must be proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt. There is no indication in the Remarks on Sentence that his Honour failed to appreciate this or that he thought it would be sufficient if the findings quoted at [32] above were made on the balance of probabilities. There is no basis for attributing to his Honour, an experienced criminal lawyer, such an error.
	
	
	Accepting that his Honour made these findings beyond reasonable doubt, did he have a basis for so doing? The last sentence of the passage quoted at [32] was criticised in the Applicant’s written submissions as not being supported beyond reasonable doubt. But the agreed facts themselves substantiated these findings to the requisite standard, partly directly and partly by inference. The “significant and lasting impairment and physical… harm” were constituted by, at least, the condition of the victim’s reconstructed facial bones. According to the agreed facts, it is required that there remain in place “permanently unless an infection occurs” the plates which were inserted and screwed in position as part of the open reduction and fixation of fractures of his facial bones.
	
	
	The Applicant challenges his Honour’s findings of “significant and lasting… emotional and economic harm”. The Victim Impact Statement included assertions by Mr Sermetovski that he had suffered significant economic harm due to inability to work whilst hospitalised and during a substantial period of recovery thereafter. It would have been well open to his Honour to infer such economic harm from any information which showed that the victim had been working (apparently self-employed in his own business) and earning at the time of the incident. The agreed description of the injuries would establish by inescapable inference that the victim would suffer a significant period of being unable to work.
	
	
	The Victim Impact Statement also placed before his Honour Mr Sermetovski’s claim that he suffers from disturbing memories of the attack. In the absence of such assertions this would be open to be inferred by the sentencing judge, beyond reasonable doubt, merely from the nature of the attack and the injuries. The number of people who could sustain such devastating facial injuries as a result of being stomped upon in the face by a 130 kilogram man and not be emotionally disturbed by the event or have haunting memories of it must be negligible.
	
	
	In oral submissions counsel for the Applicant also challenged his Honour’s finding in the second last sentence of the passage quoted above at [32]. By this sentence it appears to us his Honour merely intended to be summarising a part of the Victim Impact Statement which was expressed in closely similar terms. His Honour’s finding was thus directly supported. It was not inconsistent with the photographs of the victim’s activities, which the Applicant seeks to introduce as fresh evidence (see [44], below).
	
	
	It was not open to the Applicant to object to the Victim Impact Statement: the Court was entitled to receive and consider it under s 28(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. If there was any challenge to or reason for scepticism about the victim’s assertions in that document it would have been open to the Applicant to say so and seek an opportunity to adduce evidence to demonstrate that the effect upon Mr Sermetovski of the assault had been less than he claimed. No such indication was given in the sentence hearing. The Applicant was content to conduct the sentence proceedings upon the basis of acceptance of the Victim Impact Statement and to seek to mitigate penalty by expressing remorse for what had been inflicted upon this victim. At T 19.15 – .25 the Applicant answered a question from his Honour with an express indication that he understood “Mr Sermetovski will suffer lifelong harm”.
	
	
	In R v Tuala [2015] NSWCCA 8 at [77] – [81] this Court reviewed authorities concerning Victim Impact Statements. The Court’s statements of principle with respect to them included the following:
	


“Where no objection was taken to the victim impact statement, no question raised as to the weight to be attributed to it, and no attempt made to limit its use, the case for its acceptance as evidence of substantial harm has been considered to be strengthened… [Further, where the statement tends to be confirmatory of other evidence (either in a trial, or in the sentencing proceedings) or where it attests to harm of the kind that might be expected of the offence in question, there is little difficulty with acceptance of its contents.”


	
	In R v Tuala it was also said that considerable caution must be exercised before a Victim Impact Statement is used to establish an aggravating factor beyond reasonable doubt if the content of the statement is the only evidence of harm. That is not this case. The agreed facts constitute detailed and extensive evidence of physical harm. Other types of harm – emotional and economic – would inescapably be found, as a matter of inference.
	
	
	The Applicant cited EG v R [2015] NSWCCA 21 at [36] in support of the proposition that in the absence of evidence other than the Victim Impact Statement, on the issue of duration of harm to Mr Sermetovski and the question whether he suffered emotional and economic harm, his Honour should not have found such matters to be made out, in aggravation of the offence, beyond reasonable doubt. EG v R was a very different case. The complainant there was 2 years old at the time of the subject offence and 3 years old at the date of the sentence hearing. The Victim Impact Statement was made by the complainant’s mother. Such a case, in which the Court is asked to rely upon a mother’s claims concerning lasting impact on an infant child, raises issues and difficulties which do not arise in any comparable way in the present case.
	
	
	We reject Ground 1.
	


Ground 2 – fresh evidence and miscarriage of justice


	
	Subsequent to the sentence proceedings the Applicant has obtained photographs from Facebook entries showing Mr Sermetovski trail bike riding and jet skiing in March 2013, about 10 months after the assault upon him at the Collingwood Hotel. The Applicant relies upon the circumstance that these photographs illustrate his activities more than 18 months prior to the date of his Victim Impact Statement (2 October 2014).
	
	
	The Applicant has cited the following statement of the pre-requisites for reception of additional evidence on appeal against a sentence, taken from the judgment of Hunt J in R v Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328 at 330:
	


“What must be established is:

(1) that the additional material sought to be put before this Court is of such significance that the sentencing judge may have regarded it as having a real bearing upon his decision;

(2) that, although its existence may have been known to the applicant, its significance was not realised by him at the time; and

(3) that its existence was not made known to the applicant’s legal advisors at the time of those sentencing proceedings.”


	
	In our opinion the additional material relied upon by the Applicant would not satisfy the first of these pre-requisites, as formulated by Hunt J (with the concurrence of Grove J). The fact that Mr Sermetovski was able to ride a jet ski and a trail bike 10 months after the subject assault does not in any respect contradict or cast doubt upon the content of his Victim Impact Statement. The period within which he said that he was unable to return to work and rarely left his house was “several months”. He did not assert that he had been unable to return to any outdoor activities. His statement was much more qualified than that and entirely consistent with him being able to ride a trail bike and a jet ski in March 2012. He said:
	


“It is still [at 2 October 2014] taking me time to return to doing these things that I used to love. Many of the activities that I once did with ease, I am still unable to do at my full capacity due to my injury.”


	
	The ongoing physical pain that is asserted in the Victim Impact Statement was described as being “around my head and face, extreme pain and sensitivity around my jaw and teeth”. Pain in those regions would not be expected to preclude him from jet skiing and trail bike riding.
	
	
	In any event, more recent authorities have set the bar somewhat higher with respect to demonstrating the potential impact of putative additional material. In R v De Marco (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 20 November 1995, unrep) Sully J said that whilst recognising R v Goodwin as the then uncontradicted authority in this Court, it was “at least open to reasonable argument that the first factor articulated in Goodwin is perhaps more loosely drawn than correct principle would allow”. His Honour referred to Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392, a case concerning fresh evidence in relation to an appeal against conviction. His Honour noted that, with respect to conviction appeals, the test of whether a miscarriage of justice had arisen from the absence of the subject material at the trial would be whether the jury acting reasonably would have acquitted the accused of the charge if that evidence had been put before them. Gleeson CJ also expressed “some considerable reservations” about whether the approach based upon the first of the pre-requisites propounded in Goodwin may be unduly favourable to the party seeking to adduce the additional material.
	
	
	In R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 Howie AJ (with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Smart AJ agreed) said at 377 – 378:
	


“Generally before fresh or new evidence will be received by this Court, it must be shown that the sentencing of the appellant in the absence of that evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. As a general rule, where that evidence was available to the defendant at the time of sentencing, a miscarriage of justice would rarely result simply from the fact that the evidence was not before the sentencing judge, even if the evidence may possibly have had an impact upon the sentence passed… It has been held that new evidence may be admitted where the evidence has real significance to the sentencing proceedings, and where the significance of the evidence was unknown to the appellant and the existence of that evidence was not made known to the legal representatives at the time of sentencing: Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328...”.


	
	Subsequently in Bland v R [2014] NSWCCA 82; (2014) A Crim R 51 Johnson J reviewed the authorities on this question at [77] – [86]. At [86] his Honour held:
	


“In R v Fordham, Howie AJ (Hunt CJ at CL and Smart AJ agreeing) stated at 377-378 that, even if the evidence is fresh, it ought not be received by the Court unless it affects the outcome of the case. Generally, it must be shown that the sentencing of the offender, in the absence of the fresh evidence, resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The miscarriage of justice principle in R v Fordham was applied in Norrie v R [2008] NSWCCA 185 at [22].”


	
	In this formulation, this Court has taken the first pre-requisite stipulated in R v Goodwin as having a more restrictive effect than the literal words of Hunt J. Here, regardless of what may have been the circumstances which led to the Applicant not discovering the images on Facebook until long after sentence was passed and irrespective of whether the first pre-requisite formulated by Hunt J in Goodwin should be applied, or some stricter criterion, these Facebook images would not qualify for reception in evidence on the hearing of the appeal. We therefore reject Ground 2. 
	


Conclusion


	
	Neither of the specific errors attributed to the sentencing judge has been established. The Applicant does not propose that the appeal for which leave is sought would include a ground that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Clearly it was not, taking into account the brutality of the assault, the severity of the victim’s injuries and the appalling record of other instances of the Applicant’s alcohol-fuelled gratuitous violence, which disentitle him from lenience. Making full allowance for the Applicant’s subjective circumstances, this was a moderate sentence.
	
	
	Accordingly the orders of the Court will be:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

2768931,Wainwright v R [2016] NSWCCA 19,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The Applicant was arraigned before his Honour Judge Norrish QC in the District Court at Sydney on 20 February 2013 on a charge that on 16 January 2010, at Mortdale, he did cause grievous bodily harm to Tamara Lee with intent to murder her (s 27 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)). The indictment contained an alternative count based upon the same events, under s 33(1)(b) Crimes Act, that the Applicant caused the grievous bodily harm to Tamara Lee with intent to do her grievous bodily harm. He pleaded not guilty to the first count and his plea of guilty to the second was accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment.
	
	
	The maximum penalty under s 33(1)(b) is 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years applies. Because of medical opinions regarding his unfitness to plead at various times and for other reasons which it is not necessary to recite or examine here, the Applicant’s pleas were not entered in the District Court until a little over 3 years after his arrest. Sentence was not passed until 12 June 2014, another 16 months later. On that date his Honour imposed a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 3 years and 1 month. Due to the Applicant having been intermittently in custody between his arrest on 16 January 2010 and the date sentence was imposed, for a total of 2 years 7 months and 12 days, his sentence was ordered to commence on 31 October 2011. The non-parole period will expire on 30 October 2016 and the balance of the term will expire on 29 November 2019.
	
	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence on the following ground:
	


“His Honour the sentencing judge erred in his approach to the effect of the Applicant’s mental health conditions upon sentence.”

Facts of the offence


	
	The victim, Tamara Lee, was just 3 weeks short of 20 years of age at the date of the Applicant’s assault upon her. The Applicant was 28 years of age at the time. Ms Lee first made contact with the Applicant through an internet social networking site in about early 2009. She was at that time living in Tasmania. She moved to Sydney at about the beginning of December 2009 and from then lived with the Applicant and his mother for about 3 weeks.
	
	
	Shortly before Christmas 2009 Ms Lee and the Applicant moved into a house at Mortdale owned by one Cindy Feng and her partner Nigel Sinclair. The four of them continued to share this residence through to the date of the offence.
	
	
	On 15 January 2010 the Applicant went out drinking, alone, and returned after 1:30am on 16 January 2010. Upon his return he seized Ms Lee’s mobile phone and proceeded to use it to contact a number of her friends, by text messages and phone calls, to tell them not to contact Ms Lee again. The Applicant made threats to the persons with whom he communicated by means of this phone. This was done in the presence of Ms Lee and concluded with the Applicant telling her to “Get out of the fucking house”. The Applicant pushed Ms Lee violently out through the front of the house causing her to fall to the ground and hit her head on a concrete step. She lost consciousness and did not regain it throughout the sustained attack upon her which ensued.
	
	
	The Applicant, who was wearing shoes, stomped upon Ms Lee’s head with considerable force as she lay unconscious where she had fallen. Mr Sinclair and Ms Feng both tried to force the Applicant away from the victim, who was motionless and defenceless. The Applicant told Mr Sinclair to “stay out of it” and threatened to harm his girlfriend, Ms Feng, if he interfered. The Applicant then stomped upon Ms Lee’s head at least three more times. He said, amongst other things, “She’s trying to kill me”.
	
	
	Next the Applicant picked up a glazed terracotta pot about 60 centimetres high, 30 centimetres wide and constructed of material 20 – 25 mm thick. It weighed approximately 6.8 kilograms. The Applicant threw the pot down on Ms Lee’s head with sufficient force to shatter the pot. The Applicant then returned inside the house and commenced packing his belongings to leave. He departed the house through the front entrance, stomping on the victim’s head once more as he passed. She was still unconscious in the position in which she had first fallen.
	
	
	During the course of this attack witnesses on the street and in neighbouring properties had called the police. The Applicant was arrested in the front yard of the property. He told the arresting officers: “Fuckin’ dumb bitch deserved it, she ran at me with a knife”. This was either a fabrication or a delusion. A police search of the premises did not locate any knife with which the victim could have attacked or threatened the Applicant.
	


The grievous bodily harm sustained by Ms Lee


	
	Upon the arrival of ambulance officers shortly after police, the victim was found to be lying in a pool of approximately 1000 mL of her own blood, around her head. Her hair was heavily matted with blood and with pieces of terracotta. More broken terracotta was scattered around her head. Ms Lee had sustained major contusions to her face, eyes, ears, and nose. There were significant lacerations, measuring 2, 3 and 5 centimetres in length, around her eyes. The eyes were closed over due to swelling.
	
	
	On subsequent examination in the hospital Ms Lee was found to have significant bruising and swelling of her entire face. Radiological examination revealed fractures of the mandible (lower jaw) and inferior orbital rim (lower part of the eye socket). The fracture of the mandible required fixation with a plate under anaesthetic. During recovery and knitting of the fracture Ms Lee was restricted to a liquid diet for approximately 6 weeks as she could not open her mouth or chew.
	
	
	Ms Lee had also sustained a subconjunctival haemorrhage which caused blurred vision, more pronounced in the right eye. This haemorrhage, beneath the surface of the conjunctiva, has apparently since resolved.
	
	
	Ms Lee is left with residual scars on her face and significant dental damage which will require extensive treatment to restore. Two of her teeth were loosened as a result of the blows she received and two more were chipped. She has continuing pain and discomfort in her jaw. Unsurprisingly Ms Lee has also been significantly and lastingly affected emotionally and psychologically by the trauma of the attack.
	


Subjective circumstances of the Applicant and criminal history


	
	The Applicant is an only child. During his early years his mother and he were both the victims of domestic violence at the hands of his father. He has also given a history of having been sexually assaulted by a neighbour when he was 7 years old and by older boys in the neighbourhood at some stage during his childhood. He has said that he was bullied at school.
	
	
	The Applicant was affected by Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder and by epilepsy during his school years and he left school in year 11. Since then he has worked in a number of unskilled occupations.
	
	
	The Applicant’s criminal history shows a conviction for only one prior offence of any significance. He was convicted in 2005 of malicious wounding, which occurred on 27 February in that year. This offence arose out of an argument between the Applicant and another man, who was apparently a stranger to him, in a hotel. Both were affected by alcohol. The Applicant shattered a glass over the victim’s head, causing some lacerations.
	


Psychiatric state of the Applicant


	
	In 2005 at age 22 the Applicant attended a mental health facility in Canterbury New South Wales with symptoms of depression. He was treated with anti-depressants medication and anxiolytics for a period. Prior to his arrest on 16 January 2010 for the subject offence he had never been diagnosed with a psychotic illness.
	
	
	After the Applicant’s arrest a number of psychiatrists examined him and prepared reports. Several of these were directed to the question whether the Applicant was fit to plead to the charges laid against him. For a period the conclusion of at least some of the psychiatrists who examined him was that he was not. In chronological order, these sequential psychiatric reports contained the disparate and conflicting assessments summarised in the following paragraphs.
	
	
	29 May 2011, report of Dr Olav Nielssen: the doctor concluded that the Applicant was, in May 2011, suffering a schizoaffective disorder, being a relapsing psychotic illness with features of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This conclusion was based in part upon the Applicant’s description of:
	


“…perceptual disturbances that sounded typical of schizophrenia–like psychosis in the period after his reception into prison, and in the years beforehand. He expressed a number of persecutory beliefs, for example, that corrupt police had influenced the case, that he had been the subject of sexual interference whilst asleep, that his drinks had been spiked and that his food had been tampered with. His beliefs seemed to be delusions of reference, that is, derived from his paranoid interpretation of commonplace events, rather than arising in response to the content of auditory hallucinations”.


	
	Dr Nielssen’s diagnosis was also based upon:
	


“…aspects of his presentation during the recent interview, when he expressed what seemed to be a number of bizarre persecutory beliefs, was quite disorganised in his thinking and was thought to be mildly elevated in his mood, considering his circumstances.”


	
	Dr Nielssen concluded, tentatively and uncertainly, as follows:
	


“From the limited information available it appears that Mr Wainwright was mentally ill at the time of the offence. It is unclear whether he had a delusional belief regarding Ms Lee or whether his underlying mental illness together with the possible effect of unstable epilepsy affected his perception of events and his ability to control his actions. Contemporaneous observations from medical records and other documents could help clarify the contribution of an abnormal state of mind to Mr Wainwright’s behaviour on 16.1.10, and hence his capacity to form the specific intention to commit the offence of attempted murder.”


	
	There was no evidence before the learned sentencing judge that Dr Nielssen had subsequently clarified the “contribution of an abnormal state of mind to Mr Wainwright’s behaviour on 16.1.10”, by reviewing records of contemporaneous observations of the Applicant or by any other means.
	
	
	13 July 2011, report of Dr Adam Martin: Dr Martin undertook an examination of the Applicant on 2 July 2011 and reviewed the police brief of witness statements and Dr Nielssen’s report of 29 May 2011. He recorded that various paranoid and delusional assertions were made by the Applicant during his examination. Dr Martin concluded as follows:
	


“…whilst there are some diagnostic uncertainties regarding whether he does have a major mental illness, or of its exact aetiology, on balance, I think it is likely that he does have some psychotic phenomena suggestive of a Major Mental Illness such as Bipolar Disorder or Schizo-affective Disorder, and on a background of epilepsy and other previous behavioural problems stemming from childhood. However, there is not much objective evidence of his having had severe psychotic or mood-related symptoms at the time of the alleged offence and certainly he was not receiving treatment for this. The victim’s statement describes him accusing her of having been unfaithful; the accusations of her infidelity are not necessarily delusional in origin, even if incorrect”.


	
	14 September 2011, further report of Dr Adam Martin: the doctor reviewed recent clinical assessments of the Applicant completed by Justice Health whilst the Applicant had been on remand in custody in relation to the subject charge. These did not cause Dr Martin to change his opinion but he considered that they added to the “diagnostic uncertainty around his psychopathology”.
	
	
	21 November 2011, report of Dr Andrew White: at this date Dr White was the Applicant’s treating psychiatrist. The Applicant had been under his care since 20 September 2011, on which date her Honour Judge Flannery had found him unfit to be tried. Based upon clinical interviews with the Applicant, his Justice Health medical record, a summary of the evidence against the Applicant on the subject charge and the psychiatric reports of Drs Nielssen and Martin, Dr White concluded as follows:
	


“I do not feel able at this time to diagnose Mr Wainwright with any Axis 1 condition. He certainly does not appear to be suffering any psychotic symptoms at the moment and there are no signs of psychosis at interview. He has reasonable and plausible explanations for past beliefs and experiences that have been thought to be suggestive of a diagnosis of schizophrenia… There does seem to be a history of some instability of mood but in my mind this does not reach the diagnostic threshold of a mood disorder such as bipolar disorder. In my opinion his mood instability is more in keeping with that seen in people who have been subjected to abuse in childhood.

There certainly seems (sic) to be some features of borderline personality disorder in Mr Wainwright. He has instability of mood, instability of self-image, ambivalence in several areas including career and relationships. His relationship with the alleged victim of the offence could be seen as fairly typical of the relationship with someone with a borderline personality disorder with frequent fighting and instability. Other elements of his personality may well include narcissistic and paranoid traits.”


	
	Dr White concluded that by the date of his report the Applicant was fit to be tried. He said:
	


“I do not feel able to diagnose Mr Wainwright with any major mental illness and have not attempted to treat him with any medication.”


	
	3 July 2012, report of Dr Adam Martin: Dr Martin interviewed the Applicant again on this date and provided his further report solely for the purpose of assisting the Court to determine his then fitness to be tried. The doctor considered that he was fit. No further analysis was made or opinion expressed regarding his mental state at the time of the offence.
	
	
	11 May 2013, report of Dr John Roberts: this report is concerned only with the Applicant’s fitness to stand trial, as at April 2013. The doctor considered that at that date “the Applicant’s beliefs are arising from a delusional belief system in which evidence of psychosis exists”. The doctor made no attempt to ascertain what may have been the Applicant’s psychiatric state at the date of the subject offence or what contribution any possible psychosis at that date may have made to the commission of the offence.
	
	
	10 July 2013, further report of Dr Martin: this report was again directed to the question of fitness to plead rather than to that of the Applicant’s mental state at the time of commission of the offence. The opinions expressed by Dr Martin which have some relevance to the latter question included the following:
	


“My opinion regarding Mr Wainwright’s clinical condition is that he is a person with various psychological vulnerabilities stemming from having epilepsy and having been exposed to childhood trauma and disrupted attachments…

Having reassessed him and having read my previous reports and the other information made available, my opinion is that he probably does not have a major mental illness such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder, but that he has experienced long term problems in relation to controlling his behaviour, being prone to impulsivity and mood changeability, as a result of childhood experiences and complicated by having had epilepsy [now reasonably well controlled] and previous substance abuse.

I do not believe Mr Wainwright is psychotic although he may take a paranoid stance towards some of the named members of the police and witnesses regarding his case. However, I do not believe this paranoia is of a delusional nature. My opinion is that the manner in which his expressed beliefs are held is not of the manner in which delusions are held in illnesses such as schizophrenia.”


	
	4 March 2014, report of Dr Jacmon: Dr Jacmon is a consulting psychologist who treated the Applicant in that capacity from February 2012 up to the date when sentence was passed. Treatment involved numerous therapeutic “sessions”. As at 4 March 2014 Dr Jacmon concluded that the Applicant had four clinically significant disorders. The first, borderline personality disorder, was considered to have likely appeared in adolescence. The second, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, was thought by Dr Jacmon probably to have “emanated from child sexual assaults, violence by his father and witnessing his father assault his mother”. The third, major depressive disorder, and the fourth, generalised anxiety disorder “have likely arisen from traumatic experiences and have been maintained by subsequent life downturns such as the truculence in former relationships and the discord with his mother”.
	
	
	The report does not contain any expression of opinion as to whether any of these diagnosed disorders may have contributed, or if so in what degree, to his attack on Ms Tamara Lee. The doctor did offer the following opinion about the Applicant’s changes in mood and response to relationships, generally, which may have a bearing:
	


“Throughout adult life Mr Wainwright experienced frequent changes in mood triggered by life events as they occurred and ranging from elation to anger that was difficult to control. His relationships were at times intense and stormy. He was impulsive and this often led him into difficulties particularly with his mother.”

The learned sentencing judge’s assessment of psychiatric evidence


	
	His Honour reconciled and synthesised the range of views of the psychiatrists and of Dr Jacmon in this passage:
	


“The conclusion I reach is that the medical material and the view of the treating psychologist speaks (sic) of mental and psychological issues that may be seen as relevant to the offending, emanating primarily, from what I see, as his borderline personality disorder and the possible complications arising from the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The anxiety and depressive symptoms would appear to be reactive to circumstances at the time of the subsequent assessments [following] the commission of the offence. There is no contemporaneous observation or record of psychotic symptoms and in my view no reliable evidence of any psychotic illness underlying or causing the prisoner’s conduct.”


	
	In written submissions made by the Applicant’s counsel, the above conclusion of the learned judge is quoted without the final sentence and it is expressly stated that “no issue is taken with the basic manner in which his Honour reconciled the conflicting opinions”. We consider that, similarly, no issue could be taken with the final sentence of the passage quoted.
	
	
	His Honour did not accept that the savage assault upon Ms Lee was perpetrated under the influence of delusional beliefs. His Honour said:
	


“I appreciate it is reported that the prisoner has from time to time had delusional beliefs after the event, but in the context of the observations of the eyewitnesses and the conduct of the prisoner that is established through the facts, the conduct of the prisoner subsequently very much falls within the realm of self-justification and the avoidance of responsibility. This is emphasised by the many versions [of the events and of the Applicant’s perceptions at the time] that the prisoner has given to different people.”


	
	This finding was fully justified by the material before his Honour. Likewise, his Honour was justified in rejecting the Applicant’s contention on sentence that he “had no memory of hitting her with the pot plant or stomping on her head”. This proposition had been submitted on his behalf from the bar table. The Applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceeding.
	
	
	Further findings of his Honour, again well open to him, were as follows:
	


“…[O]ne of the issues that I conclude in favour of the prisoner is that contributing to the prisoner’s reaction to circumstances, that were not as he would assert them to be, were the underlying psychological conditions arising from both the borderline personality disorder and the history of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and his inability thus to control himself.”


	
	On appeal, that finding was also expressly accepted by the Applicant’s counsel but issue was taken with the learned sentencing judge’s conclusion that any diminution of moral responsibility attributable to his mental condition was slight. In the relevant passage of the remarks on sentence, as follows, his Honour contrasted the Applicant’s case with that of Elturk v R [2014] NSWCCA 61:
	


“If, in the case of Elturk, his moral culpability was significantly diminished by reason of his illness, in this case whilst I accept there is some diminution of moral responsibility in the context of psychological conditions in part caused by events beyond the prisoner’s control, the diminution is slight.”


	
	With respect to this passage the Applicant’s counsel now complains that the question of diminution of moral responsibility ought not to have been approached by way of comparison with a more serious case but by his Honour making “a proper assessment of the extent to which those afflictions may have reduced the moral culpability of the Applicant”. We reject this criticism of the learned judge’s remarks. His Honour did “make a proper assessment” namely that the “diminution is slight”. The material before him on sentence justified that conclusion.
	
	
	The Applicant’s counsel went so far as to submit that his Honour was “bound to accept” the opinions of Dr Jacmon regarding psychiatric disorders from which, in Dr Jacmon’s view the Applicant had suffered for most of his life. His Honour was not “bound to accept” the opinion of any one of the experts whose evidence was before him. He evidently took into account the more cautious assessments of the psychiatric specialists and he was entitled to do so. We do not agree with the Applicant’s submission that “a proper assessment of the link between the Applicant’s mental condition and his offending conduct compels a conclusion that the [reduction in] his moral responsibility is more than ‘slight’”.
	


Legal principle with respect to taking account of mental health


	
	In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 243 FLR 28 at [177] McClellan CJ at CL summarised the principles to be applied in sentencing an offender who was suffering from a mental condition at the time of committing the offence, to the following effect:
	



	
	Where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced and consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced, with a reduction in sentence.
	
	
	The offender’s state of mental health at the relevant time may also have the consequence that he or she is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed.
	
	
	The offender’s mental condition may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily upon him or her and, because the sentence may thus be more onerous, its length or the conditions under which it is to be served may be reduced.
	
	
	The offender’s mental condition at the time of committing the offence may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence.
	
	
	Conversely, an offender’s mental illness may mean that he or she presents more of a danger to the community than a person not afflicted by such a condition and considerations of specific deterrence may therefore result in an increased sentence.
	



	
	The learned Chief Judge supported these propositions with extensive citation of authority. They are substantially to the same effect as the propositions formulated by Sperling J (Grove and Dowd JJ concurring) in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] – [36]. The principles have been restated and applied in this Court on many occasions. They were re-endorsed in Aslan v R [2014] NSWCCA 114 with the concurrence of all three judges who constituted the Court for that appeal, at [33].
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge correctly noted these principles and gave effect to them so far as applicable. The following extracts from the remarks on sentence are relevant:
	


“There is a need for an element of general deterrence and specific deterrence. At the moment I do not believe the community needs protection from the offender and I do not believe the prisoner presents a risk to the victim. I am required to promote his rehabilitation and make him accountable for his actions. … In this particular matter the [mental] condition is not one that calls for reduction upon the weight to be given to general deterrence, although the moral culpability issue I have already dealt with [a reference to the ‘slight’ diminution in responsibility as found in the passage cited at [37]]. I appreciate the prisoner by reason of his personality and the matters adverted to in the medical reports may have difficulties in custody that may not be promoted [scil ameliorated] sufficiently by available resources. I do not believe, subject to supervision, that the prisoner is a danger to the community. On the other hand there is, it must be said, in the way in which the prisoner has conducted himself, some need to have regard to the specific deterrence of the prisoner by any penalty that the Court imposes. I am required to recognise the harm done to the victim of course and make the prisoner accountable for his crime even if he refuses to take full responsibility.”


	
	Immediately following this passage his Honour proceeded to fix sentence, allowing a 10% discount for the utilitarian value of his plea. But for the 10% discount the total term would have been 9 years.
	
	
	We have, as stated, found no error in his Honour’s evaluation of the psychiatric reports and no error in the conclusion that the diminution in moral responsibility which could be recognised on account of the Applicant’s mental history was slight. There was no error in his Honour’s appreciation of the principles applicable to taking into account the Applicant’s mental disorders, nor in his application of those principles. Although his Honour has not quantified the degree of amelioration of sentence which he allowed on account of the Applicant’s mental condition (as he was not obliged to do) it is apparent that some allowance for this has been made.
	
	
	The attack upon Ms Lee was one of appalling savagery. It was sustained. The repeated assaults were perpetrated upon a defenceless young woman lying unconscious. The Applicant persisted with his attack in the face of entreaties from his housemates to desist. He pressed on with determination against their attempts physically to restrain him.
	
	
	The offence to which the Applicant pleaded guilty and for which he was sentenced involves the same mental element as for murder: intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The significance of this mental element in the crime, relevantly to sentence, has been referred by this Court in AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203 per Johnson J at [67] and [68].
	
	
	Given the 25 years maximum and the 7 years standard non parole period which are applicable to s 33(1)(b) Crimes Act, an offence against that section involving such objectively seriousness features as were present here would have been expected to attract a starting point sentence more severe than 9 years (before discount – see [43]) absent some allowance for the slight reduction in moral responsibility which his Honour recognised on account of the Applicant’s mental condition.
	


Conclusion


	
	For these reasons, although the Court will grant leave to appeal, the appeal must be dismissed. The second ground which appears in the proposed Grounds of Appeal (“a lesser sentence is warranted in law”) would only fall to be considered if error were demonstrated under the first ground – which is not the case.
	
	
	Accordingly the orders of the Court will be:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offence and sentence

On 23 October 2014, after a two day trial before King SC DCJ sitting without a jury, the applicant was found guilty of one count of attempted robbery armed with a dangerous weapon (shotgun) pursuant to ss 97(2) and 344A(1) Crimes Act 1900. Section 97(2) carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.


	
	On 16 February 2015 his Honour imposed a sentence of 10 years imprisonment to commence 13 December 2016 and expire 12 December 2026 with a 6 year non-parole period to expire 12 December 2022. His Honour found special circumstances to vary the “statutory ratio” of the overall sentence to 60 per cent.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him on the following ground:
	


The learned sentencing judge did not take into account or give appropriate weight to social disadvantage experienced by the applicant arising from his growing up and living in his community at La Perouse.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	At about 5:08pm on 7 August 2012 the applicant rode as a pillion passenger on a motor bike driven by an unknown person to the Sir Joseph Banks Hotel at Waratah Street, Botany. A co-offender, Trindall, and the applicant entered the hotel through the open beer garden entrance. The applicant and Trindall called out to the patrons to get down on the ground, “this is a stick up”. Trindall was armed with a sawn off shotgun.
	
	
	As the applicant and Trindall approached patrons seated at a table, one of the patrons lunged at Trindall who struck him on the head with the shotgun causing a wound which bled. Other patrons came to his assistance and a struggle with Trindall took place. During that struggle the shotgun discharged but no-one was hurt.
	
	
	The applicant entered the main bar of the hotel and was confronted by a patron who used a bar stool to push the applicant back to the beer garden. Once back in the beer garden, he was chased by other patrons, one of whom had a chair. The applicant left the hotel through the beer garden doors. He was seen to partially lift his mask when leaving. He mounted the motor bike outside the beer garden and was driven away on it. Trindall was detained by patrons.
	
	
	Police arrived and located a single barrel shotgun.
	
	
	Pursuant to the issue of a warrant, a listening device recorded conversations between the applicant and another inmate on 18 and 21 May 2013 when the applicant was in custody at Wellington. In the course of those conversations the applicant made statements indicating knowledge of the attempted robbery.
	


Sentence judgment


	
	The facts as to the occurrence of the offence found by his Honour were as set out above. His Honour noted that the applicant did not give evidence on sentence. His Honour had before him a pre-sentence report of Vimmela Bendall, Community Corrections Officer; two reports from Miriam Wyzenbeek, Clinical and Forensic Psychologist; and the applicant’s criminal history.
	
	
	His Honour found the effect of those reports to be as follows:
	


“The offender was 19 years of age at the time of the offence, and is now 22 years of age. He was raised in the La Perouse area. He was the second youngest of six children to his parents. His mother died when he was approximately 13 years of age. The relationship between his parents was described by him as having been positive, and he denied any notable discord or domestic violence in their union. I should indicate that what I have just said and the following is taken from the reports of Miriam Wyzenbeek. He is said to have enjoyed positive relationships with his father and siblings, and at the time of the offence was still residing in the family home, not having gained functional or financial independence. Apparently neither of his parents had a history of criminal involvement or problematic substance use. However, apparently crime and substance use (alcohol and other drugs) was (and continues to be) common, and is generally accepted within his extended family and the broader community in which he was raised and socialises.

In terms of familial involvement in crime, apparently his brothers and cousins have extensive criminal histories, and are each currently incarcerated. He said that his sisters, aunts and uncles have histories of substance abuse/dependency. Although he denied witnessing any violence between his immediate family members, he apparently witnessed much domestic and other interpersonal violence within his extended family members and the broader community at La Perouse.” (Sentence judgment 4.2 – 4.9)


	
	His Honour noted that the applicant was of Aboriginal background and completed school at the age of 13. As a result, he is unable to read or write. He had never been engaged in employment nor had he ever applied for social security benefits. When he was in the community he was supported financially by his family and friends. His Honour noted that Ms Wyzenbeek reported that the applicant presented as a person of low intelligence. In subsequent testing, Ms Wyzenbeek was not able to confirm the occurrence of any traumatic brain injury nor any matter which may have had an adverse effect on his cognitive ability.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the applicant reported having first consumed alcohol when he was 10 years of age, drinking each weekend at that time, and between the ages of 17 and 18, drinking to the point of inebriation on most weekends. He said that he had not consumed alcohol since he was 18 because he was aware of the harmful effects that it had on his family and other members of the community.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the applicant reported first smoking cannabis when he was aged 13 and smoking an ounce daily until around 17 years of age, but that he had not used that substance since then, due to its demotivating effect. He first started using amphetamines at age 17 and used it at a rate of three times weekly. His first methamphetamine use occurred when he was aged 19 and he was smoking a quarter of an ounce of that drug daily from that time until he entered custody on 18 March 2013. The applicant said that he did not use drugs while in custody and had not participated in any drug or alcohol treatment programs because he was unable to see the benefit.
	
	
	His Honour observed that despite that assertion, the applicant’s custody record indicated that since March 2013 he had been found to be in breach of prison discipline by failing urine tests, possessing drug equipment and failing prescribed drug tests.
	
	
	His Honour summarised the effect of Ms Wyzenbeek’s most recent report (20 November 2014) as follows:
	


“Ms Wyzenbeek refers to her earlier report and her previous comments about his childhood exposure to social disadvantage and anti-sociality, being largely the product of the environment in which he was raised, and as a result of which he had modelled and normalised and socially reinforced his own behaviours.

Ms Wyzenbeek’s reports are unusually frank and comprehensive, particularly in respect of psychological reports tendered on behalf of an offender. For that reason, I intend to quote an extensive passage of her report from para 33:

“Mr Ingrey has a lengthy history of offending behaviour dating back to early childhood that has included property, driving and violence related offences. He also has a history of non-compliance with sanctions and institutional routine. During our initial interview he informed me that he had been in and out of custody since around eight years of age. Mr Ingrey’s early and repeated episodes of incarceration have likely had multiple negative impacts on him, including disrupted schooling and difficulties participating in mainstream education leading to early dropout; exposure to additional negative/antisocial influences, stigmatising effect of labelling him an offender; and reinforcement of his criminal behaviours and attitudes from collective detention. That Mr Ingrey has not yet participated in any treatment programs suggests the facts contributing to his offending have remained unaddressed.

Mr Ingrey’s early and ongoing engagement in crime, as well as the type of offence that he has continued to commit is reflective of a pattern of antisociality. He continues to violate and disregard the rights of others, possesses a disregard for social norm/rules and is not dissuaded by the potential negative consequences of his behaviours on himself or others. Mr Ingrey reports engaging in crime for the adrenaline rush that it provides, the ease with which he is able to obtain money and meet his perceived needs, and the status which he obtains within his antisocial peer network. In addition, Mr Ingrey’s self-identity is entwined with his engagement in crime and he does not report experiencing any remorse for his past offending. Mr Ingrey perceives crime as a justifiable way of obtaining money and did not express any desire to change his criminal behaviours. He offered that he has continued to engage in violent and aggressive behaviours whilst in custody, such as fighting other inmates, despite receiving repeated sanctions for this. Overall, Mr Ingrey’s past and current behaviours indicate that punishment has not had a dissuading impact and that he is currently endorsing antisocial attitudes.

As noted in my previous report, Mr Ingrey has lived a relatively immature and irresponsible lifestyle compared to other similar aged peers of non-offending backgrounds. He has no employment experience, resides at home when not incarcerated, and expects his family to financially support him. Mr Ingrey’s education was largely disrupted as a result of truancy and detention/incarceration, and he is unable to read/write. Mr Ingrey’s lifestyle is characterised by impulsiveness in that he possesses low self-control, lacks meaningful daily routines, and has a history of making irresponsible and hedonistic decisions. Mr Ingrey stated that he would like to commence a panel-beating apprenticeship once released from custody, however, he seemed unclear about the steps involved in this, and was noncommittal towards following through with this plan. Mr Ingrey appears to experience difficulties with planning, problem solving and following through with intended goals, which if left untreated, is likely to negatively impact on his capacity to obtain legal employment post-custody and his goal of becoming a panel-beater.

Interpersonally, Mr Ingrey’s relationships appear to be unreciprocal and exploitative in that they are focussed on what others can offer him. He is generally mistrustful and suspicious of others and he overreacts with aggression to minor events.

Mr Ingrey reported a history of problematic substance use and this appears to be related to his history of offending in that he spoke about committing crimes whilst under the influence of illicit substances (although he explained that he is not more likely to commit crimes when under the influence of illicit substances) and committing crimes in order to obtain illicit substances. Mr Ingrey informed me that he has continued to use illicit substances whilst in custody despite repeat identification and sanctions.

In regards to mental health, Mr Ingrey has not currently satisfied criteria for a diagnosable mental illness. On the basis of his reporting, Mr Ingrey was not experiencing mental illness at the time of or leading up to his offending.” (Sentence judgment 9.8 – 11.5)


	
	His Honour noted that Ms Wyzenbeek said that the applicant would potentially benefit from a period of incarceration in order to complete the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program and also such programs as Getting Smart. His Honour could find no evidence of any remorse or contrition on the part of the applicant and concluded that there was little, if any, prospect of rehabilitation. Because of the material before him, his Honour concluded that it was impossible to find that the applicant was at low risk of re-offending. On the contrary, his Honour found that the applicant had a high risk of re-offending.
	
	
	His Honour did not detail all of the applicant’s past offences, but referred to categories. Those categories included being carried in a stolen conveyance, break and enter with intent to steal, failing to appear in courts with bail, shoplifting, obtaining money by deception, aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offences, assault and resist officers in the execution of duty, being armed with intent to commit indictable offence, use offensive language in or near public places or schools, possess prohibited drugs, drive dangerously, drive conveyance taken without the consent of the owner, drive recklessly furiously or speed in a manner dangerous and having goods in custody suspected of being stolen.
	
	
	His Honour noted that as an adult the applicant had been imprisoned for a period of 9 months, with a 4 month non-parole period for stealing from the person as well as receiving terms of imprisonment in respect of driving a conveyance without consent and engaging in a police pursuit. In respect of the police pursuit, the sentence imposed was one of 2 years with a non-parole period of 12 months. That sentence commenced on 13 September 2013. There were other offences with terms of imprisonment in relation to larceny.
	
	
	His Honour paid particular attention to offences committed by the applicant which gave rise to sentences of imprisonment which might impact on the sentence to be imposed for this matter. His Honour noted that this offence occurred on 7 August 2012 but that the applicant was not arrested until 13 August 2013. At the time of his arrest, he was already in custody as a result of other offending. This offence was committed when the applicant was on parole in respect of offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company and affray, being offences committed as a juvenile. In respect of those offences the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing 27 February 2012 with a non-parole period of 3 months. He was released on parole on 26 May 2012, i.e. about two and a half months before this offence. As he was not arrested in respect of this offence until 13 August 2013, his parole had already expired on 26 February 2013.
	
	
	His Honour noted that since committing this offence and while in the community, the applicant committed a number of further offences. On 4 October 2012, i.e. two months after the current offence, an offence of destroying or damaging property occurred for which the applicant received imprisonment for 2 months. Two days earlier on 2 October 2012, he committed an offence of larceny for which he received a s 9 bond of 12 months. On 25 September 2012, he committed the offence of drive a conveyance without the consent of the owner for which he received a s 9 bond of 12 months. He also received a s 9 bond of 12 months and a s 10A conviction with no other penalty in respect of a number of offences committed on 9 September 2012 being drive a conveyance taken without consent, never being a licensed person drive a vehicle on road and a police pursuit.
	
	
	Importantly, subsequent to the current offence, the applicant committed two offences of wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, one being taken into account on a Form 1. In respect of those offences he was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 6 years commencing 13 December 2013 with a non-parole period of 4 years to conclude on 12 December 2017.
	
	
	In relation to the objective seriousness of this offending, his Honour noted that the co-offender, Trindall, was in possession of a shotgun which discharged during the course of him being over-powered by the patrons at the hotel. His Honour found that the offence was pre-planned, the three offenders all travelling to the hotel with the object of entering through the rear beer garden while disguised by wearing balaclavas. His Honour noted that they only failed in the attempted robbery because there was a significant number of patrons in the hotel not prepared to have their drinking session interrupted. His Honour considered that the features of this offending made it more serious than the offence referred to in the guideline judgment of R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 106 A Crim R 149. Those features were that he was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise where his co-offender had a loaded shotgun for which he was just as responsible. His Honour concluded that this offence was a very serious matter.
	
	
	In relation to parity, his Honour noted that there were a number of distinguishing features – the applicant did not plead guilty and was on parole at the time of the offence. Although Mr Trindall also had a poor criminal record, there was little evidence of offences involving violence. There were also distinguishing features in relation to contrition, remorse and the prospects of rehabilitation and re-offending.
	
	
	His Honour declined to commence the sentence in this matter from the date on which the applicant was convicted, being 23 October 2014. On that issue, his Honour referred to the judgment of Simpson J in Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58 where her Honour said that the sentencing discretion allowed him to impose a sentence which was concurrent, partially concurrent or wholly cumulative upon the sentence or sentences which the applicant was already serving.
	
	
	On that issue, his Honour said:
	


“In my view, it would be entirely inappropriate, regarding the seriousness of this offence and the significant sentences imposed in respect of other offending, to take the course submitted by Mr Sandilands. I will, however, make the sentence partially concurrent with the sentence imposed in respect of the offence of wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. That sentence was to date from 13 December 2013, and he would be eligible for release in respect of that sentence on 12 December 2017. I intend to date the sentence from 13 December 2016, meaning that it will commence and be concurrent with the last year of the non-parole period for the wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.” (Sentence judgment 18.8 – 19.1)

Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that proper consideration was not given by the sentencing judge to the notion of reduced moral culpability where an offender has suffered social disadvantage when young. In support of that proposition, the applicant relied upon the decision of the plurality in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at [37]:
	


“37    An Aboriginal offender's deprived background may mitigate the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate for the offence in the same way that the deprived background of a non-Aboriginal offender may mitigate that offender's sentence. In this respect, Simpson J has correctly explained the significance of the statements in Fernando:

""Properly understood, Fernando is a decision, not about sentencing Aboriginals, but about the recognition, in sentencing decisions, of social disadvantage that frequently (no matter what the ethnicity of the offender) precedes the commission of crime.""

…

43   … The experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Among other things, a background of that kind may compromise the person's capacity to mature and to learn from experience. It is a feature of the person's make-up and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending.

44   Because the effects of profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending, it is right to speak of giving ""full weight"" to an offender's deprived background in every sentencing decision. However, this is not to suggest, as the appellant's submissions were apt to do, that an offender's deprived background has the same (mitigatory) relevance for all of the purposes of punishment. Giving weight to the conflicting purposes of punishment is what makes the exercise of the discretion so difficult. An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.”


	
	The applicant accepted that in his case the particular disadvantage was not the circumstances of his immediate upbringing by his mother and father, but his association with peers and extended family who were engaged in criminal activities in the small community of La Perouse. The applicant submitted that such an atmosphere where criminal activity was the norm was likely to distort the applicant’s moral compass, particularly when he was of tender years.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that although the sentencing judge had set out in detail his disadvantaged background, he had not done so with a view to taking it into account by way of mitigation, but rather as a factor which counted against him in that it was not conducive to rehabilitation.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that despite the fact that his counsel had made frequent reference in submissions to the application of Bugmy v The Queen and R v Fernando [1992] 76 A Crim R 58, his Honour made no reference to those cases in the sentencing judgment. The applicant submitted that his Honour neither adopted anything said in those cases nor did he give reasons why they ought not apply.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that despite the fact that his Honour was sufficiently impressed by the psychological reports of Ms Wyzenbeek to quote from it at length, particularly in relation to her conclusions, he did not at any time say that the matters raised by Ms Wyzenbeek were indicative of social disadvantage and that this was a matter which ought be taken into account in his favour. He submitted that although his Honour had identified as a fact that he had been exposed to social disadvantage, he did not take the next step of taking that into account in order to provide some amelioration of his sentence. This was clear from the fact that in his reasons, his Honour said:
	


“I note that apart from the offender’s age there is nothing else that assists him on the material before the Court.” (Sentence judgment 19.3)

Consideration


	
	It is true that his Honour fully reviewed the applicant’s subjective case. Included in that review was a detailed statement of the history received and conclusions reached by Ms Wyzenbeek. That material made it clear that an important part of the applicant’s background history was that his extended family were involved in a criminal milieu and that from a young age, the applicant was exposed to that influence. Despite being aware of those matters, his Honour appears to have disregarded them when exercising the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	This is clear from the observation by his Honour relied upon by the applicant that:
	


“I note that apart from the offender’s age there is nothing else that assists him on the material before the Court.”

That observation was made by his Honour after he had fully reviewed the facts and when he was identifying the sentencing principles which he proposed to apply. It is clear from that observation and from the contents of the sentencing judgment that his Honour had no regard to that aspect of the applicant’s background.


	
	It follows that the complaint made by the applicant in the ground of appeal has been made out. Nevertheless, there remains the question of whether that amounts to an error such as would require this Court to re-sentence the applicant.
	
	
	It is true, as the Crown submitted, that in Bugmy v The Queen the plurality said:
	


“40   … The circumstance that an offender has been raised in a community surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may mitigate the sentence because his or her moral culpability is likely to be less than the culpability of an offender whose formative years have not been marred in that way.” (emphasis added)


	
	My understanding of that statement is that it refers to the ultimate effect of that factor. The plurality were not saying that a consideration of this factor was optional. What the plurality clearly had in mind was that even when that factor is taken into account, there may be countervailing factors (such as the protection of the community) which might reduce or eliminate its effect. In other words, this factor where it is present should be taken into account in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. That is something which his Honour did not do.
	
	
	Accordingly, error of the kind identified in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505 has occurred:
	


“If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so.”

Here his Honour failed to take into account a material consideration.


	
	Error having been established, it is necessary for this Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion. This was made clear by the plurality in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 88 ALJR 947 where their Honours said:
	


“40   … When a judge … does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. …”


	
	As a start point in the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion, it needs to be noted that while the applicant’s background during his formative years involved exposure to persons who were active in the criminal world and that there was a general acceptance among the members of his wider family and peers that breaking the law was acceptable, neither his mother nor his father were criminally involved nor was either of them abusing alcohol or drugs. To that extent, as was made clear by Ms Wyzenbeek, the applicant was raised with a supportive family background. Most particularly, there was no evidence that the applicant was raised in an atmosphere of violence, although he did see it in the community around him.
	
	
	It follows that although the applicant’s background was marked by exposure to regular criminal activity, it was not of the kind (regrettably found all too often in such cases) where the abuse of alcohol and alcohol-fuelled violence were endemic. The applicant’s background was considerably better than that described in Bugmy, Fernando and a number of similar cases which have come before the courts. Nevertheless, the applicant’s exposure to crime at an early age would still have “compromise[d] the person’s capacity to mature and learn from experience” (Bugmy at [43]).
	
	
	Ms Wyzenbeek summarised the position of the applicant at para [28] of her first report as follows:
	


“Family and social influence appear to have been integral to the development and continuation of Mr Ingrey’s antisocial attitudes and engagement in antisocial activities. Although actively involved in an antisocial peer culture, Mr Ingrey stated that he generally offends alone. Mr Ingrey’s current supports have been unable to supervise, confront or regulate his engagement in antisocial behaviours to date. Furthermore, they appear to be complacent in regards to his offending history, by assisting him in hiding from police detection. Additionally, a number of his supports reportedly engaged in crimes themselves.”


	
	Guidance as to how to take into account social disadvantage of the kind established in this case, was provided by the plurality in Bugmy as follows:
	


“44   ... An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.

45   The point was made by Gleeson CJ in Engert in the context of explaining the significance of an offender's mental condition in sentencing:

""A moment's consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. That was the particular problem being examined by the court in the case of Veen (No 2). Again, in a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence, might, at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the offender.""”


	
	Observations to similar effect were made by the plurality in Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 249 CLR 600:
	


“54   … First, the proper role of the criminal law is not limited to the utilitarian value of general deterrence. The criminal law is more than a mode of social engineering which operates by providing disincentives directed to reducing unacceptably deviant behaviour within the community. To view the criminal law exclusively, or even principally, as a mechanism for the regulation of the risks of deviant behaviour is to fail to recognise the long-standing obligation of the state to vindicate the dignity of each victim of violence, to express the community's disapproval of that offending, and to afford such protection as can be afforded by the state to the vulnerable against repetition of violence. …”


	
	In Munda v Western Australia the plurality quoted with approval the following statement in the Court of Appeal by McLure P:
	


“43   …

""Even if it is established that a person's addiction to alcohol and/or drugs is mitigatory because of events in their formative childhood years or otherwise, that does not inevitably reduce the weight to be given to personal deterrence. Indeed, addictions ordinarily increase the weight to be given to personal deterrence (and/or community protection) because of the associated increase in the risk of reoffending. ... Further, the courts must exercise caution in characterising or treating an offender as a 'victim' because it can lead adult perpetrators to wrongly believe that they are not truly responsible and accountable for their conduct, leading to a failure to properly protect the community. …””


	
	A statement of principle to similar effect was made by Johnson J (Hoeben JA and Beech-Jones J agreeing) in Jinnette v R [2012] NSWCCA 217:
	


“104   It is the case that the Applicant has had a terrible life involving a dysfunctional family and constant negative events involving abuse and exploitation of him by others. There is no way that his life can be recalled and a more positive life substituted for it. All reasonable persons will have a considerable measure of sympathy for him.

105   At the same time, reasonable members of the community will observe what the Applicant has done consistently when at large in the community, offending in different ways including placing members of the community at risk and harming them. There is a history of failed conditional liberty and breaches of parole. The criminal justice system has no ready solution for cases such as this given the relatively blunt instruments available to it.

106   The protection of the community remains a most important consideration in a case such as this, involving incapacitation through incarceration of the Applicant, and also the protection of the community in taking reasonable steps to provide an opportunity for intensive supervision when the Applicant comes to be considered for release on parole.”


	
	A matter which was not raised as a ground of appeal but was referred to in argument is the issue of the applicant’s institutionalisation. It is common ground that the effect of the sentence imposed by his Honour, taken with the sentences which the applicant was already serving, will produce a result of imprisonment with a non-parole period in excess of 9 years. Given the applicant’s age (22), this has to be a relevant consideration in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	The Court had available to it on re-sentence an affidavit of Ms Betteridge from the Office of the ODPP. Annexed to the affidavit was a record of the applicant’s offending while in custody for this offence. The applicant has continued to breach prison discipline, albeit not with the same frequency as he has in the past. There was an offence on 12 January 2015 involving the possession of a drug implement, on 6 March 2015 for refusing to supply a urine sample and on 3 September 2015 for failing a prescribed urine test. These matters have been taken into account on re-sentencing.
	
	
	In the independent re-exercise of the sentencing discretion, I have taken into account by way of mitigation the applicant’s age, his exposure to criminal activity and like matters during his formative years and the potentially crushing nature of the sentence which he is currently serving. Although all assessments of his prospects of rehabilitation are negative, I have taken into account the possibility that he will attend the courses available to him while in custody and that these, together with increasing maturity, will change his attitude to life.
	
	
	By way of balance, I have also taken into account the objective seriousness of the offending which is substantial, particularly the possession by the co-offender of a loaded shotgun which did in fact discharge. I have taken into account the applicant’s lack of remorse, his lengthy criminal history and poor compliance with supervision and other orders. General deterrence is an important consideration in this matter as is personal deterrence and the protection of the community. As the applicant’s criminal record makes clear, which is confirmed by the comprehensive report of Ms Wyzenbeek, there is at the moment no sign that upon release into the community, the applicant will change his behaviour and cease offending.
	
	
	Taking those matters into account, the sentence which I propose is imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. In setting the commencement date for that sentence, I propose to increase the level of concurrency to 2 years. The effect of the sentence is that the applicant will be eligible for parole on 12 December 2020 and that the total term of the sentence will expire on 12 December 2024.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed by King SC DCJ on 16 February 2015 is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 years, commencing 13 December 2015, with a non-parole period of 5 years expiring 12 December 2020. The balance of term is 4 years which will expire on 12 December 2024.
	



	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	FULLERTON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2768933,R v Turnbull (No. 1) [2016] NSWSC 189,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: On 4 December 2015, the Accused, Ian Robert Turnbull, was arraigned in this Court upon an indictment containing two counts:
	



	
	that on 29 July 2014, at Moree in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Glendon Turner;
	
	
	that on 29 July 2014, at Moree in the State of New South Wales, he did, without consent, detain Robert Strange with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely, the killing of Glendon Turner.
	



	
	A plea of not guilty was entered on the murder count, with the Accused not being arraigned on the second count at the request of the parties.
	
	
	Thereafter, for the purpose of fixing a trial date, a discussion ensued as to the appropriate venue for the trial. Mr Alexis SC, for the Accused, submitted that a trial was appropriate at Moree or, alternatively, Dubbo or Armidale. The Crown submitted that the trial should proceed in Sydney.
	
	
	In light of this controversy, the Court gave directions for the filing of a Notice of Motion concerning venue together with evidence and written submissions, with a hearing being fixed on that issue for 18 December 2015.
	
	
	The venue issue was considered by the Court on 18 December 2015. At the outset, I indicated that a trial listing in April 2016 was available, but that the available venues for a trial at that time were Moree or Sydney.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the hearing, I indicated that I was well satisfied that the venue for the trial should not be Moree, and that the Court was in a position to list the trial in Sydney in April 2016. I fixed the trial to commence on 4 April 2016 with an estimate of three-to-four weeks.
	
	
	I stated that I would publish my reasons on the venue issue early in the 2016 Law Term. What follows constitutes my reasons on the question of venue.
	


The Venue Application


	
	By Notice of Motion filed 15 December 2015, the Crown sought that the venue for the trial be a venue other than Moree, with the application proceeding upon the basis that the Crown sought a Sydney venue.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon affidavits of Mark Julian Alexander Dight sworn 3 November 2015 and affidavits of Detective Senior Constable Timothy McCarthy affirmed 28 October 2015, 10 December 2015 and 18 December 2015.
	
	
	In addition, the Crown tendered a folder containing extracts from Parliamentary debates concerning the Native Vegetation Bill 2003 and the Native Vegetation Amendment Bill 2014 (Exhibit A) which was admitted, subject to relevance.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Accused read the affidavit of Sylvester Martin Rodrick Claudius Joseph sworn 14 December 2015.
	
	
	Helpful written submissions had been filed on behalf of the Crown and the Accused.
	


The Crown Case


	
	It is appropriate to refer to the Crown case against the Accused. What follows is drawn from the Crown Case Statement. It is, of course, a narrative of the Crown allegations and not any finding or findings of fact by the Court.
	
	
	The incident in question occurred in the late afternoon of 29 July 2014 on public land adjacent to Talga Lane, a public road in the Croppa Creek area of northern New South Wales, about 60 kilometres north of Moree.
	
	
	The Accused was 79 years old at the time of the incident. He is a farmer and land owner. The Accused had been prosecuted for illegal land clearing under s.12 Native Vegetation Act 2003, said to have occurred between November 2011 and January 2012. The Crown alleges that the Accused was deeply angered by the prosecution, which was a lengthy and expensive process, and that the Accused resented what he saw as interference with his farming operation.
	
	
	Mr Turner, the deceased, was 51 years old at the time of the incident. He was employed as a Compliance and Regulation Officer for the Office of Environment and Heritage, Department of Premier and Cabinet. His role involved investigating illegal land clearing and prosecuting individuals for breaches of s.12 of the Native Vegetation Act 2003.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that Mr Turner had been involved in monitoring illegal clearing on the Accused’s property, and had prosecuted the Accused in the two years running up to the incident. It is alleged that the Accused resented the prosecution and that there was ongoing animosity on behalf of the Accused towards Mr Turner.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that, in the course of an incident on 28 June 2012, the Accused threatened Mr Turner. As a result of this alleged threat by the Accused, Mr Turner had been instructed not to have further contact with him.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 29 July 2014, Mr Turner and a work colleague, Robert Strange, were performing duties in the Croppa Creek area. Mr Turner and Mr Strange were on route to a site unrelated to the Accused. As they travelled along Talga Lane, the Crown alleges that they noticed a number of fires burning, consisting of cleared trees, on a property owned by the Accused’s son, Cory Turnbull.
	
	
	At about 4.56 pm, the vehicle containing Mr Turner and Mr Strange passed another vehicle driven by Ivan Maas, an employee of the Accused. The Crown alleges that Mr Maas recognised Mr Turner, and soon after called a colleague, Scott Kennett, indicating that he had seen Mr Turner in that location.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that between 5.00 pm and 5.05 pm, Mr Kennett advised the Accused that Mr Turner and another person were in the area and indicated their location.
	
	
	Soon after 5.00 pm, Mr Turner and Mr Strange stopped on County Boundary Road to take some photographs and GPS waypoints. Shortly before 5.15 pm, Mr Turner and Mr Strange drove to a point about 500 metres from the scene of the subsequent shooting and stopped. Mr Strange took a number of photographs and the men returned to their vehicle.
	
	
	At about 5.22 pm, the Accused arrived at the scene. Based on the account of Mr Strange, the Crown alleges that Mr Turner and Mr Strange were looking onto the property when a vehicle pulled up behind them. Mr Strange saw the Accused standing near the vehicle about 10 metres away. The Accused raised a .22 calibre rifle and shot Mr Turner once in the neck. Mr Turner dropped to one knee and said “Ian, what are you doing?”. Mr Turner managed to stand up, but was shot a second time in the upper-left chest region. Mr Turner stumbled towards his work vehicle to take cover from further gun fire.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the Accused then said “You have ruined the Turnbulls, you have had planes flying over here taking photographs, continually harassing us and taking us to court”. Mr Strange then said “Sir, he is hurt and I need to get him help. Please let me take him and get some help”. Mr Strange continued “Sir please this is not helping anyone, put the gun down and let us go”. Mr Strange again tried to get closer to the Accused, but the Accused pointed the rifle at Mr Strange and said “You will be shot if you don’t back up”.
	
	
	The Accused then walked towards the rear of the vehicle pointing the rifle towards Mr Turner. He then fired two shots through the canopy window, shattering the glass. One bullet hit Mr Turner in the chest area and penetrated his clothing, but not his skin. The second of those two shots did not hit Mr Turner.
	
	
	The Accused continued to point the rifle at Mr Turner and moved to the rear of the vehicle in an attempt to get a clear path to him. Mr Strange then said “Sir, I’m begging you, put the gun down and let me take him to hospital, you have hurt him and he needs some help”.
	
	
	By this stage, the Accused was at the rear of the vehicle and fired another shot in the direction of Mr Turner. Mr Turner attempted to run towards the tree line and the boundary to escape from the Accused, but the Accused shot him in the back and Mr Turner fell to the ground. That shot was fatal.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the Accused then said to Mr Strange “You can go now. I’ll be at home waiting for the police”. The Accused then got in his vehicle and left the scene.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that, on his way home, the Accused communicated with Mr Kennett over the two-way radio, saying to him “You there Scott? I’ve just shot Turner, I think he’s dead. I’m going home to wait for the police”.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the Accused, in the course of a conversation that evening as to why he had shot Mr Turner, said “I had no choice, he was ruining my family and it was never going to end”.
	
	
	The Accused was arrested by police later that evening.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the Accused fired his rifle at Mr Turner with the intention of killing him in revenge for Mr Turner’s investigation into the Accused’s land clearing activities in the Croppa Creek area.
	


Partial Defence of Substantial Impairment


	
	At the hearing on 18 December 2015, the Court was informed that the issue at trial will be substantial impairment.
	
	
	In considering the venue for trial by jury, it is useful to keep in mind the nature of the partial defence of substantial impairment and the role of the jury in considering that issue. In Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229; 227 A Crim R 217, with the agreement of MClellan CJ at CL and Fullerton J, I said at 224 [29]-[35]:
	


“29   Section 23A(1) Crimes Act 1900 permits a person tried for murder to be convicted of manslaughter in the following circumstance:

‘(1)    A person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if:

(a)    at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person’s capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person’s actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and

(b)    the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.’

30   ‘Underlying condition’ is defined in s.23A(8) as meaning ‘a pre-existing mental or physiological condition, other than a condition of a transitory kind’.

31   The onus lies upon the accused person to prove (on the balance of probabilities) that he or she is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of the section: s.23A(4).

32   For the purpose of s.23A(1)(b), evidence of an opinion that an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter is not admissible: s.23A(2).

33   It has been said that the issue under s.23A(1)(b) is a task for the tribunal of fact, which must approach that task in a broad commonsense way, involving a value judgment by the jury representing the community, and not a finding of medical fact: R v Trotter (1993) 35 NSWLR 428 at 431. It is often put to juries (as it was here) that an impairment is substantial if it is such as warrants the reduction of the crime from murder to manslaughter: R v Trotter at 431; R v Ryan (1995) 90 A Crim R 191 at 195; R v Majdalawi [2000] NSWCCA 240; 113 A Crim R 241 at 243 [10]-[11]. In R v Majdalawi, Adams J observed (at 247 [36]) that the ‘value judgment by the jury representing the community’ to which Hunt CJ at CL referred in R v Ryan ‘is a decision about culpability’ and hence ‘is not a medical question’.

34   The directions of Kirby J to the jury in the present case (which were not challenged on appeal) illustrate the way in which a jury is invited to determine the s.23A(1)(b) issue. Kirby J directed the jury that the distinction between murder and manslaughter ‘is both a legal distinction and a moral one’ (SU66). Manslaughter is regarded as ‘having less culpability than murder and it is, therefore, punished less severely’ (SU66). If that ‘incapacity did so operate and did impair him, then his moral blameworthiness would be reduced by reason of that impairment and the appropriate verdict would be manslaughter’ (SU68).

35   Section 23A(1)(b) has been described as giving rise to ‘an issue which is quintessentially one for the determination of a jury’: R v Hucker [2002] NSWSC 1068 at [2] (Howie J).”

Submissions on the Venue Issue

Submissions for the Crown


	
	The Crown submissions noted that there may be a question whether the Attorney General’s discretion to select venue (referred to in older authorities) had survived the passing of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. The Crown noted, without pressing for determination, that a submission may be available that the selection of the venue for trial is incidental or conducive to the exercise of the principal functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions, for the purpose of ss.7 and 20 Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986.
	
	
	Having flagged these matters, the Crown was content to proceed on the basis that ordinarily, as a rule of practice, a trial will proceed in the district in which the offence is alleged to have been committed. It was submitted that, however powerful the considerations favouring a local trial may be, they must give way to the paramount requirement that the trial of an accused person should be fair to all the parties: R v Vjestica [2008] VSCA 47; 182 A Crim R 350 at 353 [3]; R v Cattell (1968) 86 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 391 at 395-396.
	
	
	For the purpose of s.30 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the Crown submitted that the venue of trial should be moved from Moree to Sydney on the basis that:
	



	
	a fair or unprejudiced trial cannot otherwise be had: s.30(a);
	
	
	further, it is otherwise expedient for the venue to be changed: s.30(b).
	



	
	In light of the material contained in Crown affidavits, the Crown submitted that it had been established that a fair trial cannot be had at Moree, by reason of local prejudice or by reason of widespread prejudice among the class from which the jurors are to be selected, or because local prejudice might be thought to exist.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there is, at least, a strong perception of prejudice in favour of the Accused and, in particular, what is perceived to be his stance against the native vegetation laws.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence suggests that the very existence of those laws has created a strong feeling of resentment against those whose responsibility it is to enforce that legislative regime. Given that it is the Crown case that the motive for the shooting of Mr Turner was his role as an enforcement officer, the Crown submitted that it is unavoidable that the context of the trial will involve evidence of the prosecution of the Accused by Mr Turner for breaches of the Native Vegetation Act 2003.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Crown that, in determining this application, the Court should seek to “ensure that not only would a fair trial be had in fact, but that it should be had in such circumstances that all reasonable men would so admit”: R v Cattell at 396; R v Iaria and Panozzo [2004] VSC 96; 9 VR 425 at 426-427 [5].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the application did not depend upon the Crown establishing that pretrial publicity concerning the facts are such that a fair trial has been prejudiced. Rather, it is what the pretrial publicity reveals about what is said to be the pre-existing prejudice, and deep divisions within the community, that is important.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to statements made by various members during the Parliamentary debates for the Native Vegetation Bill 2003 and the Native Vegetation Amendment Bill 2014, as fortifying a conclusion that there were strong feelings, adverse to the native vegetation laws, held by rural communities, including the Moree community.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Crown that the difficulties revealed by the evidence in this case could not be met by appropriate directions from the trial Judge.
	
	
	It was submitted that the issue of substantial impairment appeared to be the real issue in the trial. To the extent that Moree witnesses may give evidence at the trial bearing upon this issue, then the jury would not only be asked to assess the partial defence of substantial impairment, but the credibility of witnesses living in the same district as themselves, and who may well be known to them directly or indirectly.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that to move the venue of the trial to Sydney would have the effect of neutralising any prospect of jurors having had personal contact with the deceased during the course of his employment, and also neutralise as an emotive issue the native vegetation laws.
	
	
	With respect to s.30(b), the Crown relied, as well, upon the evidence of difficulties in assembling sufficient potential jurors in Moree in recent years. It was submitted that this feature supported a conclusion that it was expedient for the venue of the trial to be changed.
	


Submissions for the Accused


	
	Mr Alexis SC, for the Accused, submitted that no proper basis had been demonstrated for the trial being held at a place other than Moree. He submitted that local publicity was insufficient to warrant a change of venue. It was submitted that the Court should attribute to jurors in a country town a sufficient understanding of their oaths in trying a case, to be guided by the evidence, and the evidence only.
	
	
	With respect to the local feelings alleged to exist concerning native vegetation laws, it was submitted that the context of the alleged offence is the land clearing on the Accused’s family’s properties, and that this was an unavoidable part of the trial.
	
	
	It was submitted that only three short media reports published on 31 July 2014 were relied upon by the Crown. These articles made no comments concerning the Accused’s culpability and made no comments favourable to the Accused.
	
	
	Insofar as comments were reported from the Mayor of the Moree Plains Shire Council, Katrina Humphries, it was submitted that the article had expressed horror that things had broken down so badly as to come to violence, but did not justify the actions of the Accused.
	
	
	Mr Alexis SC submitted that the limited media coverage in no way suggested that a Moree jury would be unfairly biased and needed direction.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Accused that the present trial will be no different to other trials that occur in regional communities. It was noted that the matter in issue will be the question of substantial impairment, a quintessential jury question. There would be very few disputes as to facts requiring members of the jury to come to a view about the credibility of persons in the community. It was submitted that the Accused should be tried by a jury of his peers in the district where the offence occurred.
	
	
	With respect to the issue of expedience under s.30(b), it was submitted that the Moree Court House had adequate facilities to hold a Supreme Court jury trial.
	
	
	Mr Alexis SC submitted that it is in the public interest that an offence would ordinarily be tried in the district in which it is alleged to have been committed.
	
	
	He submitted that the Crown had not established that there is a real risk that a trial held in Moree will not be fair, or that any such risk cannot be controlled by the procedures of the trial. He submitted further that witness convenience and expense were also important considerations and that these matters did not favour a change of venue.
	


Decision

The Statutory Test for Change of Venue


	
	Section 30 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides as follows:
	


“30    Change of venue

In any criminal proceedings, if it appears to the court:

(a)    that a fair or unprejudiced trial cannot otherwise be had, or

(b)    that for any other reason it is expedient to do so,

the court may change the venue, and direct the trial to be held in such other district, or at such other place, as the court thinks fit, and may for that purpose make all such orders as justice appears to require.”


	
	Section 30 has a long history, having been located previously in s.13 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and, before then, in s.577 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The provision has been referred to in decisions of Courts made prior to the enactment of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. Those decisions emphasised that it was the Attorney General who had the primary responsibility and power in selecting the venue of trial, and that his or her right would not be lightly interfered with: Lemon v Attorney General (1932) 50 WN (NSW) 19 at 19-20; R v Holden (1956) 73 WN (NSW) 444 at 445; R v Dorrington [1969] 1 NSWR 381 at 382.
	
	
	The Crown did not advance a submission, which called for any determination, that the enactment of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 operated to place the Director of Public Prosecutions in the shoes of the Attorney General with respect to venue for trial: cf Blackmore and Hosking, “Criminal Law (NSW)”, Thomson Reuters, paragraph [4.1150].
	
	
	What may be noted, however, is that cases in this State which have emphasised the exercise of discretion by the Attorney General with respect to trial venue are no longer apt, given the absence of any function of the Attorney General concerning selection of trial venue in the contemporary criminal justice system.
	
	
	The matter proceeded on the understanding that s.30 has application to this case, and that the Court should apply relevant principles attaching to that provision in resolving the question.
	
	
	The parties accepted that the change of venue function in s.30 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 applies equally to the Supreme and District Courts.
	
	
	With respect to indictable criminal matters which are to proceed in the District Court, it is the practice that an accused person is committed for trial to the nearest proclaimed place where the District Court is to sit, in accordance with directions made by the Chief Judge of the District Court for the purpose of s.173 District Court Act 1973; Rules 7, 10(2)(f), Part 53, District Court Rules.
	
	
	In the case of matters which are to proceed in the Supreme Court, all accused persons are committed for trial to appear in the Arraignments List in Sydney sitting usually on the first Friday of each month between February and December: clause 5-6, Practice Note SC CL2 Supreme Court Common Law Division - Criminal Proceedings.
	
	
	In the case of the Supreme Court, it is a question for the Judge fixing a matter for trial in the Arraignments List to nominate a venue, with that decision being made in the light of a variety of factors which may bear upon that question as raised by the parties following arraignment.
	
	
	The present application is not one to change a venue for trial already fixed by the Court. Rather, it is one to determine the appropriate venue for trial following the arraignment of the Accused.
	
	
	The presumption in favour of a local trial is a rule of practice and not a rule of law: R v Vjestica at 353 [3].
	
	
	Each application for change of venue (or for trial other than a local trial) falls to be considered on its own merits, without preconceptions. It is not necessary for an applicant to show exceptional circumstances. Nor is the applicant to be regarded as bearing a heavy onus. It is both necessary and sufficient for the applicant to show that the change of venue is necessary for the purpose of securing a fair and impartial trial: R v Vjestica at 353 [4].
	
	
	Many factors may bear upon the assessment of merits. I agree with the following observations of Teague J in R v Vandergulik [2008] VSC 17 at [6]:
	


“In short, each application must be considered on its own merits. ‘Merits’ can involve consideration of many factors, including but not limited to fairness, the perception of fairness, local concerns, pre-trial publicity, inconvenience, and health. A trial should ordinarily proceed in the district in which the offence charged is alleged to have been committed. On the other hand, and in my assessment, relatively more importantly a trial should be held in such circumstances that all reasonable men would admit that a fair trial could be held.”


	
	The term “expedient” is used in s.30(b) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. In R v Leitch [1998] 1 NZLR 420 at 428-429, Richardson P (in the judgment of the Court) said:
	


“`Expedient’ is frequently used in statutes – according to a computer check it appears 1116 times in the statute book. While there may be shades of meaning of the word, depending on the context, reference to standard dictionaries brings out its basic meaning: The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed): ‘Conducive to advantage in general, or to a definite purpose; fit, proper, or suitable to the circumstances of the case'; more expansively, Webster's Third New International Dictionary definition is ‘characterized by suitability, practicality, and efficiency in achieving a particular end: fit, proper, or advantageous under the circumstances’; Black's Law Dictionary (5th ed) definition is: ‘Apt and suitable to end in view. . . . Whatever is suitable and appropriate in reason for the accomplishment of a specified object’'; and closer to home The Macquarie Dictionary gives as the primary meaning: ‘tending to promote some proposed or desired object; fit or suitable for the purpose; proper in the circumstances’.”.


	
	As assessment of what is expedient in a particular case will involve a practical consideration of matters bearing upon the balance of convenience for the purpose of a jury trial. In the present case, this involves not only issues such as cost and location of witnesses, but importantly, the capacity of the relevant country location to provide numerically for potential jurors so that a jury trial could practically and efficiently proceed at that country location.
	


The s.30(a) Issue - Fair or Unprejudiced Trial


	
	There are some most unusual features to this application. The evidence indicates the expression of a significant level of community feeling in the Moree district concerning the native vegetation laws, and the impact of those laws upon the local rural community.
	
	
	In the course of an article in “The Daily Telegraph” dated 31 July 2014 (Annexure C, affidavit of Mark Dight, 3 November 2015), the following appears:
	


“Moree Plains Shire Council Mayor Katrina Humphries said the relationship between conservationists, the government and local farmers had become toxic: ‘Ian [the Accused] is a well known and respected member of the community - he has been part of the community forever. I’m horrified things have broken down so badly’.

…

Agricultural Minister Barnaby Joyce endorsed the Mayor’s comments, saying the situation on the land ‘has a very hostile environment’.

He said farmers hated native vegetation laws, which had created incredible animosity towards the government.

‘This is not an isolated incident, this is just the worst of a range of incidents’, he said. 

Ecologist Phil Spark, who has worked in the Croppa Creek community, said some land owners knew they couldn’t afford to lose another tree. But others were clearing vegetation to take advantage of the rich agricultural soil and there was friction between the groups: ‘There is a lot of fear and threats’.”


	
	In an article in “The Sydney Morning Herald” dated 31 July 2014 (Exhibit D, affidavit of Mark Dight, 3 November 2015), the following appears:
	


“In 2010, talkback host Alan Jones made an ominous prediction regarding the growing stoush between NSW farmers, who were defending their right to remove vegetation on their own properties, and environmentalists, who believed significant clearing was doing irreversible damage.

‘The behaviour of this department is the kind of behaviour that leads people to murder’, he said of the supposedly heavy handed way the Department of Environment and Climate Change was enforcing the Native Vegetation Act.

Tensions over illegal clearing at Croppa Creek, which includes a koala habitat, has led to previous threats to Mr Turner and other departmental workers, Fairfax Media has learnt.

State and federal governments had investigated clearing on the Turnbulls land since 2011 but it did not stop, said ecologist, Phillip Spark, who has documented changes there over three years.

…

Northwest NSW has been a ‘hotbed’ for the bitter stoush over land clearing, Total Environment Centre Executive Director Jeff Angel said. 

‘Some of those farmers feel very strongly about private property rights but the fact is almost 10 years … the rate of clearing is equal to that of some South American countries in soil resources and dozens of threatened species were in danger so there was a reason to intervene’, he said.

Moree Plains Shire Mayor Katrina Humphries said the frustration had become so intense violence was ‘always going to happen’.

‘I thought it would happen over coal or gas or water’, she said. ‘The frustration is so great, but obviously to have an outcome like that is so horrible. What are we doing, as communities, as Australians, what are we doing that a tragedy like this happens through absolute frustration?’”


	
	In an article in “The Northern Daily Leader” dated 31 July 2014 (Annexure E, affidavit of Mark Dight, 3 November 2015), the following appears:
	


“The issue has been simmering for years in the local area as the debate rages on about the clearing of vegetation.”


	
	The hearsay rule does not apply to this evidence adduced on the present interlocutory application: s.75 Evidence Act 1995. This evidence indicates, in my view, a long-standing level of tension in the community in the Moree district with respect to native vegetation laws. This is not a transient state of affairs. This is an unusual and significant factor in the determination of this application.
	
	
	The extracts from the Parliamentary debates surrounding the Native Vegetation Bill 2003 and the Native Vegetation Amendment Bill 2014, to which the Court was taken during argument, serve to fortify the conclusion that there are strong community feelings in rural areas, including the Moree district, with respect to native vegetation laws. To that extent, the Parliamentary debates are relevant to this application.
	
	
	I am satisfied that there is a very real concern as to whether a trial, which would be regarded as a fair trial by all reasonable persons, can be held if the trial venue was Moree.
	
	
	The process of jury selection, and directions to the jury by the trial Judge might ameliorate the position to an extent. However, there is at least a reasonable perception that there will not be a fair trial, being a trial which is fair to both the Crown and the Accused.
	
	
	It is appropriate to move to matters which bear upon s.30(b) of the Act, before determining the issue of the appropriate trial venue.
	


The s.30(b) Issue - Expedient for any Other Reason


	
	A number of factors were addressed for the purpose of s.30(b) of the Act. These included witness availability and witness convenience, cost and the interests of Mr Turner’s family and the Accused’s family so far as the location of the trial is concerned.
	
	
	A further and important factor addressed in the evidence was the suggested difficulty in empanelling a jury for the purpose of a trial at Moree. The Court was informed that there had not been a Supreme Court jury trial at Moree for some 20 years. However, the District Court sits at Moree from time to time for the purpose of criminal jury trials.
	
	
	The evidence indicates that the Moree Court House has facilities which enable its use for a criminal trial involving a jury of 12 persons.
	
	
	However, the evidence also indicates that there have been difficulties in empanelling a jury at the Moree District Court in recent times because of insufficient numbers of potential jurors attending.
	
	
	The affidavit of Detective Senior Constable McCarthy affirmed 18 December 2015 indicates the position as expressed by Ms Carol Bell, who has worked in the Office of the Sheriff at Moree Court House for some 22 years. She states that there have been problems empanelling a jury at Moree. Ms Bell explained that this was not necessarily because potential jurors did not comply with their summonses, although that does occur. Rather, Ms Bell stated that most potential jurors who are excused from jury duty in Moree are excused because they live outside the 65 km zone, have work or travel commitments or have children to care for.
	
	
	In support of this was information concerning a number of jury panels called for jury duty at the Moree District Court in 2015. A trial listed in March 2015 could not proceed as a jury could not be empanelled, with the matter thereafter being transferred to Dubbo District Court.
	
	
	During the October 2015 sittings at Moree, the trial of three men from Narrabri was unable to proceed as a jury was not able to be empanelled.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Accused that any concerns in this respect could be met by summonsing additional jury panels, so as to increase the number of persons required to attend. On the evidence before the Court, I am not at all sure that this would be of great assistance in the present context.
	
	
	The difficulty appears to have been the large number of potential jurors who have been excused for reasons associated with distance from the Moree township, and matters related to employment and family commitments. The Crown informed the Court that April is the cotton harvesting season in Moree (T26, 18 December 2105). This aspect would further complicate the position with respect to the availability of members of the local rural community.
	
	
	Added to this is the reasonable expectation that a considerable number of persons, attending as potential jurors, would have some association with the Accused and his family or a Crown witness or witnesses. A further aspect in this case would involve the trial Judge informing the jury panel that persons with views concerning the native vegetation laws, which would impact upon a person’s capacity to act in a fair and unprejudiced fashion in trying the Accused, should apply to be excused.
	
	
	In assessing factors relevant to s.30(b), I have had regard to practical issues including cost, witness location and availability, the witnesses likely to be required (given the issues in the trial) and the wishes of the families of Mr Turner and the Accused concerning trial venue.
	
	
	An important issue for the purpose of s.30(b) is the practical question as to whether the processes of the Jury Act 1977 will, in this case, provide sufficient potential jurors for the trial to actually proceed in Moree. Upon the evidence on this application, there is a very substantial concern that the Court would not be in a position to empanel a jury at any trial of the Accused at Moree in April 2016.
	
	
	In these circumstances, this is an additional important factor under s.30(b) pointing away from a Moree venue, to be considered together with the conclusion reached by the Court concerning the “fair or unprejudiced trial” factor under s.30(a) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	I note that the Court has not had regard to any possible difficulty which may arise surrounding the Accused’s health if the trial was held at Moree. Although there was some discussion concerning this topic at the hearing on 18 December 2015, it was stated by Mr Alexis SC, that if this issue was to assume importance, an opportunity would be sought to adduce further evidence. The issue has not played any part in my determination concerning venue.
	
	
	I have kept in mind the desire of the Accused for a trial at the earliest available time. That consideration involves a trial in April 2016 with, as I have said, the issue being the appropriate venue for the trial.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having considered the matters arising for consideration on this application under s.30(a) and (b) Criminal Procedure Act 1986, I am well satisfied that the venue for this trial should not be Moree. Given the strong desirability of a trial in April 2016, the venue for the trial is to be Sydney.
	
	
	It was for these reasons that I made an order on 18 December 2015 directing that the trial of the Accused proceed at the Supreme Court in Sydney in April 2016.

2768937,Application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police dated 10 March 2016 re matter 2015/156458 [2016] NSWSC 255,"Judgment


	
	This is an application for forfeiture orders under s 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth). The Court is required to make an order that the specified property is forfeited to the Commonwealth if the requirements of s 49(1) are relevantly established.
	
	
	In the present case there are three requirements. The first is that the Applicant for the order is a responsible authority. The Applicant, being the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, is such an authority.
	
	
	The second requirement is that the restraining order has been in force for at least six months. The restraining orders were made by Hamill J on 27 July 2015. That requirement is, therefore satisfied.
	
	
	The third requirement is that the Court is satisfied that the authority has taken reasonable steps to identify and notify persons with an interest in the property. There are five such persons, being, Vergara Rodriquez, Federico Gonzalez Magana, Siaki Lavaki, also known as Anthony Lione, Sisifa Tufunga and Steve Fine Lapu’aho.
	
	
	I am satisfied from the affidavits of Nicole Marie Van Lent affirmed 2 September 2015, Jeffrey Aaron Kokles sworn 1 March 2016, Jody Brian Earl sworn 2 March 2016, and Trenton Schmidt affirmed 3 March 2016, that the five known persons have either been served or that the authority has taken reasonable steps to identify and to notify such persons.
	
	
	No application has been made by any person to exclude property from the restraining order. In these circumstances the requirement under s 39(1)(c) of the Act is not required to be established.
	
	
	Accordingly, I make orders in terms of paras 1 to 5 of the short minutes of order. I note that there is to be no order as to costs and that proceedings are now finalised.

		22 March 2016",2016-03-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768941,R v Hobson [2016] NSWDC 177,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Virtually no-one in the community could be unaware of the link between methylamphetamine use and crime, particularly violent crime, so those who voluntarily take methylamphetamine can scarcely complain when they receive little or no reduction in sentence because their violent offences were committed under the influence of that drug.
	
	
	We have an example of such a crime here today. Whilst under the influence of ice the offender, Frederick Gilbert Hobson, committed an offence of considerable seriousness. It has had enormous impact upon the victim of that offence.
	
	
	It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence imposed by an offender must bear a relationship to the objective gravity of that offence. For that reason Mr Hobson must go to gaol for a considerable period of time.
	
	
	The offender was a regular user of ice. He needed money to get more of that drug. When he ran out of money and could not afford to buy the drug anymore he had a choice, he could have recognised the fact that he could not afford it and just not used it anymore, or he could have, and this is what he did, plan to commit a criminal offence which involved no consideration as to the victim of that offence but was concerned only with his desire to obtain money so that he could get more drugs.
	
	
	Some of his associates had told him about some premises where there was believed to be a safe inside, and so the offender armed himself with a metal baton and some gloves and went to those premises. Living there was a 65 year old woman who raised three foster children. She lived by herself, apart from her children, having divorced from her husband some time before.
	
	
	It is important to understand what I am about to describe shows that the offender was not one of those who committed the offence of break, enter and steal who wished to get in and out of the premises undetected, it was entirely necessary for him to carry out his plan that Ms Hanson was home because he needed her to open the safe he believed to be installed in the premises. And so this is what happened.
	
	
	After Ms Hanson’s foster children had gone to school, she was left alone. At about 8.30am the offender knocked on her door. She answered it. The offender said that his car had broken down and asked to use her phone. Very sensibly Ms Hanson said that he could not. She told Mr Hobson that she had children inside. This was not true, but Mr Hobson was not to know that. It is important to bear that circumstance in mind when I describe what later happened, and that is that Mr Hobson was at least aware of the risk that Ms Hanson was telling the truth and that there were children present when he did what he did.
	
	
	Having been told that he could not use her phone, the offender said, “Can I have your mobile then? I have a pregnant wife in the car.” Again, very sensibly, Ms Hanson said “No”, shut the wooden front door and locked the deadbolt. The offender was not to be deterred. He walked around from the front door to the rear of the house and climbed on to a second storey balcony. He had the baton, about 45 centimetres long, in his hand. He used the baton to hit a glass sliding door in an attempt to smash it open. Ms Hanson was only metres away from that glass door, sitting at a computer desk. She saw and heard what the offender was trying to do. She quite understandably was panicked and terrified.
	
	
	The offender was unable to smash that glass door but still he was undeterred. He moved to a second glass door and found that was closed but unlocked. Ms Hanson realised that the door was unlocked and so she fled to the front door to escape. The offender by now had opened that unlocked door and followed her. She made it to her front door and opened it partially, but before she could get through it the offender ran up behind her and shouldered the door closed. He prevented Ms Hanson from leaving. She struggled, but could not get the door open.
	
	
	She said to him, “Just let me go, don’t hurt me,” and the offender said “No”. Completely unprovoked he then swung the baton towards Ms Hanson’s head. She lifted her left arm up in a defensive manner so that the baton did not strike her head, as Mr Hobson obviously intended, but struck her left arm instead. She felt immediate pain. He then began to scream at her. He said, “Open the fucking safe, I don’t want to hurt you.”
	
	
	Ms Hanson was able to run to the master bedroom where she opened the window and screamed, “Help, I’m being robbed”. The offender followed her and closed the window. He said, “Just open the safe. Where is the key? You rich people don’t use banks, you put all the money in the safe.” Ms Hanson said, “My husband has the key, he is at work.” At this stage the offender saw a set of keys inside the lock of the door to the master bedroom. He pulled them out of the lock and made Ms Hanson explain what each key was for. None were for her safe.
	
	
	This seems to have made the offender even angrier. He hit Ms Hanson to her chest with the end of the baton two to three times, causing her to step backwards. He said, “I want the key, I want the key.” Ms Hanson tried to placate him. She said, “I’ll give you all of the money that is in my purse.” She then got her handbag that was sitting on the bed. She had about $150 in notes and some change. She gave the notes to the offender and said, “That’s all I’ve got, my husband left me for shopping.”
	
	
	Once more the offender was not to be deterred. He said, “I want more, get me more.” He then picked up her handbag and tipped it upside down, emptying the contents onto the bed. An iPad fell out and the offender took it. Ms Hanson said, “Please leave me the iPad, I’m not a rich woman.” Mr Hobson threw the iPad back onto the bed and said, “Where is all your jewellery?” Ms Hanson took two gold chains from around her neck and gave them to the offender. He left those chains on the bed and instead took some other jewellery, a gold chain that was sitting on a chest of drawers, and took also a gold watch and a rose coloured beaded bracelet, putting those into his pocket.
	
	
	That still was not enough though. The offender said, “I don’t want to hurt you, just give me the fucking key,” and again Ms Hanson told him that her husband gives her nothing, “He is at work with the key”. At this stage the offender seems to have finally given up. He walked to the front door and found it was locked. He told Ms Hanson, “Open the door” and Ms Hanson complied, saying “Okay, just leave”.
	
	
	However for reasons that are not entirely clear the offender was not finished. He made a nasty threat to Ms Hanson. He told her that if she called the police he would come back and shoot her. He then took hold of the collar of her jacket and pulled her through the hallway. He picked up the house phone and pulled out the cord from the back of the phone and the wall socket. He picked up a brown jewellery box containing a silver locket, a silver peacock brooch, a green jewelled heart brooch and small trinkets. He pulled Ms Hanson over to the glass sliding doors on the ground floor. She opened the doors for the offender, and he said, “Stand by the door so I can see you because I will come back and hurt you.” Finally he went outside, picking up a large square bag that he had been carrying earlier and ran away.
	
	
	Ms Hanson eventually ran to her neighbour’s house and police were alerted. Police attended the scene and they conducted patrols. They found the offender walking in the nearby vicinity carrying the black bag. He was stopped and arrested. A search of the bag revealed Ms Hanson’s property, the baton, two pairs of gloves, a Stanley knife and some items of clothing.
	
	
	When first taken back to the police station he was not in a fit state to be interviewed, but when he was interviewed he made admissions to having committed the offence. He explained that he had been told that Ms Hanson does not believe in banks, he said “that’s what I heard and that she has a safe”.
	
	
	To say that this offence is serious is an understatement. To say that its effects upon Ms Hanson were serious is also an understatement. She gave sworn evidence today as to the effect of that sustained period of terror upon her. Not surprisingly she explained that as the offence was taking place she did feel terrified and in the aftermath she has suffered significantly. Firstly, there were the physical consequences of the assaults upon her. She said she was bruised and found it difficult to get around, but of course more important perhaps than the physical consequences are the psychological consequences. Ms Hanson said that she was emotionally distraught and all she wanted to do was sleep. Previously Ms Hanson said who she did a lot of community work and she was the sort of person that people went to when they wanted to get things done in the community, but since the offence her ability to do such work has suffered enormously, to the extent that she no longer does it, explaining that she cannot stand confrontation and does not want to be put in the spotlight. She has no confidence and everywhere she goes she takes someone with her. In circumstances where she lives alone this lack of confidence impacts upon her considerably.
	
	
	Perhaps the most distressing consequence for Ms Hanson concerns the circumstance that she is no longer a foster parent. She had been a foster parent for ten and a half years, but the agency decided that after this offence she was not well enough either physically or mentally to keep the children. She feels keenly the consequences of the offender’s awful crime. She now has alarms installed throughout the house and cameras around the house. The consequences for Ms Hanson have gone far beyond what would ordinarily be expected from an offence of break, enter and steal whilst armed with an offensive weapon, but those consequences are entirely foreseeable given the nature of the offender’s violent crime.
	
	
	When sentencing the offender for the offence to which he pleaded guilty in the Local Court, aggravated break, enter and steal whilst armed with an offensive instrument, I am asked to take into account a common assault on the Form 1. That common assault relates to aspects of the offender’s behaviour whilst in the home. A debate arose in the course of submissions as to whether I could take into account that the offender’s conduct within the house went beyond that which would establish a mere common assault. I believe that I can, being careful of course not to double count by increasing the sentence that I would otherwise impose because of the presence of the Form 1 and also by taking into account those aspects of the offender’s conduct which amount to common assault when considering the objective gravity of the substantive offence.
	
	
	Ultimately, however, it probably does not make a lot of difference given the number of aggravating circumstances which I am undoubtedly entitled to take into account when assessing the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. Although the Crown has chosen to charge the circumstance of aggravation being that the offender was armed with an offensive weapon, the Crown could have selected other circumstances of statutory aggravation; for example, the offender well knew that there was a person inside when he broke into Ms Hanson’s premises, indeed, as I have explained, it was part of his plan that she be there. Also Ms Hanson’s liberty was deprived by the offender’s conduct. She wanted to get outside through the front door to escape, but he shouldered the door closed and prevented her from doing so.
	
	
	It is fortunate that Ms Hanson’s property was recovered, but it is instructive to consider what the offender took. There is no evidence as to whether the jewellery was expensive or not, but the thing about jewellery is that it often has a sentimental value which far exceeds its monetary value. People like the offender, who think nothing of the legitimate rights of the victims of their offences, do not really care that they may be taking something which they would be able to sell for only a few dollars but which is of enormous sentimental value to the person deprived of it.
	
	
	I should mention that the maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years’ imprisonment. There is also a standard non parole period of five years. I have taken both the maximum penalty and the standard non parole period into account in assessing the appropriate penalty. My reasons for not imposing the standard non parole period appear in these remarks on sentence. They primarily relate to the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct which I assess as being well above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I take into account, of course, that the offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to this offence and so he is entitled to a discount of 25% from the sentence I would otherwise have imposed, to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea.
	
	
	Somewhat remarkably the offender’s criminal history consists of a single offence of obtaining property by deception for which he was fined $500, that offence being committed in 2014. It is remarkable that the offender’s serious criminal offending would commence with an offence of such seriousness as the one I have described.
	
	
	Mr Hobson is a Maori, he was born in New Zealand and in his early childhood he lived something of an idyllic lifestyle, living with extended family in a traditional Maori community on the north island of New Zealand. There was no history of domestic violence, substance abuse or neglect in the offender’s early childhood. However when he was aged about 12 the family moved to Auckland apparently because of his father’s illness. He suffered from diabetes and indeed had both legs amputated when the offender was aged 16 and tragically died when he was a couple of years older. The death of Mr Hobson’s father seems to have precipitated his use of substances as well as an affiliation with gang culture.
	
	
	The offender moved to Australia with his partner in 2011 when he was aged 22, living with his mother and brothers in Revesby from 2014. Although his brothers have been substance users, they have managed to avoid criminal convictions and indeed have maintained full employment. He has a close relationship to his mother, but clearly did not take her advice when she advised him to go into rehabilitation in 2015, advice he laments that he did not accept.
	
	
	As is obvious these offences relate to the offender’s use of drugs. He started using cannabis and alcohol at about 18 following his father’s death, but matters escalated in 2015 when he commenced smoking methylamphetamine and he quickly developed a daily habit. He stopped working, rarely slept or ate and lost a significant amount of weight. He was aggressive and committed offences to support his habit.
	
	
	Since going into custody, bail refused, he has improved physically and there are no misconduct charges on his custodial history. He was granted bail at one stage but breached that bail and so has had a couple of periods of pre sentence custody, such that the sentence I will announce shortly will commence on 27 September 2015.
	
	
	The offender told a psychologist that he did not consider the moral implications of his behaviour at the time he committed the offence, being strictly focussed on obtaining money to purchase methylamphetamine. How many times has a sentencing judge heard such expressions. Drugs are terrible things, they do cause people like Mr Hobson to commit terrible crimes, however, as I began these remarks on sentence, not too much can be made of that because it was Mr Hobson’s voluntary consumption of the drug ice, a decision made in full understanding of what ice does to people which has seen him before the courts for sentence today. He told the psychologist “It’s the ice, it’s ruined everything”. He is probably accurate in that.
	
	
	Of course the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation are linked to the likelihood that he will give up drugs once released from custody. As I mentioned it is remarkable that the offender has no prior convictions before 2014 and that was only for a very minor matter, although that has to be balanced by the circumstance that the offender did say to the psychologist that he had committed crimes in order to obtain drugs. However the fact that the offender’s criminal history is as limited as it is does tend to suggest that if the offender can give up drugs, there is a very good chance that he will not commit further offences in the future.
	
	
	A sentence imposed upon someone has to reflect both offence and the offender. The offender’s misconduct was very serious indeed. As I have mentioned more than once he planned to threaten Ms Hanson, he planned to terrify her, he struck her when she was cooperating with him and the consequences for Ms Hanson have been enormous. That is enough to explain the sentence I will now announce.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of six years to date from 27 September 2015, and a head sentence of eight and a half years. The offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 26 September 2021. As is obvious I have made a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour. They relate to the need to assist him to give up his drug use, which will assist him to avoid committing offences in the future. Both he and the community will benefit thus from an extended period of supervision on parole.

		23 August 2016",2016-03-10 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768942,Application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police dated 10 March 2016 re matter 2015/208401 [2016] NSWSC 280,"Judgment


	
	This is an application for forfeiture orders under s 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act at 2002 (Cth). Under that section the Court must make orders if the requirements of s 49(1) are satisfied.
	
	
	In the present case there are three requirements. The first is that it is a responsible authority that makes application under the section, and I find that the AFP Commissioner is a responsible authority. The second requirement is that the restraining order has been in force for at least six months. Restraining orders were made by Justice Beech-Jones on 2 September 2015 and that requirement is satisfied.
	
	
	The third requirement in the present case is that the Court be satisfied that the authority has taken reasonable steps to identify and notify persons with an interest in the property. I am satisfied from the affidavit of Jody Earl, affirmed 14 September 2015, and the affidavit of Scott Murphy, sworn 8 March 2016, that the three interested persons, Pratheepan Sinnarasa and Ravi Srinivasan and Jose Pablo Herrero-Calvo have all been notified of the orders having been made.
	
	
	Mr Kumar of counsel appeared this morning for Pratheepan Sinnarasa and sought an adjournment for five or six weeks to enable him to get instructions from Mr Sinnarasa in relation to the matter.
	
	
	At or about the time that the property was seized in 2011, a letter was written from a firm of solicitors called Success Lawyers and Barristers saying that they represented Mr Sinnarasa and they put forward an explanation for the presence of the large amount of money in their clients’ possession. They enclosed what were said to be business records and which were said to show that he operated a cash remittance business. That was the explanation for his possession of the money.
	
	
	Since 28 February 2011 nothing has been heard from that firm of lawyers nor from Mr Sinnarasa until the present application for the adjournment was made this morning. Mr Sinnarasa has had a number of opportunities to make an application in relation to the seized funds but he has not done so. His counsel this morning was not able to give me any indication upon what basis it would be suggested that the money was legitimately in his possession when it was seized.
	
	
	For these reasons I refuse the adjournment.
	
	
	Since no application has been made for property to be excluded from the restraining orders that have been made, it is not necessary for the Court to be satisfied of the matters set out in s 49(1)(c) of the Act which relates the seized property to the commission of offences.
	
	
	The relevant requirements of s 49 have been satisfied and the orders sought by the Commissioner should be made.
	
	
	I note the usual undertaking is given by the applicant’s solicitor. I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the orders signed by me and dated today.

		17 March 2016",2016-03-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768945,Da Silva v R [2016] NSWCCA 40,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: The applicant, Ricardo Da Silva, is due to stand trial for murder, commencing on 26 April 2016 in the Supreme Court at Newcastle. On 8 December 2015 he filed a motion seeking orders that the trial date be vacated and the matter remitted to the Local Court for a committal hearing and otherwise that the venue for the trial be changed from Newcastle to Sydney. On 14 December 2015 Johnson J dismissed the motion. [1]  The applicant has sought leave to appeal from the order dismissing the notice of motion.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) an accused person in proceedings for prosecution on indictment in the Supreme Court has a right to seek leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings. The Prosecutor concedes that the order made by Johnson J was an interlocutory order and that the Court has jurisdiction under s 5F to consider the application for leave and, if granted, the appeal. Nevertheless, the prosecutor submits that the application for leave should be refused on two bases. The first is that the grounds lack merit; the second is that the application is out of time. Indeed, because the appeal lacks merit, the prosecutor says the extension of time should be refused.
	
	
	The application was dated 18 February 2016, but was not filed in the Court until 26 February 2016. An affidavit sworn on 18 February 2016 was filed at the same time as the application. An annexure to the application gave adequate reasons for the delay. The appropriate course is to grant an extension of time up to and including 26 February 2016.
	
	
	The operative relief sought involved two orders, namely, (a) to have the matter stayed and returned for a committal hearing in the Local Court at Wyong and (b), if necessary, to have the trial returned to Sydney. This morning, the applicant has emphasised the second of the two orders sought. In respect of the first matter, the grounds alleged a denial of procedural fairness and an abuse of process, presumably based upon proceeding to trial on an indictment without a committal hearing. There was also an allegation of pre-judgment by Johnson J, relating to his refusal to grant this particular order.
	
	
	With respect to the change of venue, the grounds identified were “high likelihood of jury bias” and “denial of adequate facilities to prepare a defence.” The emphasis in the submissions this morning has been on the likelihood that there will be difficulties in obtaining through a jury selection process conducted in Newcastle, a jury which is able to deal fairly with the trial and the accused.
	
	
	With the exception of the claim of bias on the part of the primary judge, neither the application nor the affidavit identified errors in the reasoning of the primary judge, but rather sought to re-agitate factual matters which had been raised before him. It is appropriate to deal first with the allegation of bias by way of pre-judgment.
	


Prejudgment of application


	
	The allegation of pre-judgment was based entirely upon an email message from the associate to Johnson J dated 8 December 2015 (six days before the hearing of the motion) addressed to the applicant’s solicitor. It attached copies of two judgments, namely Potier v Magistrate Maloney [2]  and Crowe v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW). [3] 
	
	
	Potier was a case in which an accused sought a further committal hearing on the basis that an earlier committal had miscarried. The judge concluded that, the Director having determined to proceed in the District Court by filing an indictment, the magistrate’s decision to commit the accused for trial had been “overtaken by the decision to find a bill”. [4]  That case followed a line of authority to similar effect, referred to in Crowe and dating back to Sergi v Director of Public Prosecutions. [5] 
	
	
	Given that the applicant’s notice of motion sought similar relief, it was appropriate for the primary judge to draw the attention of his legal representatives to authority which, if not distinguishable, appeared to stand in his way.
	
	
	It is not entirely clear whether this ground alleged actual pre-judgment (of which there was no evidence) or merely a reasonable apprehension of pre-judgment. The latter invokes a lesser test, namely an objective (rather than a subjective) test of whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the issue for determination. [6]  Even by that relaxed standard, the complaint fails. The exchanges between the Court and lawyers will regularly lead to the judge raising for consideration legal authority which may be against the application being presented. That authority may be known to the lawyer appearing, especially if, as in this case, it is counsel with long experience in criminal law and practice.
	
	
	The judge, it may be noted, was not determining any criminal proceeding; he was merely dealing with an interlocutory application relating to pre-trial procedures. The application was by no means unimportant; it was, however, dealt with in one of a number of pre-trial hearings routinely held and designed to ensure that, once a jury is empanelled, the criminal trial will proceed expeditiously and without unnecessary delay. By way of illustration, the present matter was in the arraignment list on 11 September 2015. It had previously been the subject of a hearing resulting in a timetable of procedural steps on 5 December 2014 and on 21 August 2015.
	
	
	When the matter was in the list on 14 December 2015, the judge noted that he had earlier transcripts of 5 December 2014 and 11 September 2015, copies of which he made available to counsel. Both parties were represented; Mr Scragg, on behalf of the applicant, made submissions in relation to the orders sought in the motion. There was no complaint about the step taken by the primary judge in drawing the attention of the applicant’s representatives to relevant authority, nor in relation to such a matter would complaint be expected. Nevertheless, it is a powerful reason for rejecting the allegation now made.
	
	
	In the course of the hearing on 14 December, the following exchange took place: [7] 
	


“HIS HONOUR: What do you want to say in support of paragraph 1 of the notice of motion?

SCRAGG: The application is upon the basis that the accused was denied the opportunity to have or to participate in a full committal hearing, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well, even if he was, where would that take it? This matter has been in this Court for more than a year. He was arraigned and pleaded not guilty in December last year. The matter has not progressed very far this year. Lawyers have been changed. The Crown has referred to the relevant cases. I think two of those cases I brought to the attention of your solicitor last week, through my Associate.

SCRAGG: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: So I would like you to move directly to deal with those questions.

SCRAGG: Well, I have read those cases, your Honour, and I understand what those cases provide for your Honour. All I can say, your Honour, is that I seek to distinguish those cases that in this case the committal proceedings were waived when the accused had not given his instructions to waive the committal and in those circumstances, your Honour, I seek to distinguish it. That there, in my submission, has been a failure to provide the accused with his entitlement to seek to have a full committal hearing, if I can put it that way.


	
	The issues which were raised, and others which might have been raised, were addressed by the primary judge; there was nothing in the transcript or the supply of relevant authorities which gave any hint of inappropriate pre-judgment. The allegation of bias is without substance and leave to raise the matter should be refused.
	


Request for committal hearing


	
	The first substantive order sought before the primary judge, and to be sought in this Court if leave to appeal be granted, is for a committal hearing before the Local Court.
	
	
	Following the murder in May 2010, the applicant was arrested and charged with a related but presently immaterial offence. (It gained some publicity relied on in relation to the next matter.) On 30 November 2013 he was arrested and charged with murder. There appear to have been about 11 appearances before the Local Court prior to 8 October 2014, when his solicitor signed a document waiving his right to a committal hearing.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 68 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), a magistrate may at any time on the application of an accused person, and with the consent of the prosecutor, commit the accused for trial. On 8 October 2014 the accused was committed for trial to the Supreme Court. The application was signed by the applicant’s then solicitor and by the prosecutor. The applicant has since repeatedly asserted that that step was taken without his instructions and contrary to his wishes. It appears from the applicant’s affidavit of 18 February 2016 that instructions were not formally withdrawn from that firm until 3 August 2015. Shortly thereafter, a grant of legal aid was transferred to the applicant’s next solicitor, who acted until after the decision under appeal, but no longer does. Further details of the history were set out by the primary judge. [8] 
	
	
	In his affidavit filed before the primary judge and dated 8 December 2015, in addition to complaining about the waiver of a committal hearing having occurred without his consent, the applicant stated that he wished “to have a committal hearing so counsel can consider whether to seek [to] have witnesses attend and give evidence”. At that stage it appeared that he was unable to identify any particular witness whose attendance would be required and counsel appearing for him before the primary judge was unable to assist further in that respect. The matter was not further advanced in his affidavit of 18 February 2016. Nothing further was put in respect of that issue this morning.
	
	
	Nor has the applicant identified any error on the part of the primary judge. His affidavit complained only of counsel’s failure to direct the primary judge to legal authority to support an order for a committal hearing. He did, however, annex a letter of 20 November 2015 requesting of his counsel that the Court be referred to a passage in the judgment of the High Court in Barton v The Queen, [9]  and to Barron v Attorney General [10]  and Hiroti v The Queen. [11] 
	
	
	Barton and Barron are both decisions applying general law principles, and pre-date the Criminal Procedure Act. Even if Barron were to be applied in its terms, the applicant would fail: like the claimant in that case, he has not demonstrated what actual prejudice would flow from his loss of an opportunity to cross-examine prosecution witnesses.
	
	
	As with Barton and Barron, Hiroti involved a different statutory scheme applicable in the Northern Territory. Although the instructions to rely on these cases are in truth beside the point, they would not have assisted him. Had he read the cases the judge referred to his lawyers, he would have seen, for example, that Barton was addressed and no longer has the force he seems to have ascribed to it. (Indeed even his own preferred authority, Barron, indicates that.)
	
	
	The scheme which applies in this jurisdiction and which was addressed by the primary judge, requires attention to the terms of s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act. That section requires substantial reasons why a witness should attend for cross-examination. As the judge noted, [12]  counsel not being in a position to identify any witness in relation to whom such a submission could be put, the argument failed at the first stage. Having reviewed the prosecution’s statement of its case, the primary judge was also not satisfied that there was any real prospect of the accused not being committed for trial. [13] 
	
	
	The legal principles applied by the primary judge were set out in the following passages:
	


“[23]   Firstly, the holding of committal proceedings is not a condition precedent to a trial on indictment in the Supreme or District Court: R v Butler; [14]  Sergi v Director of Public Prosecutions; [15]  V v McDonald; [16]  Potier v Magistrate Maloney & Ors; Crowe v Director of Public Prosecutions.

[24]   Secondly, where a bill of indictment has been found, the effect is that the criminal proceedings against a person, in the position of the Accused, have been commenced, in effect, in the higher Court. The authorities that I have referred to at (at [23] above) demonstrate clearly that the Crown exercises prosecutorial discretion in filing a bill and that once that happens, it is rare in the extreme that the higher Court would consider taking any step other than to proceed with the trial. The exception to that may be in a case where it could be demonstrated that it would be an abuse of process to proceed to trial. That is not asserted here, nor, on my understanding of the case, could it be asserted.”


	
	In the absence of any plausible submission as to error on the part of the primary judge, the Court should decline leave to appeal from this aspect of the orders refusing referral for a committal hearing.
	


Change of venue


	
	The applicant’s submissions supported a change of venue to Sydney on two bases. One involved an assertion that the applicant’s “legal team” is from Sydney, giving rise to difficulties of communication and expense if the trial were to be conducted in Newcastle. The basis of that submission is unclear, as, according to his affidavit, he withdrew his instructions from the lawyers who were representing him in December 2015 and had not then instructed lawyers to replace them. This morning, he indicated that lawyers had been instructed and legal aid had been provided so that he will be represented at the trial. The basis of the contention was not, however, otherwise addressed in submissions this morning.
	
	
	This ground does not appear to have been the basis of his instructions prior to the hearing before the primary judge and would, in any event, have been unlikely to attract a favourable outcome. Rather, the focus was entirely upon media publicity, raising sympathy for the victim, Ms Carter, who was a popular school teacher and well-known in the local community, and prejudice against the accused. Although the material is no doubt still available on the internet, that submitted to the primary judge did not go beyond the time of his arrest in 2013, with one exception in December 2014.
	
	
	The application engaged the power conferred on the Court by s 30 of the Criminal Procedure Act which permits the Court to change the venue if it appears to the Court (a) that a fair or unprejudiced trial cannot otherwise be had or (b) that for any other reason it is expedient to do so.
	
	
	The applicant referred the Court to the judgment in Rawlinson v R, [17]  a case in which Harrison J considered and rejected a similar application in relation to a trial for a well-publicised murder in Wollongong. The accepted principles were applied; each case will turn on its own facts.
	
	
	In this case, the trial judge set out in unexceptionable terms the principles to be applied and referred to the publicity in the media which had surrounded the circumstances of Ms Carter’s death. He was not satisfied that, adopting proper jury selection procedures, pursuant to s 38(7) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW), a fair trial could not be held in Newcastle. Accordingly he declined to make the order changing the venue to Sydney. Although the applicant suggested that in Rawlinson practical problems arose when the trial was listed in Wollongong, that is no reason for interfering with the decision of the trial judge in the present case. There is no reason to grant leave to appeal in respect of this matter.
	


Conclusions


	
	Although the applicant should have an extension of time within which to bring the application for leave to appeal, leave should be refused. Accordingly, the Court should make the following orders:
	


(1)   Extend the time for lodging an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act from the judgment of Johnson J delivered on 14 December 2015.

(2)   Refuse leave to appeal.


	
	R A HULME J: I agree.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I agree.

2768951,Swift v Wearing-Smith [2016] NSWCA 38,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: I agree with Hoeben JA that this appeal should be allowed. For the following reasons and those given by his Honour, I consider the primary judge erred in his findings as to breach and as to the mechanism of failure of the balustrade. What follows assumes a familiarity with the factual background and evidence at trial as summarised by Hoeben JA.
	
	
	The primary judge held that in the circumstances which followed their receipt of the 2002 building inspection report, the exercise of reasonable care by the appellant home owners required that they take “advice and action to ensure the structural soundness of the balustrade before allowing guests to be in close proximity” to it: Judgment at [156], [159]. His Honour concluded that the fact that work had been carried out in 2006 by a painter “without structural qualifications of any kind” and “without any consideration of the state of the component parts of the supporting structures” ought to have raised in the minds of the appellants the question whether the rust identified in 2002 had been “adequately addressed from a structural and safety viewpoint”: Judgment at [153], [171]-175].
	
	
	In so concluding his Honour reasoned as follows: in 2002 the appellants were advised of the presence of rust in the steel components of the balustrade; that rust problem remained unaddressed until 2006 when Mr Mesker chipped scaled rust from the poles and lugs, applied rust converter, and then painted those structures; at that time the appellants took no active steps to satisfy themselves of the structural safety of the balustrade and its supporting components, and could not reasonably have assumed that the work undertaken by Mr Mesker, a painter, had the effect of ensuring the structural soundness of the areas he had treated or that he would have identified any structural problems in the balustrade if they existed. In particular, he was not in a position to determine whether the mounting bolts holding the glass in place were corroded: see Judgment at [145]-[162], [171]-[175].
	
	
	The mounting bolts holding the glass panel in place assumed particular significance, because the primary judge found that it was one or more of those four bolts which had failed due to corrosion: Judgment at [130], [131].
	
	
	In my view the primary judge’s conclusion that the appellants, acting reasonably, would have appreciated as a result of the 2002 inspection report that there was an underlying problem of rust in the steel components of the balustrade which remained unaddressed after the works undertaken by Mr Mesker in 2006, was not justified by the evidence or a consideration of what a reasonable person in the appellants’ position would have done in response to that report.
	
	
	The report described the “metal lugs and posts” of the balustrade as having “some corrosion” and recommended “rust proofing and repainting” or “simply replacing”. It did not, in terms or implicitly, recommend that the appellants also seek further advice from someone (other than a painter or rust proofer) as to the structural soundness of the component parts of the balustrade. The description of the corrosion was not such as to indicate that there was a need for such advice. By way of contrast, express advice to that effect was given in other parts of the report concerning items or sources of damage in respect of which it was considered that there should be an inspection by the council, a qualified engineer or a tradesperson with particular qualifications or experience. Nor did the report say that the balustrade was not or may not have been structurally sound at that time, or that it might become unsafe even if the work recommended was undertaken.
	
	
	In those circumstances there is no apparent basis for the primary judge’s conclusions that “in 2002, and thereafter, a reasonable person in the position of the [appellants] would have taken precautions by taking advice and action to ensure the structural soundness of the balustrade” beyond what was recommended by the report and that the appellants had been advised of the need for the balcony to be “appropriately treated”, it being suggested that the appropriate treatment extended beyond what was described in the report: Judgment at [156], [173]. It is correct, as the primary judge records at [157], that from 2002 the appellants were on notice that “proper remedial treatment of rusted components” was recommended. However that treatment did not extend beyond “rust proofing and repainting”.
	
	
	In 2006 the appellants engaged Mr Mesker to undertake work which answered the description of that which was recommended in the inspection report, albeit some three years after the recommendation was made. It was not suggested that he was not qualified to undertake the work described, or that he said as much to the appellants. On the contrary, his Specification and Tender dated 5 March 2006 described the rust proofing and repainting that he proposed to undertake in terms which might have given the appellants some confidence as to his ability to carry out the work properly.
	
	
	The primary judge considered that it was not sufficient for the appellants to rely on Mr Mesker to identify any structural or safety issues arising from the condition of the balustrade: Judgment at [148]. That observation is not to the point and, in any event, is contradicted at least to some extent by Mr Burn’s evidence. Mr Mesker was retained to undertake the work described in the inspection report. Mr Burn considered that a prudent painter in his position, who considered that a more thorough structural assessment was required, was likely to have raised the matter with the home owner. From the appellants’ perspective they might reasonably have proceeded on the basis that if the painter had observed something which he believed required further assessment or work, he would have raised that fact with them.
	
	
	That did not occur. Mr Mesker, who the primary judge accepted as a witness of truth, gave the following evidence:
	


From memory, the glass was held in with two tabs or four tabs top and bottom, and those tabs were holding the glass in between the two posts, and we checked for rust there. There was no rust there. So we didn’t have to take the glass out or dismantle any glass, left the glass totally as it was.


	
	There was no reason following the completion of Mr Mesker’s work, for the appellants, acting reasonably, to believe that any further structural assessment of the balustrade was required. To the extent that a defect had been identified, that defect had been addressed in one of the ways recommended and the tradesperson who had been engaged to that end did not suggest that he thought that any further work was required to make the structure safe.
	
	
	I also agree with Hoeben JA’s reasoning and conclusion that the primary judge erred in finding the mechanism of failure of the glass panel was as suggested by Mr Burn (being the finding referred to in [4] above). Finally, I agree with Hoeben JA that the respondent’s application to rely upon his notice of contention should be refused.
	
	
	HOEBEN JA: 
	


Nature of proceedings

The respondent and the appellants are related by marriage – the respondent is the stepfather of Kim Swift, the second appellant. The respondent was injured when he fell from a balcony at the rear of domestic premises owned by the appellants at Turramurra on 5 November 2011. He suffered significant injuries to his chest and thoracic spine. Damages were agreed at $425,000.


	
	The house, where the accident occurred, was built in 1952 and the appellants moved into the premises in February 2003. It was their place of residence. The balcony was about three metres above ground level and had glass panels around it. The balcony was constructed before 1992. The accident occurred when a glass panel gave way and the respondent fell to the ground.
	
	
	The respondent brought proceedings against the appellants in the District Court alleging that they were negligent in allowing him access to the balcony when they knew that the supports for the balcony were dangerously corroded, failed to warn him of that fact, failed to inspect the balcony and failed to rectify the corrosion of the metal lugs and posts. The proceedings were heard by Levy SC DCJ (the primary judge) on 11 – 13 August 2014, with judgment delivered on 9 October 2014. The respondent was successful in his claim.
	
	
	The appellants have appealed against the primary judge’s finding of negligence against them.
	


Factual background and evidence at trial

The state of the premises at the time of the accident


	
	The appellants commissioned a pre-purchase report in 2002 before buying the premises. The report was received in December 2002 and signed by a master builder. Of its 28 pages, 20 related to the house and pool, and the balance was a pest inspection report. The format of the report was to identify various aspects of the structures on the property and to comment on them, e.g. roof external/roof internal, external walls, footings, foundations, balcony, handrails, pool, each room.
	
	
	By way of an executive summary, there were two pages headed “Issues” and “Safety Concerns”. Under the heading “Issues” were the following matters – extensive termite damage, with a recommendation that this be treated, concrete cancer in the slab of the garage, with a recommendation that this be inspected, corrosion to the base of the water heater requiring its replacement, failure of the pool to comply with the safety code, with a recommendation for a Council inspection, damp in the wall of the rumpus room, with a recommendation for a damp course, covered edges of the concrete slab, with a recommendation that this be remedied.
	
	
	Under the heading “Safety Concerns” the following matters were listed. The pool fence was decayed and did not comply with the Council code. The electrical wiring was faulty, with a recommendation that a licensed electrical contractor inspect and remedy faulty or illegal electrical wiring. The paths were identified as constituting a slip hazard. The water heater had been incorrectly installed so that the control valve might malfunction and injury occur. There were no safety glass stickers on glass panes below one metre, e.g. on shower screens, windows, doors, built-in wardrobe doors there should be safety glass. The comment was “this is considered to be serious, have a glazier inspect the glass and upgrade as soon as practicable” (Blue 9K). Floor surfaces were identified as possibly being “slippery” when wet, with a recommendation that anti-slip material be placed on them.
	
	
	In another part of the report, the following comment and recommendations were made in relation to the balcony and handrails:
	


“Balcony:

The concrete roof slab edges have concrete cancer and spalling render, the lower walls have extensive vegetation cover, remove the vegetation and fully inspect the left elevation slab edges and supporting walls defects may exist. The concrete/tiled surfaces have inadequate expansion joints, provide expansion joints at 4.5 metre centres cracking may occur.

The masonry walls above garage have severe cracks, have engineer inspect and advise.

Handrails:

The glass handrails have no safety glass stickers on the glass panels, have a glazier inspect the glass and upgrade as required. The metal lugs and posts have some corrosion. We recommend rustproofing and repainting or simply replacing.” (Blue 13J-L)


	
	Ms Swift, gave evidence that she would have read the pre-purchase building report at the time she and her husband were purchasing the property, but she did not specifically recall its content. She recalled retaining painters to do work on the house, approximately three years after they moved in. She said:
	


“A. They painted all the exterior woodwork of the house and also all the steel poles supporting the glass panels forming the pool fence and the upstairs balustrade.” (Black 82T)

When asked about staining on the paintwork of the balustrade she said:

“A. The poles were steel, not stainless steel, and they had surface rust. Alex took the rust off and rustproofed it and repainted them in a charcoal colour.”


	
	In cross-examination, her evidence concerning the painting in 2006 was:
	


“Q. … The balustrade painting that happened in 2006. Mr Mesker came along and did some painting, you told us about.

A. I would have been there partly during the day. I mean, I was working school hours - 9.00 till 3.00 - then, so Alex would usually turn up about 7.00 and do some work, and be tidying up by the time I got home. But I would have witnessed some of it, yeah.

Q. Would you say he painted the steel stanchions themselves because they

had discoloured?

A. They had surface rust on them, yeah. And I'm not sure how he did it, if he burnt it back, if he just I think rubbed it back and treated it with rust proofing. I

mean, that was what he said he was doing in the quote, and he's done work

for us before, and I've always had faith in him doing what he said he would

do.

…

Q. It was cosmetic, what he was doing?

A. There wasn't rust through that it needed replacing. It was only surface rust, yeah.” (Black 86Q – 87C)


	
	Ms Swift gave evidence that in about 2010 more work was done on the property.
	


“A. I don't remember what year it was, to be honest, but we had Peter

Livingstone from Abbey Fencing come out, and he quoted on replacing the glass fencing around the pool and also on doing a new glass balustrade

upstairs. We ended up just going with the pool fencing and left the glass upstairs.” (Black 83C – D)


	
	Ms Swift said that she was otherwise unaware of any issue with the glass balustrade on the deck. She and her husband would frequently entertain on the deck, having family gatherings, people over for barbeques and a couple of parties, including New Years Eve parties.
	
	
	The person who carried out the painting in 2006 was Mr A Mesker. The quote which he provided for the work was dated 5 March 2006 and he appears to have signed it on 10 March 2006. Included in the quote was the following:
	


“METALWORK: To be scraped free of rust scale and flaking paint. Rust affected areas to be treated with a proprietary rust inhibitor and allowed to react, washed off and treated areas to be coated with Taubmans All Metal Primer and two final coats of White Knight Epoxy Metal Enamel or equivalent quality in colours to be determined.” (Blue 57L)


	
	Following the accident, the balustrade was replaced. Ms Swift’s evidence was:
	


“A. Yeah. I think a week. I don't remember when, but I did ring Peter Livingstone of Abbey Fencing again, and asked him to come out and quote on replacing it.

Q. Then what happened with respect to that quote?

A. We got the quote and sorted out the money to pay for it, and placed an

order and I think it -I don't remember exactly when it was installed, but it was a few weeks later that we had it replaced with similar fencing to what we had

around the pool, because we couldn't afford to go for the glass look again, and we didn't want to live with a missing panel of glass. You know, there was a safety risk to anyone, including our pet dog, you know.” (Black 84T – B)

Q. Prior to this incident, had you had any concern about the balustrade on the

deck?

A. No.” (Black 85D)


	
	Mr Mesker gave evidence that he recalled doing painting work at the premises in early 2006. His evidence was:
	


“A. Yes, I think it was to attend to the pool fence, from memory, and - so the metal work around the pool fence and the balustrade, from memory.

Q. Was that up on the deck?

A. I think so. And I think it was also to wash down mould-affected areas and

also then to touch up areas that were bare. So it was more to rectify anything that was not good.

Q. To that extent, did you or your painting team paint the metal work on the balustrade of the deck?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall what your standard process was for metal work as at that time?

A. And today - as it is today, the metal is hammered or chipped with a little chip hammer to remove scale - rough scale. Then, once that's clean or

de-scaled, we use a proprietary rust converter which converts the rust to an

inert steel. Once that's done, we apply an oil-based primer which excludes

oxygen, and then we finish with an oil-based coat of paint over the final coat,

yeah.

…

HIS HONOUR:

Q. When you say everything was painted in situ, if there was an assembled

part, you didn't disassemble it in order to treat it in any way?

A. No. No, because it's too dangerous with some of these things. You can   

run the risk of having glass drop out, and there was no need for that because there was no evidence of any rust at that point. From memory, the glass was held in with two tabs or four tabs top and bottom, and those tabs were holding the glass in between the two posts, and we checked for rust there. There was no rust there. So we didn't have to take the glass out or dismantle any glass, left the glass totally as it was.” (Black 120U – 121N)


	
	The first appellant, Mr Swift, gave evidence that he remembered reading the pre-purchase report and that he made some notes on the front of the document. He said that the arrangements to paint the balustrade and other parts of the property were made between his wife and the painter and he played no part in them. He said that after 2006 when the balustrade was painted, he did not notice any staining on the poles.
	
	
	Mr Livingstone was a fencing salesman, who attended the premises in 2010, to inspect the pool fence and quote for its replacement. At the same time he inspected the balustrade. He was asked to give an estimate of the potential cost to replace the existing tinted glass of the balustrade with clear glass. In a statement dated 8 July 2014 he set out his observation of the glass panels, which formed the balustrade:
	


“ … It was typical of the glass used in the earlier balustrades, i.e. two sections of glass compressed and glued together to form a minimum thickness of 8 or 10 mm and generally referred to as “safety glass”.” (Blue 59P – Q)

“As mentioned the section of the glass presented is very consistent with the product used in the earlier balustrades, i.e. two sheets of laminate glass compressed and “glued” together to create the thickness required – referred to loosely as safety glass.

Present day glass is now one piece only (10 or 12 mm depending on the configuration) and the glass goes through what is called a “toughened” process; one of the critical differences pertains to how the glass shatters to minimise severe cuts.” (Blue 60R – S)


	
	He set out his observations of the structure of the balustrade as follows:
	


“3.2   The balustrade consisted of a post with two separate welded flat plate side flanges on each side of the post and each flange had a hole through it, the glass also had holes suitably located to enable a bolt/nut to secure the glass to the flanges.

3.3   A closer inspection revealed the post/flange structure was not a typical “off the shelf” standard product but in fact had been constructed diy; however, such construction appeared to be very sound. Due to the finishing tile/slate around the base of the posts I was not able to readily identify how the posts were affixed to the concrete base of the balcony; however, when side pressure was applied to the posts, they appeared to be well anchored.

3.4   The posts appeared to me in good working order, with no apparent sign of rust or any other form deterioration; there were no other immediate signs of structural shortfall with the balustrade.” (Blue 59S – 60G)


	
	In his oral evidence, Mr Livingstone said in relation to the posts and flanges:
	


“Q. Just on that issue, in answer to a question from my friend, you said words

to the effect of the front and back plates were in place. All right?   

A. Yes.

Q. When you say that, could you just describe to his Honour what you meant

by that observation?   

A. So on the post is welded a front and back plate in which a bolt would go through that plate to hold the glass in position. That front and back plate were in place and, as I thought I recalled, there was a bolt holding those - that bolt was still in place as well.” (Black 81P – T)


	
	I infer from that evidence (which was the only direct evidence on the subject) that each steel post had flanges (or lugs) welded to them. On the side of each post, attached to the welded flanges by bolts, were sheets of glass which were sandwiched between the two flanges at each point. This is consistent with the blurred photograph of the balustrade before the accident (Blue 52).
	
	
	Mr Livingstone explained what happened as a result of his inspection of the balustrade in 2010 as follows:
	


“With consideration to the finished height of the existing balustrade (approx. 900 mm) inability to affix a safety top rail and the unknown integrity of the posts I advised Ms Swift that whilst replacement of the glass only was possible/acceptable that I, personally, was not willing to commit to such as it would fall short of the requirement now in existence for all new balustrades.

Ms Swift understood my approach and indicated that she and her husband would take it under advisement; I believe that there were a number of other items that needed attention – it was a matter of priority.” (Blue 60B – D)


	
	In oral evidence, Mr Livingstone said that in 2010 the glass on the balustrade appeared “okay” to him. He tested the posts of the balustrade, but not the glass (Black 74L – T). The advice which he gave to Ms Swift was:
	


“A. Ms Swift asked me if we replace the glass with clear glass. I had a look at the overall structure, and even though it complied to the rules, probably in the

time that fence was built, it wasn't in accordance with the new rules. I wasn't willing to put in or replace that glass. I told her that I would prefer to see a new balustrade in place.

…

A. As I understand, if you replace only a damaged sheet of glass, you only

have to comply with the rules that stood at the time in which that fence or

balustrade was put in place. But if there was going to be major structural

change to a residence, then we'd have to comply to the new rules.

Q. But your advice was to replace the whole thing, wasn't it?

A. I said that I wasn't willing to use the existing system that was in place

From my viewpoint, I'd feel much more comfortable that a normal standard balustrade, 1 metre high with rail system, be put in place.

Q. That was because operating on your mind was safety of people on that

verandah, correct?

A. Yes.” (Black 75E – F, 75T – 76C)

Mr Livingstone said that when he saw the balustrade in 2010 he did not think that it was unsafe (Black 75M).


	
	Within a week following the accident, Mr Livingstone was asked to attend at the premises by Ms Swift and to provide a quote. His evidence in his statement as to what he observed on that occasion was:
	


“4.2   There was no immediate or apparent damage to the balustrade.

4.3   The only evidence of some potential mishap was the absence of 1 sheet of glass.

4.4   The posts and flanges to which the glass would have been affixed appeared to still be sound in good working order.” (Blue 60L – N)


	
	In oral evidence he said:
	


“A. My recollection is I had a look at the particular site where the glass was

missing. I was interested to see why the accident might have happened. The

posts were in good order, the brackets were in the order. All the brackets and

bolts were in order. The only thing that was missing was the glass.

HIS HONOUR:

Q. What do you mean by ""in order""?

A. There was no damage to the post, no damage to the brackets, no indication that they had given in any particular way.

Q. And the bolts were present?

A. Bolts present.” (Black 72K – S)


	
	When the evidence as to the bolts was tested under cross-examination, Mr Livingstone gave the following evidence:
	


“A. It's about why - I had a look at the structure, and to my mind everything was in place, and the question I had to ask myself, ""Why was it in place?"" it's because the front and back plates were there, and a bolt would have been in place to hold that in place.

Q. A bolt would have been in place to hold that in place. Is that what you say? A. Yes.

Q. You're guessing, aren't you?

A. Possibly.

Q. You could be mistaken.

A. Could be mistaken.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Does that answer mean that the bolts weren't actually visible to you at the

time of the inspection?

A. The only way that the back plate would have been held in place would have been for a bolt to be there.   

Q. But you didn't see the bolt?

A. I don't specifically recall.

Q. In your evidence earlier today you said that the bolts were - I don't

remember the exact word - either in place or unaffected. Do you recall that

evidence?   

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Was that correct?

A. At the time of the question, yes.

Q. Well, how do you reconcile the difference?   

A. As far as I'm concerned, those bolts were in place.

HUGHES:

Q. But you have no memory of seeing them in place.

A. No.” (Black 80T – 81N)


	
	Mr Burn, a civil engineer, gave evidence on behalf of the respondent. His evidence comprised two reports, dated 25 November 2013 and 8 July 2014, together with oral evidence. While objection was initially taken to some parts of the reports, they eventually were received by the court without objection.
	
	
	When preparing his first report, Mr Burn did not perform a site inspection, did not inspect the component parts of the balustrade and was not provided with any photographs. He did have available the pre-purchase report obtained by the appellants. From that he noted “metal lugs and posts used to secure the handrails had visible corrosion with recommendation to rust proof and repaint and/or replace the fixings”. For the purposes of his report, he made an assumption that the handrail fastenings did not receive any attention between the date of the report and the date of the injury.
	
	
	On the basis of that material, and by reference to other instances which he had observed of the failure of a balcony handrail, Mr Burn concluded that inadequate handrail maintenance had caused the accident. He opined that what should have happened was for there to be a periodic inspection of handrails to determine if there were any inherent movement, the degree of movement and whether the handrail could be re-secured by tightening the existing fixtures. If the fixtures had corroded, they would have to be properly inspected, which would involve disassembling the fixture.
	
	
	In between the first report and the second report, Mr Burn became aware that painting of the balustrade had taken place in March of 2006. He assumed that no other maintenance had taken place between February 2003 and March 2006. On the assumption that painting of the balustrade had taken place, Mr Burn said:
	


“It is possible had the painting work been carried out in 2006 as originally proposed in the March 2006 quotation that the corrosion of the brackets securing the handrail may have been held at a stage that would have retained sufficient strength to prevent the subsequent failure in November 2011 by having prevented further corrosion occurring between 2006 and 2011.” (Blue 45M – N)


	
	Mr Burn made the following observations concerning the painter:
	


“It is unlikely the painter has structural qualifications. However based on the painter’s likely prior experience observations by the painter when cleaning and preparing for the handrails for painting (assuming the painting work included the painting of the handrails) should have seen the degraded state of the brackets and lugs.

A prudent painter having observed the state of the metal brackets and lugs after cleaning away the rust and other corrosion would have raised the condition of the handrail with the property owner suggesting a structural assessment be conducted before the metalwork was primed and painted. No material has been briefed to indicate whether this occurred.” (Blue 45Q – T)

“Had the work quoted in 2006 been carried out in 2006 the continued corrosion of the handrail and its fixtures may have been arrested at a condition that could have prevented the 2011 collapse.” (Blue 46P)


	
	Mr Burn expressed an opinion as to the possible effect on the glass of the balustrade when somebody forcefully came in contact with it.
	


“Normally it would be expected when glass is used as a balustrade or handrail treatment the type of glass would be substantial enough to withstand the specified loading under relevant ordinances and Australian Standards (e.g. the SAA loading code, and the relevant issue of AS1288 relating to glass in buildings). Without knowing the specific date of installation for the handrail the precise requirement cannot be stated.

The normal expectation would be for the glass panel used in handrails/balustrade to be of sufficient thickness it would withstand human impact loading, the minimum thickness being determined by type, area and method for securing the glass. A sufficient impact force with the glass panel would result in the panel shattering to some degree, the specific being determined by the type of glass used (e.g. safety glass, laminate glass, etc).”


	
	Before giving his evidence, Mr Burn had the opportunity of reading the statement from Mr Livingstone of 8 July 2014. With the benefit of that information, he said:
	


“A. Well, it gave me a clearer understanding of the construction of the

balustrade, that it was actually a glass panel bolted to metal lugs, and that the bolts that failed would have been the ones that held the glass to the lug.

Q. Having regard to the photographs that you saw this morning and that

report, have you reached that conclusion as to how the failure occurred; that is, how the glass came to fall out?

A. Yeah. The bolts were.. (not transcribable) and basically corroded sufficiently so that when there's pressure applied to the glass they snapped and the glass swung down.” (Black 57Q – U)

“A. The method used to secure the glass panel to the posts was, from looking at the photographs, four bolts, which would be through the glass panel and through the bracket on the post. If one of those bolts fails because of corrosion, the panel is going to pull away from the bracket and just by the – if one bolt is corroded, unless one of the other three bolts has been replaced,

they will be in a similar state of degradation. So, as the panel falls away, the increased load on the other bolts is going to cause them to snap as well.” (Black 58S – U)


	
	Mr Burn expressed an opinion as to the likely progression of any corrosion of the bolts on the balustrade as follows:
	


“Q. Would you expect, based on your experience, that any corrosion would

have continued during that time?

A. Unless they'd been covered up with paint or something in the meantime,

yes, it would have continued.

Q. You make reference in your report to the way to properly test the depth of

the corrosion, and you refer specifically to unscrewing and re-screwing the

particular fixture. Is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. What's the purpose of that?

A. You can only see the corrosion on the outside, at the end of the bolts and

nuts. To determine how much it's affected the shaft of the bolt and that

through the bracket, through the sheet of glass, you'd have to physically look

at that.

Q. And to do that you'd have to undo it.

A. You'd have to undo it, yes.

Q. And merely painting over the end of the bolt, how would that affect, positively or negatively, the integrity of the bolt itself.

A. It will have minimal effect on the shaft through the bracket and through the glass. It will only protect the end which has been painted.

HIS HONOUR:

Q. Sorry, does that mean, if there's a corrosive process already affecting the

shaft, notwithstanding that the end is painted, the shaft would continue to

corrode?

A. Yes.” (Black 60Q – 61G)


	
	Mr Burn estimated the likely load produced by the respondent leaning against the balustrade would be between 1 and 50 kgs (Black 62F). He described the likely mechanism of failure as follows:
	


“Q. Are you telling his Honour that one bolt failed or they all failed?

A. I'm of the opinion that one bolt failed and, as a result of that one bolt failing,

the transfer of load to the other three bolts caused them to fail, like a zipper effect sort of thing.

Q. You're assuming that all four bolts failed.

A. Ultimately, yes.” (Black 62M – P)


	
	In cross-examination Mr Burn gave the following evidence on the assumption that the bolts had not failed.
	


“A. If the panel of glass came away from the post and the bolts remained intact, then it means the glass itself failed, where the bolts went through the glass. It would have fallen through, and that would be less likely, in my    opinion, to occur than the bolts themselves snapping.” (Black 63J)

Q. If the bolts had remained in place after this accident, then your theory that

the bolts had fractured and failed couldn't be correct, could it?

A. The bolts could be partly in place but, yes, if the bolts and their nuts were

fully intact after failure, then some other mechanism would have caused the

failure.

Q. You never inspected this balcony at any relevant time, did you?

A. No.” (Black 63T – V)

“Q. You have accepted today that it is possible that the glass may have failed. You accept that, don't you?

A. It's a possibility, but I consider it unlikely.

HIS HONOUR:

Q. Why would you consider it unlikely?   

A. The thickness of the glass to try and pull the head of the bolt through,

especially with having had a washer behind it to help stop it dragging through

the hole, means you're pulling through a substantially larger hole in the glass

than you are trying to break the bolt.   “ (Black 65H – L)


	
	Mr Burn explained the basis for his opinion as follows:
	


“A. There are other ways it could have failed but, as I said, in my opinion, the

most logical and apparent reason for failure would be the corrosion of the bolts holding the glass in place.

HIS HONOUR:

Q. What compels you to that view as opposed to other possible causes?

A. Generally glass balustrades are reasonably sound; they last a good amount of time. This information here says it was laminated glass. Laminated glass is very difficult to fracture, so to pull a bolt through laminated glass would be exceedingly difficult. One of the reasons they make car windscreens out of laminated glass is because they prevent the majority of rocks thrown up from going through and therefore the potential for driver fatalities. I would therefore consider it highly unlikely that the bolt could have been pulled through the glass and for the panel to fall away, leaving the bolt on the post.” (Black 66F – J)

“A. If laminated glass is impacted with, usually only one of the sheets of glass will crack, and it takes a substantial impact force to cause the glass to crack in the first place.” (Black 66P – Q)


	
	Mr Burn set out his experience in relation to how glass fractures as follows:
	


“Q. Mr Burn, have you actually studied how glass fractures?

A. Only if I'm reserving on site where I've been with fragment of glass and glass shades and shattered glass and - the old days of the safety glass in the

windscreen, where they shattered into the crazed pieces, as opposed to

laminated glass, where you get the chip out of it.

Q. That's the extent of your expertise on this topic. Is that right?

A. On the way glass fractures, yes.

Q. It's the case, isn't it, that you really don't have any expertise to give an

opinion to this Court on the extent to which the glass may have contributed to this fall. You would accept that, wouldn't you?

A. I would say that the plant and that I've been in charge of when I was in local government and stuff, with broken windscreens, and picking branches of trees and that - with laminated glass, I would be able to give an opinion as to how laminated glass is likely to split versus fracture and fall away through impact loads.

Q. You don’t even know how thick this glass was do you?

A. No.

Q. You don’t know what the bonding compound was do you?

A. No.

Q. You don’t know what the glass specification was do you?

A. No.

Q. As to the windscreen in your father’s car, you don’t know what the thickness of that glass was do you?

A. No because we’re talking about 15 – 20 years ago so I couldn’t use that versus what we use now.

HIS HONOUR:

Q. Where did you acquire your understanding of how laminated glass behaves when struck?

Q. Well as I said, I supervised the plant when I was in Local Council and part of my job was to – its acquisition, its maintenance, its operation and being in the rural shire at times when the windscreen of the various items of the plant were struck with branches and they tended to split, and you get the crack where they were impacted or if they didn’t – it’s unlike a car where you get the chip situation and very rarely did the window shatter and fall away – it’s more a case of a split and then the plant put in a new windscreen or a new side window whatever ordered in to replace the cracked one.” (Black 67C – V)

“A. Well most of the stuff I would have seen previously would be designed for the plant and automotive industry usage.” (Black 68H)


	
	Mr Burn gave evidence as to his understanding of how the glass on the balustrade may have reacted if it fractured:
	


“Q. To what extent is an understanding of the specification necessary for

undertaking the analysis which you've done?

A. Only to the extent that the glass panel is - well, it's only supported by four

points, two on each edge. It has a certain area, certain height - or certain

height by width which gives a certain area, and therefore, under the glass

standard, depending on whether it's annealed glass, safety glass or laminated

glass, it would have to have a certain minimum thickness to be considered safe.

Q. The fact is that you would have to know, I want to suggest to you, what the

specification of this glass was, wouldn't you, to form the opinion that it was unlikely that the glass failed.

A. The glass was installed originally under the standard at the time it was

installed, which would have - I've taken that to mean that the glass would be of a certain strength and characteristic. Whether it's glue A, glue B to hold the

laminates together, it doesn't matter. The glass itself is capable of meeting the requirement of the standard, otherwise it wouldn't have been used in that location.

Q. But, you see, you don't know what the specification of this glass was. You don't know the thickness of the glass, do you?

A. Not without being given a sample of the glass.

Q. I want you to assume that, contrary to the assumption that you've been given, that this failed as he leaned against the balustrade - I want you to ignore that assumption - Mr Wearing Smith fell heavily into this glass balustrade, with the upper half of his body striking the glass balustrade, and that the glass fractured. All right? Can you make that assumption.

A. Fractured or shattered?

Q. Fractured.

A. Yes.   

Q. If that assumption is taken, then that would be an important matter for you to take into account as to the mechanism of this fall, do you agree?

A. It would potentially influence it, but as my expectation with laminated glass even if it cracked, it wouldn't have failed and fallen away.

HIS HONOUR:

Q. In order to answer Mr Morris's question, would you need to know more    about the resolution of forces, such as the weight of Mr Wearing Smith and the distance over which he fell before he struck the glass?   

A. Yes, and also a bit more about the size of the glass panel.

MORRIS:

Q. And you just don't have any of that information, do you?

A. No.

Q. Can I suggest to you that this opinion that you've sought to give that this

panel failed because of rust in the bolts is just an exercise in speculation.

A. Based on the information that was presented to me, that was the

conclusion I drew, yes.

Q. I want to suggest to you that you cannot opine as to the mode of failure of

this balustrade, given the material you've had.   

A. Given the material I've had, I've come to the conclusion that the bolts failed, and the glass panel fell away as a result of the bolt failure.” (Black 68J – 69U)


	
	Mr Burn gave evidence about other modes of failure, apart from the bolts.
	


“HIS HONOUR:

Q. What are the other reasonable hypotheses, if any, to explain this incident,

other than the theory of the corroded bolts failing?

A. Well, the only other thing I could think of to be a possibility would be if the laminate themselves separated, but that would be visually obvious by the fact

that, if it was clear glass, you wouldn't be able to see through it any more, in

which case the structural integrity of the panel would be obviously in question

because it would be from being fairly rigid to becoming quite flexible.

Q. Was that the only other reasonable hypothesis?

A. It was the only other one I can think of.

MORRIS:

Q. Might there have been an invisible manufacturing defect in the glass?

A. It's unlikely to get a defect in the two panes of glass lining up so that they

work in concert.

Q. Unlikely but possible. Do you accept that?

A. It would be a very remote possibility.

…

Q. Had a defect of the type suggested to you by my learned friend been

present, would you expect there to have been some obvious signs of it?

Q. Could you answer that, please.

A. Depending on the exposure to sun and cold on the glass panel, a latent condition may or may not become visible over time. If it forms a crack, causes the glass to crack, it would become visible. If it didn't cause the glass sheet to crack, it wouldn't necessarily become visible.

Q. Would you expect a defect to cause it to come away at four points where

it's attached to the balustrade?

A. No.” (Black 70F – 71F)

The accident


	
	Much of the evidence at trial related to how the accident occurred. The purpose of adducing that evidence was to determine how forcefully the respondent came in contact with the balustrade. The effect of the evidence, however, can be briefly stated.
	
	
	The respondent had no recollection of the mechanism by which he came to fall from the rear balcony. He had no clear recollection of how far from the balustrade he was seated, but thought it was about a metre to a metre and a half. He remembered reaching out with his left hand towards the balustrade but otherwise had no recollection of what happened. He had no recollection of putting his hand on the glass (Black 14).
	
	
	The respondent’s wife gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. Yes, immediately before and leading up to, and the fall.

A. Well I saw him stand up, and I thought, you know, he’s going to walk around, and then suddenly he seemed to be unsteady on his feet, and I though, “My God, has he got a cramp again?” And he turned around, put his arm out –

…

A. Yes. He turned around anticlockwise, and put his left arm out, and I thought –

Q. Did you see where his hand landed?

A. If it landed at all, it was on the top.

Q. Of what?

A. Of the glass.

…

Q. Did you see his hand come into contact with the glass?

A. I’m not sure. It happened very, very quickly, and I was just suddenly aware that he was gone.

Q. Disappeared from your view?

A. Yes.” (Black 33V – 34V)


	
	Mr Stobo was sitting near the respondent. It was his evidence that the respondent stood up and “seemed to get his foot caught perhaps, on the chair.” He thought that something made the respondent stumble. He observed the respondent to take a step and reach out with his left arm. He did not see the respondent fall.
	
	
	Mr Stobo thought that there was a railing on top of the balustrade and that the respondent was reaching for it. He was clearly wrong in that regard. It was common ground that there was no railing on top of the balustrade, just glass panels. Mr Stobo saw some glass where the respondent fell. He was not able to say whether there was glass on the balcony because he did not specifically look.
	
	
	Ms Swift did not see the respondent fall. She was not asked whether she saw any glass on the balcony. She did, however, see that one of the glass panels had disappeared. She observed glass where the respondent had fallen.
	


“A. Yeah. The glass was - by the time I saw him, he was trying to sit up, and

the glass was still in some big pieces. And I remember thinking that was good, because there was a big sandstone rock there, and I would have hated - that I think cushioned his fall a bit; that if he'd landed on that rock he would have been a lot worse off.” (Black 85P)


	
	Mr Swift gave evidence that he saw the respondent stand up, his left leg give way completely causing him to stumble to his left and crash into one of the glass panels with great force. He said that the respondent was heavier than he was at the trial because of his illness. He described the respondent as crashing through the glass panel. He said that he did not see the respondent put his hand out.
	
	
	When asked about the glass, he said:
	


“A. Well, it wasn’t there afterwards so it was there before and there was a hole where a glass panel was and Peter had clearly gone over with the glass panel, so it had to have preceded him in going over into the garden bed.” (Black 94V)


	
	Mr Dobson gave evidence that the respondent got up, probably caught his foot on the chair or the table, stumbled towards the glass balustrade and hit it with his right shoulder and went straight through it, right in the middle of the glass. He described the respondent as hitting the glass hard. He did not see the respondent put his hand out.
	
	
	In relation to glass, his evidence was:
	


“A. … and I’d say the glass has saved him from serious injuries because, when he came down on the garden terraces underneath, the glass was underneath him and he was laying on his back on top of the glass.

…

Q. Did you notice any change in the appearance of the glass?

A. I can’t say I noticed it but obviously it was broken. It would have been broken, yeah, as he hit it.” (Black 112E – J)


	
	The issue between the parties was the force with which the respondent came in contact with the glass panel.
	


The findings of the primary judge


	
	The primary judge made a number of credit findings. He accepted that the respondent, his wife and Mr Stobo were all witnesses of truth. He found that Mr Livingstone had an unreliable recollection of key events and that his evidence included elements of unwarranted assumption and reconstruction and also involved inaccuracies. His Honour concluded that caution should be exercised before his evidence could be accepted.
	
	
	He found Mr Swift to be an unreliable witness, who was not careful or considered in his responses. He found that Mr Dobson’s recollection had been affected by his ingestion of alcohol and that he was an unreliable witness because his evidence involved reconstruction and was in part based upon assumptions. The primary judge accepted Ms Swift as a witness of truth.
	
	
	The primary judge accepted Mr Mesker as a witness of truth. He concluded that because Mr Mesker did not have the skills of a structural engineer, some of his observations and conclusions had to be qualified by that fact. The primary judge found that no credit issues arose from Mr Burn’s evidence “which stood to be evaluated according to its content”.
	
	
	The primary judge made the following findings in relation to the premises. There was no maintenance carried out to the “corroded metal lugs and posts” between the purchase of the property in February 2003 and the painting carried out by Mr Mesker in March 2006. There was no evidence of the state of the securing bolts at the time that Mr Mesker treated and painted the posts and lugs on the balustrade. There was no evidence of any further maintenance inspection or repairs to the balustrade between 2006 and the date of the accident “… at the time of the accident, the underlying metal structure was not as thick, and its components were not as integral, compared to when it had been initially installed”. The extent to which the application of the rust converting compound and surface paint by Mr Mesker’s company in 2006 was successful in arresting the rusting process, especially the shafts of the bolts, was uncertain.
	
	
	When considering how the accident occurred, the primary judge observed that the description of what Mr Dobson saw was remarkably similar to that given by Mr Swift. He found that their evidence was “tailored” to exaggerate the force of the respondent’s contact with the glass panel. He preferred the evidence of Mr Stobo to that of Messrs Dobson and Swift.
	
	
	The primary judge found that the mechanism of the accident was that one or more of the four bolts, holding the glass panel in place at its base, failed due to corrosion having weakened those structures, as explained by Mr Burn in his evidence. He found Mr Burn’s expert explanation to be cogent and plausible and to provide a rational cause for why the panel gave way. He found that Mr Burn’s explanation combined a common sense understanding of the progression of the rusting process with his expert engineering understanding of the way in which the material in question was affected by that process. The primary judge inferred that the rusting process had continued from the time of acquisition of the house, so as to weaken the bolts to the point where they sheared or gave way when the respondent leaned upon the balustrade.
	
	
	The primary judge found:
	


“132   In the absence of evidence of the bolts having been dismantled and treated for rust at the time Mr Mesker's company carried out painting works in 2006, given the presence of scaled rust on the lugs at that time which was advanced to the point of having to be chipped off the lugs, I find it more probable than not that the securing bolts were also affected by rust and that a progressive rusting process had set in and had continued unabated until the time of the plaintiff's fall.”


	
	The primary judge articulated the relevant duty as:
	


“136    … a duty to take reasonable care, including to take precautions against the risk of injury occurring due to a condition of the premises which they knew or ought to have known to represent a foreseeable risk of injury to persons such as the plaintiff.”


	
	By reference to s 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (CLA) the primary judge found that the number of guests in close proximity to the balustrade (which had earlier been the subject of a recommendation for replacement and which had not been the subject of an inspection for structural integrity in respect of any of its component parts) made it reasonably foreseeable that there was a risk of harm from a failure of the balustrade (Red 52F – J).
	
	
	The primary judge identified the risk of harm as:
	


“143   … the risk of a fall in circumstances where to the knowledge of the defendants there had been an earlier recommendation to replace the balustrade with a taller structure, with stickers on the glass, to make it comply with changed fencing requirements and that recommendation had been considered by the defendants and rejected due to considerations of cost”.


	
	The primary judge found that because the appellants had not completely replaced the balustrade in 2010, reasonable maintenance required that care be taken in the form of dealing not only with surface rust, but also ensuring that the structural components were either not affected by rust or if they were, that those components were properly treated or replaced so as to maintain safety (Red 53E – H).
	
	
	The primary judge found that the appellants were in breach of the duty which they owed to the respondent in failing to obtain any structural advice, especially in the absence of the structure being disassembled for rust proofing and painting purposes.
	
	
	Put another way, the primary judge found:
	


“153   I am satisfied that the combined effect of the defendants having obtained the pre-purchase building inspection report dated 18 December 2002, and in 2006 arranging for a painter, without structural qualifications of any kind, to attend to the identified surface rust in the manner described in the evidence of Mr Mesker, without any consideration of the state of the component parts of the supporting structures, ought to have raised in the minds of the defendants the question of whether the rust so identified had been adequately addressed from a structural and safety viewpoint.”


	
	The primary judge found that while the posts and lugs on the balustrade may have been treated for rust by Mr Mesker in 2006, the shafts of the bolts were affected by corrosion at the time of the respondent’s fall because they had not been treated for rust, either in 2006 or in the intervening period. The primary judge found that a reasonable person in the position of the appellants would have taken precautions by taking advice and action to ensure the structural soundness of the balustrade before allowing guests to be in close proximity to the structure. His Honour reached that conclusion because the appellants were on notice that replacement of the structure, or proper remedial treatment of rusted components had been recommended as necessary.
	
	
	The primary judge found that an appropriate response to such a risk of harm was to ensure that all components of the supporting structure, which were likely to be subject to attack from rust, were adequately treated in such a way as to address the problem of corrosion or, absent any inquiry by the appellants along those lines, replacement of the structure. His Honour found that the relative burden on the appellants to take such precautions was not a great one, although it would have involved some cost.
	
	
	In summary, his Honour found that the exercise of reasonable care required that the appellants consider and respond to the risk of failure of the balustrade before allowing guests near it. His Honour found that the important difference between this case and other cases where homeowners had escaped liability was that the appellants in this case had notice of an underlying problem of rust in the steel components of the balustrade, as was identified in 2002 in the pre-purchase inspection report. His Honour found that the appellants were advised of the presence of rust and of the need for it to be appropriately treated or for the structure to be replaced, yet they took no active steps to satisfy themselves as to the structural safety of the balustrade and its supporting components in that there was no investigation into the safety of the structure.
	
	
	The primary judge found that the appellants could not have reasonably assumed that the work carried out by Mr Mesker as a painter had the effect of ensuring structural soundness of the areas which he had chipped free of rust, nor could they reasonably assume that Mr Mesker as a painter who had not dismantled the balustrade would have identified structural problems in it if they existed. His Honour found that the appellants failed to consider or recognise that corrosion of the supporting components of the balustrade that had first been identified in 2002 had weakened its structural soundness. He found that the appellants had failed to take reasonable and available safety precautions in conformity with the duty of care they owed to the respondent. Their breach of duty involved the failure to ensure the structural soundness of the balustrade and the failure to isolate the area from guest access.
	
	
	The primary judge noted that there was no real issue as to causation and that if the bolts which held the glass panel in place had not corroded, they would not have failed, thereby causing the glass panel to give way and the respondent to fall. He found that the failure of the bolts was a necessary condition for the harm to occur and that factual causation, pursuant to s 5D(1)(a) CLA had been established.
	


The appeal


	
	The appellants relied upon the following grounds of appeal:
	


1.   The trial judge erred in finding the scope and content of any duty of care owed by the owner of a residential property required the Defendants to:

(a)   Inferentially, have the balustrade inspected by a structural engineer; or

(b)   Required the balustrade to be dismantled and inspected.

2.   The trial judge erred in finding the Defendants breached their duty of care in the circumstances, having had the posts repainted by a skilled painter, and inspected by a fencing contractor prior to the accident, and not being on notice of a defect which could affect the structural integrity of the balustrade.

3.   The trial judge erred in failing to address the unchallenged evidence of Ms Swift that there was only light surface rust on the post, and no evidence of staining after painting.

4.   The trial judge erred in relying on the opinion of Mr Burn on the question of causation and in his finding of the mode of failure of the balustrade.

5.   The trial judge erred in rejecting the evidence of Mr Swift and Mr Dobson:

(a)   Solely on the question of credit;

(b)   Without assessing the extent to which they corroborated each other on the events leading to the Respondent's fall;

(c)   Without addressing the Appellants' submission that Mr Swift and Mr Dobson corroborate the other on how the accident occurred.

6.   The trial judge engaged in impermissible speculation as to:

(a)   The mechanism of injury and the circumstances leading to the failure of the balustrade;

(b)   The mode of failure of the balustrade; and

(c)   Causation.

7.   The trial judge erred in disregarding the unchallenged evidence of Mr Livingstone, that on inspection shortly after the accident, all fixed and floating flanges that would have restrained the glass panel were in place on the post, leading to the only inference available that the bolts had not failed (contrary to the findings of the trial judge that they had done so).

8. The trial judge erred in finding:

(a)   That the Appellants ought to have known there was a potentially dangerous defect due to corrosion in components that supported the balustrade structure; and

(b)   That the Appellants failed to exercise reasonable care and skill as residential homeowners.


	
	The respondent relied upon a Notice of Contention as follows:
	



	
	1.   His Honour failed to consider properly the alternate theory that the glass in the balcony had failed.
	


Evidentiary issues – Grounds 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7


	
	There was no challenge to the evidence of Ms Swift that there was only surface rust on the posts and lugs in 2006 and no evidence of staining after painting (at [22] – [23] hereof). That evidence was supported by that of Mr Mesker as to the technique which he used to remove rust and to convert any rust affected surface to inert steel (at [26], [28] hereof). It was supported by the observations of Mr Livingstone when he inspected the balustrade in 2010 (at [31] hereof and Blue 60G). It was supported by the evidence of Mr Swift. The observations of Ms Swift were consistent with the pre-purchase report which referred to “the metal lugs and posts have some corrosion …”. That description did not suggest extensive corrosion or rust on those components.
	
	
	In other words, there was no evidence that the metal posts and lugs on the balustrade were extensively or dangerously rusted before Mr Mesker’s work in 2006. After that date, the only evidence was that there was no evidence of observable rust or corrosion. There was no evidence whatsoever as to the state of the bolts connecting the glass to the lugs, either before or after Mr Mesker performed his work. The pre-purchase report made no mention of them.
	
	
	The primary judge rejected in its entirety the evidence of Messrs Swift and Dobson on credit grounds. Rather than taking into account that their observations as to the movement of the respondent were similar, the primary judge found that they had deliberately “tailored” their evidence so as to exaggerate the force with which he came in contact with the glass panel. That was not a finding open to his Honour. This was a very serious adverse finding which required compelling evidence to justify it. A suggestion of concoction was never put to either witness, nor was such an issue raised by the parties at the trial. Moreover, the evidence of Mr Dobson was corroborated in an important respect by Mr Stobo in that he observed the respondent to trip, or catch his leg, when he got to his feet immediately before the accident.
	
	
	It was open to the primary judge to qualify the evidence of Messrs Swift and Dobson on demeanour grounds on the basis that they appeared to him to be describing what they saw in rather dramatic terms and to be exaggerating the force with which the respondent came in contact with the glass panel. That, however, did not involve the complete rejection of their observations. This is particularly so when the respondent had no recollection of how he came to fall and neither his wife nor Mr Stobo saw the fall. Given that Mr Stobo saw the respondent catch his leg or trip, which was consistent with the observation of Mr Dobson and to a lesser extent that of Mr Swift, it is clear that the force involved must have been substantially more than the respondent merely leaning on the glass panel.
	
	
	The primary judge was not entitled to reject the evidence of Mr Dobson on the basis that his observations were adversely affected by his ingestion of alcohol. While Mr Dobson volunteered that he had consumed some alcohol before the fall, it was never put to him that his ingestion of alcohol prevented him from making an accurate observation of how the respondent came to fall.
	
	
	The primary judge’s substantial rejection of the evidence of Mr Livingstone on credit grounds does not withstand scrutiny. The only issue on which it could be said that Mr Livingstone’s evidence might be unreliable was whether the “bolts were in order” when he made his observations of the balustrade within days of the accident having occurred. When that evidence was tested, it became clear that he did not have a recollection of actually having seen the bolts in position at that time.
	
	
	He did, however, explain the earlier evidence by reference to the configuration of the flanges or lugs on each post. It was his evidence as an eye-witness, not as an expert, that at each point where the glass was bolted to a post there was a flange on either side so that the glass was sandwiched between each flange. What is not altogether clear from his evidence was whether both flanges were welded onto the post or whether one of them was a floating flange, i.e. one which would be locked into position by the bolt. In his statement he said that each flange was fixed but in cross-examination his evidence was that there was one fixed and one floating flange (Black 80T, 81E). In re-examination he again said that both flanges were fixed (Black 81T). He explained his evidence by pointing out that because all of the flanges were in place on the post, the only reasonable inference was that the bolts were also in place. That explanation, however, was only available if there was one fixed and one floating flange in each corner. In that context, it is significant that Mr Livingstone never said that he actually saw the bolts.
	
	
	His Honour does not appear to have understood the effect of that evidence. In the circumstances, his Honour was not justified in dismissing the evidence of Mr Livinstone’s observations on the basis that they were “not based on any formal qualifications of an engineering kind” (Red 42J). This was eyewitness evidence of a person who had been selling pool fences and balustrades for 10 years. Such a person would know the significance of the presence of flanges or lugs and the function they performed. No engineering expertise was needed for that.
	
	
	Mr Livingstone said that he thought that he had prepared his first statement in about 2011. He was mistaken in that he had prepared it in 2013. With that as his only basis, his Honour characterised Mr Livingstone as a person with a faulty memory. This, with great respect to the primary judge, was also neither fair nor accurate.
	
	
	It was on the basis of that characterisation of his memory and his Honour’s apparent failure to understand Mr Livingstone’s evidence as to the flanges, that his Honour observed:
	


“His faulty memory and what I consider to be his reconstructed memory based on guess work which included the concession that he could be mistaken about the important detail, cause me to doubt the reliability of his evidence as to the observations he had made of the structure a few days after the accident.” (Red 42S – U)


	
	It was not accurate to say that Mr Livingstone was mistaken about an important detail. At no point did he say that he actually saw the bolts. What he did say was that he observed the flanges/lugs to be in place and from that he inferred the bolts were also “in order”. Of course, that inference was only available to Mr Livingstone if one of the flanges in each corner was floating.
	
	
	His Honour also rejected the eyewitness evidence of Mr Livingstone on the basis that he had conducted many other inspections of pool and other fences between the date of the accident and when he prepared his statements and gave his evidence. Such a finding does not automatically follow from those facts. This is particularly so when Mr Livingstone’s unchallenged evidence was that he was interested to know what had caused the glass panel to fail and that is why he had carried out the particular inspection on his own initiative (Black 72M – N).
	
	
	It follows that there was no proper basis for the primary judge to reject the evidence of Mr Livingstone as to what he saw shortly after the accident and as to what he observed of the condition of the balustrade when making recommendations as to its replacement in 2010. This was the occasion when he was asked by Ms Swift to quote for the cost of replacing the tinted glass in the balustrade with plain glass. There was no basis for his Honour to reject Mr Livingstone’s evidence that he tested the posts of the balustrade in 2010 and found them to be solidly attached. This was one of the modes of testing recommended by Mr Burn for assessing the structural stability of a balustrade (Blue 36W).
	
	
	His Honour also ignored the corroboration of the evidence of Mr Livingstone by Ms Swift. Far from having a defective memory, Mr Livingstone was able to remember the reason why he had been asked to quote on replacing the glass in the balustrade in 2010 and why he refused to simply replace the glass and recommended that the whole balustrade should be replaced, i.e. because the regulations had changed in that the specifications for balustrades were different, requiring an increased height, and also a bar or railing to be placed on top. This was fully in line with the evidence of Ms Swift on that issue.
	
	
	I have concluded that it was not open to his Honour to reject the evidence of Mr Livingstone on the bases which he did. When assessing the circumstances of this accident, the evidence of Mr Livingstone should have been properly taken into account and given due weight.
	
	
	The appellants have challenged the evidence of Mr Burn, essentially on the basis that it was based on speculation not inference, and that it lacked a sound evidentiary basis. As already indicated, at the time that Mr Burn prepared his reports of 25 November 2013 and 8 July 2014 he had very little information available to him and was proceeding on assumptions he was asked to make. Most particularly, he had not attended the site for an inspection, had not seen any photographs and had not inspected any of the component parts of the balustrade. All that he had available was the pre-purchase report and the quotations and other documents produced by Mr Mesker. In his two reports, no mention was made by Mr Burn of the bolts connecting the glass panels to the lugs/flanges. The focus was upon the posts and the lugs/flanges. It was only in evidence at trial, after having read the statement of Mr Livingstone, that for the first time he focused on the lack of maintenance and suggested corrosion of the bolts as the cause of the accident. Even then he assumed (incorrectly as it turned out) that at each point of connection there was only a single metal lug which connected the glass to the bolt (see [45] hereof).
	
	
	What emerged from cross-examination was that Mr Burn had no knowledge of the length of the bolts, their thickness, what they were made of and the extent (if any) of any rust/corrosion of them between the date of the pre-purchase report and the accident. In his evidence he relied on the standard for bolts at that time (Black 68Q). That, however, may not have been relevant or applicable given the observation of Mr Livingstone that:
	


“3.3   A closer inspection revealed the post/flange structure was not a typical “off the shelf” standard product but in fact had been constructed d.i.y.”


	
	Cross-examination also revealed that Mr Burn had no knowledge of the type of glass and its thickness used in the panels on the balustrade. His evidence was based on assumptions which were incapable of being verified. The potential problems with the glass and the likelihood that it was an older style of glass lacking the “toughness” of modern glass, was made clear by Mr Livingstone at Blue 59P – Q and Blue 60R – S. The limitations of a visual inspection of the glass (which Mr Livingstone was able to carry out but which Mr Burn could not) was exacerbated by the fact that the glass was tinted, not plain.
	
	
	Cross-examination revealed that whereas Mr Burn had expertise as a civil engineer, he had little knowledge of the shatter and/or fracture properties of glass of different types. His experience appears to have been limited to a period when he was working for a local council in a workshop which from time to time was required to repair windscreens on vehicles which had been damaged. The timeframe for that experience was never explored or established and the relationship between the glass used on the windscreens of cars and the older style of glass apparently used on the balustrade was never explored or established (Black 67S – V).
	
	
	Mr Burn said that the likely force exerted by the respondent when he “leaned” on the balustrade was between 1 and 50 kgs. How that figure was arrived at and what assumptions underpinned it, was never explained. How that figure might alter if more force were exerted than merely leaning on the glass, was also not explained or explored. Another difficulty with the evidence was that Mr Burn assumed that there was only one flange on one side of the glass at each point of connection. Mr Livingstone said that there was either a fixed flange on one side of the glass and a floating flange on the other or a fixed flange on either side at each point of connection. How the different configuration of the flanges to that assumed by Mr Burn might have or would have affected the mechanism by which the failure occurred was never explained.
	
	
	If the flanges were fixed, it is difficult to understand how the failure of a single bolt would have led to the glass panel failing in the manner suggested by Mr Burn. The flanges would have held the glass in position for at least some time. Alternatively, if there was one fixed flange and one floating flange in each corner, it is still difficult to understand how the mechanism of failure described by Mr Burn could occur. Even if it be surmised that the glass may have slipped downwards, rather than moved outwards, this would require all four bolts to have failed almost instantaneously.
	
	
	Alternatively, the glass could have fractured given that we know so little about it and what we do is based purely on the visual inspection of Mr Livingstone. The evidence as to where the glass was found does not greatly assist. There was no witness who said in terms that there was no glass left on the balustrade since no witness appears to have looked. Certainly some witnesses said that there was glass beneath the respondent when he fell with Ms Swift observing that some of the glass comprised large pieces. Little can be inferred from the sparse evidence as to where glass was observed after the accident.
	
	
	The problem for the respondent generally and by reference to Mr Burn’s evidence in particular, is the lack of evidence to establish on the balance of probabilities how the accident occurred. There is an underlying problem in that the post/flange structure was not a typical “off the shelf standard product but in fact had been constructed d.i.y”. This meant that assumptions could not be made that the products used were in accordance with the standard in place at the time. That problem was exacerbated by the fact that the date of the construction of the balustrade is not known except that it was probably before 1992 when the regulations changed and prescribed a height greater than 900mm with a railing or bar on top. Accordingly, to the extent that reliance was placed on relevant standards, we do not know the timeframe.
	
	
	With that limitation in mind, there was no information at all about the dimensions or makeup of the bolts. There was no information as to the extent of the rust/corrosion of the posts and lugs observed by the author of the pre-purchase report. What was clear from the report was that not all of the posts and lugs were so affected. To the extent that there was any evidence on the subject, it was that of Ms Swift that what she observed on the posts and lugs was surface rust only. There was some support for that observation in the evidence of Mr Mesker. The implicit assumption in the findings of the primary judge of extensive corrosion being present on the external fixtures which could be observed, i.e. the posts and lugs, was not supported by evidence. To the extent that there was any evidence, it was to the contrary.
	
	
	Putting the evidence of Mr Burn at its highest, it goes no further than identifying the failure of the bolts as a possible mechanism for the accident. For it to reach the level of being a probable cause, the assumptions upon which it was based had to be made out and they were not. There was no evidence that the bolts were in fact rusty. The evidence went no further than to establish surface rust on some posts and flanges. For Mr Burn’s theory to be made out, what then had to be inferred was that not only similar rust but more extensive rust was affecting the bolts (the dimensions and structure of which are unknown) which over time continued to progress thereby causing them to fail when a relatively modest pressure was imposed on them. That, of course, ignores Mr Burn’s misunderstanding of how the flanges securing the glass panels were configured. If the configuration was by fixed flange and a floating flange, the flanges simply could not have been in position, as Mr Livingstone stated, if the bolts had failed. If the two flanges were both fixed, it is difficult to envisage a mechanism which would have caused the glass panel to fail even if the bolts had done so unless it was the glass panel itself which failed by one of the mechanisms put to Mr Burn in cross-examination, i.e. the glass simply being exposed to a force which it could not withstand or a latent defect.
	
	
	The evidence in this case as to how the respondent came to fall is exiguous. To explain the cause of the accident, on the basis found by his Honour in reliance upon the opinion of Mr Burn, involved speculation not inference. It follows that Ground 6 has been made out and factual causation giving rise to liability on the part of the appellants has not been made out.
	


Grounds 1, 2 and 8


	
	There are real problems with his Honour’s articulation of the duty of care and its breach by the appellants.
	
	
	There was in fact no clear articulation of the duty of care, although the statement at Red 50F – G gets closest, i.e. “as occupiers of the premises the defendants owed the plaintiff a duty to take reasonable care, including to take precautions against the risk of injury occurring due to a condition of the premises which they knew or ought to have known to represent a foreseeable risk of injury to persons such as the plaintiff”. At no time did his Honour set out the content or scope of that duty of care.
	
	
	Having set out that statement of the duty of care, his Honour moved directly to breach of duty. The danger with such an approach is that the duty of care and its content are liable to be defined in terms of breach which is productive of error. In Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan [2002] HCA 54; 211 CLR 540 McHugh said at [106]:
	


“106   … To formulate the duty in more specific terms invites error because it is likely to mix a question of law (whether a duty existed) with a question of fact (whether a breach occurred). If the duty is formulated in specific terms, the issue on breach is whether the duty has been performed in accordance with the terms of the duty as formulated. But, as Wyong Shire Council v Shirt shows, the question of breach is far more complex than an affirmative or negative answer to the question whether the defendant carried out the duty as formulated. It involves evaluating and weighing a number of competing considerations. …”


	
	Gummow and Hayne JJ made observations to similar effect in that case.
	


“191   An analysis of the competing considerations referred to in Wyong Shire Council is impeded, not assisted, by formulating the relevant duty of care in terms of its breach, which was the approach that the majority in the Full Court appeared to adopt. The use by Kiefel J in the passage quoted in [189] above of the words ""sufficient"" and ""could be regarded"" does not deny the cogency of the submission by the Barclay companies that duty was identified in terms of breach.

192   A duty of care that is formulated retrospectively as an obligation purely to avoid the particular act or omission said to have caused loss, or to avert the particular harm that in fact eventuated, is of its nature likely to obscure the proper inquiry as to breach. That inquiry involves identifying, with some precision, what a reasonable person in the position of the defendant would do by way of response to the reasonably foreseeable risk. As Isaacs ACJ observed in 1924, ""[n]o conclusion of negligence can be arrived at until, first, the mind conceives affirmatively what should have been done"". The trial judge and the majority of the Full Court in the present case failed to identify with the necessary precision, by reference to considerations of the nature of those indicated in Wyong Shire Council, the reasonable response to the risk of harm that existed. In so failing, their Honours fell into an error of law. …”


	
	Observations to that effect were made by both Gummow and Hayne JJ in Vairy v Wyong Shire Council [2005] HCA 62; 223 CLR 422:
	


“60   The determination of the existence and content of a duty is not assisted by looking first to the damage sustained by the plaintiff and the alleged want of care in that regard by the defendant. There is a particular danger in doing so in a case such as the present. The focus on consideration of the issue of breach necessarily is upon the fate that befell the particular plaintiff. In that sense analysis is retrospective rather than prospective.

61   In his reasons in this appeal, Hayne J explains why an examination of the causes of an accident that has occurred does not assist, and may confuse, in the assessment of what the reasonable person ought to have done to discharge the anterior duty of care. Moreover, an assessment of what ought to have been done, but was not done, critical to the breach issue, too easily is transmuted into an answer to the question of what if anything had to be done, a duty of care issue. (Gummow J)

…

105   The central issue in the appeal is whether the Council breached a duty of care it owed to the appellant by not erecting one or more signs warning against, or prohibiting, diving from the rock platform. Resolving that question, a question of fact, hinges critically upon recognising that what has come to be known as the ""Shirt calculus"" is not to be undertaken by looking back at what has in fact happened, but by looking forward from a time before the occurrence of the injury giving rise to the claim. The several questions described by Mason J in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt are to be asked and answered with that perspective. Thus, before the appellant was injured, would ""a reasonable man in the [Council's] position ... have foreseen that his conduct involved a risk of injury to the [appellant] or to a class of persons including the [appellant]? If the answer to that question is affirmative, ""it is then for the tribunal of fact to determine what a reasonable man would do by way of response to the risk"".

…

124   Again, because the inquiry is prospective, it would be wrong to focus exclusively upon the particular way in which the accident that has happened came about. In an action in which a plaintiff claims damages for personal injury it is inevitable that much attention will be directed to investigating how the plaintiff came to be injured. The results of those investigations may be of particular importance in considering questions of contributory negligence. But the apparent precision of investigations into what happened to the particular plaintiff must not be permitted to obscure the nature of the questions that are presented in connection with the inquiry into breach of duty. In particular, the examination of the causes of an accident that has happened cannot be equated with the examination that is to be undertaken when asking whether there was a breach of a duty of care which was a cause of the plaintiff's injuries. The inquiry into the causes of an accident is wholly retrospective. It seeks to identify what happened and why. The inquiry into breach, although made after the accident, must attempt to answer what response a reasonable person, confronted with a foreseeable risk of injury, would have made to that risk. And one of the possible answers to that inquiry must be ""nothing"".” (Hayne J)


	
	When dealing with breach, the primary judge found that the injury was foreseeable because there were a number of guests in close proximity to the balustrade, which had earlier been the subject of a recommendation for replacement, and which had not been inspected for structural integrity. His Honour found that a reasonable response was to properly maintain the balustrade which involved ensuring that the structural components were not affected by rust, or if they were, that they be replaced. He found that if such structural components were not checked, it was necessary for the appellants to obtain expert structural advice (Red 51Q – 53L).
	
	
	The primary judge (see [76] hereof) found that in view of the contents of the pre-purchase report, retaining a painter without structural qualifications was not an adequate response to the foreseeable risk of injury posed by the balustrade. This was because although the lugs and posts may have been adequately treated by painting, nothing had been done about the bolts which would have become unsafe because of continuing corrosion/rust. His Honour found that it was not open to the appellants to assume that the work carried out by Mr Mesker as a painter had ensured the structural soundness of the balustrade (Red 54L – P).
	
	
	The effect of the reasoning of the primary judge was to define the scope of the duty of care as requiring the appellants to ensure the structural stability of the balustrade before allowing guests to position themselves upon it. The basis for that obligation was the pre-purchase report of 2002. The references to obtaining expert opinion and disassembling and inspecting components were merely ways of achieving that result.
	
	
	As can be seen, this reasoning gave rise to the very error which was identified in the statements of principle above. It, in effect, defined the duty by reference to breach of duty, i.e. by reference to what happened and ignored the proper inquiry which was a prospective one. It is the very error identified by the majority (Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Callinan JJ) in Vairy. At first instance in Vairy the focus of the inquiry had been on the particular rock platform from which the plaintiff had dived and what, if any, remedial action should have been taken in relation to it. As the majority in the High Court made clear, the true inquiry was a consideration of the duty owed by the council, not just in respect of that rock platform but in respect of the whole 27kms of coastline for which it was responsible.
	
	
	This was explained as follows:
	


“88   Reference has been made above to the geographic reach of the Council's responsibilities. It is doubtful whether the rock platform may properly be described as ""a distinct and unusual natural formation"". The finding on that issue by the trial judge was based upon evidence concerning the geography of the Warringah Shire.

89   Indeed, one may doubt whether there is anything to distinguish the rock platform from the other areas of coastline or shoreline which the Council had been charged with the task of managing. The Council submitted, for example, that evidence of the frequency with which members of the public are injured as a result of activities associated with the rock platform is of little assistance in this case because ""[t]here was no attempt on [Mr Vairy's] part to show that there was something special [in this] in relation to [the] rock platform"". …

…

91   The question must then be asked: if, as Mr Vairy contends, the Council had a duty to warn of the risks associated with diving from the rock platform, why did it not also have a duty to warn of these other risks both on the platform and at every point along the coastline and shoreline for which it was responsible? … (Gummow J)

…

121   All the matters relied on by the appellant in connection with breach of duty took as the focus of their attention what was to be done about diving from the rock platform near Soldiers Beach. Is that question too confined?

122   … And it is clear, therefore, that to ask what was to be done about diving from the rock platform near Soldiers Beach was a relevant, indeed a central, question to ask and answer. But, as Romeo v Conservation Commission (NT) demonstrates, while it is necessary to look at what ought to have been done in relation to activities on the rock platform, attention cannot be confined to the precise place at which the events in question took place. In deciding what the response of a reasonable council would have been to the risk of diving injuries it is necessary to recognise that that council would be bound to consider all of the land of which the council had the care, control and management. That consideration may yield different answers for different places but all would have had to be considered. And it is a consideration that must be set into a much wider context than is provided by focusing only upon diving injuries. The duty of care which a council owes to those who enter land of which it has the care, control and management is a duty which is not limited to taking reasonable care to prevent one particular form of injury associated with one particular kind of recreational activity.” (Hayne J)


	
	It should be noted that both Gummow and Hayne JJ observed that in this respect, the position of the local council in Vairy was generally analogous to that of an occupier of land. Reference was made to what Hayne J said in Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory [1998] HCA 5; 192 CLR 431 at [152]:
	


“152   It has now long been held by this Court that the position of an authority …which has power to manage, and does manage, land which the public use as of right is broadly analogous to that of an occupier of private land. It is the management of the land by the authority which provides the necessary relationship of proximity between authority and members of the public.”


	
	A statement of the duty of care should be at a high level of generality with amplification being by way of a statement of its content or scope. The following articulation of the duty was given by Dawson J in Northern Sandblasting Pty Ltd v Harris [1997] HCA 39; 188 CLR 313. Although the members of the High Court gave different reasons in that case, Gummow J agreed with that statement of duty and Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ cited it with approval in Jones v Bartlett [2000] HCA 56; 205 CLR 166:
	


“[The duty of care is] that which arises under the ordinary principles of the law of negligence, namely, a duty to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risk of injury to the respondent. The nature and extent of the duty in the particular instance depends upon the circumstances of the case.”


	
	In Sakoua v Williams [2005] NSWCA 405; 64 NSWLR 588 at [9] Mason P quoted with approval a passage from the judgment of Hodgson JA (with whom Sheller and Bryson JJA agreed) in Ahluwalia and Ors v Robinson [2003] NSWCA 175, at [23] as follows:
	


“23   … Jones v Bartlett makes it clear that, in the absence of a contract supportive of a higher duty, the duty of a landlord in relation to the safety of premises does not in general require a landlord to commission experts to inspect premises to look for latent defects, nor is it a duty to make premises as safe as reasonable care can make them. In general terms, the duty of the landlord is to be determined by reference to foreseeable risk of harm and what a reasonable person would do in response to that risk.”


	
	The start point for the inquiry as to the scope of the duty of care in this case, and whether the duty was breached, is that these were residential premises. The purpose of the pre-purchase report was to bring to the attention of the appellants defects in the premises which they were intending to purchase to put them on notice of likely or possible expenditure over and above the purchase price. Its purpose was not to place them on notice of possible dangers which visitors to the premises might encounter.
	
	
	The focus of the primary judge was on what the pre-purchase report said about the handrails. That recommendation, however, was one of many contained in the 20 pages of the report devoted to the premises. There was nothing to separate the recommendations made in respect of the handrails from other recommendations. Most particularly, the recommendations relating to the handrails did not appear under the headings “Issues” or “Safety Concerns” in the pre-purchase report and to which reference has been made at [19] – [20] hereof.
	
	
	There was nothing in the recommendation relating to the handrails which indicated a risk of danger or that the handrails or balustrade might fail. For example, there was no warning such as was given in relation to “Glass” under “Safety Concerns” i.e. “this is considered to be serious …”. There was nothing in the terms of the recommendation to indicate urgency or danger. The recommendation simply stated that there was “some” corrosion of the metal lugs and posts for which the remedy suggested was “rust proofing and repainting” such as was performed by Mr Mesker or “simply replacing”. I do not read that last recommendation as indicating a replacement of the whole of the balustrade but as replacing the particular post.
	
	
	When one looks at all of the recommendations in the pre-purchase report, there are a number which potentially could cause harm if not remedied and the likelihood of such harm was much greater than that indicated by the recommendation in respect of the handrails, e.g. in relation to “Lintels” (Blue 12N) the recommendation was:
	


“Painted over monitor for corrosion. # see building advice. Corroding arch bars cause cracking to masonry surfaces and should be replaced with galvanised steel arch bars.”


	
	As indicated, the content of the duty found by his Honour (at least implicitly) was far too narrow in focusing upon the recommendation as to handrails, rather than the many other recommendations contained in the report. What the primary judge did was to telescope the concepts of duty and breach retrospectively by focusing on the accident which occurred and not prospectively looking at the position of the appellants as purchasers having before them a pre-purchase report with a large number of recommendations. Only a small number of the recommendations were identified as either “Issues” or as “Safety Concerns”. They did not include the recommendation in respect of the handrails.
	
	
	To impose a duty of care based on the pre-purchase report on the appellants in the way in which his Honour stated would involve an obligation to implement all the recommendations in the report which foreseeably might cause harm to a visitor. To separate and focus upon the recommendation for the handrails was to do the very thing identified in Vairy as impermissible when considering a duty of care and its breach. As was there made clear, the issue of duty and its breach involved not merely placing warning signs on the rock platform from which Mr Vairy dived, but on every rock platform from which a person could potentially dive over the 27 kilometres of coastline under the control of the Council.
	
	
	It follows that the appellants did not owe a duty to the respondent with the content and scope implicitly found by his Honour, i.e. not to allow visitors to enter upon the rear balcony until expert opinion had been obtained in relation to its integrity or until an inspection of the fixtures had taken place so as to ensure the absence of corrosion of the bolts. If the pre-purchase report had the effect sought to be given to it by the primary judge, the scope of the duty would have required the appellants to have refused to allow visitors onto the premises until every recommendation in the pre-purchase report, which might foreseeably cause injury, had been complied with. That is an unreasonable requirement. The duty owed by the appellants was to exercise reasonable care. The duty implicitly found to exist by the primary judge went well beyond that. A duty which focused only on the handrails invited a finding of breach.
	
	
	For similar reasons, breach of duty has not been established. When reasoning to that conclusion I have, contrary to my finding as to factual causation, accepted that the glass panel on the balustrade failed because of the corrosion of a bolt.
	
	
	By reference to s 5B CLA, the “risk of harm” would be that the failure of a bolt would occur. I am, however, not satisfied that the risk of such an event was reasonably foreseeable. There was no evidence that the appellants had actual knowledge concerning a corroded bolt, nor on the evidence should they have known.
	
	
	The pre-purchase report made no mention of bolts. It referred only to the posts and lugs. The extent of the corrosion, as of December 2002, was not established. It can, however, be inferred from the description that not every post and lug was so affected, otherwise one would have expected a greater qualification such as “extensive” or “widespread” rather than the use of the word “some”. The extent of the corrosion cannot have been very great if painting and rust proofing was identified as an adequate response. Importantly, there was no mention in the recommendation of the bolts securing the glass to the lugs. In the absence of some specialised knowledge on their part, there was no reason why the appellants should have been on notice that apart from some “surface rust” there could have been a corrosive process attacking the bolts. Similarly, there was no basis for finding that in the absence of some specialised knowledge, the appellants would have appreciated that since they could not visually observe the state of the bolts, they should obtain expert opinion on that issue. The identified risk of harm was not reasonably foreseeable.
	
	
	To the extent that there was a risk of harm known to the appellants, i.e. some corrosion of the lugs and posts, their response was that of a reasonable person in their position. What could be observed of the posts and lugs was surface rust, not deep seated corrosion. There was no urgency indicated in the pre-purchase report for the need to take remedial action. In the circumstances, retaining a painter to carry out one of the recommendations made in the pre-purchase report approximately three years after they had taken possession of the premises, was not unreasonable. Moreover, there was no evidence from the painter that the corrosion which he treated was such that “rust proofing and repainting” would not be adequate. There was no evidence of any rust observed on any part of the handrails after Mr Mesker’s painting in March 2006.
	
	
	Had there been significant corrosion giving rise to structural weakness, it was not unreasonable for the appellants to expect to be advised to that effect by Mr Mesker. Mr Mesker did not give evidence that he had observed significant corrosion and the appellants were not so advised by him. There was also the evidence of Mr Burn at Blue 45Q – T that if Mr Mesker had observed “the degraded state of the brackets and lugs”, he should have raised the condition of the handrail with the appellants and suggested a structural assessment be conducted before the metalwork was primed and painted.
	
	
	In the circumstances known to them, the response of the appellants was reasonable.
	
	
	On the basis of what the appellants were able to observe of the handrail, the information concerning it in the pre-purchase report and the absence of any notification by Mr Mesker of substantial corrosion, the probability that harm would occur and the likely seriousness of that harm was low.
	
	
	In relation to the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm (s 5B(2)(c) CLA) one of the findings of the primary judge, by way of response to what he identified as the foreseeable risk of harm, was for the rear balustrade to be completely replaced. When articulating the breach of duty by the appellants, his Honour on a number of occasions referred to there having been a recommendation for the replacement of the balustrade in 2010 but that the recommendation had not been implemented by them. The implication was that the recommendation to replace the balustrade was based on safety considerations.
	
	
	That is an incorrect statement of the evidence. The evidence on the subject came from Ms Swift and from Mr Livingstone. Its effect was this. Ms Swift was unhappy with having tinted glass panels on the balustrade. When Mr Livingstone attended to provide a quote to repair/replace the pool fencing he was also asked to provide a quote to replace the tinted glass with plain glass on the balustrade. Because the regulations as to balustrades had changed since the construction of this balustrade, Mr Livingstone was not prepared to replace the tinted glass panels with plain glass panels of the same size. His explanation was:
	


“A. Ms Swift asked me if we replace the glass with clear glass. I had a look at the overall structure, and even though it complied to the rules, probably in the time that fence was built, it wasn’t in accordance with the new rules. I wasn’t willing to put in or replace that glass. I told her that I would prefer to see a new balustrade in place.” (Black 75E – F)

Despite that recommendation, Mr Livingstone said that he did not regard the balustrade as it was in 2010, as unsafe (Black 75M).


	
	Although not in the written submissions, there arose in the course of oral argument a discussion as to why the appellants completely replaced the balustrade following the accident instead of simply replacing the fractured glass panel. Neither appellant was asked about that issue and there was no other evidence directed to it. On that state of the evidence, it would be unsafe to infer that the whole balustrade was replaced because other parts of it were corroded and dangerous. To the extent that any inference is available, it can probably be drawn from the evidence of Mr Livingstone, to which reference has just been made. Given that an accident had occurred, Mr Livingstone almost certainly would have recommended that the whole balustrade be replaced with one which complied with the new rules.
	
	
	It follows from the above analysis that breach of duty was not established.
	
	
	For the reasons set out above, the appeal should be allowed.
	


Notice of Contention


	
	The notice contended that his Honour should have considered properly the alternative theory that the glass in the balcony had failed. The respondent should not be allowed to rely upon the Notice of Contention for a number of reasons.
	
	
	It was never part of the respondent’s case at trial that there had been a failure of the glass panel. That issue was raised in cross-examination by the appellants as an alternative theory to that put forward by Mr Burn.
	
	
	Had the respondent sought to rely upon the failure of the glass panel as an alternative basis for a finding of negligence against the appellants, it is the sort of matter on which evidence could and would have been given.
	
	
	The relevant statement of principle is set out in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33; 162 CLR 1 where the plurality (Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ) said at 7:
	


“… To say that an appeal is by way of rehearing does not mean that the issues and the evidence to be considered are at large. It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial. If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish. The powers of an appellate court with respect to amendment are ordinarily to be exercised within the general framework of the issues so determined and not otherwise. In a case where, had the issue been raised in the court below, evidence could have been given which by any possibility could have prevented the point from succeeding, this Court has firmly maintained the principle that the point cannot be taken afterwards.”


	
	The respondent’s application to rely upon his Notice of Contention should be refused.
	


Orders


	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	The appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The verdict and judgment in favour of the respondent on 9 October 2014 is set aside.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, there be verdict and judgment in favour of the appellants.
	
	
	The order for costs of the trial in favour of the respondent is set aside.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the respondent is ordered to pay the appellants’ costs of the trial.
	
	
	The respondent is to pay the appellants’ costs of the appeal.
	



	
	SIMPSON JA: The comprehensive statement of the relevant facts and circumstances contained in the judgment of Hoeben JA, which I have read in draft, relieves me of the need to undertake an extensive recitation. I will confine my references to the facts to those that are directly relevant to the issues raised on appeal, and my conclusions.
	
	
	The respondent particularised his case against the appellants as follows:
	


“a  Allowing the plaintiff access to the offending balcony area when the defendants knew, or ought to have known, that the balustrade/handrails was dangerously corroded in the circumstances;

b  Failing to warn the plaintiff as to the state of the offending balustrade in the circumstances so as to ensure his safety;

c  Failing to rectify the corrosion of the metal lugs and posts by either rustproofing and re-painting or replacing same;

d  Failing to properly and/or adequately inspect the offending balustrade/handrails prior to allowing the plaintiff access to the balcony;

e  Failing to heed the Property Inspection Report dated 18 December 2002 which put them on notice that the offending metal lugs and posts were dangerously corroded and required replacing.”


	
	The claim was governed by the provisions of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).
	
	
	The essential facts for the purpose of this appeal are as follows. In 2002, prior to purchase of the property, the appellants commissioned a building report which was provided by Mr Philip Connor, a building consultant. The report is lengthy (31 pages) and covers a range of issues. Relevantly for present purposes, the report made reference, under the heading “Safety Concerns”, to “Glass”, but this appears to be confined to shower screens, windows and “the like”, and not to include the glass constituting the balustrade on the balcony. After making some observations about the concrete and other aspects of the balcony, Mr Connor wrote:
	


“Handrails

The glass handrails have no safety glass stickers on the glass panels, have a glazier inspect the glass and upgrade as required. The metal lugs and posts have some corrosion we recommend rust proofing and repainting or simply replacing.”

Both the hearing before the primary judge and the appeal proceeded on the basis that this was a reference to the glass balustrade.


	
	Following purchase, the appellants undertook some remedial work. That work included replacing glass fencing around the swimming pool (in 2010) and painting the steel poles supporting the upstairs balustrade (in 2006). The pool fences were replaced by a company called Abbey Fencing, of whom Mr Peter Livingstone was a sales consultant; the painting was done by Mr Alex Mesker.
	
	
	Mr Mesker gave evidence that he checked for rust on the “tabs” that were holding the glass between the posts. He observed no rust, and so found it unnecessary to dismantle the balustrade or remove the glass. He said that his practice was to clean or descale, and use a proprietary rust convertor which converts the rust to an inert steel; and then to apply an oil based primer that excludes oxygen, and finish with an oil based coat of paint over the final coat.
	
	
	Mr Livingstone’s evidence was given, in the first instance, by way of a statement made on 8 July 2014. He said that he had been asked to attend the premises to inspect, report on, and quote with respect to the pool fence, but that while he was there Ms Swift (the second appellant) asked him to estimate the cost of replacing the existing tinted glass on the balustrade with clear glass. In his statement he described the balustrade as follows:
	


“3.2  The balustrade consisted of a post with 2 separate welded flat plate side flanges on each side of the post and each flange had a hole through it; the glass also had holes suitably located to enable a bolt/nut to secure the glass to the flanges.

3.3  A closer inspection revealed the post/flange structure was not a typical ‘off the shelf’ standard product but in fact had been constructed d.i.y.; however such construction appeared to be very sound. Due to the finishing tile/slate around the base of the posts I was not able to readily identify how the posts were affixed to the concrete base of the balcony; however when side pressure was applied to the posts they appeared to be well anchored.”


	
	Because of the height of the balustrade, Mr Livingstone considered that replacing the glass alone would result in a balustrade that failed to meet then current building standards, and accordingly declined to take that course. In the process, however, he noted:
	


“3.4  The posts appeared to me in good working order with no apparent sign of rusting or any other form deterioration [sic]; there were no other immediate signs of structural shortfall with the balustrade.”


	
	Mr Livingstone was unable to locate any documentation that would enable him to pinpoint the date of his first visit to the premises, but he believed that it was sometime in 2010.
	
	
	Mr Livingstone next attended the premises on 12 November 2011, after the respondent’s fall. He said that there was no immediate or apparent damage to the balustrade and that the posts and flanges to which the glass would have been affixed appeared still to be sound and in good working order. All that was untoward that was observed by Mr Livingstone was the absence of the one sheet of glass that had been associated with the respondent’s fall.
	
	
	In oral evidence he said that, on his second visit, because he was interested to see why the accident might have happened, he had examined the site where the glass was missing; he observed that the posts were in good order, as were the brackets and bolts, which showed no damage. Only the glass was missing.
	
	
	This assertion was the subject of some cross-examination. Mr Livingstone acknowledged that he had made no mention in his statement of observing the intact bolts. He said, however, that he had a memory of seeing the bolts. He said that the recollection had come to him while thinking about what he had seen. He did not accept that his recollection was the result of reconstruction. It was put to him that he was guessing, to which he answered “possibly”. He agreed that he could have been mistaken.
	
	
	He agreed that he had no specific recollection of seeing the bolts, but that:
	


“The only way that the back plate would have been held in place would have been for a bolt to be there.”

He explained this in re-examination:

“So on the post is welded a front and back plate which a bolt would go through that plate to hold the glass in position. That front and back plate were in place and, as I thought I recalled, there was a bolt holding those – that bolt was still in place as well.”


	
	It is of some interest that, although only one glass panel was broken, Mr Livingstone’s company replaced the whole balustrade. Why this was done in preference to repair of the one broken panel was not explored in the evidence. There was no evidence called from the contractor who replaced the balustrade, and who might have been expected to have had some knowledge of the state of the bolts on the broken glass, and also on the other panels.
	
	
	Accounts of how the respondent came to fall varied. The respondent said that he had consumed a small amount of alcohol, and had been sitting at a table with two of the guests (Dennis Stobo and his wife) when he suffered a cramp in his right leg. (This was a condition from which he suffered intermittently, and for which he was receiving treatment.) He stood up to steady himself, and put out his left hand against the balustrade. He was about a metre to a metre and a half away from the balustrade. He leaned against the balustrade. He had no further recollection of the fall; his next memory was of travelling in an ambulance to hospital.
	
	
	The respondent’s wife (Lyn Montgomery) gave evidence to similar effect. She said that she saw the respondent stand up; it seemed to her that he was having a problem with a cramp. He put out his left arm which landed on the top of the glass, although she was not sure whether contact was made. He then disappeared from view.
	
	
	Mr Dennis Stobo said that the respondent stood up, appeared to have his foot caught, perhaps in his chair, and stumbled. He reached out his arm (probably his left), reaching for the horizontal railing on top of the balustrade. (It is doubtful that there was a separate railing above the top of the glass.)
	
	
	The first appellant, Mr Anthony Swift, gave a different account. He said that he was on the balcony sitting at a table with other guests, including the respondent. He saw the respondent stand, his left leg gave way completely, he stumbled to his left and “crashed” into one of the glass panels with great force. His hip hit the glass panel. The glass panel gave way, and the respondent fell, with the glass panel, to the garden bed below. Mr Swift said that he had a very clear memory of the respondent “hitting that panel at considerable force”. He used language such as “smashing into the panel”; he repeated the word “crashed” on more than one occasion. He likened the event to “a rugby game or something”, and said that “it was a big impact, massive impact”.
	
	
	Mr Ian Dobson was another guest at the party. He was seated at a table on the balcony. He saw the respondent stand. Mr Dobson thought that he had probably caught his foot on the chair or the table. He stumbled towards where Mr Dobson was, corrected, and headed towards the balustrade, which he struck with his shoulder in the middle of the glass. Mr Dobson also used a rugby union analogy; he said that the respondent “hit it [the glass panel] fair and square with his shoulder, straight through it, right in the middle of the glass, straight through …”. He maintained that the respondent’s body struck the glass.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mr Dobson volunteered some evidence about his alcohol consumption on the afternoon and evening. In answer to a question specifically challenging his recollection (about where the respondent was seated), he said (unresponsively):
	


“Well, you’ve got to also consider – I want to say all – I’d had a few drinks too, but as I say, I don’t know, I’m pretty sure Lyn [Montgomery - the respondent’s wife] was sitting there. I really do think Lyn was sitting there. They’d been sitting there all afternoon and evening so --”

When asked what he meant by “a few drinks” he replied:

“Whatever, we were still compos mentis.”


	
	He said that they had begun drinking at about 3 or 4 o’clock in the afternoon, that he had been drinking light beer, and had probably had “a wine” with the meal, and possibly champagne for a toast, that he was not driving, and accordingly had no reason to count his drinks.
	
	
	There was also some evidence about the fate of the glass panel. Ms Montgomery said that there was no broken glass on the balcony, but there was a lot of glass on the ground under and around the respondent. Mr Stobo made no observations of glass on the balcony, but saw glass on the ground. Ms Swift said that the whole panel of glass had fallen to the ground, and was on the ground in some big pieces.
	
	
	The respondent called evidence from an expert, Mr Ian Burn, a consultant engineer, who provided two reports, dated 25 November 2013 and 8 July 2014. Because, by the time Mr Burn was retained, the balustrade had been replaced, he did not inspect the site. He had no details of the glazing work on the balcony. He assumed that the recommendation in Mr Connor’s building report had not been implemented. In this he was correct; Mr Mesker had painted, but not rust-proofed or replaced, the metal lugs and posts. He assumed therefore (and on the basis of past experience) that the collapse of the balustrade was caused by corrosion of the handrail fixings. In the second report he was asked to answer several specific questions.
	
	
	In his second report, Mr Burn drew attention to a discrepancy in a quotation given by Mr Mesker in March 2006, and a later quotation in August 2010, which was the quotation for the work actually undertaken. The earlier quotation specified remedial rustproofing to metalwork; this was not included in the later quotation. Mr Mesker expressed the opinion that, had the work quoted in 2006 been then carried out, the continued corrosion of the handrail and its fixtures may have been arrested, preventing the collapse in 2011.
	
	
	In oral evidence, Mr Burn was asked if he had reached a conclusion as to how the accident occurred. His answer is recorded in the transcript as follows:
	


“Yeah. Bolts were … (not transcribable) … and basically corroded sufficiently so that when there’s pressure applied to the glassing they snapped and the glass swung down.”

A little later, he was asked to elaborate upon that and answered:

“The method used to secure the glass panel to the posts was, from looking at the photographs, four bolts, which would be through the glass panel and through the bracket on the post. If one of those bolts fails because of corrosion, the panel is going to pull away from the bracket and just by the – if one bolt is corroded, unless one of the other three bolts has been replaced, they will be in a similar state of degradation. So, as the panel falls away, the increased load on the other bolts is going to cause them to snap as well.”

And, later:

“If the bolts were in good order when he leant against it, it wouldn’t have given way. When he leant against it, the load he put on the balustrade was more than the bolts could handle, so they failed.”


	
	He expressed the opinion that:
	


“… one bolt failed and as a result of that one bolt failing, the transfer of load to the other three bolts caused them to fail, like a zipper effect sort of thing.”


	
	It was Mr Burn’s conclusion that it was the bolts that had failed, rather than the glass. He acknowledged that, if the bolts had still been in place after the respondent’s fall (as Mr Livingstone said they were), that would indicate that there was some other cause for the collapse of the balustrade.
	


The contentions of the parties at trial


	
	A significant factual issue, as to which the evidence was sparse, was the mechanism that caused the glass to give way: did the glass break, shatter, or crack before hitting the ground below, or did the whole of the glass panel separate from the uprights to which it was attached? There was, in fact, no evidence that the glass shattered before it hit the ground below. There was no direct evidence that it had separated from its metal anchorings (to the uprights); an inference that this is what happened emerged, principally from the evidence of Mr Burn.
	
	
	The transcript of 13 August 2014 indicates that both parties provided written submissions. Those written submissions were not included in the appeal papers before this Court.
	
	
	The case advanced on behalf of the respondent was that there was a defect in the balustrading and that this was known to the appellants, and had been known to them since 2002. The defect was caused by the corrosion of the metal lugs and posts by which the glass was attached to the posts, or uprights. As support for this contention, reliance was placed upon the evidence of the location of broken glass after the accident; there was no evidence of broken glass on the balcony; all the broken glass was in the garden bed below. This would indicate that the whole panel of glass had come apart from its anchoring bolts. On the respondent’s case, the painting by Mr Mesker did nothing to address the corrosion. Mr Mesker had no suitable qualifications to assess the integrity of the glass panel or the post to which it was attached. Nor did Mr Livingstone, on his inspection before or after the accident, have relevant qualifications; he was a sales consultant.
	
	
	On behalf of the appellants, issue was taken with the mechanism of the collapse of the balustrade. It was submitted that the evidence did not support a conclusion that the bolts were corroded; or, at least, corroded to a sufficient extent as to amount to a risk to safety.
	
	
	However, the principal argument advanced on behalf of the appellants was that the duty of care which an occupier of premises owes to an entrant was not such as to require the replacement of the glass balustrade. (Formulating the case in this way is of some significance, as will appear.)
	


The findings of the primary judge


	
	The primary judge commenced his judgment by identifying three issues for his determination. They were:
	


“Issue 1 – The probable mechanism by which the glass panel gave way;

Issue 2 – Whether the plaintiff has established that the defendants had breached the duty of care they owed to him;

Issue 3 – Whether there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.”


	
	He proceeded to make general credibility findings in respect of each of the witnesses. He found that the respondent:
	


“… gave his evidence in a measured and considered manner. He was careful to identify the limits of his recollection on the factual matters canvassed within the evidence. He avoided speculation and he made concessions where appropriate.”

He concluded that the respondent was “a credible and reliable witness” within the limits of his recollection.


	
	He made similar favourable findings about Ms Montgomery, Mr Stobo and Ms Swift. He considered that no credit issues arose with respect to Mr Burn. He made less favourable findings about the evidence of Mr Livingstone, whose recollection as to key events he said was unreliable, and included “elements of unwarranted assumption and reconstruction, and … inaccuracies”; about the evidence of Mr Swift, who he considered had exaggerated his evidence as to the manner in which the accident occurred, had engaged in a process of reconstruction and who he held to be unreliable; and Mr Dobson, who, he noted, had been consuming alcohol for 5-6 hours prior to the accident, such as to “have had some effect on the acuteness and accuracy of his observations”, and whose account, his Honour said, “varied materially at times”, “involved reconstruction, and was in part based on assumptions”. His ultimate conclusion in relation to Mr Dobson was that he was an unreliable witness. He described as “fanciful” the descriptions of the accident given by Mr Swift and Mr Dobson, and considered that their evidence had been “tailored” to suit an argument that the structure was sound, and that a great force had been applied to it to cause it to fall. He expressed no concerns as to Mr Mesker’s credibility, but noted that his recollection of detail was “understandably limited by the passage of time” and by the loss of computer data comprising his records.
	
	
	He found (at [39]) that, before December 2002:
	


“… the supporting structure for the balcony fence had been affected by rust, which in December 2002, was visible through the paintwork on an external inspection. That rust remained unaddressed and uninhibited until 2006, when Mr Mesker carried out the removal of surface rust scale and the painting work he described.

40  Although Mr Mesker did not describe either the thickness of the rust scale that was removed in 2006, nor the residual thickness of the remaining rust-affected metal before it was chemically treated, it can be inferred from the above circumstances that at the time of the accident, the underlying metal structure was not thick, and its components were not as integral, compared to when it had been initially installed.”


	
	He then reviewed at some length the evidence of the various witnesses as to the circumstances of the accident, and to the hypothesis of Mr Burn. He stated his conclusion at [130], saying:
	


“In considering the mechanism of failure of the glass panel, on the balance of probabilities, I find that one or more of the four bolts holding the glass panel in place at its base failed due to corrosion having weakened those structures, as explained by Mr Burn in the evidence I have already cited.”


	
	This was his finding in respect of Issue 1. With respect to Issue 2, the primary judge set out s 5B of the Civil Liability Act, which is as follows:
	


“5B  General principles

(1)  A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless:

(a)  the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and

(b)  the risk was not insignificant, and

(c)  in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person’s position would have taken those precautions.

(2)  In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things):

(a)  the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,

(b)  the likely seriousness of the harm,

(c)  the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,

(d)  the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.”


	
	He said:
	


“139  In considering whether the defendants had breached the duty of care owed to the plaintiff, in the context of a consideration of s 5B(1)(b) and (c) of the CL Act, the essential questions are: whether, in the circumstances where it was foreseeable that a number of guests would be in close proximity to the balustrade, the defendants ought to have known there was a potentially dangerous defect due to corrosion in components that supported the balustrade structure; and whether, in these circumstances they failed to take reasonable steps by way of precautions, to either rectify or address that defect if they intended to allow the balcony to be used to entertain guests who would not know of such defects, or alternatively, to isolate the balcony from guest access.”


	
	The primary judge proceeded on the basis (unchallenged) that the appellants, as occupiers of the property, owed the respondent a duty of care. The relevant question was whether the appellants had failed to discharge that duty. He considered it critical ([145]) that the appellants had been advised, in 2002, to have the rust affected area treated, or the balustrade replaced. He made the following findings:
	


“146  Whilst it was understandable that at the time, the defendants baulked at the cost of replacement, such a stance necessarily required that reasonable maintenance care be taken in the form of dealing not only with surface rust, but also ensuring that the structural component parts were either not affected by rust, or if they were, that those components be properly treated or replaced so as to maintain safety.

147  This was particularly so in circumstances where it was foreseeable that the first floor balcony would be used as a guest entertaining area. If the component parts of the structure were not sound, guests leaning on the balcony balustrade could foreseeably fall to the ground below if the structure gave way.”


	
	He rejected a submission made on behalf of the appellants that they should not be held liable in negligence because they were not skilled in the building trades, they had engaged a professional painter to undertake remediation works identified in the 2002 pre-purchase inspection report, and that he had not identified any structural or safety issues. He rejected this submission on the basis of the four year delay between identification of the defects in the pre-purchase inspection report, and when the painting works were undertaken, a further four years thereafter, and because neither Mr Mesker, nor Mr Livingstone, was qualified to comment on structural matters ([148]-[150]).
	
	
	He went on to say:
	


“156  In my assessment, on a prospective consideration of the chronology of events, in 2002, and thereafter, a reasonable person in the position of the defendants would have taken precautions by taking advice and action to ensure the structural soundness of the balustrade before allowing guests to be in close proximity to that structure: s 5B(1)(c) of the CL Act: Vairy v Wyong Shire Council [2005] HCA 62; (2005) 223 CLR 442.

157  I am reinforced in that view because, from early times within the knowledge of the defendants, in 2002 and 2006, they were on notice that replacement of the structure, or proper remedial treatment of rusted components, was recommended as being necessary. Absent those precautions, it was very probable that the balustrade, or a component panel of it, might foreseeably give way because those components formed the basis of the structural integrity of the balustrade: s 5B(2)(a) of the CL Act.

158  In my view, in the context of consideration of a possible fall from a first floor balcony, the precautions referred to above were required because a person falling from that height was very likely to sustain a variety of serious injuries: s 5B(2)(b) of the CL Act.”


	
	His ultimate conclusion was:
	


“159  In those circumstances, the nature of the burden on the defendants in this case required that they take reasonable precautions to ensure that all structural components were sound, integral and safe.

160  This could have been achieved either by ensuring all components of the supporting structure likely to be subject to attack from rust were adequately treated in a way that addressed the problem of corrosion without compromising the protective purpose of the structure, or absent any inquiry by the defendants along those lines, replacement of the structure.”


	
	Importantly, in my opinion, he also noted that an alternative precautionary measure was for the appellants to entertain guests in a different area of the premises that did not pose a risk to safety by reason of the unsafe balustrade.
	
	
	His Honour then dealt with causation in a manner that has not been challenged on appeal.
	


Contributory negligence


	
	Initially the appellants pleaded contributory negligence on the basis of asserted intoxication on the part of the respondent. That assertion was abandoned, and the appellants claimed that the respondent caused or materially contributed to his own injury by reason of:
	



	
	failure to take appropriate care for his own safety;
	
	
	failure to secure a proper foothold;
	
	
	attempting to stand and walk in circumstances where he may have been unable to support himself.
	



	
	The primary judge rejected each of these, finding that the respondent had taken only one step when he experienced a momentary unsteadiness to which he responded reasonably by reaching out to steady himself on the nearby balustrade, and that it was the cramp that caused him to experience unsteadiness, that events transpired rapidly in such a way as not to sustain an assertion of contributory negligence. No ground of appeal challenges that conclusion.
	


The appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal are fully set out in the judgment Hoeben JA. It is unnecessary to repeat them.
	


Grounds 3-7


	
	Grounds 3-7 concern the fact finding exercise. By Ground 3, the appellants complain that the primary judge failed to address “the unchallenged evidence of Mrs Swift that there was only light surface rust on the post, and no evidence of staining after [Mr Mesker’s] painting”.
	
	
	The whole of Ms Swift’s evidence in this respect was as follows:
	


[In evidence in chief]

“Q.  Do you recall any staining on the paintwork?

A.  The poles were steel, not stainless steel, and they had surface rust. Alex took the rust off and rustproofed it and repainted them in a charcoal colour.”

[In cross-examination]

“Q.  Would you say he [Mr Mesker] painted the steel stanchions themselves because they had discoloured?

A.  They had surface rust on them, yeah. And I’m not sure how he did it, if he burnt it back, if he just I think rubbed it back and treated it with rustproofing. I mean, that was what he said he was doing in the quote, and he’s done work for us before, and I’ve always had faith in him doing what he said he would do.

…

Q.  It was cosmetic, what he was doing?

A.  There wasn’t rust through that it needed replacing. It was only surface rust, yeah.”


	
	There was no suggestion that Ms Swift had any expertise in the assessment of rust penetration, nor, indeed, that she had made any attempt to examine the structure for rust penetration. In counsel’s final address in the trial, no reliance was placed on this evidence. During the course of counsel’s final address, the following exchange is recorded:
	


“HIS HONOUR:  Doesn’t it depend on whether you are comfortable with the view that the appearance of rust is only cosmetic and not structural?

[COUNSEL]:  The fact is that they got a painter in to perform the task. He wasn’t concerned that there was any structural issue with respect to the paint and –

HIS HONOUR:  But is that his field of endeavour? I mean painters will paint over cracks as well, won’t they?

[COUNSEL]:  I’m sure there are varying quality of painters. But the fact of the matter is that, if you combine the combined evidence of Mr Mesker and Mr Livingstone about the state of this, the state, and I’m talking about Mr Livingstone at the time of his attendance in 2010 and his time of attendance after the event, it would be my submission that your Honour would find that these posts were structurally sound.”


	
	No mention was made in this exchange, or anywhere else, of Ms Swift’s evidence that the rust was surface rust only. As mentioned above, the written submissions made at trial were not available to this Court, but one would have expected that if they contained anything additional they would have been included in the appeal books in order to support this ground which, it should be emphasised, complains of a failure by the primary judge to address that evidence.
	
	
	In the circumstances, it was entirely appropriate for the primary judge to attribute no weight to Ms Swift’s evidence in this respect. And the only mention made of this evidence in the written submissions to this Court was in the recitation of “background facts”. It was not further mentioned in that part of the written submissions that appeared under the heading “Appealable errors”.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 3 of the appeal.
	
	
	By Ground 5 the appellants complain of the treatment of the evidence of Mr Swift and Mr Dobson. The principal complaint is that the primary judge rejected their evidence “solely on the question of credit”, and failed to assess the extent to which the evidence of each corroborated the evidence of the other.
	
	
	One specific complaint made concerning the treatment of Mr Dobson’s evidence concerned the finding of his alcohol consumption, and the inference expressly drawn that this had impaired the accuracy of his observations and recollections. It was submitted that there had been no cross-examination to the effect that he was so intoxicated as to affect his perception or memory.
	
	
	I have set out above the passage of the evidence, in cross-examination, in which this subject arose. In fact, it was Mr Dobson himself who introduced the subject. In a passage of cross-examination in which his recollection was being tested, with specific reference to the identities of the persons with whom he was sitting, Mr Dobson said:
	


“Well, you’ve got to also consider … I’d had a few drinks too …”

This can only be interpreted as an explanation for what may have been a failure of memory. When asked what he meant by “a few drinks” Mr Dobson asserted that “we were still compos mentis”. Implicit in this is a recognition that he was, to some degree, affected by alcohol, though not to an incapacitating degree. Putting these two answers together, it is not difficult to draw the inference that he was, to some extent, affected by alcohol.


	
	The assertion that the evidence of Mr Swift was rejected “solely on the question of credit” is not correct. At [83] the primary judge set out seven instances of what he called “variations within the descriptions [Mr Swift] gave”. These led him to the conclusion that Mr Swift was “not a careful witness” ([84]).
	
	
	The primary judge subjected Mr Swift’s evidence to a lengthy analysis. He undertook the same exercise with respect to Mr Dobson’s evidence.
	
	
	Once that exercise had been undertaken, examination of the extent to which the two witnesses corroborated one another would have been of little value. It is true that Mr Swift and Mr Dobson both used (similar) vivid language to describe the force with which the respondent struck the balustrade, and, in that sense, could be said to have corroborated one another. But the search for corroboration would have required focus, not only on those parts of their evidence that coincided, but also on discrepancies. Importantly in this respect, Mr Dobson was positive that the respondent had hit the glass with his shoulder; Mr Swift that it was his hip. Moreover, had such an examination been undertaken, it would have been necessary to replicate it with respect to the evidence of the respondent, Ms Montgomery, and Mr Stobo, who gave essentially similar accounts of what happened immediately before the collapse of the balustrade. Those accounts did not include assertions that the respondent struck the glass with great force.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 5 of the appeal.
	
	
	By Ground 4 the appellants complain of the primary judge’s reliance on the evidence of Mr Burn as to the mode of failure of the balustrade and its cause, and, by Ground 6, they complain that the primary judge engaged in “impermissible speculation” as to these issues.
	
	
	Criticism was made of Mr Burn’s evidence. One such criticism was that he had reached his conclusions without examination of the balcony and without knowing any relevant specifications of the bolts or the glass. Given that, by the time Mr Burn became involved, the balustrade had been entirely replaced, and given that there appears to have been no information – certainly no evidence – about the specifications of the bolts and glass, these criticisms were somewhat hollow. Mr Burn had to do the best he could with the material available to him.
	
	
	With respect to his evidence that the accident had happened by reason of failure of the bolts, it was submitted that “the balustrade could have failed for a number of reasons, including an invisible defect in the glass”. This proposition was based upon one question and answer in the cross-examination of Mr Burn. The question and answer were:
	


“Q.  You could have had an invisible defect in this glass could you not?

A.  It’s a possibility.”

I do not read this answer as a concession that a glass defect was a realistic possibility.


	
	In any event, two responses may be made to the proposition. The first answer is to put the question and answer in the context of the whole of the cross-examination. It was preceded by this question and answer:
	


“Q.  You have accepted today that it is possible that the glass may have failed. You accept that, don’t you?

A.  It’s a possibility, but I consider it unlikely.”

That was followed by further cross-examination that highlighted the dearth of concrete information available to Mr Burn; it was followed, immediately, by:

“Q.  You see, there is a range of possibilities as to how this may have failed. Do you agree?

A.  There are other ways it could have failed but, as I said, in my opinion, the most logical and apparent reason for failure would be the corrosion of the bolts holding the glass in place.”


	
	The second answer to the proposition is that, had the glass had a defect and broken, it might reasonably be expected that pieces or shards of glass would have been on the balcony floor. But there was no evidence that there was, and some evidence that there was not.
	
	
	Moreover, in his second report, Mr Burn commented that:
	


“Normally it would be expected when glass is used as a balustrade or handrail treatment the type of glass used would be substantial enough to withstand the specified loading under relevant ordinances and Australian Standards …

The normal expectation would be for the glass panel used in handrail/balustrade to be of sufficient thickness it would withstand human impact loading …”


	
	I do not consider that there was any error in the primary judge’s acceptance of Mr Burn’s evidence. He was the only witness with any expertise. True it was that, by reason of the absence of concrete facts, he was forced to engage in inferential reasoning. Experts are permitted, by reason of their expertise, to engage in a process of extrapolation from known facts: Hatziandoniou v Ruddy [2015] NSWCA 234; 72 MVR 171. That is what Mr Burn did, and it was no error by the primary judge to accept his process of reasoning. To do so is not to engage in speculation. I would reject these grounds.
	
	
	The final ground concerning the facts was Ground 7, by which the appellants complain that the primary judge erred in disregarding what was said to be the unchallenged evidence of Mr Livingstone, that on his inspection shortly after the accident, all fixed and floating flanges that would have restrained the glass panel were in place on the posts. The primary judge found to the contrary. Much of the relevant evidence is set out above, but I will, for convenience, repeat it here.
	
	
	The relevant evidence in chief was:
	


“My recollection is I had a look at the particular site where the glass was missing. I was interested to see why the accident might have happened. The posts were in good order, the brackets were in the order. All the brackets and bolts were in order. The only thing that was missing was the glass.”

In cross-examination after acknowledging that he had made no reference in his statement to seeing the bolts, Mr Livingstone gave the following evidence:

“Q.  So is it since then that, for the first time, you say you have a memory of seeing the bolts in position?

A.  That’s correct.

Q.  How did that come about? How is it that since 8 July, about a month ago, it was that it came into your mind that you’d seen the bolts?

A.  It’s a matter of the more you think about things, the more things start to come back to you.

Q.  Isn’t that a matter of reconstructing?

A.  Not when you think about reconstructing.

Q.  What, you’ve been going over it in your mind, have you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And then, what, one day it came to you that the bolts were there?

A.  It’s about why – I had a look at the structure, and to my mind everything was in place, and the question I had to ask myself, ‘Why was it in place?’ It’s because the front and back plates were there, and a bolt would have been in place to hold that in place.

Q.  A bolt would have been in place to hold that in place. Is that what you say?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You’re guessing, aren’t you?

A.  Possibly.

Q.  You could be mistaken.

A.  Could be mistaken.

HIS HONOUR:

Q.  Does that answer mean that the bolts weren’t actually visible to you at the time of the inspection?

A.  The only way that the back plate would have been held in place would have been for a bolt to be there.

Q.  But you didn’t see the bolts.

A.  I don’t specifically recall.

Q.  In your evidence earlier today you said that the bolts were – I don’t remember the exact word – either in place or unaffected. Do you recall that evidence?

A.  Yes, I do.

Q.  Was that correct?

A.  At the time of the question, yes.

Q.  Well, how do you reconcile the difference?

A.  As far as I’m concerned, those bolts were in place.

[COUNSEL]:  

Q.  But you have no memory of seeing them in place.

A.  No.”

And, in re-examination:

“Q.  Just on that issue, in answer to a question from my friend, you said words to the effect of the front and back plates were in place. Alright?

A.  Yes.

Q.  When you say that, could you just describe to his Honour what you meant by that observation.

A.  So on the post is welded a front and back plate in which a bolt would go through that plate to hold the glass in position. That front and back plate were in place and, as I thought I recalled, there was a bolt holding those – that bolt was still in place as well.”

Some of these answers suggest that Mr Livingstone engaged in the very kind of inferential reasoning in respect of which Mr Burn was criticised. But Mr Livingstone lacked the qualifications that would justify such reasoning.


	
	The characterisation of Mr Livingstone’s evidence as “unchallenged” is incorrect. His evidence was challenged, so far as it could be in the absence of firm instructions as to the existence or otherwise of the bolts post-accident, by testing his memory, and by doing that by reference to his statement, which made no reference to the bolts. In any event, the cross-examination I have extracted shows that, in fact, Mr Livingstone was quite equivocal. His evidence was not “disregarded”, as asserted in the ground of appeal; it was, quite properly, treated as equivocal.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 7 of the appeal.
	


Grounds 1, 2 and 8: duty of care


	
	Each of these grounds concerns one or other of the matters relevant to the finding of duty of care, the scope and content of the duty of care, and breach of duty.
	
	
	It is necessary to set out Ground 1 as pleaded. It is:
	


“1.  The trial judge erred in finding the scope and content of any duty of care owed by the owner of a residential property required the Defendants to:

(a)  Inferentially, have the balustrade inspected by a structural engineer; or

(b)  Required the balustrade to be dismantled and inspected.”


	
	The word “inferentially” was inserted for a reason. The reason is that the primary judge made no finding that the scope and content of the duty of care owed by the appellants to the respondent required them to have the balustrade inspected by a structural engineer, or required them to have the balustrade dismantled and inspected. Nor did the respondent advance any case to the effect.
	
	
	The fallacy was repeated in the written submissions. There it was asserted:
	


“83  His Honour found that the Appellants took an inadequate response to the rust … He found that in order to discharge the duty the balustrade needed to be dismantled and checked or that engineering opinion be obtained.”


	
	Paragraph 153 of the judgment was cited as the source of the “finding”. Paragraph 153 reads in full:
	


“153  I am satisfied that the combined effect of the defendants having obtained the pre-purchase building inspection report dated 18 December 2002, and in 2006 arranging for a painter, without structural qualifications of any kind, to attend to the identified surface rust in the manner described in the evidence of Mr Mesker, without any consideration of the state of the component parts of the supporting structures, ought to have raised in the minds of the defendants the question of whether the rust so identified had been adequately addressed from a structural and safety viewpoint.”

I have already set out [156] in which his Honour referred to the precautions that a reasonable person would have taken in the circumstances.


	
	There was no evidence and no submission (at trial) that “taking advice and action to ensure the structural soundness of the balustrade” entailed retention of a structural engineer or dismantling the balustrade, or both. Ground 1 as pleaded overstates what the primary judge found. By s 5B(2)(c) of the Civil Liability Act, the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm is one of the considerations a court is required to take into account in determining whether a reasonable person would have taken such precautions. Neither party adduced evidence to establish what would have been involved in “taking advice and action to ensure the structural soundness of the balustrade”. Reasonable common sense dictates that a building contractor or consultant or the like could have undertaken the initial examination; what action needed to be taken would, of course, depend upon what that examination revealed.
	
	
	Against that must be balanced the magnitude of the risk if, as did happen, the balcony collapsed under the weight of a person who came in contact with it. Plainly, the likely seriousness of harm that would ensue is significant. Moreover, inspection and advice was not the sole precaution on which the primary judge relied. He made it plain that an alternative was simply to refrain from making the balcony available to guests until it had been rendered safe. Again, when seen in the light of the magnitude of the harm that could ensue, such a precaution could hardly be called burdensome.
	
	
	One of the submissions on behalf of the appellant was that:
	


“There was no evidence as to the cost of the structural engineer, or the types of test or remediating action that would have been suggested and at what cost.”


	
	This is correct, but what might have been suggested can now not be known, given the total replacement of the balustrade. What Mr Burn suggested was that, had action been taken in 2002, or shortly thereafter, when the building report first signalled the problem, was that the continuing corrosion might have been arrested. What is known is that, nine years after the appellants were alerted to the existence of rust, the risk that was then identified eventuated.
	
	
	In my opinion the appellants have failed to make good any of the grounds of appeal concerning the duty of care owed by the appellants, and their breach of that duty.
	
	
	I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	In those circumstances it is unnecessary to consider the Notice of Contention filed on behalf of the respondent.
	
	
	Having regard to the conclusions of Hoeben JA, I would add the following.
	
	
	It was not, and could not have been, in issue that the appellants owed the respondent a duty of care. The key to the respondent’s case lay in the determination of what was encompassed in that duty. That is a question that could not, in this case, be answered until the cause of the balustrade collapse was determined. That having been identified as failure of rusty fittings (it scarcely matters whether it was lugs, posts, or bolts) – the questions that arose under s 5B of the Civil Liability Act were:
	



	
	what was the risk of harm?;
	
	
	was the risk foreseeable?;
	
	
	was the risk insignificant?;
	
	
	what precautions would a reasonable person in the position of the appellants have taken?
	



	
	The answer to the first question is that the risk of harm was that, if the fittings failed, a person might fall from the balcony. The second question is answered in the light of what the appellants knew. Once it was established that they had forewarning of a defect in the fittings, the risk that a person placing weight on the balcony might fall was foreseeable.
	
	
	The very purpose of a balustrade on a balcony is to prevent persons falling from the edge of the balcony. It must be in contemplation that some weight will be placed upon the balustrade and that it will be sufficiently robust to withstand that weight. Of course, it is not expected to cope with excessive pressure or weight. (At just what point pressure or weight becomes excessive need not and cannot be decided.) This is the significance of the evidence of Mr Swift and Mr Dobson concerning the manner in which the respondent struck the balustrade. If accepted, their evidence would have raised for consideration the question of what weight a balustrade might reasonably be expected to bear. Rejection of their evidence removes the need to come to a view about just what pressure would be seen as excessive. In Jones v Bartlett [2000] HCA 56; 205 CLR 166, at [176] and following, Gummow and Hayne JJ discussed (with respect to leased premises) what constitutes a dangerous defect. Their Honours drew a distinction between defects that are dangerous of themselves, and that will, or may, cause injury through normal use of the premises, and “defects” that arise from misuse.
	
	
	The risk that, with normal use of this balustrade – that is, the application of normal, not excessive, pressure – it might break, was not insignificant. Rejection of the evidence of Mr Swift and Mr Dobson meant that it was not necessary to consider what weight would have made the difference between a defect that would cause injury only through misuse, and a defect that could cause injury through normal use.
	
	
	For my part, I consider that a balustrade on a first floor balcony ought to be sufficiently robust to withstand the pressure of even a relatively heavy fall against it. It is not uncommon, after all, for a number of people to lean on a balustrade such as this.
	
	
	Moreover, given the well-known propensity of rust to progress, for as long as it was not attended to, the significance of the risk increased over time.
	
	
	What precautions a reasonable person in the position of the appellants would have taken is to be decided in the light of these considerations. That is what the primary judge did. It must be emphasised that the precautions upon which he relied did not necessarily extend to heroic engineering repairs; entertaining guests in another part of the premises was a viable alternative (although, perhaps, not so appealing to the owners of an attractive balcony).
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	


(1)  Appeal dismissed;

(2)  Appellants to pay the respondent’s costs.

		10 March 2016",2016-03-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2768952,Proud v R [2016] NSWCCA 41,"Judgment


	
	JUDGMENT of COURT delivered by BASTEN JA: On 11 April 2014 the applicant, together with a co-accused, was found guilty by a jury of the murder on 27 October 2011 of Katherine Foreman. Ms Foreman died when the bedroom in which she was sleeping was set alight. On 11 April 2014 a jury returned a verdict, finding the applicant guilty of murder. She was sentenced on 28 July 2014 to imprisonment for 20 years, with a non-parole period of 14 years.
	
	
	On 2 October 2015, some 18 months after the verdict, she sought leave to appeal from that conviction; the application and, if leave be granted, the appeal were listed for concurrent hearing today. The applicant gave notice last week that she sought to vacate the hearing of the appeal, on the basis that this Court was bound on existing authority to reject proposed ground 4, but that a similar issue was to be raised in the High Court on an application for special leave to appeal in South Australian cases, Smith v The Queen [1]  and the related matter of Presley. [2]  On 12 February 2016 that application was referred to a Full Court and has been listed for hearing in the May sittings.
	
	
	The grounds, as filed on 2 October 2015, contained no express challenge to the directions given with respect to “extended joint criminal enterprise”, although ground 2 referred to error in directing the jury “on the element of participation in the joint criminal enterprise”. On 3 March 2016, the applicant filed a further submission with respect to an additional ground 4, which alleged error in directing the jury “on extended joint criminal enterprise and the requisite mental state.”
	
	
	The submissions stated: [3] 
	


“6.   It is accepted that the … directions conformed to Australian law on … joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise as it then stood and currently stands: McAuliffe v The Queen; [4]  Gillard v The Queen; [5]  Clayton v The Queen. [6] 

…

9.   Additional Ground 4 further asserts that the correctness of his Honour’s directions as to the mental state required for extended criminal enterprise should be reconsidered in light of the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in R v Jogee (Appellant). [7]  This would necessarily involve reconsideration of the principle from McAuliffe outlined above.”


	
	For present purposes it is sufficient to note one aspect of the applicant’s offending and two aspects of the trial.
	
	
	In relation to the offending, there was evidence connecting the applicant to the plans carried out by two other persons to cause harm to the victim, but the applicant was not present, nor in the vicinity, when the attack occurred.
	
	
	In relation to the trial, the matter was left to the jury both on the basis that the applicant was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to cause physical harm to the deceased, with the shared intention that the deceased would be killed or grievously injured. That is a standard form of joint criminal enterprise. The appeal raises a ground as to whether a verdict entered on that basis would be unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence, but the availability of that basis of murder is not challenged.
	
	
	The matter was also left to the jury on the basis of an extended joint criminal enterprise, which allowed for a verdict of guilty of murder in circumstances where, although it was not the intention to cause death or grievous injury to the intended victim, the applicant foresaw the possibility that that might occur. The ground of appeal as originally formulated included a challenge to the adequacy of the directions given in this regard. However, what is now proposed is that a ground be added which challenges the established principles as to mere contemplation of conduct causing death or grievous bodily harm as a sufficient basis for a conviction of murder.
	
	
	It is this additional ground which gives rise to the request for the appeal to be adjourned, partly on the basis that such a ground has been raised with respect to an appeal in the matter of Smith v The Queen, listed for hearing in the High Court in May. Further, counsel for the applicant understand that it is proposed, on behalf of Mr Smith, to invite the High Court to reconsider the present law regarding the state of mind sufficient for a conviction of murder based on extended joint criminal enterprise, relying on the reconsideration of those principles by the United Kingdom Supreme Court in R v Jogee.
	
	
	On the assumption that the hearing in the High Court occurs by the end of the May sittings (16 May 2016) it may be expected that a judgment will be delivered in the second half of the year. To delay the appeal in this matter until after the judgment is delivered renders it probable that the current appeal would not be relisted until late 2016 or early 2017. There are two issues to be addressed in determining whether that element of delay is warranted. The first is the possibility that the applicant will succeed on other grounds, that is by application of the law as it presently stands. It is accepted by senior counsel for the applicant that this would be likely to result in a retrial: that possibility itself renders undesirable the foreshadowed delay, consequential on vacating the current hearing date.
	
	
	The other issue concerns the likelihood that the appeal in the matter of Smith will affect the outcome in the present case. On the one hand, it must be accepted that, if the High Court were to revisit the principles governing extended joint criminal enterprises and accept the approach now adopted by the UK Supreme Court, the directions to the jury with respect to that aspect of the prosecution case against the applicant would probably be found to be erroneous. However, this outcome is by no means certain and may not be probable. That is for three reasons.
	
	
	First, the application for special leave to appeal has not been determined, but has been referred to the Full Court. Special leave may yet be refused in so far as Mr Smith seeks to reopen the principles governing extended joint criminal enterprise, on the basis that his case does not provide an appropriate vehicle for such a reconsideration. That must remain a real possibility, given the facts of the case. Mr Smith was one of at least four and possibly six men who attacked the victim. One man, Betts, inflicted a fatal stab wound. Mr Smith, on the prosecution case, was a party to the assault and hit the victim with a shovel and a bottle. The relevant ground as identified by the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal, in the case there known as R v Presley, [8]  was in the following terms:
	


“Additionally, a submission was advanced which sought to echo specific grounds advanced by Miller. Those grounds were that the judge erred in leaving extended joint criminal enterprise as a basis for liability for murder in the circumstances of the case, that the judge failed to adequately direct the jury as to the distinction between murder by extended joint enterprise and manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act and, finally, that the judge failed to direct the jury that Smith could be found guilty of manslaughter by excessive self-defence, notwithstanding that the defence of self-defence may be rejected in respect of the case against Betts.”


	
	In dealing with the complaint of the co-appellant that the trial judge had left extended joint enterprise to the jury, the Court noted the argument that it was “open to the jury to conclude that Miller was part of a group who had at least agreed to cause grievous bodily harm to others.” [9]  The submissions in the response were identified in the following passage: [10] 
	


“Counsel for Miller submitted that it was redundant to leave extended joint enterprise murder because there was no possibility on the evidence that the jury would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Miller was guilty of joint enterprise murder but would be guilty of extended enterprise murder and, therefore, leaving both produced unnecessary complexity and potential confusion. However, in our view, it was open for the jury not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the agreement to which Miller and Betts were parties extended to inflicting grievous bodily harm but to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Miller contemplated the possibility that another would act with this intent.”


	
	The reason for referring to these passages is a limited one, namely to identify a possibility that Smith’s case might not provide an acceptable vehicle for reconsidering the principles established in cases such as McAuliffe.
	
	
	The best case in favour of an adjournment would be circumstances in which an applicant lacked reasonable prospects of success on an appeal other than through the High Court revisiting the principles stated in McAuliffe and other authorities, and where, in another case already before the High Court, that was likely to occur. Assuming both those circumstances were made good, the next question is whether the applicant would be prejudiced by the Court proceeding with her appeal on the law as it presently stands.
	
	
	It may be accepted that the applicant, having raised the issue, should have the benefit of any reconsideration conducted by the High Court and applicable to her circumstances. It is unlikely that Smith’s case will be determined before she has an opportunity to seek special leave to appeal, if she were otherwise unsuccessful on her appeal. She could then seek special leave so as to obtain the benefit of any result favourable to her in the judgment in Smith, or to agitate the arguments if not resolved. Although success may not follow as of course, the judgment not on any view being a nullity, [11]  such an application would have reasonable prospects of success. Alternatively, if that course were not followed, or were to be unsuccessful, and although precluded from a second appeal, [12]  she could proceed under Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).
	
	
	The applicant should in any event have leave to amend her grounds to raise a challenge to the directions with respect to the mental element of extended joint criminal enterprise. Otherwise, the application to vacate the hearing date should be refused.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

The Cold Case Justice Project identified the respondent from DNA left at five crime scenes between 1989 and 1991.

	The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour on the single ground that the sentence imposed upon the respondent was manifestly inadequate. Notice of Appeal was served upon the respondent on 19 September 2015, i.e. 16 days after he was sentenced by his Honour.
	


Factual Background


	
	The offences, the subject of the Crown’s appeal, occurred between 20 August 1989 and 16 September 1991. The victims were aged between 9 years and 17 years at the time of the offences. The respondent was aged between 19 and 21 years at that time. All of the victims were unknown to the respondent.
	


Victim RW


	
	Shortly before 10am on Sunday 20 August 1989 the victim aged nine years was walking from her home in Bankstown to another street in that suburb. She was planning to attend Sunday School. She attended the church on most Sundays and usually walked with a school friend but on this occasion was walking alone. As she walked past a derelict house, the respondent grabbed her from behind, putting his hand over her mouth to prevent her from screaming. He lifted her off the ground and carried her down the side passage of the house and into the backyard. That was the kidnapping.
	
	
	The respondent carried RW inside the house by the back door. The victim was unable to break away from him and was having trouble breathing. When they entered the house the respondent said words to the effect: “If you scream I’ll kill you.” The respondent then lay the victim, who was wearing a skirt, on the floor. The respondent lifted her skirt, pulled down her underpants and stockings. He fondled her breasts and genitals. He unzipped his pants and exposed his penis. The respondent laid down on top of the victim with his bare penis against her genitals. The respondent ejaculated.
	
	
	During the commission of the offence, the respondent penetrated the victim’s genitalia. A medical examination identified extensive redness and abrasions similar to chafing on the inner thighs. There was also redness and abrasion to the outer and inner vaginal lips. There had been some penetration of the entrance to the genital area. She was seen by a doctor who concluded that it was unlikely that there was full vaginal penetration, i.e. penetration past the hymen.
	
	
	At some stage during the commission of the offence, the respondent said words to the effect: “I know where you live”. When the offence ended the victim ran to a nearby McDonald’s restaurant and was taken to hospital.
	


Victim EW


	
	On 6 January 1990 the victim, who was then aged 12 years, and her younger brother, aged ten years, left their home in Strathfield. They rode their bikes to the end of their street to enter a bike track. As they were riding along the bike track, they saw the respondent sitting in the bushes near a stormwater canal. The respondent stood up and moved towards them as they went past him.
	
	
	When the victim and her brother reached the end of the park, they were unable to locate their friends, so they turned around and started heading home. As they approached the offender for a second time, he moved into their path, blocked the track and caused the victim and her brother to stop riding. The respondent said words to the effect: “Get off your bike, you’re coming with me. I’ve got a knife.” The victim got off her bike and was grabbed by the respondent. When the victim’s brother also got off his bike, the respondent said words to the effect: “Not you”. The respondent told the victim’s brother to go home and he rode away to get help.
	
	
	The respondent held the victim by the wrist and pulled her away from the track into the bushes. That was the kidnapping. She was still wearing her backpack and helmet. She said: “If you let me go I won’t tell anyone.”
	
	
	The respondent took the victim over a grass embankment towards an industrial building out of sight of the bike track. He produced a knife with a 10 inch blade from a sheath in his pants. He told the victim to lie down and she complied. The respondent told the victim to take her pants off and he pushed her so that she was lying on her back. He pulled down her pants and underpants. He removed her jumper from around her waist. The respondent pulled down his own pants and exposed his penis. He lay on top of the victim. The victim tried to keep her legs together but the respondent put his penis between her legs and started moving backwards and forwards. The Crown was unable to establish beyond reasonable doubt that penetration occurred.
	
	
	The respondent’s body weight was holding the victim to the ground. She was having trouble breathing. He was still holding the knife. The victim told him she would do anything or give him anything if he did not hurt her. The respondent said she should do what he said or she would get hurt. The respondent turned her over so that she was lying on her stomach, put his penis between her legs and again started moving backwards and forwards. The respondent was panting and making noises. He ejaculated onto the victim’s genitals. He ran off. The victim went home, she was crying and made an immediate complaint. She was taken to hospital and examined.
	


Victim IM


	
	On 19 March 1990 IM, aged ten years, was walking home from the Franklins Supermarket at Bankstown. As she was walking home she saw the respondent standing on Stacey Street, in front of a demolition site. As she walked past him, he grabbed her by the hand, put his hand over her mouth, and dragged her into the demolition site. That was the kidnapping. He told the victim to be quiet or he would stab her with a knife, but at no stage did she see a knife.
	
	
	The respondent walked behind the victim into the demolition site. He pushed her from behind. She was scared that he would do something bad to her if she did not comply. Eventually the respondent stopped behind some trees and bushes. He pushed the victim on to the ground, removing her underpants and pulling down his own pants so as to expose his penis. The respondent lay on top of the victim and started rubbing his penis against the her genitalia. Due to the respondent’s weight, the victim was having trouble breathing. After a few minutes he ejaculated.
	
	
	During the commission of this offence the respondent penetrated the victim’s genitalia with his penis. A medical examination revealed swelling and abrasions on the introitus, posterior fourchette and the hymen. There was a small amount of soil on the victim’s labia majora and labia minora. There was blood on the victim’s thighs and in her underpants. There was no issue that penetration had occurred.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the offence the offender said: “You had better not tell anyone or I’ll kill you with a knife.” He told the victim to stay there and then ran off.
	


Victim GG


	
	On 26 August 1990, GG, who was aged ten, left her home in Punchbowl and walked the local park to find her brother. There was a stormwater canal at the other end of the park which ran up into Punchbowl Road. The victim was standing near the stormwater canal throwing rocks when she was approached by the respondent. He grabbed her and put his hand over her mouth. He dragged her into the stormwater canal and into the concrete underpass. There was no water in the canal at the time. That was the kidnapping.
	
	
	The victim started screaming. The respondent said that if she screamed again he would kill her. He took off her tights and underpants. He opened his zipper and pulled down his pants, exposing his penis. He told the victim to put his penis in her mouth, but she refused to open her mouth. The respondent started touching the victim and put his penis in her vagina. This caused pain. The respondent kept on doing it and turned the victim over and tried to put his penis into her anus. The respondent started kissing the victim and she kept asking him to stop. The respondent ejaculated.
	
	
	At some time during the offence, the respondent hit the victim on the leg with a rock and threw the rock in the canal. The respondent ran off. As a result of the offence, the victim sustained bruising to the back of her right calf and upper arm. She had various grazes, a split lip and was bleeding. When she was medically examined, semen was detected.
	


Victim EL


	
	On 25 February 1991 the respondent kidnapped and indecently assaulted another young girl (EL) aged nine. He was arrested for that offence on 19 March 1991 and was bail refused until 17 April 1991. He was released on bail on 17 April 1991 upon conditions, including a condition that he continue treatment with Dr Lucire, psychiatrist, for such period as required by the doctor. The respondent was sentenced on 19 June 1992 for his offences against EL (see [30] below).
	


Victim RN


	
	The offences against RN were committed whilst the respondent was subject to conditional liberty. On 16 September 1991 RN was aged 17 years. She was on her way to work as a hairdressing apprentice. She was walking from her home towards Artarmon station. She was walking along a bush track through the Artarmon Reserve which was a track frequently used by commuters. When RN noticed someone walking behind her, she started to walk faster. When she heard footsteps coming closer, she could not see anyone else on the track.
	
	
	The respondent came up behind the victim and put his hands over her mouth. She tried to scream but found it hard to breathe because the respondent’s hand was pushing hard against her lips. He said: “If you don’t shut up I have a knife and I will kill you.” At no stage did the victim see a knife. The respondent pushed the victim off the track and into the bushes closer to the railway line. That was the kidnapping.
	
	
	The victim started crying. The respondent pushed her through bushes towards a wire fence. He put his hand on top of her head , pushed her down under the fence and into some bushes. He pushed her to the ground and lay on top of her with his weight holding her back against the ground. He had one hand over her mouth and another around her throat.
	
	
	The respondent unbuckled her belt. She asked him to let her go but he said: “I will when I’m finished what I want to do.” He pulled down the victim’s pants and underpants and pulled down his pants, exposing his penis. His penis was erect. He put two fingers inside her vagina, withdrew his fingers, lay down on top of her and put his penis inside her vagina. He was breathing heavily.
	
	
	After approximately one minute the respondent withdrew his penis and kissed the victim on the mouth. He then lifted her skivvy and started kissing her on her breasts on the outside of her bra. He told her to turn over. She asked him to let her go. He rolled the victim over so that she was lying on her stomach and pushed her legs underneath her so that she was in a kneeling position. He put his erect penis against her anus and started pushing, however, he was unable to penetrate her. The respondent pulled the victim so that she was again lying on her back. He again lay on top of her with his penis near her vagina. He started to masturbate himself using his hand and his penis. The victim tried to push him away. He ejaculated onto her genitalia.
	
	
	The respondent stood up and pulled the victim into a sitting position. He held her head and pulled it towards his penis, put his penis inside her mouth but she pulled her head away. The respondent then held her head so that she could not pull away and continued to move his penis backwards and forwards inside her mouth for approximately one minute. He withdrew his penis, again lay down on top of her and pushed his penis inside her vagina. He was holding her down with his hands on her shoulders. He continued to move his penis backwards and forwards in her vagina for approximately one minute. She was asking him to stop and not do it. The respondent withdrew his penis and ejaculated on the outside of her genitals. He stood up, pulled his pants up and said to the victim, “Walk the other way” and ran off.
	
	
	The victim ran for the train station and made immediate complaint. The victim sustained grazes to her neck, buttock, thighs and lower back. Semen was detected.
	


Victim EH


	
	In April 1992 the respondent committed an aggravated act of indecency on a 12 year old girl. He was arrested and was bail refused from 27 April 1992. This was EH. For this offence, and for the kidnapping and indecent assault offences against EL, the respondent was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 11 months commencing 28 April 1992 and to a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 3 months with a minimum term of 6 months. The respondent was released to parole supervision on 27 September 1993, having spent a total of 17 months in prison.
	
	
	The sentence proceedings
	
	
	Having set out the facts of the offending, Garling ADCJ reviewed the respondent’s subjective case. His Honour noted his criminal record of abduction and indecent assault and aggravated act of indecency committed against EL and EH for which the respondent had served a term of imprisonment. The respondent at the time of sentence was aged 45. The respondent was taken into custody for these offences on 18 August 2014.
	
	
	The respondent did not give evidence in the sentence hearing. Despite that, his Honour had before him a report from Dr Bruce Westmore, psychiatrist; a report from Catherine Wakely, psychologist; a report from Dr Peter Ashkar, psychologist and pre-sentence reports from 1992 and also August 2015.
	
	
	His Honour noted the conclusion of Dr Westmore that as of the date of sentencing, the respondent was suffering from multiple psychiatric conditions including substance abuse (cannabis), episodic alcohol abuse, depressive episodes, possible PTSD arising from a motor vehicle accident and chronic paranoid schizophrenia. Dr Westmore opined that the respondent was a paedophile but that the pattern of offending was unusual. Dr Westmore thought that the respondent’s prognosis was generally poor, because he suffered from a chronic unremitting treatment resistant schizophrenic illness. When Dr Westmore examined him in 1991 he was not suffering any psychotic symptoms. The respondent was diagnosed as having a psychiatric illness in the early 2000’s.
	
	
	Ms Wakely provided further information to the effect that the respondent’s functioning was complicated by many factors. She noted a history of exposure to earlier mistreatment and abuse that was repeated and severe, along with exposure to parental mental illness. Ms Wakely also noted a history of head trauma and the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Ms Wakely had concerns for his current level of functioning, his ability to participate within the courtroom setting and to give instructions.
	
	
	By reference to the report of Dr Peter Ashkar his Honour noted that the respondent demonstrated considerable variability in his intellectual and cognitive functioning. He was within normal limits in some areas and below normal in other areas. Dr Ashkar found an impairment of language skills that was consistent with brain injury. He concluded that the respondent understood the charges brought against him.
	
	
	From the pre-sentence reports, his Honour noted that the respondent appeared to have been managing his risk factors well over a long period of time, i.e. the previous 22 years. Nevertheless, his mental health issues and presentation at interviews hindered full exploration of all the factors which were present at the time of his offending. Importantly, nowhere in the reports was it asserted that his mental illness played any role in the offences, the subject of these proceedings.
	
	
	His Honour observed that the sentencing of the respondent involved the consideration of a number of sentencing principles. His Honour noted that the offences had occurred almost 22 years before at a time when the respondent was aged about 20. His Honour noted that the respondent must be sentenced as he would have been at or about the time when the offences occurred. This would affect the ratio of the non-parole period to the sentence as a whole. His Honour noted that he had to consider the respondent’s mental condition at the time of the offences, its effect on his commission of the offences and the effect of deterrence as a sentencing principle. In that regard, his Honour noted that he also had to have regard to the respondent’s present mental condition and how it would affect the way in which he served his sentence.
	
	
	His Honour gave attention to the effect of delay since the offences occurred and that the respondent had not committed any other offences during the intervening 22 years. His Honour noted that he had to have regard to the offences in 1991 – 1992 for which the respondent was convicted and for which he received prison sentences.
	
	
	His Honour considered that Dr Westmore was in a good position to assess the respondent’s state of mind, both at the time of the offending and at the present time, because he had seen the offender in October 1991 and in February 2015. Specifically his Honour noted the conclusions of Dr Westmore that at the time of the offending the respondent had a psychosexual disorder consistent with paedophilia and that there was no history that his mental illness played any role in the offending. By way of guidance, his Honour referred to Aslan v R [2014] NSWCCA 114 where Simpson J (Adams and McCallum JJ agreeing) said:
	


“33   This Court has frequently had to grapple with the effect on sentencing (especially with respect to serious or violent crimes) of mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental or emotional impairment or disability. The compassion and sympathy that such a condition engenders collides with the need for sentences to reflect the objective gravity of the offence in question, the community's interest in general deterrence, and that criminal conduct must be met with appropriate denunciation and retribution. … “


	
	Although not applicable in this case, his Honour noted that where mental illness contributed to the commission of an offence, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. His Honour observed that in such circumstances, the need to denounce the offending may be reduced so that there is a reduction in the sentence. His Honour noted that such a finding might also have the consequence that the offender was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. His Honour had regard to the fact that where mental illness is present, a custodial sentence might weigh more heavily on an offender because the serving of the sentence would be more onerous. His Honour noted that none of those principles were absolute.
	
	
	In particular his Honour noted that although the potential effect in any given case of mental disability was important, it did not follow necessarily that because an offender suffered from some mental impairment or disability, his moral culpability is reduced and that he is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, nor that the custodial sentence will weigh more heavily upon him. Each case depended on its own facts.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that because the respondent’s mental condition did not appear to contribute to the offending, there was no reason why less weight should be given to general deterrence. His Honour found that although the respondent would have some difficulty in serving his sentence, most prisoners did so and that prison authorities would be able to cope with the respondent’s particular problems. His Honour accepted that the respondent had to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment and that the sentences had to be partially accumulated, keeping in mind the requirement of totality.
	
	
	On the other side of the ledger, his Honour noted that he had to take into account that the respondent was aged about 20 at the time of the offending, that the offences occurred 22 years ago, that the respondent had not offended since then and that he entered an early plea of guilty for which he was entitled to a 25 per cent discount on sentence.
	
	
	In relation to the seriousness of the offending, his Honour said:
	


“These are extremely serious sexual offences committed against young girls over a period of two years, five separate victims, 9, 10, 12 and 17 years of age. Four victims were kidnapped and subjected to sexual intercourse and one kidnapped with intention to have sexual intercourse together with other offences. It was predatory behaviour. He set out to physically attack, with one exception, young girls, children going about their daily life, no doubt feeling safe, enjoying their youth, as all children are entitled to and he perpetrated these sexual acts on them which no doubt would, and did, terrify them, also changed their life. No longer did they feel safe, it badly affected all of them and the brother of one of the girls.

The other, a 17 year old going to work as an apprentice, no doubt starting out on an exciting new life is viciously, sexually assaulted. Whilst the term has gone out of use, she was raped by a total stranger at 8.30am in the morning. The victims were threatened, the 17 year old, “I have a knife I’ll kill you” and threatened to kill other victims and told one he knew where she lived. Each of these offences is most serious and requires its individual sentence and some accumulation as far as each victim is concerned.” (Sentence judgment 12.4)


	
	His Honour observed that delay should not affect the sentence to be imposed except where there was a different sentencing pattern at the time when the offences occurred. Although his Honour was not provided with sentencing statistics for these kinds of offences which occurred at that time, he was satisfied from his own experience that “sentences for these type of offences were lower, at a lower level than they are today”. His Honour also noted by reference to Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50 (Button J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed) that “the Court was not satisfied that sentences for rape committed against children before 1981 were shorter than sentences imposed nowadays for sexual intercourse without consent” (Sentence judgment 13.7). By reference to those matters, his Honour said:
	


“I have therefore reached these sentences by looking at the maximum penalties available then and normal sentencing principles. I also have taken into account that the offender must be sentenced in such a way that he knows and others know, others in the community know, that if they commit offences of this type they will be sentenced to terms of imprisonment and lengthy terms of imprisonment.” (Sentence judgment 13.8)


	
	Because of the way in which the parties have joined issue in the appeal, it is necessary to set out what his Honour said when recording the indicative sentences:
	


“The first series of offences commencing in August 1989 relating to RW include kidnapping, sexual intercourse with a child under 10 and Form 1 offences. They form one set of offences, part of the same act and I will make them concurrent between each other. I have to take into account the 25% discount. Those offences should carry a term of imprisonment of six years to commence on 18 August 2014.

As far as EW is concerned the offences carry a maximum penalty of 20 years and 10 years. Again there are other matters on a Form 1, after a deduction of 25% between them they should carry a penalty of five years and that sentence should commence on 18 August 2015.

The offences relating to IM carry maximum penalties of 20 years and 10 years, they are the same set of offences and should be concurrent between them and should, after a deduction of 25%, carry a penalty of five years, to commence on 18 February 2017.

The offences relating to GG carry a maximum penalty of 20 years and 10 years are part of the same set of offences and after a discount of 25% should carry a sentence of six years commencing on 18 August 2018.

The offences relating to RN carry maximum penalties of 20 years and after a discount of 25% should between them carry a sentence of seven years to commence on 18 August 2019 and conclude on 17 August 2026.” (Sentence judgment 14.1)

Crown submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that a body of statistical material did not exist to reflect the pattern of sentencing for these kinds of offences at the time when they occurred. The Crown submitted that an unusual feature of this case was the large number of victims and that the offending occurred over a relatively short period. No similar factual scenario had arisen in the reported cases in the 1980’s and early 1990’s. Nevertheless, the Crown accepted the relevance of the analysis in Magnuson which recognised that between 1983 and 1991, although sentences at the beginning of that period were lenient by today’s standards, they had moved upwards by the end of the period.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that his Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried because of the following matters:
	



	
	The sentence failed to adequately reflect the objective criminality of the offences.
	
	
	As reflected by the indicative sentences, there was a failure to recognise the different offences and the different maximum penalties applicable.
	
	
	As reflected by the indicative sentences, there was a failure to appropriately determine the seriousness of the individual kidnapping offences; with each kidnapping offence being given the same indicative sentence as the sexual offence for that victim.
	
	
	There was an error in the indicative sentence for the sexual offending upon RN for which the offending on a Form 1 was required to be taken into account.
	
	
	There was a failure to consider the aggravating feature of the respondent being on conditional liberty at the time of the offending upon RN.
	
	
	The sentence failed to adequately reflect an appropriate application of the totality principle.
	



	
	In elaboration of those matters, the Crown submitted that despite his Honour’s findings that the offending spanned some two years, that each involved a kidnapping and a physical attack on children going about their daily life and that the conduct was predatory with serious sexual offences being committed upon each victim, there was a significant disconnect between those matters and the aggregate sentence imposed. The Crown submitted that the aggregate sentence simply failed to reflect those findings and that these were extremely serious offences committed against five young girls over a period of 2 years. The Crown submitted that part of the difficulty was that his Honour did not make specific findings about the seriousness of each offence but approached the matter on a general basis, i.e. that the sexual offences were “extremely serious offences”. The Crown submitted that these generic findings, although appropriate, masked the seriousness of each group of offences committed against each of the five victims.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that except for EW the respondent had committed acts involving penetration against the four other victims. In each case there was a threat to kill and in one case, a weapon was produced. Despite those “most serious” aspects of the offending, the indicative sentences ranged between 5 and 7 years. This was despite the maximum penalties ranging between 10 and 20 years.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that except for IM there were other serious offences on a Form 1 for each of the other four victims. The Crown submitted that it was clear from the indicative sentences that little, if any, effect was given to those Form 1 offences. This was particularly so in the case of RN where apart from the offences in Sequences 14, 24 and 25 each having a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, two of the offences on the Form 1 also had maximum penalties of 20 years. The Crown submitted that an indicative sentence of 7 years could not in those circumstances be said to comply with the guidance in Attorney General’s Application under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146. The Crown submitted that this flaw was highlighted by his Honour’s treatment of IM where there were no Form 1 offences. IM was treated in the same way as the other victims with an indicative sentence of 5 years.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the offences against RN were committed while the respondent was on bail for the offences committed 7 months earlier upon EL. The Crown submitted that the offending against EL was of a similar kind to that which was perpetrated against RN, albeit not as serious. The Crown submitted that committing offences while on conditional liberty, which involved similar offending, i.e. kidnapping and sexual offending, was an important aggravating feature which has always been treated seriously by the courts (s 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435; 48 NSWLR 327 at [48]). The Crown submitted that because his Honour did not refer to this factor, it should be inferred that his Honour failed to take it into account.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that apart from characterising each of the offences as “most serious”, no further determination or separate analysis of the seriousness of the individual offences was undertaken. The Crown submitted that the assessment of objective seriousness is and has always been a critical component of the sentencing process (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357). The Crown submitted that without such assessment, it was not possible to reliably impose a sentence that was reasonably proportionate to the criminality of the offending: (Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that in addition to the sexual offending, there was a kidnapping count involving each of the victims with the same maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. For each victim his Honour indicated the same sentence for the kidnapping counts as indicated for the sexual offences. The kidnapping entailed the victims being grabbed and taken to another location, i.e. an abandoned house (RW), over a grass embankment (EW), a demolition site (IM), a water canal (GG) and off a bush track (RN). The Crown noted that there was no issue that the kidnapping offences involved more than the detention required to commit the sexual offences. The Crown submitted that the reasoning behind the indicative sentences for the kidnap offences was flawed in that no allowance was made for the additional criminality involved in them.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that each of the offences involved the forced taking of a child. The first four victims were aged 9, 12 and two were aged 10. The final victim was still a child, although older at age 17. The Crown submitted that the age of the children was a relevant factor as the younger the child, the greater the vulnerability. The Crown submitted that by imposing the same penalty for the kidnapping count to mirror the sentence for the sexual offences, his Honour failed to appropriately assess the relative seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	In relation to totality, the Crown submitted that a fundamental question to be asked was whether the criminality of the one offence could encompass the criminality of the other offences. If not, the sentence should be at least partially cumulative otherwise there was a risk that the total sentence would fail to reflect the total criminality of the offending. This was so regardless of whether the offences could be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality (Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]).
	
	
	The Crown noted that because his Honour had set out the commencement date for each indicative sentence, it was possible to analyse the structure of those indicative sentences:
	


RW indicative sentence of 6 years to commence on 18 August 2014.

EW indicative sentence of 5 years to commence 18 August 2015 (accumulated by 1 year but subsumed).

IM indicative sentence of 5 years to commence 18 February 2017 (accumulated by 1 year and 6 months).

GG indicative sentence of 6 years to commence 18 August 2018 (accumulated by 1 year and 6 months).

RN indicative sentence of 7 years to commence 18 August 2019 (accumulated by 1 year).


	
	It should be noted that the authorities are clear that when an aggregate sentence is imposed, not only is specification of commencement dates unnecessary, it ought not be done: Truong v R [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [231]; Behman v R [2014] NSWCCA 239 at [26]; AB v R [2015] NSWCCA 31 at [10]; Cullen v R [2014] NSWCCA 162 at [26]. R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17] does, however, allow consideration of indicative sentences as a mode of assessing whether they are consistent with the aggregate sentence. Here, both the Crown and the respondent have based much of their submissions on the indicative sentences and their commencement dates. It is for that reason that I have taken into account those matters.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that although there was some accumulation of the indicative sentences, its modest extent failed to appropriately reflect the serious criminal conduct included in the numerous individual offences. This needed to be reflected in the aggregate sentence. The Crown submitted that the proposed accumulation failed to partially accumulate the sentences for each victim as his Honour intended in that there was no meaningful sentence imposed for the offences upon EW. The indicative sentences for both the kidnapping and sexual offending committed against EW were subsumed within the indicative sentence for RW. The Crown submitted that because the criminality of each of the offences was distinct, in that they each involved separate victims, separate punishment was warranted in respect of each offence. The Crown submitted that the aggregate sentence, taken with the indicative sentences, failed to encompass that the offences involved separate components with each victim being not only sexually assaulted but also kidnapped. The Crown submitted that the seriousness of the respondent’s conduct called for a greater degree of accumulation between the individual indicative sentences resulting in a larger aggregate sentence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that although determinations on totality are discretionary, such determinations must be in accordance with principle. Here, his Honour intentionally made all offences against a victim identical and concurrent. This failed to take into account that the criminality of the kidnapping entailed different offending to that of the sexual offences. The Crown submitted that the nature of the error was clear when the indicative sentences for the offences upon RN are examined. RN was the only victim to have more than one sexual offence for sentence. The second of the two sexual offences had considerable criminality reflected on the attached Form 1. The Crown submitted that in the case of RN, not only did his Honour’s approach to the individual sentences reflect error, but the making of all three offences concurrent exacerbated that error.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the aggregate sentence did not account for the harm occasioned to each of the victims. This was despite his Honour’s finding that the offending undoubtedly terrified the victims and changed their lives as “no longer did they feel safe, it badly affected all of them and a brother of one of the girls”. The aggregate sentence did not reflect his Honour’s finding that he was sentencing upon “extremely serious” and “most serious” offences committed over two years upon five separate victims. Taking all these matters together, the Crown submitted that the aggregate sentence was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	By way of response to the respondent’s submissions, the Crown submitted that too much weight should not be given to the fact that the respondent had not engaged in offending behaviour since 1992. In making that submission, the Crown relied upon the opinion of Dr Westmore who had diagnosed the respondent as suffering from paedophilia at the time of the offending. Dr Westmore said that it was most unusual with paedophilia to have a level of offending such as occurred here and then no further offending. Dr Westmore was unable to explain the absence of offending since 1992.
	
	
	On the basis of that evidence, the Crown submitted that this was not a case where there was clear evidence of rehabilitation with the passage of time. The Crown submitted that what has occurred here was quite inexplicable and that it is by no means clear that re-offending would not occur. In support of that proposition, the Crown relied upon the disordered thinking of the respondent revealed in his antipathy to certain racial groups while in prison and the difficulty experienced by psychologists in ascertaining the current risk which the respondent presented to the community.
	


Respondent’s submissions


	
	Not surprisingly, the respondent reviewed in detail prominent features of his subjective case. These included his current condition of treatment resistant schizophrenia, a brain injury when he was aged 7 as a result of a car accident, low intelligence albeit somewhat variable when tested and a dysfunctional early family life with a violent father who subjected the respondent and his mother to mental and physical abuse. The respondent noted that when imprisoned in 1992 – 1993 he had self-harmed and had a strong suicidal ideation. He was emotionally immature with low self-esteem. In 1991 – 1993 Corrective Service records show him to be depressed and withdrawn. Before his arrest for these offences, he had been living independently in Housing Commission accommodation at Riverwood for about 5 years. In 2014 Ms Wakely reported:
	


“Mr Crowe’s disclosed social network is non-existent, apart from his close relationship he shares with his mother and sister. He reported that he “does not like anyone around him apart from his mother and sister”.”


	
	The respondent referred to the history recorded by Dr Westmore that he no longer had any recollection of having committed these offences and Dr Westmore’s conclusion that:
	


“Understanding why he committed a series of sexual offences as a young adult is probably impossible now because of all the events which have subsequently occurred in his life, his generally below average intelligence and his poor historical ability.” (Dr Westmore – p7)


	
	The respondent referred to Dr Westmore’s conclusion that at the time of the offending, he had a serious sexual disorder consistent with paedophilia and that the offences probably arose as a result of psychosexual difficulties he was experiencing at the time.
	
	
	In relation to rehabilitation, the respondent acknowledged that the STATIC-99 test had assessed him as being at a medium to high risk of re-offending. By way of balance, he relied upon the following opinion of Dr Westmore:
	


“The offending behaviour which I have identified as being of a paedophilic type is certainly unusual in that it appears to have been a cluster of offences committed during a relatively short period of time in his life and not subsequently repeated or carried on throughout his life. That history is in my view unusual …

If I assume that he has not acted in a sexually violent way since the cluster of offences occurring some years ago, then that might suggest that his risks of re-offending are at the lower end of the spectrum. There are always obvious difficulties in predicting risk in both violent and sexual offences, the offences have not been identified to have occurred in the context of his mental illness and probably arose as a result of psychosexual difficulties he was experiencing at the time and other emotional and personality problems which were impacting upon as well.” (Report p8)


	
	By reference to totality, the respondent submitted that the Court should not become engaged in a dissection of how the sentencing judge dealt with concurrency and accumulation in the indicative sentences. He accepted that the criminality of none of the offences against one victim could be encompassed in the criminality of the offences committed against any other victim. He submitted that this error had not occurred. The staggering of the commencement date for the indicative sentences made that clear.
	
	
	In relation to the indicative sentences proposed in relation to each victim, the respondent submitted that it would have been wrong and oppressive to have increased the sentences for the sexual assault offences because of the kidnapping offences. He submitted that the detention in these cases was no longer than necessary to commit the sexual offence. They were not detentions in the order of hours or days with conduct towards the victim additional to that occurring for the commission of the sexual offences. The respondent submitted that none of the kidnapping charges needed to be laid against him in order to reflect the whole of the criminality engaged in. He submitted that had he been charged only with the sexual assault offences, they would have included the criminality arising from the kidnap offences. This is because an important aspect of the sexual assault offences was that they were predatory and that he had exploited the vulnerability of girls at semi-secluded locations in the suburbs of Sydney where he was able to grab them and quickly be out of sight. In those circumstances, it was open to his Honour to make the sentences for the sexual assault offences and the kidnap offences wholly concurrent.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that far from failing to address the objective seriousness of the offending, his Honour had analysed each offence in considerable detail and was clearly fully aware of that aspect. He noted that no objection had been taken by the Crown to his Honour’s assessment that these were “most serious” offences.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that when one had regard to the 25 per cent discount which was to be applied to the indicative sentences, it was by no means clear that they were inadequate. In particular when one carried out that exercise in relation to the offences against IM and GG, it was clear by reference to the maximum penalty for those offences, that the indicative sentences were, if anything, high.
	
	
	By reference to RN, the respondent noted that the starting point for that indicative sentence was 9 years and 4 months. He submitted that although the circumstance of aggravation was the threatening of the victim with a knife, no knife was actually produced. He submitted that the time over which these offences were committed was not specified but it could be inferred that they occurred over a matter of minutes. By reference to these matters and his subsequent lack of offending for over 20 years, the respondent submitted that his offending was significantly less than that in R v AEM (Snr); KEM; MM [2002] NSWCCA 58. In R v AEM the sentence imposed was less than the indicative sentence in his case. He noted that in R v AEM the offences were very grave, committed against two different victims who were deprived of their liberty for many hours and subjected to horrific degradation and fear. He submitted that R v AEM, where a range of cases was reviewed by the court, made it clear that an indicative sentence of 7 years for the offending against RN was unremarkable.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the Crown’s challenge to the lack of accumulation in relation to the offences against each victim in reality involved double counting. On one approach the kidnapping offence could encompass the sexual assault offending. Alternatively, the sexual assault offending could encompass the kidnapping offence (Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610). The respondent submitted that in the majority of cases of sexual assault, there was the deprivation of a victim’s liberty and that deprivation of liberty can be far longer than the time to complete the sexual offence. In that regard, the respondent referred to Davis v R [2006] NSWCCA 392 at [56] where Howie J made it clear that it is the interference with the liberty of the person that is the conduct at the heart of the modern day concept of kidnapping. The respondent submitted that because these offences occurred before the decision in Pearce, it was appropriate for his Honour to address the issues of concurrency or accumulation in accordance with the practice at the time, i.e. that the sentences imposed for the sexual assault and kidnapping offences, should be concurrent.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that it was clear from his Honour’s description of the sexual assault offending in respect of each victim (in particular RN at sentence judgment 12.8) that his Honour was taking into account how these victims were detained as part of the sexual offences. The respondent submitted that it was entirely appropriate for his Honour to do so. There was no requirement to segregate in some way the sexual assault offending from the circumstances in which it occurred, i.e. taking the victims from a public street or park etc.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that what the Court should not do is to go into the detail of the indicative sentences, but focus upon the aggregate sentence since the issue before the Court is whether that sentence was plainly unjust or not. The respondent submitted that the aggregate sentence was plainly not unjust. He submitted that it was clear that his Honour had allowed for a substantial degree of accumulation when formulating that sentence. This was not a case where the indicative sentences were in a minor way accumulated with one another. The respondent submitted that when one looked at the head sentence of 12 years it was greater than if two of the indicative sentences had been entirely accumulated. He submitted that the aggregate sentence was longer than any of the individual sentences which showed that they all had a role to play in producing the final sentence and that his Honour regarded that as appropriate for the totality of the criminality involved in the offending.
	


Consideration


	
	A claim of manifest inadequacy requires the Crown to establish that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust in a sentencing environment where there is no single “correct” sentence and judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach (Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25], Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [58]).
	
	
	Uniformity of sentencing is a matter of great importance in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice. Inadequate sentences give rise to a sense of injustice, not only in those who are the victims of the crimes in question, but also in the general public and are likely to undermine public confidence in the ability of the courts to play their part in deterring the commission of crimes. To permit the Crown as well as convicted persons to appeal against sentences assists in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice: Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 306 per McHugh J.
	
	
	The primary purpose of a Crown appeal against sentence is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons. In the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Court retains a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence, even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1]. The Crown must negate any reason why the residual discretion of this Court not to interfere should be exercised: CMB v Attorney-General (NSW) [2015] HCA 9 at [36]; 89 ALJR at 407.
	
	
	However, it was observed in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [42] that cases might arise where the Court concludes that the inadequacy of the sentence appealed from is so marked that it amounts to “an affront to the administration of justice” which risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system. In such a case, the Court is justified in interfering with the sentence.
	
	
	Those principles need to be kept clearly in mind when considering the issues raised in this case.
	
	
	His Honour was fully aware of the historical nature of the offending and of the need to consider sentencing patterns, if such were available. In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 Simpson J in a passage which was approved by the plurality in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen said:
	


“303   A history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. Such a history does not establish that that range is the correct range, nor that either the upper or the lower limit is the correct upper and lower limit. Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts.

304   But it would be a mistake to regard an established range as fixing the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence. To take that attitude would be, de facto, to substitute judicial selection of sentences in individual cases for the boundaries of sentencing for a particular offence laid down by Parliament. In this case, that range is from 0 to 25 years. Of course, it is well established that the maximum sentence is reserved for the most serious cases. It is equally well established that it would be an extraordinary proposition that a person convicted of an offence of importing prohibited drugs would escape any custodial penalty. The point I am making is that the ranges of sentences actually imposed, while illuminating, are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence. But it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that “unifying principles” may be discerned: Wong and Leung, at [59].”


	
	Observations to similar effect were made by Garling J (with whom Basten JA and R A Hulme J agreed) in MPB v R [2013] NSWCCA 213 where his Honour said:
	


“83   In some circumstances, it will be possible for the relevant sentencing pattern to be capable of being readily discerned. As cases such as Shore, Featherstone v R [2008] NSWCCA 71; 183 A Crim R 540, PWB v R [2011] NSWCCA 84; 216 A Crim R 365, and Magnuson show, a comprehensive identification of similar cases, or else references to readily available statistical databases may assist in establishing earlier sentencing patterns. But, as experience shows, such sources need to be considered with some care because of inherent difficulties with them. For example, are the cited cases truly representative of those decided over the period, or else how is it that the statistical tables or analyses provided take into account, and identify, the wide variations in objective criminality and subjective circumstances. Statistical tables of sentencing outcomes are always to be treated with care.

…

87   The guide which is entirely objective and is easily ascertainable, and therefore which is likely to be of most use to a sentencing court, when attempting to impose sentences which accord with an earlier practice or pattern, is the maximum penalty fixed by the law for the offence charged, together with the range of criminality encompassed by the offence charged. By having regard to these features, a sentencing judge will be able to readily assess where the particular offence charged falls along the spectrum of conduct encapsulated in the offence, and accordingly how the particular offence ought be viewed against the maximum penalty fixed by the legislation.”


	
	There is no issue in this case that although the offences against the first victim (RW) – 20 August 1989 – were committed before the commencement of the Sentencing Act 1989 which commenced on 25 September 1989, all the offences would have been sentenced under that Act if there had been no delay because of its retrospective provisions. No historic pattern of sentencing was advanced before his Honour. There was reference to an increase in maximum penalties for some offences and that there had been an increase in sentences up to the present. His Honour accepted that historically sentences for most of these types of offences were lower.
	
	
	As the parties have appreciated, the sentencing exercise which confronted his Honour was a difficult one. The offending was objectively very serious, involving five victims, all of whom were young and four of whom were very young. Regrettably, all were of an age such that the effects of the offending will be felt by them for the rest of their lives. Balanced against that is the unusual subjective case of the respondent. He had at the time a number of mental deficits comprising frontal lobe damage and depression. He came from a dysfunctional background with an abusive father. There is, however, no evidence that those matters contributed to the offending. On the contrary, the evidence is to the effect that they did not.
	
	
	Somewhat remarkably, as set out by Dr Westmore, apart from this sequence of offending over a period of two and a half years (if one includes the offending against EL and EH) no further offences appear to have been committed for a period in excess of 20 years. Generally speaking, the psychiatrists and psychologists who have examined the respondent are unable to explain this unusual feature other than by reference to his increasingly isolated lifestyle and the significant worsening of his mental condition.
	
	
	It is that latter consideration which adds a further element to the respondent’s subjective case. There is no issue that the respondent’s mental condition has significantly deteriorated over the years and he now suffers from treatment resistant schizophrenia. He says that he cannot remember committing any of the offences.
	
	
	The question of his rehabilitation and possible danger to the community is largely equivocal. On the positive side, there is the uncontradicted fact that he does not appear to have offended for over 20 years. On the negative side, that lack of offending is unexplained by medical experts. Psychological testing has identified him as a risk and while in custody he has reported delusional beliefs with a bias against Asians and Arabs.
	
	
	As was made clear in such cases as Magnuson v R, R v AEM (Snr); KEM; MM and MPB v R sentences imposed for these kinds of offences were less than those imposed now, although in the case of offences against children the difference was not great. That was a matter to which his Honour referred to and it is a matter of which this Court is fully aware and has taken into account.
	
	
	Despite the care which his Honour took in relation to this matter, I have concluded that the aggregate sentence is manifestly inadequate and that the explanation for that can be seen in the matters relied upon by the Crown.
	
	
	There is considerable force in the Crown submission that by focusing on the respondent’s offending in a general way, his Honour failed to fully appreciate individual aspects of the offending against each victim. This is particularly so in the case of RW and RN. To the extent that the indicative sentences reveal his Honour’s reasoning, his Honour failed to give adequate weight to the Form 1 offences in those cases and the significantly more serious offending against RN and the maximum sentences to which that offending was subject. It is also clear that his Honour failed to have regard to the aggravating feature of the offending against RN in that the respondent was on bail.
	
	
	Although RN was older than the other victims, she was exposed to a more serious and aggressive level of offending which appeared to take place over a longer period. It is difficult to see how in accordance with sentencing principles, a protracted episode of offending could be properly regarded as producing fully concurrent sentences. The indicative sentences in relation to the offences against RN strongly suggest that his Honour did not fully appreciate the level of criminality involved.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence failed to reflect the seriousness of the respondent's offences against five separate victims: R v Brown at [50]. It is important that sentences passed for child sex offences recognise the harm done to the victims of the crime: R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56; 239 A Crim R 469 at [87]; R v Gommerson [2014] NSWCCA 159 at [98], [102]; s 3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Although these offences were committed many years ago, ss 3A and 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applied to the sentencing of the respondent: clause 45(2), Schedule 2, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	It was necessary for the notional level of accumulation involved in setting the aggregate sentence to give proper regard to the fact that there were five separate young victims of the respondent's predatory attacks upon girls who were strangers to him. It is important that there be punishment that is referrable in a real sense to each of the five victims of the respondent's serious and separate criminal conduct: Doyle v R; R v Doyle [2014] NSWCCA 4 at [459]-[461]; R v Gommerson at [100]-[102]. The aggregate sentence in this case clearly did not meet this requirement.
	
	
	In relation to all of the victims, but particularly RW and RN, there is a difficulty in the lack of accumulation between the kidnapping counts and the sexual assault counts. As was conceded, albeit in a qualified form by counsel for the respondent on the appeal, there was additional criminality in the kidnapping which was not encompassed by the sexual assault charges. Each victim was grabbed in a public street and taken to a secluded location apparently selected in advance by the respondent. Regardless of the intention of the respondent, the effect on the victims would have been one of terror. While the level of accumulation in those circumstances would not have been particularly great, there was a requirement for some.
	
	
	It follows therefore that the aggregate sentence for those reasons was manifestly inadequate and constituted an “affront to the administration of justice”.
	
	
	That does not end the matter. There remains the question of whether the Court, despite that finding, should in the exercise of the residual discretion refrain from interfering with the sentence.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the Court should not re-sentence because any adjustment to the aggregate sentence was likely to be so modest as to not justify the Court’s intervention. Additionally, the respondent submitted that it was clear from his affidavit and that of Ms Hill that the level of hardship being experienced by the respondent while in custody is significant. He has already been attacked on one occasion by a fellow prisoner and there have been occasions of self-harm. Because of the nature of his offences, the respondent has been classified as PRLA (Protected Limited Association Areas) which self-evidently restricts his activities while in custody.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that despite the respondent’s mental illness, general deterrence and denunciation of the offending still had an important role to play so that an increased sentence would not only have a deterrent effect on putative offenders, but would also accord with community expectations as to appropriate sentences. The Crown also referred to the importance of public confidence in the administration of justice being maintained by the imposition of appropriate sentences for serious offending such as this.
	
	
	While it is clear that the respondent is experiencing hardship in custody because of his classification, it needs to be kept in mind that his lifestyle before going into custody was already substantially isolated and his only real personal contact was with his mother and sister. Although there is some evidence of self-harm in the form of cuts to his right arm, that is nothing like the problems he experienced when he was originally incarcerated in 1992 – 1993.
	
	
	As already stated, an important purpose of a Crown appeal against sentence is to lay down principles for the guidance of courts having a duty of sentencing convicted persons. In this case, given the seriousness of the offending, the inadequacy of the aggregate sentence appealed from is such that it amounts to “an affront to the administration of justice” which needs to be remedied. Not to do so runs the risk of undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system. The additional evidence filed in this Court has been taken into account for the purpose of resentencing.
	
	
	It follows that the Crown has persuaded me that the residual discretion should not be exercised and that the respondent should be re-sentenced. In doing so, it is not necessary to set out new indicative sentences or to adjust those proposed by his Honour. It is sufficient to say that of themselves the indicative sentences are adequate but there needed to be in the case of each victim, in particular RW and RN, some level of accumulation of the indicative sentences.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	The Crown appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence imposed by Garling ADCJ on 3 September 2015 is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment which consists of a non-parole period of 10 years, with a balance of term of 5 years, commencing 18 August 2014. The respondent will be eligible for release to parole on 17 August 2024. The balance of term will expire on 17 August 2029.

	DAVIES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2768964,Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant, Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd (the appellant), operated and controlled an underground longwall coal mine. It was convicted under s 8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) (the Act) of a charge that it failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employee, Mr Steven McNab, who was found at the appellant’s mine crushed beneath a moving roof support.

Longwall mining is a form of underground mining where a block of coal is mined in shears. The operation is designed to remove essentially all the coal from the block and allow to roof to collapse into the cavity behind, whilst maintaining a safe working space for miners along the coalface. The roof between the cavity and the coalface needs to be supported for a period of time. Roof supports, which slowly advance towards the face, supply this pressure to control the roof fall. Coal is cut by a machine called a shearer, operated by two miners at any one time. As the shearer removes coal, the roof supports move into the newly created cavity. At the appellant’s mine, this movement was automated; if the shearer stopped, the roof supports continued to advance until there was a predefined distance between the last advanced support and the shearer. The roof supports could be stopped manually at any time by the operation of roof support controls or activation of an emergency switch.

On 23 April 2010, Mr McNab was one of the shearer operators. He was operating from a standing or walking position behind the shearer, in front of the last advanced roof support. At one point, a co-worker noticed Mr McNab on the ground and caused the shearer to be stopped. Mr McNab was found with his upper body lying on the roof support and his lower body trapped under the base of the roof support.

The appellant was convicted in the District Court on the basis that it failed to employ a Support Advance Controller (SAC) to monitor the advancing roof supports and observe the operator, so that if the operator became incapacitated, the SAC could activate the emergency stop button. The relevant risk to Mr McNab’s health, welfare and safety was the risk of being crushed, when incapacitated, by the powered roof supports as they automatically advanced towards the coalface. The trial judge imposed a penalty of $50 000 and awarded the prosecutor 20% of her costs. The appellant appealed against conviction and the Attorney General and prosecutor appealed against the penalty and costs orders.

The Attorney General and prosecutor also challenged the trial judge’s finding that the appellant’s failure to ensure that tilt switches were installed, which would detect if an operator fell over, was not found to amount to a contravention of s 8(1) of the Act.

The issues on appeal were:

1. Whether the appellant’s failure to take steps that would only minimise or manage the risk, as opposed to eliminating the risk, could constitute a breach of duty under s 8(1) of the Act.

2. Whether the omitted measure would have ensured the employee’s health, welfare and safety when the risk already existed at the point of the employee becoming incapacitated.

Conviction Appeal

Whether particularised measure must eliminate risk

(i) A failure to take steps which are necessary but insufficient to ensure safety, or which limit the risk to the employee without entirely eliminating it, can constitute a breach of s 8(1) of the Act: [108]-[113] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

(ii) While there is no doubt the duty of an employer under s 8(1) of the Act is absolute, the relevant question when assessing the effect of a particularised measure is what can constitute breach: [106]-[107], [116] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

Whether employee exposed to risk before intervention of SAC

(i) The duty under s 8(1) of the Act can be breached by the failure to take action to prevent a risk, to which an employee is already exposed, from crystallising: [124]-[125] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531; Thiess Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 252; 78 NSWLR 94 considered

Causal Nexus

(i) In determining causation under s 8(1) of the Act, the relevant question is whether the particularised omission was a substantial and significant cause of the risk to the employee. The inquiry is not concerned with whether the omission was the cause of the injury but rather whether there was a causal relationship between the omission and the risk: [130] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

Simpson Design and Associates Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of NSW [2011] NSWCA 316 applied

(ii) The question of causation is to be determined by the application of common sense to the facts in question, appreciating that the purpose of the inquiry is to attribute legal responsibility in a criminal matter and in light of the purpose to which the question is directed and the objects of the Act: [128]-[129] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

Power of appellate court in an appeal under s 5AA Criminal Appeal Act

(i) Obiter: It is doubtful that an appellate court can dismiss an appeal under s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act where guilt is found on a separate basis, which was expressly rejected by the trial judge, particularly if it involves making contrary findings of fact: [100]-[102] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

(ii) Obiter: The power to order a new trial cannot be found as a matter of implication in s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act: [103]-[104] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

Gilmour v Environment Protection Authority [2002] NSWCCA 399 distinguished

Penalty Appeal

Objective Seriousness

(i) The trial judge did not fail to have regard to the fact that the risk was known to the appellant. However, the trial judge’s failure to consider in sentencing his own contrary findings on liability show that he failed to have regard to relevant considerations: [160], [162]-[164] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

R v KB; R v JL; R v RJB [2011] NSWCCA 190 applied

(ii) The trial judge did not fail to have regard to matters that were necessarily considered in finding a conviction: [161] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

Quantum of Fine and Extent of Injury

(i) The trial judge did not hold that the penalty must be commensurate with the degree of the employee’s suffering. The extent of harm was a relevant matter in assessing objective seriousness and was properly referred to when considering whether a discharge under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) was appropriate: [170]-[171] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

Specific and General Deterrence

(i) The trial judge was bound to follow the principle that both aspects of deterrence are matters which should normally be given weight of some substance in the sentencing process unless there is indication of circumstances which have led to an exceptional course being adopted: [177]-[180] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

(ii) A court may disregard the element of specific deterrence if satisfied that the risk of re-offending is low or non-existent: [182] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

Capral Aluminium Ltd v WorkCover Authority of NSW [2000] NSWIRComm 71; 49 NSWLR 610 applied

Remorse

(i) Offering rehabilitation and reparation, while commendable, does not constitute remorse for the purposes of s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). For remorse to be shown, the offender must accept responsibility for its actions: [190]-[191] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

Whether Court should resentence 

(i) The residual discretion should not be exercised in a situation where this was one of the first appeals from the District Court under the Act and there was a need to express approval of Industrial Commission authority on sentencing: [201] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

Costs Appeal

(i) The trial judge erred in taking into account the prosecutor’s costs of preparing the case for particulars that did not go to trial where those particulars were abandoned well before trial and it was unlikely costs were referable to that preparation: [222] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

(ii) The trial judge erred in the assessment of costs by failing to take into account the sentence proceedings, in particular, the appellant’s unsuccessful submissions: [223] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

(iii) The trial judge erred in apportioning costs on the basis that the prosecutor succeeded on only one of five particularised omissions: [224] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

(v) The trial judge erred in taking into account the fact that whether the particularised measure was reasonably practicable was never a live issue when in fact it was contested by the appellant and was relevant to the key issue at trial: [226]-[227] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

(vi) The 20% apportionment figure was reached either by the erroneous methods identified or by matters not identified, in either case, error was established: [228]-[229] (Bathurst CJ, Hidden and Davies JJ).

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: This is an appeal from a decision of Curtis DCJ (the trial judge) convicting the appellant, Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd (the appellant), of a charge that it failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employee, Mr Steven McNab, in contravention of s 8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) (the Act): Inspector Nash v Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd [2014] NSWDC 186 (Trial Judgment). The trial judge imposed a penalty of $50,000 in respect of the offence.
	
	
	The appellant has appealed against its conviction, whilst the Attorney General has appealed under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (Criminal Appeal Act) against the sentence imposed by the trial judge. In addition, the Attorney General has appealed, and the prosecutor has sought leave to appeal, against the order for costs made by the trial judge.
	


The factual background


	
	The incident which gave rise to the charge in question occurred in the evening of 23 April 2010 at an underground longwall coal mine, the Beltana Mine, operated and controlled by the appellant (the mine), when an employee of the appellant, Mr Steven McNab, was crushed under the pontoon of a moving roof support.
	
	
	In the Court below, the parties agreed on a statement of facts which described the mining operations and the circumstances in which the injury to Mr McNab appeared to have occurred. The summary below is based on the agreed statement of facts and findings made by the trial judge, which were not disputed on appeal.
	
	
	Coal was mined at the mine by a method known as the “retreat longwall method of extraction” (longwall mining). Longwall mining is a form of underground mining where a block of coal is mined in shears. A longwall block (the coal that is being mined) is typically 3-4 kilometres long, 250-400 metres wide and 1.6-5 metres high.
	
	
	The area of the block being mined is known as the longwall face. A typical longwall face at the mine was about 264 metres wide and between 2.8-3.2 metres high. The blocks are developed and mined sequentially. The production area of the block being mined is called a panel.
	
	
	Longwall mining is designed to remove essentially all the coal from the block and allow the roof and overhanging rock to collapse into the void behind, whilst maintaining a safe working space along the face for the miners. The cavity behind the longwall is called the goaf.
	
	
	The underground area of the mine comprises a roof and a floor whilst the sides or walls are called ribs. The block is formed by driving maingate roadways and tailgate roadways at each side and an install roadway and recovery roadway at each end, which connects the maingate and tailgate roadways.
	
	
	The coal is cut from the coalface by a machine called a shearer, typically comprising the main body (housing the electrical functions), tractive motive units to move the shearer along the coalface and a pumping unit to power hydraulic functions.
	
	
	At the mine, a ranging arm was fitted at each end of the shearer, on which there were mounted cutting drums fitted with cutting tools, which were used to cut the coal. The two cutting drums were known as the maingate drum and the tailgate drum. Depending on the way the shearer was moving across the coalface, the drums were referred to as the lead drum and the trailing drum. The lead drum cut the majority of the coal whilst the tracking drum cut the remainder and loaded coal from the floor onto an armoured face conveyer (AFC). The shearer moved over the AFC by the use of a chainless haulage system. A pan line, consisting of a continuous line of articulated metal box sections, supported both the track along which the shearer ran and the AFC, which carried the coal away. Each unit of the pan line was connected to the opposite roof support by a relay bar which passed between the two pontoons of the roof support.
	
	
	The mine made use of a number of roof supports – steel canopies supported by large hydraulic jacks (chocks). The top of the roof support was called a canopy. Attached to the bottom of each leg of the roof support was a pontoon which sat on the floor of the longwall and performed the function of a base. A walkway approximately 280 millimetres above floor level was formed by the toes of the pontoon of the roof support.
	
	
	For longwall mining to be undertaken, the roof between the goaf side of the support canopy and the vertical coalface needs to be supported for a period of time, whilst the area where the mining has taken place, the goaf, needs to collapse. A risk exists that unless the roof is supported, it will fall in. The roof supports provide the support by applying pressure to control the roof fall. As the roof supports advance towards the face, the roof behind them is intended to fall, forming the goaf. The support provided allows the shearer to move along the face of the AFC.
	
	
	At the mine, the roof supports advanced in a motion called “Lower, Advance, Set” (LAS). The canopy would lower off the roof, the support being advanced by pulling itself along a relay bar which was attached to the AFC and then the canopy would rise, setting itself against the roof to take the weight off the roof. The movement of the relay bar was controlled by hydraulics.
	
	
	The shearer could be operated manually or through automation. The automation could be overridden by the shearer operators so they could manually control the operation of the cutting arms and the shearer speed. Two miners operated the shearer at any one time, one operating the maingate drum and the other the tailgate drum.
	
	
	As the shearer removed the coal, the roof supports moved into the newly created cavity and the AFC was pushed over towards the newly cut face. The relay bar moved the AFC forward, opening a gap between the lines of support and the spillplate – a set of panels connected to each other which acted as a fence between the shearer and the walkways where the operators were located.
	
	
	Whilst operating the shearer, the operators walked along the walkway, comprising the pontoon of the roof support and also the ground between the toes of the pontoon and the AFC after it had been pushed forward, as described above, which effectively widened the walkway. The operators were separated from the shearer by the spillplate.
	
	
	The advance of the roof support and the push of the AFC were automated. Generally, their movements were governed by the position of the shearer. If the shearer stopped, the roof supports would continue to advance in sequence until the last advanced support was at the beginning of a predefined number of supports from where the shearer had stopped. However, the roof supports could be stopped manually at any time by operation of the roof support controls or activation of an emergency switch.
	
	
	As the shearer moved forward from the last advanced support, an electronic device signalled the next roof support to advance so as to maintain a constant headway. Before the signal to advance was sent, the shearer would send a preliminary signal to the roof support prior to its advance. That signal triggered a buzzer and a light on the roof support to warn workers of its impending advance. These warnings continued as the support advanced slowly, taking about 10 seconds to reach its allocated position.
	
	
	On the night in question, Mr McNab and a Mr Anthony Chard were the two shearer operators. Mr McNab was operating the maingate cutting drum whilst Mr Chard was operating the tailgate drum. The maingate drum was the trailing drum on the longwall shearer whilst it was hauling towards the tailgate. Mr McNab operated the drum from a standing or walking position behind the maingate drum, in front of the last advanced support. As the trailing drum advanced towards the tailgate, Mr McNab followed. The area in which he was walking was described in the appellant’s safe work procedures as a safe standing zone, away from the cutting drum and flyrock. Flyrock, as its name implies, is rock flung over the side of the AFC onto the walkway. Large pieces, “surfboards”, would fall from the top of the AFC onto the walkway, whilst smaller pieces could travel greater distances.
	
	
	The shearer was cutting from maingate to tailgate when Mr Chard noticed a broken shear pin. Mr McNab and Mr Chard stopped the shearer to replace the pin. This was done with the assistance of a Mr Alan Collins, the person controlling the roof supports.
	
	
	After repairing the pin, Mr Chard, Mr McNab and Mr Collins returned to their respective tasks. Mr Chard started the shearer moving again. At one point Mr Collins turned around and noticed Mr McNab on the ground. He began to signal Mr Chard. Mr Chard continued to cut coal but on glancing over to look at Mr McNab he saw a lamp being waved to him and, realising something was wrong, turned off the shearer and ran towards Mr McNab.
	
	
	Mr McNab was found with his upper body lying on the roof support up against the spillplate. There was a flat piece of stone lying across his upper legs and his lower legs were trapped under the tailgate pontoon of a roof support.
	
	
	Mr McNab has been unable to describe how he came to be in that position.
	


The charge


	
	As we indicated, the charge against the appellant was that, being an employer, it failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of Mr McNab, its employee. The date of the offence was stated to be 23 April 2010.
	
	
	The particulars of the charge were as follows:
	


“The risk

1.   The risk was the risk to Steven McNab, an employee of the defendant who operated the longwall shearer (shearer) in the Mine of:

a.   being crushed by the powered roof support (chock) used in the defendant’s system of work as they automatically advanced towards the coalface; and /or

b.   slipping and/or falling in the walkway behind the shearer where the chocks were automatically advancing towards the coalface; and/or

c.   being struck by pieces of rock or coal material projected towards employees by the cutting head of the shearer; and/or

d.   being struck by pieces of rock or coal material otherwise dislodged by the operation of the shearer.

The failures of the defendant

2.   The defendant failed to ensure that there was a safe walking and standing zone for the operator of the shearer as he followed along behind the shearer as it was cutting so that the operator was in a position of safety, in that if he did fall the advancing chocks would not move onto and crush him.

3.   The defendant failed to ensure that the sequential operation of the shearer instigated roof supports was stopped in the event that the operator fell over or otherwise became disabled by:

a.   ensuring that tilt switches which detected the angle of inclination of the remote control being carried by the operator were installed and used so that if the angle of inclination of the remote tilted beyond 45° relative to the horizontal the shearer would stop operating and alert the leading drum shearer operator that there may be a danger to the other operator so that he could immediately stop the advance of the chocks.

b.   ensuring that a timeout function switch or control was installed and used on the remote control being carried by the operator so that if there was no activity detected the shearer would stop operating and alert the leading drum shearer operator that there may be a danger to the other operator so that he could immediately stop the advance of the chocks.

c.   by having another person to monitor the advancing chocks and to observe the operator so that if the operator fell over or otherwise became disabled that other person could activate the emergency stop button for the advancing chocks thus prevent the chocks from moving onto and crushing the operator.

4.   The defendant failed to ensure that the operator of the shearer was protected from being struck by pieces of rock or coal projected by the operation of the shearer by reducing the speed at which the shearer was being advanced and therefore lessen the potential for pieces of rock or coal being projected by the operation of the shearer.

Because of the defendant’s failures Steven McNab was placed at risk as to his health and safety, and he was injured when he was crushed by advancing chocks.”


	
	There are a number of matters that must be noted about these particulars. First, unlike the alleged risks, the alleged failures were not pleaded as alternatives. Indeed, even assuming particulars (2), (3) and (4) could be classified as separate breaches of the duty imposed by s 8(1)(a), it is difficult to reach the same conclusion concerning subpars (a), (b) and (c) of par (3). On one reading, what was alleged was that the appellant failed to ensure the safety of its employees by not taking all the steps referred to in par 3(a), (b) and (c) of the particulars rather than any one of them. In that context, had the appellant been able to establish that one or either of the steps referred to in those subparagraphs were not practical by reason of s 28 of the Act (see below at [33]), that would have provided a defence to the charge so far as it relied on the failures particularised in par (3).
	
	
	The trial judge found that a contravention of s 8(1) of the Act occurred through the appellant’s failure to implement the procedures set out in par 3(c) of the particulars. For the purpose of the appeal, the only relevant failures are those contained in that particular (the observer particular) and in the particular contained in par 3(a) (the tilt switch particular).
	
	
	Having regard to what we have said in par [26], on one view of the matter, the approach of the trial judge was not available because of the manner in which the case was particularised. However, the parties were content to proceed both at trial and on appeal on the basis that each of the subparagraphs of par (3) constituted a separate act or omission which could constitute a breach when the other elements of the offence were established.
	


The relevant legislation


	
	Before referring to the reasoning of the trial judge and the parties’ submissions, it is convenient to set out the relevant legislation. Subject to one matter, the legislation is as it existed at the time of the alleged offence.
	
	
	Section 3 set out the objects of the Act:
	


“3    Objects

The objects of this Act are as follows:

(a)   to secure and promote the health, safety and welfare of people at work,

(b)   to protect people at a place of work against risks to health or safety arising out of the activities of persons at work,

(c)   to promote a safe and healthy work environment for people at work that protects them from injury and illness and that is adapted to their physiological and psychological needs,

(d)   to provide for consultation and co-operation between employers and employees in achieving the objects of this Act,

(e)   to ensure that risks to health and safety at a place of work are identified, assessed and eliminated or controlled,

(f)   to develop and promote community awareness of occupational health and safety issues,

(g)   to provide a legislative framework that allows for progressively higher standards of occupational health and safety to take account of changes in technology and work practices,

(h)   to deal with the impact of particular classes or types of dangerous goods and plant at, and beyond, places of work.”


	
	Section 8 of the Act imposed the following duties on an employer:
	


“8   Duties of employers

(1)   Employees

An employer must ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all the employees of the employer.

That duty extends (without limitation) to the following:

(a)   ensuring that any premises controlled by the employer where the employees work (and the means of access to or exit from the premises) are safe and without risks to health,

(b)   ensuring that any plant or substance provided for use by the employees at work is safe and without risks to health when properly used,

(c)   ensuring that systems of work and the working environment of the employees are safe and without risks to health,

(d)   providing such information, instruction, training and supervision as may be necessary to ensure the employees’ health and safety at work,

(e)   providing adequate facilities for the welfare of the employees at work.

(2)   Others at workplace

An employer must ensure that people (other than the employees of the employer) are not exposed to risks to their health or safety arising from the conduct of the employer’s undertaking while they are at the employer’s place of work.

Note: See section 12 for the penalty for an offence against this section and other provisions of this Division. Division 4 makes ancillary provision with respect to those offences, including:

(a)   section 26 – liability of directors and managers of corporations,

(b)   section 28 – defence that compliance not reasonably practicable etc.

See also Division 2 for duty of employer to consult employees.”


	
	Section 12 provided that a contravention was an offence and prescribed penalties:
	


“12   Penalty for offence against this Division

A person who contravenes, whether by act or omission, a provision of this Division is guilty of an offence against that provision and is liable to the following maximum penalty:

(a)   in the case of a corporation (being a previous offender)—7,500 penalty units, or

(b)   in the case of a corporation (not being a previous offender)—5,000 penalty units, or

(c)   in the case of an individual (being a previous offender)—750 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both, or

(d)   in the case of an individual (not being a previous offender)—500 penalty units.

Note. Section 17 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides, at the enactment of this Act, that the value of a penalty unit is $110. Accordingly, the above maximum penalties are as follows:

(a)   in the case of a corporation (being a previous offender)—$825,000, or

(b)   in the case of a corporation (not being a previous offender)—$550,000, or

(c)   in the case of an individual (being a previous offender)—$82,500 or imprisonment for 2 years, or both, or

(d)   in the case of an individual (not being a previous offender)—$55,000.”


	
	Section 28 provided for a defence to a contravention. It was in the following terms:
	


“28   Defence

It is a defence to any proceedings against a person for an offence against a provision of this Act or the regulations if the person proves that:

(a)   it was not reasonably practicable for the person to comply with the provision, or,

(b)   the commission of the offence was due to causes over which the person had no control and against the happening of which it was impracticable for the person to make provision.”


	
	Some reference was made to s 7A which was inserted into the Act by the Occupational Health and Safety Amendment Act 2011 (NSW) (the Amending Act). The Section was in the following terms:
	


“7A   The concept of ensuring health and safety

(1)   A duty imposed on a person by this Division (or by any other provision of or made under this Act) to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, health and safety requires the person:

(a)   to eliminate risks to health and safety so far as is reasonably practicable, and

(b)   if it is not reasonably practicable to eliminate risks to health and safety, to minimise those risks so far as is reasonably practicable.

(2)   For the purposes of this Division (or of any such other provision), in determining what is (or was at a particular time) reasonably practicable in relation to ensuring health and safety, all relevant matters are to be taken into account and weighed up, including:

(a)   the likelihood of the hazard or the risk concerned occurring, and

(b)   the degree of harm that might result from the hazard or the risk, and

(c)   what the person concerned knows, or ought reasonably to know, about:

(i)   the hazard or the risk, and

(ii)   ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, and

(d)   the availability and suitability of ways to eliminate or minimise the risk, and

(e)   after assessing the extent of the risk and the available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, the cost associated with available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, including whether the cost is grossly disproportionate to the risk.”


	
	The same legislation amended s 8 of the Act by providing that the obligation in question was to ensure the health, safety and welfare of employees so far as reasonably practicable. Section 28 of the Act was repealed. The effect of these amendments was to require the prosecution to establish beyond reasonable doubt that matters alleged to be necessary to ensure the health, safety and welfare of employees were reasonably practicable, as distinct from making that proviso a defence to be established by the defendant on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	Some reliance was placed on the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001 (NSW) (the Regulation), which came into force on the date of assent to the Act.
	
	
	The relevant clauses of the Regulation were cll 4, 5, 6 and 11. They were in the following terms:
	


“4   Application of Regulation

(1)   This Regulation applies to all places of work (including all mining workplaces and coal workplaces), except as provided by this Regulation.

(2)   Chapter 5 applies to plant affecting public safety, whether or not the plant is at a place of work or for use at work.

(3), (4)   (Repealed)

Note. Part 2 of the Act imposes general obligations on employers and other persons and creates offences for breaches of those obligations. This Regulation imposes additional obligations on those persons and on others. Section 29 of the Act provides that compliance with the regulations is not in itself a defence in any proceedings for an offence against Part 2 of the Act (subject to any regulations that modify Part 2), but also provides that a relevant contravention of the regulations is admissible in evidence in any proceedings for an offence against Part 2.

This Regulation applies to all mining workplaces and coal workplaces, except where specific provisions are expressed to not apply or to apply with modifications. In accordance with section 133 of the Act, clause 358 provides that references in certain provisions of the Act to WorkCover, in connection with the application of the provisions to a mining workplace or a coal workplace, are taken to be references to the Department of Industry and Investment (then known as the Department of Primary Industries), the Director-General of that Department (called the “Department Head (Mining)” in this Regulation or certain inspectors appointed in connection with mining workplaces or coal workplaces.

5   Meaning of “control” of risks

(1)   For the purposes of this Regulation, an obligation to control a risk to health or safety (in any case in which the elimination of the risk is not reasonably practicable) is an obligation to take the following measures (in the order specified) to minimise the risk to the lowest level reasonably practicable:

(a)   firstly, substituting the hazard giving rise to the risk with a hazard that gives rise to a lesser risk,

(b)   secondly, isolating the hazard from the person put at risk,

(c)   thirdly, minimising the risk by engineering means,

(d)   fourthly, minimising the risk by administrative means (for example, by adopting safe working practices or providing appropriate training, instruction or information),

(e)   fifthly, using personal protective equipment.

(2)   A combination of the above measures is required to be taken to minimise the risk to the lowest level reasonably practicable if no single measure is sufficient for that purpose.

(3)   Any obligation in this Regulation to control a risk by taking specific risk control measures, or by taking specific risk control measures in a particular order, is in addition to the obligations referred to in subclauses (1) and (2).

Note. For an example in which the above clause applies, see clause 11 (general obligation of employers and self-employed persons to eliminate risks or, if not reasonably practicable to do so, to control the risk).

6   Application of provisions providing for alternative duties if primary duty not reasonably practicable

(1)   This clause applies to any provision of this Regulation that imposes a duty, such as a duty to eliminate a risk, on a person (the primary duty), but provides that if it is not reasonably practicable to comply with that duty, the person is required to comply with another duty, such as a duty to control the risk (the alternative duty).

Note. See duties to eliminate risks or, if that is not reasonably practicable, to control the risk (clause 11). See also particular alternative control measures in clause 5.

(2)   For the purposes of this Regulation, the primary duty of a person is not replaced by the alternative duty unless the person can establish that it is not reasonably practicable to comply with the primary duty.

Note. Section 28 of the Act provides a defence if the person can establish that it is not reasonably practicable to comply with the alternative duty.

…

11   Employer to eliminate or control risks

(1)   Subject to subclause (2), an employer must eliminate any reasonably foreseeable risk to the health or safety of:

(a)   any employee of the employer, or

(b)   any other person legally at the employer’s place of work,

or both, that arises from the conduct of the employer’s undertaking.

(2)   If it is not reasonably practicable to eliminate the risk, the employer must control the risk.

(3)   An employer must ensure that all measures (including procedures and equipment) that are adopted to eliminate or control risks to health and safety are properly used and maintained.

(4), (5)   (Repealed)

Maximum penalty: Level 4.

Note. An employer must also comply with any specific risk control measures required by this Regulation. In particular see Parts 4.3, 4.4, 5.4 and 6.4 and Chapters 7 and 8. The Regulation (for example, in Part 4.2 and in Chapter 5) also imposes risk control requirements on other persons, such as controllers of places of work, designers and manufacturers of plant and so on. Clause 5 sets out the order of control measures to be taken if it is not reasonably practicable to eliminate a risk.”

The judgment on conviction


	
	The trial judge found that Mr McNab suffered severe injuries when, after falling to the ground, his body was crushed between the toe of an advancing roof support and the side of the AFC: Trial Judgment at [2]. That was not disputed. The trial judge also described the system of work which was adopted in a manner basically similar to the agreed statement of facts and in a way which was not criticised on the appeal: at [6]-[27].
	
	
	The trial judge, for reasons unexplained in his judgment, set out the alleged failures of the appellant in somewhat different terms to the failures particularised in the charge: at [29]. However, nothing turns on this as he did deal with the two alleged failures the subject of the appeal, namely those in subpars 3(a) and 3(c) of the particulars. The other alleged failures considered by him were not found to amount to a contravention of s 8 of the Act. These findings were not contested on the appeal.
	
	
	The trial judge noted the submission by senior counsel for the appellant that it was a necessary element of the prosecution case to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the preventative measures pleaded would have absolutely eliminated the risk and that it was not enough to show particular measures would have mitigated the risk of an injury occurring: at [32]-[38].
	
	
	The trial judge accepted that each of the preventative measures with which he dealt would not have “eliminated the possibility of the risk pleaded in the summons coming home”: at [54]. In relation to the tilt switch particular he found that if such a switch was operative on the shearer operator’s control, the shearer would automatically stop if the operator fell to the ground: at [48]. However, he found the measure was incapable of eliminating all risk of being crushed by an advancing roof support because a roof support which is already primed by the signal from the shearer would continue to move even after the shearer was stopped. He concluded that if the operator fell in front of one of those supports, the tilt switch would not save him: at [49].
	
	
	So far as the observer particular was concerned, the trial judge observed that subsequent to the accident, the appellant employed an additional crew member as a Support Advance Controller (SAC) whose sole function was to observe the drum controller and manually stop advancement of the roof supports if he saw there was a danger. The trial judge noted that every roof support control had a button that, if pressed by the SAC, would release hydraulic pressure in the system and instantaneously prevent the supports advancing: at [50].
	
	
	Notwithstanding, the trial judge found that because such an SAC must be attentive, not only to the safety of the two drum operators, both of whom may not be concurrently in his sight, but also to his own safety, there remained a possibility that the drum operator could fall into the path of advancing roof supports without the SAC reacting in time to save him: at [51].
	
	
	However, the trial judge seemed to reject the submission that s 8(1) was not contravened by the failure to adopt a measure that did not completely eliminate the risk but only mitigated it. He noted a concession by the appellant’s counsel that the argument that the duty was not breached in those circumstances was novel and stated without elaboration that it was inappropriate that an inferior court should adopt such a fundamental change to the interpretation of s 8(1): at [55].
	
	
	The trial judge found that the circumstances in which Mr McNab came to be injured were foreseeable to a reasonable person standing in the place of the appellant: at [100]. His conclusion that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged was founded solely on the observer particular, which was expressed in the following terms:
	


“104   The defendant failed to mitigate the foreseeable risk by taking the reasonably practicable measure of employing the services of an additional miner in the crew, whose sole task was to observe the drum operators and stop the advancement of roof supports if the drum operator became disabled.”

The grounds of appeal


	
	The appellant relied on the following grounds of appeal:
	


“1   The primary judge erred in failing to find that the Defendant was not guilty of the offence charged in the absence of proof that the omission he found the Defendant to have committed – to have a person to monitor the advancing chocks and to observe the operator so that, if the operator fell over or otherwise became disabled, that person could activate the emergency stop button for the advancing chocks thus prevent the chocks from moving onto and crushing the operator -

(a)   was of conduct that, had the omission not been committed, would have prevented Mr McNab from being exposed to a risk of being crushed whilst incapacitated, and thereby would have ensured his health and safety;

(b)   was a contravention of the duty imposed by s 8(1) Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000.

2   The primary judge erred and committed jurisdictional error in declining to exercise his jurisdiction to determine a charge of an offence against the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 according to law.

3(a)   The primary judge erred and committed jurisdictional error in failing to determine the question of whether the omitted measure of employing the support advance controller would have ensured Mr McNab’s health and safety given the fact that the support advance controller could not have intervened until Mr McNab was already at risk of being crushed when he fell incapacitated in front of advancing powered roof supports.

(b)   The primary judge erred in failing to find that the Appellant’s omission to have a Support Advance Controller would not have prevented Mr McNab from being exposed to the risk whilst incapacitated of being crushed by the advancing supports as they automatically advanced towards the coalface.

4   The primary judge erred in that he failed to find that there was a causal nexus between -

(a)   the Defendant’s omission to have another person to monitor the advancing chocks and to observe the operator so that if the operator fell over or otherwise became disabled that other person could activate the emergency stop button for the advancing chocks thus prevent the chocks from moving onto and crushing the operator (‘omission to have a Support Advance Controller’), and

(b)   the risk to Mr McNab on 23 April 2010 whilst incapacitated of being crushed by the advancing supports as they automatically advanced towards the coalface.”


	
	By what was described as a notice of contention, the Attorney General and the prosecutor (described in the document as the first and second appellants), challenged the trial judge’s conclusion on the tilt switch particular. The notice of contention raised the following grounds:
	


“1.   The finding of Judge Curtis that particular 3(a) of the Amended Summons was a measure that was incapable of eliminating all risk of being crushed by an advancing roof support, because those roof supports already primed by the signal from the shearer continue to advance even after the shearer is stopped and if an operator fell in front of one of these supports the tilt switch would not save him was wrong; and

2.   That Judge Curtis should have found that if the tilt switch mechanism in the remote had been activated and the remote fell through an angle of inclination of 45 degrees the shearer would stop operating and the leading drum shearer operator would be alerted that there may be a danger to the other operator so that he could immediately stop the advance of the chocks so as to ensure the safety of the tail drum operator.”

The parties’ submissions on conviction


	
	The parties’ written submissions were lengthy and in the case of the appellant, with respect, prolix. Notwithstanding the appeal involved questions of law and there was virtually no dispute as to the primary facts, the appellant’s written submissions in chief occupied some 84 pages, whilst those in reply and in opposition to the notice of contention occupied a further 36 pages. To the extent to which we have not referred to any particular portion of these submissions, we have taken them into account in reaching the conclusions to which we have arrived.
	


The appellant’s submissions on conviction


	
	The appellant submitted that the appeal brought pursuant to s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act was an appeal for error and as such, the appeal must be allowed if error is established and the respondent fails to satisfy the Court that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.
	
	
	The appellant referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Thiess Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 252; 78 NSWLR 94 (Thiess) in which it was held that the word “risk” in s 8(2) of the Act referred to the possibility of danger, whilst the word “exposed” referred to a person who was sufficiently proximate to the risk at the relevant time. It submitted that the same approach should be adopted in respect to s 8(1), namely relevant detriment to health and safety occurred when an employee was exposed to the possibility of danger.
	
	
	The appellant submitted the offence was one of absolute liability subject to the defence contained in s 28 of the Act.
	
	
	The appellant emphasised that the words “to ensure” in s 8(1) of the Act have been held to mean to secure, guarantee, make certain and to obviate risk. It submitted that “more than one judge of the Industrial Court has specifically abjured the notion that the duty to ensure health and safety can be satisfied by minimising the risk to which employees are exposed”. It referred in that context to the decision of the Full Court of the Industrial Court in Haynes v C I & D Manufacturing Pty Ltd (1994) 60 IR 149 (Haynes) at 158-159 where it was stated that the general duties created by ss 15 and 16 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 (NSW) (the 1983 Act) were directed at obviating risk to safety at the workplace and to WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v The Crown in Right of the State of NSW (Police Service of NSW) No 2 (2001) 104 IR 268 (WorkCover v Police) at [20] where Hungerford J stated that the duty was absolute and that “ensure” was to be construed as meaning guarantee, secure and make certain. Sections 15 and 16 of the 1983 Act were in identical terms to ss 8 and 9 of the Act.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that a similar approach had been taken by the Victorian Court of Appeal to equivalent legislation in Victoria: R v Commercial Industrial Construction Group Pty Ltd [2006] VSCA 181; 14 VR 321 at [25]; ABC Development Learning Centres Pty Ltd v Wallace [2007] VSCA 138; 16 VR 409 at [15], [19].
	
	
	The appellant also submitted this approach was consistent with the construction placed on ss 15 and 16 of the 1983 Act by the High Court in Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531 (Kirk) at [11]-[12] and the Court of Appeal in The GEO Group Australian Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 150 (GEO Group) at [15], [19].
	
	
	In relation to Ground 1 of the grounds of appeal, the appellant submitted the charges must identify the nature of the alleged offending, that being an essential factual ingredient of the offence. It submitted the duty imposed was a duty which required the employer to obviate risk not just reduce the gravity of the risk or reduce exposure to the risk. On the submission of the appellant, it followed that, because criminal liability cannot attach to an omission in the absence of a correlative duty, for an employer to contravene s 8(1) by omission, the employer must fail to ensure health and safety, not just manage risk or exposure to risk. It argued that cases in the Industrial Court which reached a contrary conclusion were incorrectly decided.
	
	
	The appellant also submitted that the proposition for which it contended was not inconsistent with the objects of the legislation set out in s 3 of the Act. It submitted s 8 was designed to promote the objects in s 3(a), (b), (c) and part of (e) – that part concerned with the elimination of risk. The fact that s 3(e) stated that a further object was to ensure risks were controlled did not mean, according to the appellant, that the “clear language of s 8(1), requiring that employees’ health and safety be ensured, was to be tortured into a meaning which the words did not convey”. It claimed the statutory obligation of controlling risk was achieved through the Regulation, particularly in those clauses which we have set out above at [37].
	
	
	The appellant also referred to the different penalties imposed for a breach of the Act and breaches of the Regulation. It submitted the lesser penalties for breach of the Regulation demonstrated that s 8(1) only criminalised the absence of measures which would ensure health and safety, whilst the Regulation penalised a failure to control or manage the risk. In that context, the appellant submitted that the Regulation could be used as an aid to the interpretation of the Act, submitting the Act and Regulation formed part of a single scheme: Brayson Motors Pty Ltd (in liq) v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1985] HCA 20; 156 CLR 651 at [5]; Master Education Services Pty Ltd v Ketchell [2008] HCA 38; 236 CLR 101 at [19].
	
	
	The appellant placed reliance on the Amending Act pursuant to which s 7A was inserted. It submitted that having regard to the modification of the duties imposed by ss 8 and 9, the insertion of s 7A and the repeal of the “not reasonably practical” defence, a major purpose of the Amending Act was to dilute the content of ensuring against risk. It submitted that, approaching the use of the Amending Act in the construction of the Act as it previously existed with due caution, the amendment made it plain that the content of the duty before the amendment was to obviate risk in the workplace. In the circumstances, it submitted there was no duty imposed to minimise risk. Furthermore, it contended that the clear words of the section could not be read contrary to their plain meaning by the adoption of a purposive approach.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the finding of the trial judge was that the appointment of an SAC would not eliminate the risk to a person in the position of Mr McNab. It submitted that, at its highest, the finding was that the employment of an SAC was a reasonable response to the risk of being crushed by an advancing support and the appellant failed to mitigate the risk by appointing an observer. It submitted that the trial judge found that the risk would not be eliminated by the employment of an observer due to a number of factors, in particular, the possibility the observer may not react in time, may not be paying attention or may be careless. The appellant maintained that this conclusion was justified by the evidence, specifically, evidence demonstrating that miners walking along the longwall had to pay attention to their own safety.
	
	
	The appellant contended that, as a matter of language, the duty did not extend to minimising and controlling risk as distinct from eliminating risk. It submitted minimising and controlling risk did not guarantee safety and that words such as minimising and controlling did not appear in s 8(1). The appellant argued the Second Reading Speech to the Act made it clear that the legislation replacing the 1983 Act adopted a risk management approach to workplace safety and that the directions to control risk were to be imposed by the Regulation rather than the Act.
	
	
	At the hearing, senior counsel for the appellant placed particular emphasis on what he described as the hierarchy of controls in the Act and Regulation. He submitted the Regulation contained an obligation to manage risk to the lowest level reasonably practical.
	
	
	The appellant summarised its submission on this ground as follows. First, the Industrial Court decisions holding that s 8(1) is contravened where a measure is not taken which would not have eliminated the risk but only controlled it, are plainly wrong. Second, the charge is not satisfied by proof of an omission to take a measure, which the prosecution has not proved would have ensured the employees’ health or safety. Third, the judge erred in finding the offence charged proved without the respondent proving that the omission contended for would have ensured Mr McNab’s safety and accordingly, that the omission breached the duty imposed.
	
	
	The appellant also submitted the failures identified above constituted jurisdictional error.
	
	
	So far as Ground 3 was concerned, the appellant submitted the facts showed that as soon as Mr McNab fell incapacitated in front of the advancing roof supports he was exposed to being crushed by the supports, immediately behind him as it advanced, closing the gap between them and the AFC.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that at the trial, it had raised the point that on the application of the law as stated in Thiess, Mr McNab had been exposed to the risk before the SAC could do anything. It submitted the trial judge failed to deal with this submission and that this was an error of law.
	
	
	The appellant characterised s 8(1) as a result offence, the conduct being the act or omissions and the result being the detriment to the employee’s safety. It submitted that Mr McNab had been exposed to the risk the minute he fell incapacitated in front of the roof supports, at which point the offence charged was complete. It pointed out the SAC could not do anything until he observed a person in the position of Mr McNab was in danger and thus could not have prevented him being put at risk. It followed that the failure to engage an SAC could not constitute a contravention of s 8(1) of the Act.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the appellant also submitted that it was incorrect to construe the section as providing that a contravention only occurred if it could be established beyond reasonable doubt that, if an observer was present, the particular injury would have been avoided. He submitted, relying on Thiess, that what needed to be guaranteed against was the possibility of danger and where, as in the present case, as soon as the victim fell he was exposed to the risk of being crushed, there was nothing a monitor could do to avoid that risk, all he or she could do was manage the risk. Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that not only was the approach consistent with Thiess but also with a number of cases in the Industrial Court which have held that it is not the actual occurrence of injury that is required for an offence to be established, but rather an exposure to the risk. He referred in that context to Haynes at 157; WorkCover Authority v Coffey Engineering Pty Ltd (No 2) (2001) 110 IR 447 at [18]-[19] and WorkCover v Police at [20].
	
	
	In relation to Ground 4, the appellant submitted the trial judge made no finding that the risk to Mr McNab was caused by the failure to appoint a SAC. It submitted that the failure of the trial judge to consider whether the omission to appoint a SAC caused Mr McNab to be at risk of being crushed when he fell in front of the roof support was a failure to consider whether an element of the offence had been proved. It submitted that this failure was a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge gave no consideration to the question of whether a substantial or significant cause of the risk was the failure by the appellant to perform a duty required by the Act.
	
	
	The appellant submitted it was impossible that the failure to appoint a controller caused the risk as Mr McNab was exposed to the risk before anything could be done about it.
	


The respondent’s submissions on conviction


	
	The respondent pointed out that the appellant at trial had admitted the risks particularised, including being crushed by a roof support as it advanced towards the coalface. She submitted her case was that, had the measures particularised been implemented at the time Mr McNab was working, on the date the subject of the charge, Mr McNab would not have been in danger. She submitted the observer particular and the tilt switch particular would have eliminated or controlled the risk.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the gravamen of the case was at all times directed towards the risk of being crushed by advancing roof supports.
	
	
	She referred to the finding by the trial judge to the effect there was a possibility an operator might fall in the path of an advancing roof support without the SAC reacting in time to save him and that the SAC may from time to time be careless, inadvertent or inattentive. She submitted it was important to note that the finding was that, absent slow reaction, inadvertence or inattentiveness, the measure would have eliminated or controlled the risk.
	
	
	The respondent accepted that the obligation or rule of conduct prescribed by s 8(1) of the Act was to guarantee or secure employees’ safety. However, she submitted there was no common sense reason why controlling or managing a particular danger in a particular way would not guarantee safety in given circumstances. She submitted that that would inevitably depend upon the risk the subject of the charge as well as the measures proposed to address it.
	
	
	The respondent submitted the essence of the appellant’s argument was that because the measure of having an observer may have been ineffective if the observer failed to notice a shearer operator becoming incapacitated, the measure could not guarantee safety. She submitted that it is possible that almost any measure designed to ensure safety might be capable of being compromised. The focus, it was contended, should be on the likelihood that the measure, when properly engaged, would ensure health and safety.
	
	
	The respondent referred to the statement by Spigelman CJ in Thiess that the relevant risk for the purpose of s 8(1) was the possibility of danger. She submitted elimination or control of some but not all danger necessarily means the danger is eliminated in those respects by which it has been eliminated or controlled. It does not mean, she submitted, that the same danger continues to exist, far less that the same possibility of danger continues to exist.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the distinction between guaranteeing or securing safety and controlling or managing it is without foundation. She submitted the inquiry always is: would the measure have secured safety if implemented in the manner contemplated?
	
	
	The respondent sought to derive support for the construction of s 8(1) contended for from s 28 of the Act. She submitted its effect was only to excuse a failure to secure safety to the extent it was not reasonably practical to conform to that obligation. It was argued that the defence under the Act necessarily meant the obligation of an employer under s 8(1) was to remove all possibilities of danger from the workplace except those which were subject to the statutory defence under s 28. In those circumstances, she submitted the Act was concerned with risk minimisation.
	
	
	The respondent contended that there were three answers to the appellant’s submission on Ground 1. First, she submitted it did not have common sense to commend it in the scheme of an Act concerned with workplace health and safety. Second, she submitted that it assumed the SAC would perform his or her task in a negligent or “half-baked” way.
	
	
	The third answer given by the respondent related to the tilt switch particular. She submitted that it was acknowledged that activation of the tilt switch would have prevented any roof supports not already primed from advancing. She submitted that if there had been an SAC present, the risk of being crushed by a primed roof support would also have been averted.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that par [104] of the reasons of the trial judge had to be put in context. She contended that “ensure” in s 8(1) did not mean absolutely ensure in the sense of completely eliminate. She referred in that context to s 8(1)(d) relating to the provision of instructions or training, stating in effect that instructions or training cannot ensure safety. It was submitted the provision should be read to ensure health and safety subject to what was reasonably practical.
	
	
	The respondent submitted the construction for which she contended was consistent with the construction placed on the provision by the Industrial Court referring to O’Sullivan v The Crown in Right of the State of NSW Department of Education and Training [2003] NSWIRComm 74; 125 IR 361 (O’Sullivan) at [140]-[141] on appeal The Crown in Right of the State of NSW (Department of Education and Training) v O’Sullivan [2005] NSWIRComm 198; 143 IR 57 at [42]; NSW Department of Education and Training and Department of Juvenile Justice v Cahill No 2 [2011] NSWIRComm 33; 210 IR 112 at [136] (which held that the decision in O’Sullivan was not affected by Kirk); Inspector Batty v Intercoast Refrigerated Transport [2012] NSWIRComm 55 at [100]-[103].
	
	
	As an alternative, the respondent submitted that as a matter of fact the appointment of an SAC would have obviated the risk. She submitted the observer would have watched the shearer operator most exposed to being struck by flyrock, that is, the operator operating the trailing drum. She pointed out that the appellant’s workplace practices provided that Mr McNab was required not to stand in the area immediately opposite the trailing drum or in front of the roof support that would next be primed. In these circumstances, it was submitted that if there was an observer whose job it was to watch Mr McNab, the risk would be eliminated because as soon as Mr McNab fell over the observer would be able to turn off the power to the roof supports and thereby stop them moving. She submitted the trial judge erred in failing to consider this argument.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 3, the respondent submitted the appellant failed to deal with the finding that Mr McNab was always at risk because if he fell over or was incapacitated, he could be crushed by the advancing supports. She again submitted that the risk could have been completely removed if a SAC was present.
	
	
	The respondent emphasised that the risk identified by the prosecution was a risk of being crushed by a roof support as it advanced towards the coalface.
	
	
	So far as Ground 4 was concerned, the respondent submitted that a fair reading of the judgment of the trial judge led to the conclusion that he did consider there was a causal link between the omission and Mr McNab’s exposure to risk. She submitted the relevant question was whether the appointment of an SAC would have eliminated or minimised the risk.
	


The submissions on the notice of contention


	
	The respondent submitted that every shearer operator who gave evidence supported the tilt switch particular as a measure to ensure health and safety.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the finding of the trial judge on the tilt switch particular, namely that if the operator fell in front of an already primed support, the tilt switch would not save him, ignored the fact that Mr McNab was not working in front of supports already primed. She submitted that if the tilt switch was activated when Mr McNab fell in front of supports not primed, the risk would have been eliminated.
	
	
	The respondent submitted it was never her case that the tilt switch, once activated, would stop the already primed roof supports. She submitted her case was that had the tilt switch facility used by Mr McNab been active, his falling or becoming incapacitated would have engaged the tilt switch, stopping the shearer immediately, which would have alerted the other operator who could have stopped the primed roof supports by hitting the emergency button.
	
	
	The respondent framed this argument by stating that the tilt switch particular involved a two stage measure. First, the activation of the switch would stop the shearer; second, the fellow shearer operator, being alerted to the danger, would stop the primed roof support from moving. She submitted the trial judge erred in misunderstanding how the case was particularised.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the respondent was seeking to have the Court overturn findings of fact made by the trial judge.
	
	
	In that context, the appellant noted its appeal was brought pursuant to s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act. It submitted s 5AA(4) conferred on the Court a power to confirm the determination of the Court below or order it be vacated and in the latter event, to make any determination the Court below could have made on the evidence heard on the appeal. It submitted that the section did not extend to setting aside factual findings made by the trial judge other than where the determination of the Court below is vacated.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that subsequent to its amendment in 2000, s 5AA has been construed as conferring a right of appeal in the strict sense, requiring the demonstration of error. It submitted there was no scope for the Court simply to make different findings of fact at the insistence of the respondent to the appeal. It pointed to the fact that the respondent did not contend that the finding made in relation to the tilt switch was not available on the evidence. Further, it submitted the Court was not authorised to hear a prosecution appeal pursuant to a notice of contention.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the finding by the trial judge in respect of the tilt switch was correct and stopping the shearer would not stop the primed roof supports from moving. Further, it submitted there was evidence the tilt switch would not necessarily operate if the remote control was dropped. It pointed to the fact that it was necessary for the control to tilt at an angle of 45 degrees for the switch to operate and that it could be dropped without tilting at that angle.
	


Consideration

a   The nature of the appeal


	
	Section 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act is in the following terms:
	


“5AA   Appeal in criminal cases dealt with by Supreme Court or District Court in their summary jurisdiction

	It is now well established that following the amendments made to the section consequent upon the decision of this Court in Hilstollo Pty Ltd v Director General of National Parks and Wildlife Service (1998) 45 NSWLR 661, an appeal under this section is an appeal in the strict sense and it is necessary to show error: Thorneloe v Phillip Filipowski [2001] NSWCCA 213; 52 NSWLR 60 at [3]; Gilmour v Environment Protection Authority [2002] NSWCCA 399; (2002) 55 NSWLR 593 (Gilmour) (in which it was stated at [19] that error must be demonstrated as a threshold point); Cabonne Shire Council v Environment Protection Authority [2001] NSWCCA 280 at [3]-[5]; Walker Corporation Pty Ltd v Director General Department of Environment and Climate Change and Water [2012] NSWCCA 210; 82 NSWLR 12 at [43]; Rummery v Chief Executive Office of Environment and Heritage [2014] NSWCCA 106 at [5]. This principle was not disputed. It follows that an appeal can only succeed if the trial judge committed an error of law or applied the wrong principles in his or her fact finding exercise.
	
	
	So much was accepted by the parties. However, the appeal gives rise to further questions. First, in the event the Court determined that the trial judge erred in finding the charge proved by reason of one particularised omission, can the Court consider whether the judge should have convicted the appellant on the basis that he erred in finding that another particularised omission did not constitute a breach? This was the matter substantially raised by the notice of contention.
	
	
	The second question is whether the Court has power to order a retrial in the event it finds the trial judge erred in reaching his or her conclusions.
	
	
	Because of the view we have formed on the disposal of the appeal, it is unnecessary to form a final view on either of these questions. However, it is appropriate to express a preliminary view.
	
	
	So far as the first question is concerned, it does not seem to us that the fact the judge may have been in error in failing to find a charge proved on the basis of another particularised omission would of itself result in dismissal of the appeal. However, in Gilmour at [27], in dealing with the absence from s 5AA(4) of the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, Santow JA, with whom Hidden and Adams JJ agreed, made the following remarks:
	


“[27]   I do not consider that the express inclusion of the proviso in s6(1) of the Act should lead to a different result. Section 6(1), and s5AA in its current form, were clearly enacted at different times. The draftsman of s5AA(4) was content to confer a discretion upon the Court of Appeal whose content can be derived from the same common law rule as has long been an essential part of the common law in relation to appeals. It is a rule that, as Kirby J put it, ‘an appellate court would not exercise its powers to set aside a valid judgment (criminal or civil) for immaterial, irrelevant or insubstantial reasons’, these being exemplified by error where ‘no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred’: para [76] at 348”


	
	The reference to the judgment of Kirby J in that passage is a reference to his Honour’s judgment in Conway v The Queen [2002] HCA 2; (2002) 209 CLR 203 (Conway) at [76]. As Santow JA also pointed out in Gilmour at [24], Kirby J also remarked in Conway that “any dismissal of the appeal in the face of a misdirection at trial is controlled by the general view that a court may dismiss an appeal if the error could not, on any reasonable hypothesis, have influenced the result”: at [80].
	
	
	Whilst this approach may justify the dismissal of an appeal where the error in question could be seen to have no material effect on the ultimate conclusion of the trial judge and perhaps where a finding of guilt can be made on the basis of a matter which the trial judge did not find it necessary to consider, we doubt it could extend to dismissal on the ground that guilt was established in a manner expressly rejected by the trial judge, particularly if it involved making contrary findings of fact. It would be difficult to conclude that in those circumstances there was no substantial miscarriage of justice so as to justify dismissal of the appeal: Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300; AK v State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438 at [58]; Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen [2012] HCA 14; 246 CLR 92 at [27]-[29], [31].
	
	
	The second question is also one of some difficulty. The power of the Court, if it finds error, is to make any order which (in this case) the District Court could have made on the evidence heard on appeal: s 5AA(4) Criminal Appeal Act. That provision in its terms does not permit the order of a new trial. In contrast, the power of the Court of Appeal under s 75A of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) includes a power to make any order which the nature of the case requires: s 75A(10).
	
	
	We do not think it can be said that the Criminal Appeal Act empowers the Court to order a new trial as a matter of necessary implication. Section 8 of the Criminal Appeal Act empowers the Court to order a new trial in the case of a conviction upon indictment. Although the section was introduced into the Act prior to the 2000 amendments to s 5AA, the latter section previously having provided for a rehearing, we do not think that as a matter of implication the power in s 8 can extend to appeals brought under s 5AA: cf Gilmour at [27].
	
	
	It may be that consideration should be given to amending the section to empower the Court to order a new trial in appropriate circumstances.
	


b   The substantive issues

Grounds 1 and 2


	
	As is apparent, the appellant placed particular emphasis on the fact that the duty imposed by s 8 of the Act was to ensure the health, safety and welfare of employees and that the obligation could not be satisfied by managing or minimising the risk.
	
	
	There is no doubt that this proposition is correct. It is consistent with what has been decided in cases in the Industrial Court, the Court of Appeal and the High Court which have considered the issue. (See the cases cited above at [52]-[54].)
	
	
	However, it by no means follows that a failure to take steps which would lessen or minimise the risk, without entirely eliminating it, could not constitute a breach of that obligation. Such steps may be necessary but not sufficient to ensure safety or may at least tend to manage the risk. It is difficult to see why the failure to take such steps, albeit insufficient to ensure safety, could not constitute a breach of s 8(1) of the Act.
	
	
	In our view, a failure to take steps which are necessary but insufficient to ensure safety, or which limit the risk to the employee without entirely eliminating it, can constitute a breach of s 8(1). Construction of the section, as with any statutory provision, must begin with a consideration of the text itself. However, the meaning of the text may require consideration of the context, which includes the general purpose and policy of a provision: Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v The Commissioner of Territory Revenue (Northern Territory) [2009] HCA 41; 239 CLR 27 at [47] and the cases there cited; see also Certain Lloyd’s Underwriters v Cross [2012] HCA 56; 248 CLR 378 at [23]-[26].
	
	
	In the present case, the legislation is silent as to what can constitute a breach of s 8(1). Having regard to the objects of the Act contained in s 3, it would be surprising if liability could be avoided by reason of the fact that it could only be established that a particular method would merely manage risk rather than eliminate it. In many cases, it will be difficult to conceive of measures which would have the effect of totally eliminating any risk to the health, safety and welfare of an employee. To construe the section to only impose liability for such a measure or measures in combination (if they existed), in our view, would render the section nugatory in many cases. It cannot be assumed this result was intended.
	
	
	There is nothing in this approach which is inconsistent with what has been said in Kirk and the cases which have followed it. In Kirk, the plurality stated at [12] that the duty in ss 15 and 16 of the 1983 Act was contravened when a measure should have been taken by an employer to obviate an identified risk. The plurality subsequently stated at [14] that the duty has been contravened where there has been a failure to take a particular measure to prevent an identifiable risk eventuating. It was not suggested in these paragraphs that the only measure an employer was obliged to take was one which, as a matter of certainty, would eliminate the risk.
	
	
	Further, as Spigelman CJ pointed out in Thiess at [31], the joint judgment in Kirk identified that the scope of the employer’s obligation as to what was necessary to be done in connection with the health, safety and welfare of employees depended upon the presence of identifiable risks and measures which could be taken to address them:  Kirk at [19]. There is no reason to conclude that this would not extend to measures which could mitigate or minimise the risk, even though the risk would not be entirely eliminated.
	
	
	In GEO Group, Meagher JA pointed out at [20] that measures may be identified in the charge which may have guaranteed against the risk eventuating, but which may not be reasonably practical. He noted that all that was required was that the act or omission be identified so that the availability of the defence may be evaluated by reference to the alleged acts and omissions. His Honour did not state that the only measures which could be identified in the charge were those which could guarantee safety as distinct from contributing to it by mitigating risk.
	
	
	Further, as we indicated above, the approach we regard as correct was adopted by the Industrial Court both in relation to the 1983 Act and the Act itself.
	
	
	As we indicated, the appellant submitted that the Act and Regulation could be construed as part of a single scheme. The difficulty with that submission is that s 8 is in identical terms to ss 15 and 16 of the 1983 Act in respect of which there were no corresponding regulations. The appellant accepted that the 2000 Act made no substantive amendments to the equivalent earlier legislation. It is difficult to see how in those circumstances the Regulation can be of any assistance on the question of construction.
	
	
	Nor do we think that statements in both the 1983 and 2000 Second Reading Speeches, to the effect the duty was absolute, are of any assistance. The relevant question is not the scope of the duty but what can constitute a breach.
	
	
	Further we do not think that s 7A assists the appellant. As we pointed out above at [35], the effect of s 7A was to place the onus on the prosecutor to prove that a measure was reasonably practicable as distinct from making this factor a defence. This does not seem to us to be of assistance in determining whether a contravention occurred.
	
	
	For these reasons, we are of the view that a failure to take a measure which would have managed or mitigated a risk to the health, safety and welfare of an employee will breach s 8(1) of the Act, even if the measure does not entirely eliminate risk.
	
	
	Although perhaps not entirely clear, this seems to have been the effect of the decision of the trial judge. Whilst his Honour found the appointment of an SAC would not eliminate the risk, he said it would mitigate it. In making this finding, the trial judge recognised the possibility that either a shearer operator might fall into the path of a moving roof support without the observer reacting in time to save him or that the observer might be careless, inadvertent or inattentive to the shearer operator’s safety (Trial Judgment at [51]-[52]). His remarks at [104] of his judgment must be read in that context. The fact that he found the measure would not eliminate the risk does not mean his conclusion was incorrect.
	
	
	It follows that Grounds 1 and 2 of the grounds of appeal have not been made out.
	


Ground 3


	
	This ground can be dealt with shortly.
	
	
	The particulars of the charge identified a number of discrete risks to which the employee was exposed. They included, separately, being crushed by the roof supports as they automatically advanced towards the coalface and slipping or falling behind the shearer when the roof supports were advancing towards the coalface. Each of the risks was admitted at the trial.
	
	
	As we indicated above at [111], it was stated in Kirk at [14] that ss 15 and 16 of the 1983 Act were contravened where there had been a failure on the part of the employer to take a particular measure to prevent an identifiable risk eventuating. Such a risk will exist where there is a possibility of danger. The person exposed to the risk is one who is sufficiently proximate to the source of the risk at the relevant time for the risk to possibly impinge on his or her health and safety: Thiess at [67].
	
	
	The appellant contended that the requirement was to avoid exposure to risk, rather than to prevent an actual occurrence. This may be accepted, however, it does not mean that the section cannot be breached by the failure to take action to prevent a risk, to which an employee was exposed, from crystallising. To reach a contrary conclusion would be to ignore the self-evident fact that the duty will arise in circumstances where there is an exposure to a risk in respect of which preventative measures can be taken.
	
	
	What we have said is consistent with the judgment in Kirk. As was stated in the joint judgment in that case, the identification of the measures which should have been taken generally will itself identify the risk: at [14]. The risk in the present case was that identified by par 1(a) of the particulars, namely a risk that an employee would be crushed by the roof supports. This risk would emerge when an employee by reason of incapacitation or some other reason, fell in front of advancing roof supports. The appointment of an observer would have mitigated or minimised that risk.
	
	
	In these circumstances Ground 3 has not been established.
	


Ground 4


	
	For the purpose of s 8 of the Act, the relevant question on causation is whether the act or omission of the employer was a significant or substantial cause of the employee being exposed to the risk of injury.
	
	
	Thus, in the present case, it was necessary to establish whether the failure to appoint an SAC was causally related to the risk of the employee’s safety which occurred on the evening in question. That question is to be determined by the application of common sense to the facts in question, appreciating that the purpose of the inquiry is to attribute legal responsibility in a criminal matter: Royall v The Queen [1991] HCA 27; 172 CLR 378 at [17] (Mason CJ), [19] (Deane and Dawson JJ), [15], [21] (Toohey and Gaudron JJ).
	
	
	Further, in considering the issue, regard must be had to the purpose to which the question is directed, which involves considering it in light of the scope and objects of the Act: Allianz Australia Ltd v GSF Australia Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 26; 221 CLR 568 at [41]-[42], [95]-[101]; see also Simpson Design and Associates Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of NSW [2011] NSWCA 316 (Simpson Design) at [79]-[102] and the cases there cited.
	
	
	In the present case, the relevant question is whether the failure to employ an SAC was a substantial and significant cause of the risk of an employee being crushed by a roof support after falling whilst incapacitated. That must be considered in light of the object of the provision in question, namely to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the employee. The relevant question is not whether the omission was the cause of the injury to Mr McNab but rather whether there was a causal relationship between the act or omission and the risk to which he was exposed: Simpson Design at [3]-[4].
	
	
	In our opinion, the requisite causal relationship has been made out. The failure to appoint an SAC increased the risk that a person who fell in the face of an advancing roof support would be crushed before his incapacity was observed. The omission to employ an observer was a significant cause of the risk to which the employee in that position was exposed.
	
	
	In these circumstances the necessary causal link has been established.
	
	
	The trial judge did not deal discretely with the issue, rather he focussed on the foreseeability of the risk. However, it is implicit in his conclusion that the employment of an observer would have mitigated the risk, such that the failure to do so was a significant cause of an employee’s exposure to it. In these circumstances, we do not think that his failure to directly deal with the issue constituted an error.
	


The notice of contention


	
	It follows from the conclusion which we have reached that it is not necessary to deal with the notice of contention. We have indicated the difficulty involved in the procedure sought to be adopted, having regard to the provisions of s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act. Further, the error which it is suggested the trial judge made, at least on one view, is an error of fact from which no appeal would lie. However, it is unnecessary to express a final conclusion on this issue.
	


Conclusion


	
	In the result, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.
	


The Sentence Appeal


	
	Although this part of the judgment concerns the appeals by the Attorney General and the prosecutor in relation to the penalty and costs, it is convenient to continue to refer to Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd as the appellant for consistency.
	
	
	On 5 February 2015, the trial judge imposed a fine of $50,000 on the appellant. On the same day and in a separate judgment his Honour held that the appellant should not pay the costs of the prosecutor in preparing her case in respect of particulars which did not go to trial after amendment of the summons and that the appellant should pay 20% of the prosecutor’s other costs as agreed or assessed. The Attorney General has sought leave to appeal against the penalty imposed. The Attorney General has appealed, and the respondent seeks leave to appeal, against the costs orders, raising identical grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal in the notice of appeal are these:
	


1.   His Honour failed to have regard or any adequate regard to the fact that the risk of a person who was disabled being crushed by the advancing roof supports ought to have been known and identified by the defendant by reason of any or all of the following: AS.NZS 4240:1:2009, the defendant's own training of its employees and by the defendant's experience of previous instances where employees working at the coal face had been struck by rock and disabled.

2.   His Honour failed to have regard to the availability [of] simple measures to deal with the risk of an incapacitated person being crushed by the operation of automated roof supports such as putting in place an observer or spotter to observe the shearer operators, and in particular the operator of the trailing drum, and to arrest or cause the arrest of the advance of roof supports in the event that a shearer operator became incapacitated and was at risk of being crushed by those supports.

3.   His Honour failed to have regard to the potential serious consequences for the defendant's employees and in particular the operator of the trailing drum of the shearer of not guarding against the risk.

4.   His Honour measured the quantum of the fine against the degree of the injured employees (sic) suffering and failed to take any account or any adequate account of the potential consequences of exposure to the risk.

5.   His Honour failed to clearly identify and include in the fine any adequate components for specific and general deterrence.

6.   His Honour wrongly took into account the defendant's remorse for the injured employee's injuries and mistook remorse for the injuries suffered by the injured employee for remorse and contrition for the commission of the offence, in circumstances where the defendant had not expressed any remorse or contrition for the offence, and, indeed had indicated that it was not contrite or remorseful for the commission of the offence.


	
	At the outset of the hearing of the appeal, the Attorney sought leave to add a further ground of appeal relating to the manifest inadequacy of the penalty imposed. The proposed ground included as the basis for the manifest inadequacy matters which, the appellant submitted, had not been the subject of findings by the trial judge partly, at least, because of the way the proceedings had been conducted. The Court, therefore, gave leave to the Attorney to raise the ground of manifest inadequacy confined to matters already identified in the sentence appeal. The new ground was as follows:
	


1A   The sentence was manifestly inadequate.


	
	His Honour’s Remarks on Sentence (ROS) were relatively brief. In relation to the objective seriousness of the offence his Honour said that the offence was neither deliberate nor reckless. Prior to the offence, the appellant was acutely aware of and concerned with the safety of its operations. It had established and maintained a well-developed and robust health and safety management system. Its record was unblemished. The offence resulted not from a lack of willingness or application to matters of safety but from a lack of imagination.
	
	
	The risk was unforeseen by responsible persons in the industry generally. It resulted from an extremely improbable sequence of events. His Honour referred to an expert mine electrical engineer employed by the appellant who calculated that no such event had occurred in some 131 million roof support movements in the industry up to April 2010. His Honour determined that the appellant’s failure to foresee the event was of the lowest degree consistent with guilt. His Honour said that, although the appellant’s good character and the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed might otherwise entitle the appellant to the provisions of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act), the penalty had to reflect the grave consequences inflicted upon Mr McNab.
	
	
	As to general deterrence, his Honour said that he regarded the fact of the conviction rather than the amount of any penalty as a sufficient exhortation to the mining industry to conceive of and guard against remote dangers. As to specific deterrence, his Honour said that the appellant’s good character, unblemished record and appropriate response to the injuries suffered by Mr McNab led him to the belief that the penalty need not reflect any need for specific deterrence.
	
	
	As far as remorse was concerned his Honour noted that the appellant had gone to considerable lengths to provide Mr McNab with extensive retraining and support with opportunity for career advancement within the company. His Honour accepted those measures as conduct consistent with the appellant’s acceptance of responsibilities for his injuries.
	


Grounds 1, 2 & 3:   Objective seriousness


	
	The Attorney dealt with these grounds together and we have adopted that approach. They all concern the assessment of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The Attorney submitted that the reference by the trial judge to AS.NZS4240:1:2009 (the Standard) should have been a sufficient answer to any issue concerning a lack of imagination because the risk was expressly identified in that Standard. The Attorney submitted that his Honour appeared to focus on the incident or accident. By doing so he had fallen into error because the focus should have been upon the risk and not upon the particular circumstances of the accident.
	
	
	The Attorney submitted that his Honour appeared not to have taken into account the fact that the risk as particularised had been known and identified before the incident. The matter had been dealt with in the Trial Judgment at [95]-[96] where he referred to the incident some five weeks earlier when an operator was struck on the head and shoulder by a large piece of coal that was thrown towards him after falling on the trailing drum. His Honour had referred to that incident as placing the appellant on notice that “a miner might be dropped by a large piece of flyrock”. Both the Standard and that incident meant that the appellant’s conduct in committing the offence was in the face of a known and identified risk about which it did nothing.
	
	
	The Attorney submitted that the trial judge, in identifying only one basis for foreseeability in his ROS, had apparently overlooked that, in the Trial Judgment, his Honour had identified four findings of foreseeability.
	
	
	The Attorney submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that the cost of the measure implemented immediately after the accident of employing an observer was prohibitive or that there was some other reason that made it difficult. His Honour should have taken into account the simplicity of the measure which pointed to the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	Finally, the Attorney submitted that the trial judge should have had regard to the fact that the risk brought about by the offence included the risk of the possibility of death. In that regard, although Mr McNab’s injuries were less serious, the extent of those injuries was relevant but not a determinative factor in assessing objective seriousness.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that none of the matters identified by the Attorney were errors of the kind referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 and such an error would need to be shown. The appellant submitted that assessing objective seriousness was quintessentially a matter for the trial judge, relying on authorities such as R v KB; R v JL; R v RJB [2011] NSWCCA 190 (KB, JL and RJB) at [51]-[53].
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the findings of fact made by the trial judge that the risk was unforeseen by responsible persons in the industry generally and that the accident resulted from an extremely improbable sequence of events are not shown to be infected with error, nor was the trial judge’s acceptance of the evidence from the appellant’s electrical engineer that no such accident had occurred in some 131 million roof support movements in the industry up to April 2010.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the trial judge regarded the Standard as significant but that, as the trial judge had found in the Trial Judgment, it was a Standard written for designers of mining equipment and not operators, and that a reasonable mining company would ordinarily only consult the Standard when purchasing or commissioning new equipment. In that way it was wrong to suggest that by reason of the Standard the risk was well known and identified.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the prior incident involved a shearer operator who had been struck by a large piece of coal but had not been disabled. In that way the first appeal ground misstated the description of that incident.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the Attorney’s submission that the trial judge appeared not to have taken account of the fact that the risk as particularised in the charge had been known and identified before the incident was itself an error because the risk as found was not the risk as particularised. The risk as particularised was the risk simply of being crushed by advancing roof supports whereas the risk found by the trial judge was the risk of being crushed by advancing roof supports after falling in front of them incapacitated.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that it was in the highest degree unlikely that the trial judge had overlooked or had forgotten the findings he made on guilt.
	
	
	In answer particularly to Ground 2 the appellant submitted that reliance on the alleged availability and alleged simplicity of having an extra observer ignored the unchallenged evidence that the measure of having an extra observer did not exist in any mine before the incident.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 3, the appellant submitted that it would have been wrong, contrary to the Attorney’s submission, for the trial judge to have taken into account the potential serious consequences for people other than Mr McNab by reason of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383.
	


Consideration


	
	In KB, JL and RJB, Bathurst CJ (with whom Buddin and Harrison JJ agreed) said:
	


[51]   As Howie J pointed out in Mirza v R [2007] NSWCCA 248 at [16] the level of objective seriousness of a particular offence is a matter on which minds might differ. It is an assessment which is classically within the role of the sentencing judge. In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 Spigelman CJ stated the position as follows (at [37]):

Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.

In that case Spigelman CJ found that the characterisation adopted by the sentencing judge was open, although he expressed hesitation in so finding.

[52]   In the same case, Simpson J set out the position as follows at [46]:

The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.""

[53]   … That is not to say that appellate courts should not intervene once they have reached a concluded view that the sentencing judge was in error in his or her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. However, the approach in Mulato supra, emphasises the need for caution in reaching such a view and the importance of paying due regard to the opinion of the sentencing judge.


	
	The Attorney’s submissions attempted to meet those principles by identifying specific errors of a House v The King type. The errors identified are said to involve the failure of the trial judge to have concluded that the risk was known both by reason of the existence of the Standard and by the appellant’s experience of previous cases of employees being struck by rock and being disabled, by the failure of the trial judge to have had regard to the simple measure of having an observer put in place and by failing to have regard to the potential serious consequences for its employees in not guarding against the risk.
	
	
	An examination of the trial judge’s ROS shows that he had regard to, and considered the significance of, the Standard. His conclusion immediately after considering the Standard, that the culpability of the appellant in failing to foresee the event was at the lowest degree consistent with guilt, must be seen also in the light of the Trial Judgment where his Honour had held that the Standard was directed to designers of mining equipment and not operators, and that not only was the appellant’s attention not drawn to the relevant provisions by the manufacturer of the equipment but that a reasonable mining company would ordinarily only consult the Standard when purchasing or commissioning new equipment. The Attorney fails to show that the trial judge did not consider a relevant matter, being the existence of the Standard.
	
	
	In relation to the other two identified errors, it was the failure of the appellant to have an observer in place that resulted in its conviction for the offence. It was because of the potential serious consequences for the appellant’s employees, notwithstanding the considerable unlikelihood of the risk eventuating, that nevertheless resulted in the appellant’s conviction. The trial judge, therefore, did not fail to have regard to the availability of having an observer present and did not fail to take account of the potential consequences of the risk.
	
	
	Although the trial judge’s findings in relation to the Standard, if viewed alone, may have led him to the conclusion that the failure to foresee the risk was at a very low level, his Honour appears not to have had regard to the other findings in the Trial Judgment concerning foreseeability. His Honour there said:
	


[88]   The sting in the evidence is not that Mr Henderson, or some other responsible officer of the defendant should have read the standard, nor that the appropriate solution to the risk was the use of a tilt switch in the remote. It is that the authors of the standard were able to foresee the risk that gave rise to Mr McNab's injuries.

[89]   This circumstance makes it difficult to conclude that the risk was not equally foreseeable to a reasonable man possessed of the relevant skill and expertise charged by the defendant with responsibilities to ensure Mr McNab's safety.

…

[91]   The trouble with the technical evidence is that, if the injury was foreseeable and existing technology inadequate to obviate the risk, the reasonable response, subsequently adopted by the defendant, was the employment of the Support Advance Controller.

Previous Incidents Known to the Defendant

16 June 2008

[92]   On 16 June 2008, a document entitled 'Safety Alert Operator Crushed

Between Long wall Roof Support and AFC Pan Line' was published to the industry. The document recorded that a Shearer operator 'was crushed between the front of a long wall chock and the AFC pan line' and suffered 'multiple fractures of the pelvis and internal injuries.' The document recited the circumstances of the incident as being that:

'The shearer operator said he was kicking spilled coal from the walkway when he slipped and fell in front of the chock. The chock advanced and crushed him against the AFC pan line. The shearer had just completed the 'snake' cut at the tailgate and was returning to the tailgate end... Chock movement control was automatic, initiated by the shearer as it proceeded along the face. The chock had been primed to move when the operator slipped and fell in front of it. The gap between the front of the chock and the pan line was sufficiently narrow that the potential for a person to receive fatal injuries was high'.

The incident placed the defendant on notice that there was a risk that a miner who was not incapacitated may be injured if he slipped or fell in front of a primed roof support that was commencing its advance.

…

[94] … . In the absence of other circumstances this incident, of itself, may not have placed a reasonable man in the defendant's position on notice of the possibility of an incapacitated person being injured by an advancing roof support. (emphasis added)

30 March 2010

[95]   On 30 March 2010, five weeks before the McNab incident, Mr Glen Watters, a miner remotely operating the trailing arm of the Shearer at Bettana was struck on the head and shoulder by a large piece of coal that was thrown towards him after it fell from the face onto the cutting drum of the Shearer. The injury was the subject of a written report by Mr Watters to the defendant in which he wrote: 'Large piece of coal thrown by trailing drum at speed'.

…

Specific Site Conditions

[97]   The defendant knew, because of the work of its geologists in preparing a Block Management Plan, that the area through which the shearing operations were to proceed on the day Mr McNab suffered his injury were particularly hazardous, with a greatly increased risk of fly rock. This was because the geologists had identified a thin strata of rock in the roof with a known tendency for large pieces disturbed by passage of the Shearer to fall onto the tines of the trailing drum.

Other Evidence Relevant to Foreseeability

[98]   Mr Michael Brock was a member of the yellow crew at Beltana that worked the shift before Mr McNab suffered his injury. Mr Brock then had 24 years’ experience as a miner. He gave this evidence:

Q   Prior to Mr McNab's injury were you ever consulted about any

methods that might be employed to prevent crush injuries to persons who if incapacitated fell and were liable to be crushed by advancing chocks?

A. The only thing that I can think of would be that the training that we - that we receive everybody that operates on the face would    know that if they've seen somebody fallen down and unconscious or whatever, and it didn't matter where they would be on the face that you would hit the dump button, which would stop all the hydraulics on the face.

Q.   When you say everybody that would be the shearer operators,

the chockmen and anybody who was double chocking?

A.   Yeah, the tradesmen, deputy, yeah, we all receive the same sort of training, operational training is -


	
	Having then concluded as a result of those matters that the risk resulting in Mr McNab’s injuries was reasonably foreseeable, his Honour went on to find:
	


[101]   Experience that an event has never happened, does not prove that it cannot happen. The highly qualified persons who contributed to the discussion in May 2010 mat [scil. may] not have turned their minds to the correlation between the movement of the Shearer and the advancing roof supports, or if they did, expressed to Mr Henderson any disquiet. They may not have been aware of the incident involving Mr Watters.

[102]   Most significantly the defendant failed to recognise the difference between the dangers created by the Shearer and the dangers created by the roof support system.

[103]   The risk assessment of the dangers created by the Shearer not unreasonable [sic] focused upon the dangers created by movement of that machine. The defendant apparently failed to recognise that it should also conduct a separate risk assessment of the dangers created by movement within the relatively autonomous machinery constituted by the roof supports.

[104]   The defendant failed to mitigate the foreseeable risk by taking the reasonably practicable measure of employing the services of an additional miner in the crew, whose sole task was to observe the drum operators and stop the advancement of roof supports if the drum operator became disabled.


	
	Those findings, when read together with the matters touching forseeability, do not sit easily with his Honour’s statement in his ROS:
	


8.   I do believe however that the culpability of this defendant’s failure to foresee the event is of the lowest degree consistent with guilt.


	
	Further, there was no mention in the ROS of the matters referred to in the Trial Judgment at [103] and [104]. Even allowing for the other matters considered by the trial judge in relation to the objective seriousness of the offending, the failure by his Honour to consider in his ROS the findings identified above show that his Honour failed to have regard to relevant considerations, and that error is demonstrated in his assessment of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The correct assessment of objective seriousness in the present case must be seen from the perspective that only one of the particulars of negligence was found to be established, from the finding that the risk resulted, as the trial judge said, from an extremely improbable sequence of events and the evidence accepted by the trial judge was that no such event had occurred in some 131 million roof support movements in the industry up to April 2010.
	
	
	We also accept the trial judge’s finding that the appellant was acutely aware of and concerned with the safety of its operations, that it had established and maintained a well-developed and robust health and safety management system and that its record to that point was unblemished. Nevertheless, the findings made by the trial judge in his liability judgment, when considered with the mitigating matters referred to, mean that the objective seriousness, whilst below the mid-range of offending, cannot be regarded at the lowest degree consistent with guilt.
	
	
	We would uphold these grounds.
	


Ground 4:   Quantum of fine and extent of injury


	
	The Attorney submitted that the statement that the penalty needed to reflect fairly the extent of Mr McNab’s suffering showed a misunderstanding of the principles of sentencing. The purpose of considering the consequences to Mr McNab was to assess the objective seriousness of the offence. The Attorney submitted that the penalty was not designed just to reflect the degree of Mr McNab’s suffering.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that there was no basis found in the trial judge’s ROS to assert, as Ground 4 alleges, that his Honour measured the quantum of the fine against the degree of the injured employee’s suffering.
	
	
	In our opinion, the Attorney’s submissions misstate what appears in the trial judge’s ROS. The trial judge did not say that the penalty was designed “just to reflect” the degree of Mr McNab’s suffering, nor did the trial judge indicate that it was the only criterion for the amount of the penalty. The trial judge made the observation that the penalty had to reflect the grave consequences visited upon Mr McNab in the context of dealing with the submission that an appropriate sentence would be a discharge under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	The extent of the harm that befell Mr McNab was a relevant matter for the assessment of objective seriousness of the offending. It was properly referred to when the trial judge was considering whether a s 10 discharge was appropriate. No error is demonstrated in relation to this ground.
	


Ground 5 - deterrence


	
	The Attorney submitted that the penalty erroneously failed to include any component for specific or general deterrence. The Attorney submitted that this was contrary to what had been said by the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission in Court Session in Capral Aluminium Ltd v WorkCover Authority of NSW [2000] NSWIRComm 71; 49 NSWLR 610 (Capral Aluminium) at [74], that both aspects of deterrence are matters which should normally be given weight of some substance in the sentencing process. The Attorney submitted that this judgment had been cited to the trial judge.
	
	
	The Attorney submitted further that other authorities make clear that both general and specific deterrence are significant considerations when dealing with matters of workplace or public health and safety. The Attorney submitted that the trial judge provided no reasons for his conclusion that the fact of the recording of a conviction alone would be a sufficient marker of general deterrence.
	
	
	The appellant submitted in relation to general deterrence that the case was not a suitable vehicle for deterring others. This was because: the appellant had a well-developed and robust health and safety management system; before this incident no other mine had employed a person to perform the duties of an SAC; although there was publicity given to this matter the Department of Trade and Industry did not recommend that having an SAC be adopted by other mines and it was only done in one other mine in fact. All of this showed, the appellant submitted, that the circumstances of the offence were unique. The role of general deterrence was reduced when the risk not addressed by an offender was remote.
	
	
	In relation to specific deterrence the appellant drew attention to the findings by the trial judge that the offence was neither deliberate nor reckless, that it arose from a lack of imagination and that the appellant had an unblemished record and made an appropriate response to the injuries suffered by Mr McNab. The conclusion that the appellant was unlikely to reoffend was a factor which mitigated penalty. The appellant submitted that the appellant’s health and safety management system and its approach to risk reduction disposed of the need for specific deterrence.
	
	
	In his ROS the trial judge said this under the heading of “General Deterrence”:
	


[12]   I regard the fact of the conviction, rather than the amount of any penalty as a sufficient exhortation to the mining industry to conceive of and guard against remote dangers.

Under the heading “specific deterrence” the trial judge said:

[13]   Given the Defendant’s good character, unblemished record, and appropriate response to the injuries suffered by Mr McNab I do not believe that the penalty need reflect any need for specific deterrence.


	
	In Capral Aluminium, the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission in Court Session said in respect of an offence under s 15(1) of the 1983 Act:
	


[73]   Although general deterrence and specific deterrence have differing purposes or aims, the varying aims of deterrence are particularly relevant in occupational health and safety prosecutions in light of the objects and terms of the Act. As Hungerford J in Fisher v Samaras Industries Pty Limited (1996) 82 IR 384 at 388 said:

the fundamental duty of the Court in this important area of public concern … [is] to ensure a level of penalty for a breach as will compel attention to occupational health and safety issues so that persons are not exposed to risks to their health and safety at the workplace.

[74]   We consider that the extract from the judgment of Hungerford J in Fisher v Samaras Industries Pty Limited accurately states the approach that members of this Court should take in relation to the question of deterrence, both general and personal or specific, when sentencing an offender in relation to a serious breach of the legislation. It follows that both aspects of deterrence are matters which should normally be given weight of some substance in the sentencing process; and although there may be exceptional cases (see, for example, Page v Walco Hoist Rentals Pty Limited (No. 2) [2000] NSWIRComm at 40 – 43) we would expect such cases to be very rare, and where the relevant circumstances were held by the sentencing judge to be established, the judge must indicate with some precision the circumstances which had led to the exceptional course being adopted.

[75]   We now refer more particularly to the issue of personal or specific deterrence. For the reasons we have given, we do not accept that the appellant’s submissions could have a substantial impact upon the weight to be attached to general deterrence in determining an appropriate penalty in the present case. Even where an offender demonstrates good character or a commitment to rehabilitation, the court may be obliged to have regard to the need for general deterrence: see R v Thompson (1975) 11 SASR 217 at 222. This is particularly so where the offence in question is prevalent in society and represents a serious threat to the community. The need for general deterrence in relation to serious offences under the Act is undeniable.

…

[77]   In sentencing, a court may disregard the element of specific deterrence if satisfied that the risk of re-offending is low or non-existent. The court may form such a view as a result of the rehabilitation of the offender: R v Corner (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 19 December 1997) or because the offender will not have the opportunity to commit a similar offence in the future: R v Macdonell (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 December 1995). However, we think it unlikely that the weight to be attached to specific deterrence could be reduced to zero in case of offences under the Act. At least where the offender continues to be an employer, risks to the safety of its employees or contractors may exist or be possible. Breaches of the duties imposed by the Act may occur both by commission and omission. Employers are required to maintain constant vigilance and take all practicable precautions to ensure safety in the workplace. They must adopt an approach to safety which is pro-active and not merely re-active: WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v Atco Controls Pty Ltd (1998) 82 IR 80 at 85. In view of the scope of these obligations, in most cases it will be necessary to have regard to the need to encourage a sufficient level of diligence by the offender in the future. This is particularly so where the offender conducts a large enterprise which involves inherent risks to safety: see WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Glass) v Kellogg (Aust) Pty Ltd [2000] NSWIRComm 53 at 46.

…

[79]   We conclude, in the light of the extract from the judgment in R v Howland that the significant increases in penalty which occurred from 1996 are of considerable significance in emphasising the importance of both particular and general deterrence in the sentencing process for offences against the Act and that the approach exemplified by the judgment of Hungerford J in Fisher v Samaras Industries Pty Limited is decisively confirmed by that legislative intervention. It follows that we do not accept the appellant’s submissions in relation to the question of deterrence, although the precise weight to be given to that issue is inevitably within the sentencing judge’s discretion: Director of Public Prosecutions v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 378. We conclude that in this case, although deterrence in both of its relevant respects is pertinent here, weight should also be given to the particular circumstances of the appellant.

[80]   Finally, in relation to the question of deterrence, we should draw attention to the line of authority which emphasises that deterrence should be a matter of significant weight in the sentencing process where the relevant offences are difficult to detect. See, for example, R v Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328 at 330 and R v Omer (unreported, Victorian Court of Appeal, 15 February 1996 at 7) where Winneke P cited with apparent approval the judgment of the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal in R v McGown (unreported, 4 December 1985). Our present, albeit preliminary view, is that this is a consideration relevant to the sentencing for serious breaches of the Act. The experience of this Court indicates that prosecutions for offences occur only where an accident of some significance, or serious injuries, and usually both, have occurred. It follows that there are many offences which occur which are not accompanied by such serious consequences and therefore may escape detection. This is a matter which may need to be considered in future decisions of this Court where questions of deterrence are raised.


	
	The trial judge provided no reasons for his conclusion that the fact of the conviction of the appellant rather than the amount of any penalty was a sufficient warning to the mining industry to conceive of and guard against remote dangers. His Honour did not appear to be dismissing the need for general deterrence on the basis that the dangers were remote because the appellant had been convicted notwithstanding the risk was improbable, and his Honour was clearly of the view that the mining industry needed to take account of remote dangers.
	
	
	The prosecutor had drawn his Honour’s specific attention to what was said in Capral Aluminium. The prosecutor also drew attention to what was said in the Victorian Court of Appeal by Nettle JA (Neave JA and Lasry AJA agreeing) in R v Irvine; R v Dynamic Industries Pty Ltd; and R v Cini [2009] VSCA 239; 25 VR 75 (R v Irvine) at [52] as follows:
	


Workplace safety requires employers to take the obligations imposed by the Act very seriously. The community is entitled to expect that both small and large emplyers will comply with safety requirements. General deterrence is therefore a significant factor when safety obligations are breached.


	
	His Honour ought to have considered that he was bound to apply the principles discussed in Capral Aluminium, particularly as the views that judgment expressed were well supported in R v Irvine concerning general deterrence. His Honour gave no reason for taking a different view. Nor did his Honour provide as a reason for his approach that the case was an exceptional one. We see no reason to qualify the principles discussed in Capral Aluminium.
	
	
	The appellant relied on the fact that the circumstances of the offence were unique and submitted that the role of general deterrence was reduced when the risk was remote. However, that does not appear to be the approach that the trial judge took. His Honour saw it as necessary that the mining industry should guard against remote dangers. It might be said of any offending that the conviction of the offender should be a sufficient warning to others who might offend. The proper application of that principle is by a sentencing judge giving due emphasis to the question of general deterrence and the penalty which is set. The trial judge failed to do that in the present case.
	
	
	As far as specific deterrence is concerned, the Industrial Commission in Capral Aluminium had allowed that a court may disregard the element of specific deterrence if satisfied that the risk of re-offending is low or non-existent: at [77]. Although his Honour’s reasons in relation to specific deterrence were inadequate, it seems clear from the way his Honour described the accident both in the Trial Judgment and in his ROS when taken together with his reference to the appellant’s good character, unblemished record, and appropriate response to the injuries, that his Honour did not err when considering the issue of specific deterrence.
	
	
	Nevertheless, we would uphold this ground as far as his Honour dealt with general deterrence.
	


Ground 6:   Remorse and contrition


	
	The Attorney submitted that it was significant that the appellant had never expressed remorse for the offence and there was no evidence of it. The Attorney submitted that the trial judge appeared to have confused remorse for the consequences suffered by Mr McNab with remorse for the offence as referred to in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that ameliorative conduct towards the victim of a violent attack or mitigating harm to the environment when it has been unlawfully polluted by a defendant are relevant considerations in mitigation of penalty. The appellant submitted that, similarly, so are the taking of special measures to ensure the victim is not held back by his injuries and providing him with special consideration to ensure his injuries do not prevent him from obtaining advancement.
	
	
	In the ROS under the heading “Remorse” the trial judge said this:
	


14.   The Defendant has gone to considerable lengths to provide Mr McNab with extensive retraining and support with opportunity for career advancement within the company. I accept these measures as conduct consistent with the Defendant’s acceptance of responsibility for his injuries.


	
	Section 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  lists as a mitigating factor:
	


the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

(i)   the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii)   the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both).


	
	In his affidavit at the sentencing proceedings Mark Munro, the Operations Manager for Bulga Underground Operations said under the heading “Contrition”:
	


74.   On behalf of myself and Bulga I express our sincere regret and remorse for:

(a)   The incident and the resulting injury and trauma suffered by Mr McNab;

(b)   The impact on Mr McNab’s family and friends.


	
	However, Mr Munro’s cross-examination clarified that he was not speaking on behalf of the company and did not have the authority of the company to do so. The following evidence was given:
	


Q.   Now under the heading Contrition, you say that on behalf of yourself and Bulga, you express sincere regret. In as much as that paragraph refers to what you say there being on behalf of Bulga, what's the nature of your authority to make that statement on behalf of Bulga? Have you been authorised by the board of Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd or the board of Glencore Corporate, or whatever the parent company is, to express sincere regret and remorse in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 74?

A.   No. I haven't been given that express permission, if you like, but I talk about - when I talk about Bulga Underground Operations, I talk about the people I work with every day and Steve's work mates and friends and I'm sure I speak accurately when I say we all regret that incident.

Q.   But you're not speaking for the board?

A.   I haven't been given express permission from the board to make that statement but I am sure that they would -I wasn't given a letter saying you can say that.

Q.   Did you ask for one?

A.   No I didn't.

Q.   Now you say that you expressed sincere regret and remorse for the incident and the resulting injury and trauma suffered by Mr McNab and the impact on his family and friends. Do we understand from that that you are expressing remorse for the offence that has been found to have been committed by Bulga Underground Operations?

A.   No.

Q.   So you're not sorry that Bulga Underground Operations did not exercise the obligations upon it as required under the legislation?

A.   No. And Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd will be appealing this decision.


	
	The evidence disclosed, therefore, that the appellant had not in any way accepted responsibility for its actions. It had acknowledged the injury to Mr McNab and had made reparation for those injuries to the extent that it could. To the extent that Mr Munro was giving evidence on behalf of Bulga it must be concluded that no remorse was shown, and his final answer in cross-examination tended to show that the trial judge’s verdict was not accepted.
	
	
	What the appellant has done for Mr McNab is commendable but it cannot be said, overall, that the appellant has shown remorse by accepting responsibility for its failure.
	
	
	We would uphold this ground of appeal.
	


Manifest inadequacy and the residual discretion


	
	The Attorney submitted that whilst it was not possible to draw direct comparisons with cases in the field of occupational health and safety, the manifest inadequacy of the fine imposed upon the appellant is demonstrated when regard is had to the cases that were put forward where a defendant pleaded guilty to occupational health and safety offences.
	
	
	In relation to the residual discretion the Attorney pointed to the size of the appellant and to the fact that the penalty was a monetary one. The Attorney submitted that the errors in the sentencing process were significant and the trial judge was not led into error by the prosecution. For those reasons the Court should not exercise its residual discretion not to interfere.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that it has not been shown that the trial judge’s sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	In relation to the residual discretion the appellant drew attention to the burden on the Crown to negate any reason why the residual discretion should be exercised: see MB v Attorney General for NSW [2015] HCA 9 (MB) at [56]-[57]. The appellant also drew attention to the authorities that discuss the limited role for Crown appeals against sentence in such cases as Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 and R v DH & AH [2014] NSWCCA 326 at [17]-[18]. The appellant submitted that even if error was established a Crown appeal is not an appropriate vehicle for general correction of error. It was submitted that there is no matter of principle that needs to be established in this case.
	


Should the Court resentence?


	
	One of the issues for consideration in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 was the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. There is no such equivalent in relation to s 5D. However, similar issues arise because of the discretion given to the court in s 5D(1) to vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the court may seem proper. The High Court approved the analysis by Spigelman CJ in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 172 A Crim R 284 at [19] but went on to say that not all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer’s discretion: at [42]. The Court went on to say:
	


[43]   After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence.


	
	In the same way, if the court on a Crown appeal considers that an error has been shown that vitiates the exercise of the sentencer’s discretion, the court may vary the sentence. Of course, other factors operate before that course is followed on a Crown appeal because of the purpose of such an appeal and the residual discretion. In KB, JL and RJB, Bathurst CJ at [82] said that although there was prima facie error in sentencing the court retained a discretion under s 5D(1) with respect to varying the sentence.
	
	
	The first question for determination now that error has been shown is whether the errors identified in relation to the assessment of objective seriousness, general deterrence and remorse are such as to vitiate the sentencer’s discretion. In our opinion, the first two are significant matters and must be considered to have impacted upon the penalty imposed.
	
	
	On the matter of the residual discretion, the appellant correctly points out that the onus is on the Crown to negate any reason why the residual discretion not to interfere should be exercised: MB at [56]-[57].
	
	
	One matter put forward by the Attorney leads to the conclusion that the residual discretion should not be exercised, namely, that this is amongst the first of appeals to this Court from the exercise of the jurisdiction under the Act by the District Court. One of the errors identified by the Attorney was the failure of the trial judge to deal properly with the matter of general deterrence notwithstanding strong authority against his Honour’s approach from the Full Bench of the Industrial Commission. In those circumstances it is important that this Court express its approval of those decisions of the Industrial Commission to make the point that in matters of this nature general deterrence (and specific deterrence for that matter) will be significant considerations for a court in all but the most exceptional cases. That is so, notwithstanding that the legislation has changed since the time of the offending. The changes are not relevant to the issue of general deterrence and its importance when sentencing for these types of offences.
	
	
	Those circumstances mean that the present case is not simply one of correction of a trial judge’s error. In our opinion, the discretion in s 5D(1) should be exercised by this Court to re-sentence the appellant.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that if the Court came to re-sentence, the Court should have regard to the evidence of Mr Harvey who had been the mine’s Safety Systems Coordinator/Safety Systems Manager and Mr Munro to whom reference has already been made. Moreover the appellant pointed to the unchallenged findings by the trial judge in relation to its safety record. In addition, the trial judge found that the offence was neither deliberate nor reckless.
	
	
	A reading of Mr Harvey’s and Mr Munro’s affidavits amply justifies the conclusion of the trial judge that prior to the offence the appellant was acutely aware of and concerned with the safety of its operations. It had established and maintained a well-developed and robust health and safety management system and its record was unblemished. Nevertheless, the duties imposed on the employer under s 8 of the Act are onerous. The employer is to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all employees. The legislature regards breaches as serious as is shown by the maximum penalties provided in s 12 of the Act.
	
	
	Whilst the objective seriousness of the offence was below the mid-range it was not at the bottom of the range. Whilst the appellant’s systems, approach to safety and its record meant that the case was an exceptional one as far as specific deterrence was concerned, general deterrence was a matter of considerable significance. Further, the appellant’s lack of remorse for the incident which seemed to derive from a belief that it had done everything it reasonably should have, is a matter that must be reflected in the penalty.
	
	
	In our opinion and having in mind that the appellant is being resentenced after a successful Crown appeal the appropriate penalty is a fine of $100,000.
	


Costs


	
	In the costs judgment of 5 February 2015 the trial judge made the following findings (Costs Judgment):
	



	
	The prosecution succeeded without difficulty in establishing the first essential ingredient of the offence, namely that Mr McNab was exposed to the risk of being crushed by the advancing roof support: at [4];
	
	
	The prosecutor sought to establish the risk could have been eliminated by the following measures:
	



	
	reducing the speed at which the Shearer was being       advanced to reduce the incidence and speed of flyrock;
	
	
	requiring the drum operators to remain behind the last       advanced roof support;
	
	
	activating a time out switch on the remote control;
	
	
	activating a tilt switch on the remote control;
	
	
	employing the services of an additional miner, whose sole task was to observe the drum operators.
	



	
	An inordinate amount of time was spent at trial canvassing the practicality of activating the tilt switch mechanism and given that the appellant had adopted the practice of engaging the observer there was “never a live issue that the risk could have been averted by that reasonably practicable measure”: at [9].
	
	
	The substance of the defence was always foreseeability: at [10];
	
	
	The prosecutor’s public duty did not require her to raise issues other than the exposure of Mr McNab to the risk of being crushed by a roof support while incapacitated and that the risk should have been averted by an SAC: at [17].
	



	
	The trial judge found that the respondent failed to establish the first four of the measures in (b) above.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal relied upon by both the respondent and the Attorney were as follows:
	


1.   In the Judgment as to costs, his Honour ordered that the defendant pay only 20% of the prosecutor's costs on the apparent basis that the prosecutor had succeeded on one of five particulars of the offence. This was wrong in principle.

2.   His Honour failed to take account of the fact that virtually no time in the trial was spent on the particulars that were not found to have been proved.

3.   His Honour gave little or no weight to the fact that much of the time taken in the trial was given over to the defendant's case and the defendant's attempt to prove that the risk was unforeseeable, a matter upon which the defendant had the onus of proof and in respect of which his Honour found against the defendant.

4.   The appellant contends that his Honour was in error when he found that insofar as the prosecutor had pleaded as a measure, that the defendant ought to have adopted to ensure health and safety, the activation of the tilt switch on the shearer's remote controls and therefore his Honour was in error when he apportioned no costs for that part of the prosecutor's case that related to that measure.

5.   The costs order of his Honour had the effect of denying the prosecutor full costs for the sentencing proceedings and limited costs for those proceedings to only 20%.

6.   As a result of the errors set out above the costs order of the trial judge was wrong in principle and ought to be varied to an order that the prosecutor have costs for all of the proceedings or for such portion thereof as this honourable court deems proper.


	
	It should first be noted that a substantial portion of the submissions from both parties on costs at the hearing of the appeal concerned the notice of contention where the respondent sought to have the trial judge’s findings concerning the tilt switch reversed. In the light of our conclusion at [134] we have not further considered those submissions.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that his Honour must have awarded only 20% of costs to be paid to the respondent because only one of five particulars had been found proved. The respondent submitted that the trial judge fell into error in assessing the time spent on the various aspects of the prosecution case during the trial. In fact very little time was spent at the trial on particulars 2, 3(b) and 4: see above at [25]. The respondent submitted that the costs order failed to reflect that the prosecution ought to have received the whole of its costs in respect of the sentence proceedings in which the appellant pressed for and was unsuccessful in achieving the non-recording of a conviction.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the trial judge paid little regard to the public duty that a prosecutor has to put all material issues before the Court. Reliance was placed on what Biscoe J said in Morrison v Defence Maritime Services Ltd [2007] NSWLEC 552; 156 LGERA 365 (Morrison).
	
	
	The respondent submitted that in any event the trial judge made no reference to the costs of the sentence hearing and that it should be inferred that the trial judge overlooked the costs of those sentence proceedings. The appellant was unsuccessful at those proceedings in persuading the trial judge not to record a conviction.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that an appeal by a prosecutor against a costs order may only be made with the leave of this Court (s 5AA(1A) of the Criminal Appeal Act) and leave should not be granted. The appellant submitted that a decision as to costs is a discretionary decision. A requirement for leave means that an applicant must show that there is a question involved either of injustice which is reasonably clear, in the sense of going beyond what is merely arguable, or that there is an issue of principle or a question of general importance. The respondent’s grounds of appeal on costs advance no issue of principle, no question of general importance or no injustice which is reasonably clear.
	
	
	The appellant conceded, correctly in our view, that s 5DB(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act confers jurisdiction on this Court to hear the Attorney’s appeal against the costs order. No leave is required under that section because of the definition of “sentence” in s 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. That definition includes under paragraph (h) any order for the payment of costs made by the court of trial. The result of that removes any force in the appellant’s submissions at [214] above that require something more than error to be shown before leave will be given to the respondent.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the 20% apportionment was not reached by way of a simplistic division of acts and omissions by five. This was because the judge abjured mathematical precision, he took into account all four particulars as to risk and all five particulars as to acts and omissions, he considered the particulars which did not go to trial after amendment to the summons, and the particular of the risk of being crushed was not found in those terms.
	
	
	The appellant took issue with the grounds of appeal that concerned the time spent on particular issues. However, the appellant accepted that time at the hearing was occupied by the appellant’s case that the risk found proven was not foreseeable.
	
	
	Costs are discretionary. To succeed in overturning a costs order an appellant needs to show an error of the House v The King type: see also Maiden v Maiden [1909] HCA 16; 7 CLR 727 at 742. The trial judge is ordinarily in the best position to make an assessment of the time and importance of different issues where a party has succeeded on some and failed on others and where costs are apportioned by the judge. It will be difficult for an appellate court to decide on matters of apportionment simply by examining a transcript or by having regard to written submissions in the court below.
	
	
	The principles relating to apportionment of costs in civil cases are conveniently summarised in James v Surf Rd Nominees Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 296 as follows:
	


[32]   The effect of Pt 52A r 11 is that an unsuccessful party may be ordered to pay the entirety of the costs of the successful party, even though the successful party did not succeed on all issues. However, as is specified by the rule itself, the Court is entitled to make a different order. That may occur where there are multiple issues involved. This was the subject of comment in Waters v P C Henderson (Aust) Pty Ltd (unreported CA (NSW) Kirby P, Mahoney and Priestley JJA, 6 July 1994) where Mahoney JA said:

Where the proceedings involve multiple issues the application of the rule that costs follow the event may involve hardship where a party succeeds on some issues and yet fails on others. Particularly is this so where, for example, a defendant succeeds on issues that occupied the bulk of the time taken by the proceedings. Nevertheless, unless a particular issue or group of issues is clearly dominant or separable, it will ordinarily be appropriate to award the costs of the proceedings to the successful party without attempting to differentiate between those particular issues on which it was successful and those on which it failed.

[33] Similarly, Toohey J made the following observations in Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (1986) ATPR 40–748:

1. Ordinarily, costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives his costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order.

2. Where a litigant has succeeded only upon a portion of his claim, the circumstances may make it reasonable that he bear the expense of litigating that portion upon which he has failed.

3. A successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered as well to pay the party’s costs of them. In this sense, “issue” does not mean a precise issue in the technical pleading sense but any disputed question of fact or of law. (references omitted)

[34] Where a matter involves multiple issues and the question before the court is whether it should make some other order as to costs other than the order that costs follow the event, a distinction is commonly drawn between cases which involve clearly discrete issues for determination, and those in which all issues are inseparable, or at least sufficiently linked, with respect to the overall disposition of a particular matter. In Permanent Trustee Aust Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (unreported, NSWSC, 3 June 1998), Hodgson CJ in Eq noted that the obvious examples of a matter involving discrete issues is one where a plaintiff makes separate claims for different relief, or a claim by a plaintiff and a cross-claim by a defendant. Another example is where a respondent is successful in having an appeal against an earlier decision dismissed, but for reasons other than those raised in the respondent’s Notice of Contention. This is not to say that so-called “discrete issues”, for the purposes of apportioning costs, only exist in cases where there are separate claims made within a single matter. As Toohey J stated in the passage quoted at [33] above, it can relate to “any disputed question of fact or law” before a court on which a party fails, notwithstanding that they are otherwise successful in terms of the ultimate outcome of the matter.

[35] In Madden v Connell [2001] NSWSC 1051, Hamilton J referred to there being a “rule” that where there are “discrete issues and the time taken on each issue at the hearing can be identified or realistically estimated”, an order for costs may be made against the party which fails on such issues, or alternatively, that party may be deprived of its costs for that portion of the matter. In the Court’s opinion it is preferable not to speak in terms of “rules”. However, the underlying approach to the “rule” stated by his Honour may be an available approach to the exercise of the court’s discretion as to costs in a particular case, depending upon all of the circumstances.

[36] Where the court does exercise its discretion to apportion costs, the apportionment itself involves the exercise of discretion. As Gummow, French and Hill JJ recognised in Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Industries Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 261:

Where there is a mixed outcome in proceedings, the question of apportionment is very much a matter of discretion for the trial judge. Mathematical precision is illusory and the exercise of the discretion will often depend upon matters of impression and evaluation.


	
	These principles are also applicable to criminal proceedings with the qualifications discussed in Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59; 170 CLR 534 at 544, 565, 568-569: see also Morrison at [18]. A particular consideration in a criminal matter is that emphasised by Biscoe J in  Morrison at [20]:
	


When considering apportionment of costs in civil litigation, a balance has to be maintained between not discouraging litigants from canvassing all material issues and not rewarding them for unreasonable conduct in the pursuit of issues. That balance is even more important in a criminal case where a prosecutor has a public duty to put all material issues before the court.


	
	The Costs Judgment in the present case provides only minimal reasons for the order ultimately made. The following findings may be discerned:
	



	
	(a)   The prosecution succeeded without difficulty in establishing the first essential ingredient of the offence, namely, that Mr McNab was exposed to the risk of being crushed by the advancing roof support: at [4];
	
	
	(b)   Three ways the prosecutor put forward to eliminate the risk were impractical. The fourth way (the tilt switch) was highly contentious. The simpler and obvious measure was the measure adopted by the appellant – the SAC: at [9], [12];
	
	
	(c)   The substance of the defence was foreseeability. Failure by the appellant on that issue meant an inevitable finding that the offence was proved: at [10];
	
	
	(d)   The prosecutor’s public duty required that she only raise for determination issues that Mr McNab was exposed to the risk of being crushed whilst incapacitated, and that the risk should have been averted by employing an SAC: at [17];
	
	
	(e)   The appellant should not pay the costs of the prosecutor in preparing her case in respect of particulars which did not go to trial: at [18];
	
	
	(f)   Mathematical precision is not possible but the appellant should pay only 20% of the prosecutor’s costs not referable to the particulars which did not go to trial: at [18].
	



	
	The matter referred to in (e) is that the original summons filed by the prosecutor on 20 April 2012 pleaded different failures on the appellant’s part from those contained in the amended summons filed 12 October 2012 which was the case ultimately pursued by the prosecutor. The trial did not commence until 26 May 2014. It seems somewhat unlikely that costs referable to the original form of the summons were significant.
	
	
	A few other matters should be noted from the Costs Judgment. First, there is no reference to the sentence proceedings at all. Whilst some of the appellant’s submissions made at that hearing were accepted by the trial judge (on deterrence and remorse) the appellant was ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining a s 10 order. That was significant. The failure of the trial judge to mention the sentence proceedings is a failure to take account of a relevant consideration. Error is demonstrated.
	
	
	Secondly, as far as can be ascertained from the trial judge’s reasons, the awarding of only 20% of the respondent’s costs appears to be related to the failure of the respondent to succeed on all but one of the suggested methods to avoid the risk that was established. Other factors may have influenced the assessment (although not the issue of the particulars which did not go to trial from the original summons) but the trial judge did not say what they were.
	
	
	Thirdly, what the trial judge did note of significance was that the key issue in the defence was foreseeability, proof of which would inevitably result in proof of the offence. In that regard it should be remembered that a successful party should not be deprived of costs unless there is material to justify a contrary order being made: Milne v Attorney-General for the State of Tasmania [1956] HCA 48; 95 CLR 460 at 477. The only matter identified by the trial judge appears to be what appears at [221] (b) above.
	
	
	Fourthly, the trial judge said (Costs Judgment at [9]):
	


In circumstances where the defendant itself suggested and adopted the reasonably practicable measure of engaging an additional miner as an observer there was never a live issue that the risk could have been averted by that reasonably practicable means.


	
	The respondent submitted that his Honour was wrong so to conclude.
	
	
	What the trial judge said in that regard does not appear to be borne out by the appellant’s written submissions at trial paras [400]-[410] with this conclusion at [410]:
	


For these reasons, the Court should conclude that it would not have been reasonably practicable for the Defendant to have implemented the measure proposed by the Prosecutor in particular 3(c).


	
	The appellant submitted that the trial judge’s statement is correct if the words “reasonably practicable” are omitted. That, however, tends to provide support for the respondent’s submission. The appellant accepted that the “reasonably practicable” aspect of the matter was related to foreseeability, and that was (as the trial judge said: Costs Judgment at [10]) “the substance of the defence”. As noted earlier, the appellant accepted that time was taken at the hearing on the issue of foreseeability. The respondent’s submission should be accepted.
	
	
	Whilst it may be accepted that, when apportioning costs, mathematical precision is not possible (as the trial judge observed: Costs Judgment at [18]) it is incumbent on the decision maker to identify the considerations which led him or her to apportion in a particular manner. The failure to give reasons in that regard will amount to error. The appellant’s submissions suggesting reasons why the proof of one out of five particulars was not the basis for the 20% should be rejected. The statement concerning mathematical precision is merely a well iterated statement from a number of authorities, the particulars that did not go to trial were the subject of a separate costs order unrelated to the 20% apportionment, and the finding of the risk in the terms identified explains nothing about the 20% apportionment.
	
	
	In the present case, the only possible conclusions are that the 20% was reached by reference to the five methods advanced by the respondent, or that it was reached by reference to matters not identified by the trial judge. In either case, error is established.
	
	
	It is necessary, therefore, for this Court to re-exercise the discretion. In exercising that discretion, some weight must be given to the evaluation made by the trial judge of the time particular issues took in terms of evidence and submission. We note, in that regard, that in the Costs Judgment, the trial judge said:
	


[9]   An inordinate amount of time was spent during the hearing canvassing the practicality of activating the tilt switch.


	
	We note further that the trial judge said:
	


[4]   In the present case the prosecution without difficulty succeeded in establishing the first essential ingredient of the offence, namely, that Mr McNab was exposed to the risk of being crushed by the advancing roof support.


	
	Other matters for consideration are these:
	



	
	The respondent was successful in establishing a breach of the Act;
	
	
	The significance of the issue of foreseeability;
	
	
	The respondent failed in demonstrating that four proposed methods were reasonably practicable;
	
	
	The summons was amended at a relatively early stage to change the basis of the case being put forward by the respondent;
	
	
	The respondent was successful at the sentencing hearing in resisting the appellant’s application for a s 10 discharge, and having a penalty imposed.
	



	
	Taking into account the matters in [230] and [231] above and having regard to the principles earlier discussed, we consider that the proper order is that the appellant should pay 50% of the respondent’s costs. There is no reason that the appellant should not pay the respondent’s costs of appeal.
	


orders


	
	In the result, we would make the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal dismissed;
	
	
	Appeal against penalty allowed;
	
	
	Order that in lieu of the penalty imposed by the trial judge, a penalty of $100 000 be imposed on the appellant;
	
	
	Grant the respondent leave to appeal against the costs order made by the trial judge;
	
	
	Allow the appeal against the costs order;
	
	
	Order that the appellant pay 50% of the respondent’s costs in the court below.

2768965,Raniga v R [2016] NSWCCA 36,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ AT CL:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   The Applicant pleaded guilty to one count of possess unauthorised firearm contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) on 11 March 2014 at Central Local Court. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of three years. The standard non-parole period for the offence was increased to four years from 21 August 2015.
	
	
	Three matters were placed on a Form 1 Schedule:
	


(a)   Possess ammunition without holding a licence/permit or authority – the maximum penalty is 50 penalty units ($5,500.00);

(b)   Possess or use a prohibited weapon without a permit (two counts) – maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of three years.


	
	The Applicant was sentenced by her Honour Judge Wells SC in the District Court on 23 January 2015 to a non-parole period of three years commencing 1 July 2013 and expiring 30 June 2016 with a balance of term of one year and six months expiring 31 December 2017.
	
	
	In the Notice of Appeal the Applicant sought leave to appeal against the sentence on one ground only, namely, that the sentence was manifestly excessive. At the hearing of the appeal the Applicant was given leave to add a further ground as follows:
	


The learned sentencing judge erred in assessing the index offence as being at the upper end of the mid range of objective seriousness.

The parties indicated that they sought to rely only on the submissions already filed in respect of this new ground.

The facts of the offending


	
	The Sentencing Judge had before her a Crown case statement setting out the facts. Objection was taken to some of the material in that statement but ultimately the Sentencing Judge considered the following facts from that statement related to the offending.
	
	
	By the middle of 2013 there was animosity between members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club and the Comanchero Motorcycle Club. In July 2013 the accused, Suvat Sarmisakliglu, was the president of the Sydney Chapter of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club. The co-accused, Ashoor Khaie and the Applicant were ""prospect"" members of that club.
	
	
	A member's position in the club's hierarchy determines the extent to which he is under the control of the organisation and members who are senior to him. Before becoming a full member of the club a member must be a prospect. A prospect is required to perform duties such as tending the clubhouse bar, cleaning the clubhouse, performing security and attending to the needs of full members. A prospect is required to hold this status for a minimum period of 12 months and is subject to the direction of a full member. Failure to comply with the direction of a full member is grounds for a wide range of penalties. These range from fines to expulsion from the club.
	
	
	At about 10:40pm on 1 July 2013, police were travelling in an unmarked, serialised police vehicle, eastbound, on Parramatta Road, Camperdown. Police were travelling in lane 2 of 3 of the carriageway when they saw Sarmisakliglu's black Mercedes four-wheel-drive, registration CDW 09X, travelling behind a Toyota Tarago Premier taxi, registration T5901 in lane 3, closest to the centre of the road. The two vehicles were travelling in convoy.
	
	
	Police moved into lane 3, behind the Mercedes, which was still behind the taxi. As they approached the intersection of Missenden Road, where a 4th right hand turn lane is designated on Parramatta Road, police saw the taxi continue driving in lane 3. About 10 to 20 metres past the commencement of the right-hand turn lane, the taxi indicated and moved into it, followed, somewhat erratically, by the Mercedes. Police followed the two vehicles into the right-hand turn lane and all three vehicles came to a stop at a red traffic light at the Missenden Road Intersection.
	
	
	Police activated their siren and pulled the taxi over on Carillon Avenue. Police requested that the front passenger, Ashoor Khaie, get out of the taxi. The Applicant who was sitting in the rear of the taxi was also removed. The taxi driver, Mr Izzet Ozturk, was escorted away from the taxi. While being escorted he told police, ""They put something in the boot, I don't know what it was"".
	
	
	Police then obtained identification details from the Applicant and Khaie and told them they and the taxi would be searched. They were spoken to and searched.
	
	
	Police opened the boot of the taxi and found a green rifle bag. Inside a side pocket of the bag, they found a plastic bag containing 7.62 x 39mm calibre rounds of ammunition and 15 x 5.56 x 45mm calibre cartridges. Upon opening the rifle bag, police found a purple towel within which was wrapped:
	



	
	a 7.62 x 39mm calibre Chinese manufactured SKS model self-loading rifle, serial number 8903811. The rifle was unregistered and is a prohibited firearm as defined in clause 5 of schedule 1 of the Firearms Act; and
	
	
	two unknown manufacture detachable box magazines - one containing 30 rounds of ammunition and the other containing 27 rounds.
	



	
	At Newtown police station, police offered the Applicant the opportunity to participate in an ERISP but, after initially agreeing to this, he said he did not feel comfortable about doing an electronically recorded interview. Police then explained that they would ask some questions which would be recorded in their notebook. When asked how long he had been a Hells Angel, the Applicant replied ""about a year as a prospect"". When asked if he knew the gun was in the boot of the car, the Applicant replied ""we wanted to go hunting”. Police asked ""so you knew the gun was in the car” to which the Applicant said ""No, I don't know what they put in there"".
	
	
	The Applicant has since supplied a statement indicating that the rifle was put there by him and that he wanted to go hunting. The Sentencing Judge noted that the Applicant did not provide any details as to what it was he proposed hunting or the circumstances of such hunting.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded beyond reasonable doubt that, in all the circumstances of the Applicant’s apprehension including his being part of the Hells Angels outlaw motor cycle group and the fact that he was travelling in a convoy with a senior officer of that club, when he told the police he wanted to go hunting it was untrue, and his possession of the weapon was not for some innocent purpose but was in some way connected with his involvement with that outlaw motor cycle group.
	
	
	Her Honour noted the Applicant’s statement of 30 August 2013 where he said that the others had no knowledge of the weapon. However, the circumstances of their travelling in convoy and the fact that the item was placed in the boot of the taxi in what clearly appeared to be a rifle bag caused her Honour to have grave doubts about his claim that the others knew nothing of the weapon at all. Her Honour noted also that the taxi driver described the circumstances in which he was hired to drive the group. When he arrived at the front of the property he saw the men all standing around together and he realised that something was placed in the boot.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing proceedings. Her Honour was provided with a pre-sentence report. That report disclosed that he was the second of five children born and brought up in a stable and supportive environment. However, five years before the offending he was asked to leave the family home due to his abuse of illicit substances.
	
	
	The Applicant first became associated with the Hells Angels in January 2012 as a prospect and became a club member in March 2014. He told the Community Corrections Officer that he discontinued his Club membership in June 2014.
	
	
	Since completing the High School Certificate he has largely been unemployed except for a position as a furniture removalist for eight months and some other short term casual employment.
	
	
	The Applicant told the Community Corrections Officer that he was under the influence of cannabis at the time of the offence, having smoked a quarter of an ounce shortly beforehand. He told her that he commenced using illicit substances in June 2012, regularly using cocaine, ecstasy and GHB. He ceased using GHB in November 2012 but commenced using methamphetamine. He had developed a daily habit and had also commenced the use of non-prescribed benzodiazepines. By April 2013 he had identified methamphetamine as problematic. He ceased using it and replaced it with daily use of cannabis.
	
	
	He told the Officer that he drank alcohol about three times per week to intoxication. He also said that he was gambling approximately $800 per day at the TAB and on poker machines. He saw that this had become a problem for him. He also told the Community Corrections Officer that he could now see that his association with the Hells Angels was a backward step.
	
	
	The Applicant was convicted of two counts of robbery in company in December 2007. He was initially given a four year section 9 bond but on a Crown appeal he received an overall sentence of nine months non-parole with a balance of term of one year and three months (the sentencing judge mistakenly referred to a non-parole period of six months).
	
	
	Since going into custody in respect of the present offence the Applicant has had a number of breaches for intimidation, disobeying directions, damaging property and other prison infractions.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	Her Honour characterised the objective seriousness of the offence as being at the upper end of the mid-range of objective seriousness. In the Applicant’s favour her Honour found that the weapon may only have been in his possession for a short time and that its condition when it was found meant that it did not present an immediate threat.
	
	
	However, her Honour said that one matter that made the offence particularly serious was the Applicant’s connection with a criminal organisation that was well known for its engagement in criminal activity of a highly violent kind where the lives of innocent members of the public might be endangered. Her Honour said there was a clear inference that such a weapon could have been used in connection with potential criminal activities although there was no direct evidence of any particular crime at that time being committed.
	
	
	Further, although the weapon was not loaded, ammunition for the weapon was found in the same bag. The weapon was a military type weapon that could inflict serious harm on other people if misused.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge noted that the Applicant had written a letter to the court explaining that his time in custody had led him to change his attitude towards his past activities and that the experience has been something of a wake-up call. He accepted that he had made some poor decisions in the past. Her Honour commented that what the Applicant said in that regard had to be given limited weight because he had not given it in sworn evidence nor been subject to questioning about it. Her Honour said also that the worth of the letter was further diminished by his institutional offences in prison.
	
	
	Her Honour stressed that both general and specific deterrence were significant in the sentencing process in this matter. Her Honour thought the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, in the light of his criminal history and his institutional behaviour, must be guarded.
	
	
	Her Honour accorded a discount of 25% for his early plea and she found special circumstances to a small extent because of his need for ongoing supervision once released.
	


Submissions


	
	The two appeal grounds are considered together because one basis for the assertion that the sentence was manifestly excessive is the Sentencing Judge’s assessment of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The Applicant pointed to the notional starting point for the sentence as one of six years with a non-parole period of four years against a standard non-parole period of three years. Whilst accepting the limited usefulness of statistics the Applicant pointed to the JIRS statistics from January 2008 to December 2014 for offences against s 7(1) of the Firearms Act. There were 71 offenders, 59 of whom were sentenced to full time imprisonment. Of those, 27 offenders were sentenced to non-consecutive terms. One received a six month non-parole period, two a 12 month non-parole period, nine an 18 month period, nine a 24 month period, three a 30 month period, two a 36 month period and one a 42 month period. The mid-point was said to be 24 months.
	
	
	All but one of those 27 offenders pleaded guilty. Eight were sentenced for one offence only and seven had matters taken into account on a Form 1. Of those eight offenders, two had a non-parole period of 18 months, five had a non-parole period of 24 months and one had a non-parole period of 30 months. The Applicant submitted, therefore, that he had been sentenced to a non-parole period that exceeded any of the non-parole periods imposed for offenders in a similar situation.
	
	
	On the assessment by her Honour of the objective seriousness of the offence as being at the upper end of the mid-range the Applicant submitted that a survey of cases indicated that the objective seriousness of the Applicant's offence was no higher than those who received lesser sentences. The Applicant relied on a number of decisions said to be comparable which showed that the Applicant’s offending was significantly lower than the offending in those cases. Those cases were R v Farrell [2015] NSWCCA 68; El Masri v R [2014] NSWCCA 13; Atkinson v R [2014] NSWCCA 262; Bejanov v R [2013] NSWCCA 207 and Satuala Nanai v R [2012] NSWCCA 141. The Applicant also relied in particular on Van Vinh Cao v R [2013] NSWCCA 321 and Thalari v R [2009] NSWCCA 170; (2009) 75 NSWLR 307 concerning matters that can properly be taken into account in assessing objective seriousness of offences against s 7(1) of the Firearms Act.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the finding of objective seriousness involved the exercise of discretion. Reference was made to Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 and Kiernan v R [2016] NSWCCA 12.
	
	
	In relation to the statistics the Crown pointed out that neither the underlying factors nor the subjective features of the cases forming the basis of the statistics were disclosed. In that way the statistics were of no utility in determining that the sentence imposed was excessive. The Crown analysed the cases relied upon by the Applicant to show why they were of little assistance in the matter.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to a number of aspects of the case identified by the Sentencing Judge which indicated that the sentence was not unreasonable or plainly unjust. These included the Applicant’s connection with the outlaw motorcycle group, the real potential for a weapon such as was found to cause damage by falling into the wrong hands or of being misused, the Applicant’s continuing disregard and disobedience for authority in prison and the inability of the Applicant to grasp the seriousness of his actions. The Crown further pointed to the seriousness of the offence reflected in both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period.
	


Determination


	
	The categorisation of the objective seriousness of an offence is only reviewable on appeal on the principles set out in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; Kiernan at [48]; and Mulato at [37] and [46].
	
	
	The Applicant failed to identify what the error was said to be in relation to the assessment of objective seriousness. General submissions were made that her Honour was not justified in finding the offending as being at the upper end of the mid-range of objective seriousness, and that the Applicant’s level of objective seriousness was no higher than other offenders in cases relied upon by the Applicant where such offenders had received lesser sentences than the Applicant. These matters do not, of themselves, demonstrate error.
	
	
	In Thalari matters that were said to be relevant to be taken into account on the present offence were the connection with drug supply (at [86] and [89]), whether the firearm was loaded and whether the offender possessed other ammunition (at [88]) and whether the serial number had been obliterated (at [89]). Whether a loaded firearm was possessed for an offender’s own protection was not a matter of significance (at [88]). The Court emphasised that general and specific deterrence were particularly relevant matters for such offences (at [92] and [93]).
	
	
	In Cao Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Simpson and Hall JJ agreed) said:
	


[32]   The firearm offences also involved a significant level of criminality. In Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240 Johnson J (with whom Bathurst CJ and James J agreed) at [64] - [73] referred to the policy reasons behind s 7(1) Firearms Act 1989 and matters relevant to the seriousness of the offence. His Honour said that the use or purpose of possession of an unlicensed firearm - particularly where it is connected with criminal activities - was regarded as a key factor in assessing the seriousness of offences contrary to the Act.

[33]   In R v Dusan Krstic [2005] NSWCCA 391 Latham J (with whom Sully and RS Hulme JJ agreed) said at [14]:

14 ... In any event, accepting the applicant's argument for present purposes, possession of a loaded gun for one's own protection is not a matter of significant, if any mitigation, since the policy of the legislature evinced by the enactment of the offence and a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment is to deter and punish possession of firearms per se. ...

[34]   Part of the rationale behind s7(1) was explained by R S Hulme J (with whom in Beazley JA and Latham J agreed) in R v Najem [2008] NSWCCA 32 at [40]:

40 ... That rationale includes at least a recognition that firearms and pistols, if possessed, are liable to be used, and if used, are liable to be a source of great danger or damage. It includes also a recognition that not all persons can be relied on to avoid or minimise such danger and not misuse the weapons and that misuse, even without discharge, is liable to amount to a great infringement of others' rights.

[35]   This Court has said on a number of occasions that an offender's criminality is more serious where he or she possesses a firearm as part of their involvement in crimes, such as trading in illegal drugs. In R v Amurao [2005] NSWCCA 32 at [69] RS Hulme J said:

69 ... It behoves the Courts to discourage any tendency for such objects to become just tools of trade for those whose activities are outside the law.

This is particularly so in relation to the possession of a concealed weapon such as the key-ring pistol which was not capable of lawful use.


	
	Her Honour was well justified in coming to the view that the Applicant’s connection with the outlaw motorcycle gang made the offence particularly serious. In addition, although the weapon was not loaded, the ammunition was nearby and the weapon could have been rendered lethal within a very short period of time.
	
	
	In Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240 a loaded pistol was found in connection with drugs, money and ammunition. Justice Johnson (with whom Bathurst CJ and James J agreed) said that those matters supported the sentencing judge’s conclusion that the offence was “well within the upper range of objective seriousness for offences” under that section (see at [70]).
	
	
	I do not consider that any error has been established in relation to the Sentencing Judge’s assessment of the offences being at the upper end of the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	In relation to the statistics, this Court has said many times that the use of statistics is a blunt tool. The Crown’s submission that, without knowing the underlying factors nor the subjective circumstances of the offenders in those cases mean that the statistics are of little utility, should be accepted. Further, as Johnson J pointed out in Thalari at [94] the sentencing statistics for s 7(1) offences may not provide any assistance when there are significant offences to be taken into account on a Form 1. Two of the offences in the present case taken into account carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of three years.
	
	
	In relation to the Applicant’s reliance on what were said to be comparative cases, in Huynh v R [2008] NSWCCA 216 Johnson J (with whom Allsop P and Price J agreed) said at [61]:
	


[61]   … The practice of approaching sentencing appeals by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases, is neither helpful nor supported by authority: R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371; R v George (2004) 149 A Crim R 38 at 47 [48]-[49].

See also in that regard Dang v R [2014] NSWCCA 47 at [55], Pham v R [2014] NSWCCA 1115 at [57] and Vandeventer v R [2013] NSWCCA 33 at [45].


	
	Not the least reason for that statement of principle is that sentencing is an instinctive process and not a mechanical one. The process does not involve a comparison of similar cases where the sentence for the case at hand is increased or decreased for the differences that can be found. Certainly, the instinctive process is informed to some extent by comparative cases but the correctness of a particular sentence, when being reviewed in a higher court, is seldom determined by examining those comparative cases to see how the sentence in question fits with the sentence in those cases. At best, those cases provide a range of what has been thought appropriate in the past, but that range must be measured against the maximum penalty and, if applicable, any standard non-parole period prescribed: see also Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [303] – [304], a passage approved by the plurality in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [54].
	
	
	The cases relied upon by the Applicant show a range of sentences for a range of different facts. I have read all of those cases, but it is not necessary to summarise nor analyse them. It is sufficient to note that there are some similarities with the present case in some of those cases and there are also differences. A reading of those cases only emphasises that the sentence imposed in the present case was either in that range of past cases or was sufficiently similar to that range that it cannot be said that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	


Conclusion


	
	Ordinarily the Court would, where all grounds are rejected, grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal, so that finality is achieved. However, the co-accused Ashoor Khaie has been convicted but not yet sentenced for his involvement in the offence charged against the Applicant. Having regard to what was said in Lowe v R [2015] NSWCCA 46 and Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 305 I consider that the appropriate course is to refuse leave to appeal.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose the following order:
	



	
	Leave to appeal refused.

2768966,Bobbin v R [2016] NSWCCA 38,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	WILSON J: Brendon Charles Bobbin (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge McLoughlin SC, sitting in the District Court at Sydney, on 26 September 2014. Sentences were imposed for two offences, being one count of knowingly take part in the supply of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (amphetamine), and one count of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug (amphetamine). The former is an offence contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment; a standard non parole period (“SNPP”) of 10 years attaches to that offence. The latter offence is contrary to s 25A(1) of the same Act and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	With respect to the first of the offences, to which the applicant entered a plea of guilty on indictment before the District Court, the applicant was sentenced to a term of 3 years and 9 months imprisonment, commencing on 22 August 2013, and expiring on 21 May 2017. A non-parole period (“NPP”) of 2 years and 6 months was fixed, which expires on 21 February 2016. Despite the lateness of the entry of the plea, the sentencing judge granted the applicant a discount on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed of 25%, to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea.
	
	
	For the second offence, to which the applicant entered a plea of guilty when the matter was before the Local Court, a term of 3 years imprisonment was imposed, commencing on 20 February 2016 and expiring on 19 February 2019. A NPP of 1 year was fixed, which expires on 19 February 2017. A discount on sentence of 25% was awarded, to reflect the utilitarian value of the early plea.
	
	
	The overall term of imprisonment is a term of 5 years, 5 months and 28 days, with a NPP of 3 years, 5 months and 29 days. The earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 19 February 2017.
	
	
	A finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) was made by the sentencing judge in the applicant’s favour. The overall NPP of 3 years, 5 months and 29 days represents 63.6% of the overall sentence.
	
	
	Two summary charges of possession of a prohibited drug (amphetamine and cannabis respectively) contrary to s 10 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) were before the sentencing court on a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), and were dealt with by the sentencing judge pursuant to s 167 of the same Act, after the applicant entered pleas of guilty. Pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act convictions were recorded for each offence but no other penalty was imposed.
	
	
	A co-offender who, common to the applicant, was charged with one count of supply of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (amphetamine), received a sentence in identical terms to that imposed on the applicant for the first offence.
	
	
	By a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal filed (out of time) on 13 October 2015, the applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on two grounds,
	



	
	“The learned sentencing judge erred in not properly giving effect to the principle of totality”; and
	
	
	“The overall sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.”
	


The Facts of the Offences


	
	The following account of the facts of the applicant’s crimes has been drawn from the remarks of the sentencing judge.
	
	
	In July 2013 a strike force was established by police to investigate the supply of prohibited drugs in the areas of Pambula and Eden in southern New South Wales. As part of the investigation a telephone service used by the applicant was lawfully intercepted, and his communications were monitored. The applicant was also the subject of physical surveillance by police officers.
	
	
	Some 35 telephone calls and 113 text messages between the applicant and his co-offender, Paul Matthew Howard, were intercepted and recorded between mid-July and mid-August 2013. The communications concerned the supply of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Some of the intercepted communications related to travel between New South Wales and Victoria by the wife of the applicant’s co-offender, with transport and accommodation for her facilitated or paid for by the applicant. Other communications concerned the processing of amphetamine for supply, which took place in a motel room the applicant booked and paid for.
	
	
	In late July 2013, the applicant and his co-offender met at two locations in southern New South Wales. The meetings were arranged to discuss plans to obtain a quantity of prohibited drugs in Sydney which it was intended would be sold both in the Pambula area and interstate in Victoria. Subsequently, and in furtherance of these plans, the applicant arranged for transport for the co-offender’s wife from Sydney to Victoria and back by a truck operated by the applicant’s trucking business, and for the payment of money to an impecunious Paul Howard in Sydney, to assist him to cover his expenses when obtaining amphetamine there. He also paid for motel accommodation for the applicant’s wife.
	
	
	On 11 August 2013, Paul Howard advised the applicant that the job was “done”, and that he was “leaving [Sydney] today”. That communication signified that Howard was in possession of an amount of amphetamine, and was returning to the south coast. Numerous communications were exchanged (and intercepted) on this subject.
	
	
	Early on the morning of the following day, 12 August 2013, police stopped a vehicle travelling south on the Princes Highway at Bega. The car was occupied by Paul Howard and his wife. When informed that the officers planned to search the car for drugs, Howard told them there was a large quantity of “speed” in the vehicle. A quantity of white powder was subsequently found. This powder was later analysed and determined to be 428 grams of amphetamine with a purity of 10.5%. The estimated value of the drug if sold was $40,000.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 22 August 2013. He refused to be interviewed.
	
	
	It was the applicant’s involvement in the acquisition of 428 grams of amphetamine which gave rise to the first charge of being knowingly concerned in the supply of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	The second charge against the applicant,that of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug, arose from analysis of some of the telephone communications the applicant had with other persons during the period when his telephone was intercepted.
	
	
	On 13 July 2013, the applicant spoke to and exchanged text messages with a male person, arranging to supply the male with an “eight ball”, or 3.5 grams of amphetamine.
	
	
	On the same day the applicant was in telephone communication with another male, making arrangements to leave an identical quantity of amphetamine at a particular location on the Princes Highway. The male later advised the applicant that he had collected the drug without difficulty.
	
	
	On 15 July 2013 the applicant was recorded in communication with another male person, arranging to supply that individual with 3.5 grams of amphetamine.
	
	
	On 19 July 2013 the applicant made a similar arrangement for the supply of 3.5 grams of amphetamine to another male. The drugs were delivered by the applicant to the male at business premises in Pambula.
	
	
	On 25 July 2013 the applicant communicated with another male person, discussing the supply of and payment for 3.5 grams of amphetamine.
	
	
	The applicant received a financial reward for each of these supplies.
	
	
	The applicant’s criminal antecedents were of no real relevance on sentence. He had a conviction for offensive language dating to 1992. There were two alcohol related driving offences, one of which (from 2000) did not attract a conviction, with the other (from 2013) dealt with by way of fine and disqualification. There was additionally a conviction for damaging property from 2003, an offence also dealt with by way of fine.
	


The Applicant’s Case on Sentence


	
	The applicant did not give evidence on sentence, although he tendered an affidavit sworn by him on 28 April 2014. He additionally tendered and relied upon a report from Terry Smith, psychologist, of 14 April 2014, together with a number of affidavits attesting to his good character and charitable works.
	
	
	The applicant is a married man with three children, all in their late teens or early twenties. At the time of the commission of the drug offences he was aged about 40 years; he was aged 41 years when sentenced.
	
	
	The applicant had a loving and supportive childhood, and enjoys a stable and happy marriage. He has been consistently employed throughout his adult life.
	
	
	The applicant worked in a managerial role for a family owned trucking business. Although the applicant had a lengthy history of sporadic drug and alcohol use, he attributed the stress of his work to his relapse into the use of cannabis and amphetamine in 2012. The applicant asserted that his supply activities were directed at financing his own habit, and that he bought in bulk to sell part of his purchase to others, thus covering the costs of his own use.
	
	
	Mr Smith regarded the applicant as having a “Substance Related and Addictive Disorder”, as referred to in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition 5 (“the DSM – 5”).
	
	
	The applicant was well thought of by others, with a number of friends and associates deposing to his courteous and hard working nature, his efforts in aid of local and interstate charities, and his remorse for his crimes.
	
	
	In the applicant’s affidavit of 28 April 2014 he asserted the truth of the history he had given to Mr Smith, and set out the background to his use of prohibited drugs. He gave an account of obtaining amphetamine via his co-offender, with the intention only of supplying part of the quantity he received to friends, thereby covering the cost of what he used himself. The applicant maintained in his affidavit that he had never profited from supplying drugs to others.
	
	
	Under a heading “I am sorry for what I have done” the applicant spoke of the “devastation” he felt at seeing the pain his crimes and arrest had caused to his family, and the adverse impact of his arrest on his family business.
	
	
	The applicant said that it was his intention to remain drug free in the future.
	


The Remarks of the Sentencing Judge


	
	In his remarks on sentence (“ROS”) the sentencing judge set out the facts of the applicant’s crimes consistent with the statement of facts tendered by the Crown. His Honour concluded that the applicant’s crimes were of a serious nature involving “a large amount of criminality”, with the enterprise being “well planned and organised over some time” (ROS 14). As to the first count, he concluded that it fell below the mid-range of any notional scale of gravity for such offences, although the applicant’s role was more significant than that of a “street dealer in the hierarchy of drug dealing” (ROS 15). As to the count of ongoing supply, the sentencing judge assessed it as “a little closer to the middle of the range of scale constructed for such an offence” (ROS 16). His Honour determined that no sentence other than one of full time imprisonment was appropriate to reflect the seriousness of the crimes.
	
	
	Referring to the applicant’s criminal history, the sentencing judge found that it was such as to allow the Court to extend him some leniency.
	
	
	His Honour set out in some detail the applicant’s personal history and his history of substance abuse, referring at length to the contents of the psychological report. He noted the evidence before the sentencing court that attested to the applicant’s years of hard work in his family’s business, and to the positive impression he had made on others in the community.
	
	
	The sentencing judge accepted Mr Smith’s opinion that the applicant had a substance abuse disorder as defined in the DSM-5, and also accepted that the applicant was focused upon, and motivated, to change his previous pattern of drug use.
	
	
	His Honour had regard to principles of parity and totality (ROS 21). He allowed the applicant a 25% discount on the sentences that would have otherwise been imposed in relation to both offences, despite the late plea in relation to the first count, to recognise the utilitarian value of the pleas. A finding of special circumstances was made, with his Honour referring to the fact that the applicant had no previous experience of prison, and to his strong family support and good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The structure of sentence adopted by his Honour was to commence the sentence for the second count at the expiration of the NPP for the first count, and to significantly reduce the NPP imposed for the second count, such that it comprised one third of the total sentence for that charge.
	


The Question of an Extension of Time in which to Seek Leave to Appeal


	
	As noted above, the applicant filed an application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal.
	
	
	The explanation advanced to explain the delay in prosecuting the appeal was that the applicant had been unable to obtain the transcript of the proceedings on sentence, as the sentencing judge had not settled the transcript owing to illness. There was some further delay thereafter in obtaining counsel to formulate the grounds of appeal.
	
	
	Although the matters advanced in explanation for the failure to file the application within time do not account for the whole of the delay, the delay is in the order of months rather than, as is not infrequently the case, years. The Crown does not assert any prejudice to it in responding to an appeal out of time, and does not object to an extension of time being granted to the applicant.
	
	
	In those circumstances, I would grant an extension of time to the applicant in which to seek leave to appeal.
	


The Proposed Appeal

Ground 1: “The learned sentencing judge erred in not properly giving effect to the principle of totality.”


	
	The applicant’s contention in support of this proposed ground is that the sentencing judge failed to properly apply the principle of totality in commencing the sentence imposed to reflect count 2 at the end of the NPP for count 1. It is argued that there should have been at least a degree of concurrency between the non-parole periods imposed for each offence, because both crimes were committed as part of a single course of conduct.
	
	
	It was argued that a number of features in the evidence dictated at least partial concurrency of sentence, being that,
	



	
	The offences were committed in the same period of time;
	
	
	The same drug was involved in both offences; and
	
	
	Both offences were committed in the context of addiction, with the proceeds of the sale of drugs used by the applicant to pay for drugs he used himself.
	



	
	It should be recognised at the outset that the level of concurrency or accumulation between two or more sentences imposed upon an offender is a matter which falls within the broad discretion of the sentencing judge: R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66; LG v R [2012] NSWCCA 249 at [24] – [26]; Franklin v R [2013] NSWCCA 122 at [42] – [44]; Mato v R; Rusu v R [2015] NSWCCA 328 at [115] – [117].
	
	
	The exercise of the discretion is circumscribed by the application of principle, most relevantly that of totality: R v Pearce [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610; MMK v R [2006] NSWCCA 272; (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at [13].
	
	
	When imposing sentence for two or more offences, a sentencing judge is required to consider each offence separately and determine the appropriate sentence for each. The question of accumulation or concurrency of the individual sentences follows, with that question articulated by Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41, at [27] as,
	


“[…] can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence?”


	
	Howie J continued, at [27],
	


“If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality.”


	
	There is no general rule or formula that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or cumulatively. The assessment to be made by the sentencing judge in that regard is very much a matter for judgment and, although minds might reasonably differ on the extent of any concurrency or accumulation of sentence, establishing error in the exercise of the discretion requires more than a difference of opinion. It must be demonstrated that an error of the type enunciated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 has occurred.
	
	
	There is no complaint by the applicant that the sentencing judge applied an incorrect principle, took into account some extraneous or irrelevant matters or failed to consider a material factor, or that he mistook the facts; the applicant asserts error only by reference to the sentences imposed and the structure of those sentences. His task in demonstrating error in those circumstances is a difficult one.
	
	
	Where sentences are imposed, as here, for drug offences, there will be a number of features that may be relevant to the assessment of the criminality involved: any commonality in the elements of each of the individual offences; the nature of the drug involved; the nature of the enterprise and how it was enacted; the question of any profit from the offences; and the period of time in which the crimes occurred, are some considerations that may arise.
	
	
	Here, the two offences both related to the prohibited drug amphetamine, they occurred in the context of the applicant’s addiction, and there was some very minor overlap in time (of about four days), but those features did not, of themselves, dictate any particular level of concurrency. There were, conversely, other features of the matter that militated in favour of a degree of accumulation.
	
	
	The first count, that of being knowingly concerned in the supply of not less than the commercial quantity of amphetamine, was averred to have taken place between 28 July 2013 and 12 August 2013. It encompassed the applicant’s enterprise with the co-offender of obtaining a commercial quantity of amphetamine from a supplier in Sydney, and moving the drug to the south coast, to be supplied to others in that location and also in Victoria. The profit the enterprise would have made to the two offenders, had it been completed, was substantial.
	
	
	The second count, the offence of ongoing supply of amphetamine, encompassed criminality largely separate to that of the first count, being the applicant’s activities, independent of the co-offender, in cultivating a client base and selling discrete amounts of amphetamine to various individuals on five separate occasions between 10 July 2013 and 1 August 2013, for financial reward. The applicant conducted that business via telephone and also in person, and the benefit was to him.
	
	
	The sentencing exercise required the imposition of sentences that reflected the criminality of each offence, consistent with the principle of totality.
	
	
	Whilst some small degree of commonality existed in the circumstances of the offending, the sentencing judge took that into account in the overall structure of the sentences imposed. In particular, the much reduced NPP imposed in relation to the ongoing supply, a term of 12 months imprisonment, being only 33.3% of the sentence imposed for that offence, was clearly intended by his Honour to give effect to the principle of totality.
	
	
	Whilst individual judicial officers might have approached the structuring of sentence differently, that does not bespeak error in the approach taken by his Honour.
	
	
	I do not regard error as having been made out. I would not grant leave to advance this ground.
	


Ground 2: “The overall sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.”


	
	The applicant’s principal contention in relation to this ground is that the asserted failure of the sentencing judge to properly apply the principal of totality resulted in a sentence which was manifestly excessive. It is not contended that the individual sentences are excessive, but rather that the degree of accumulation has led to an overall sentence which is unjust.
	
	
	As the applicant conceded in his written submissions (at [27]), the success of this ground is dependent upon the success of the first ground.
	
	
	Since I have concluded that the first ground has not been made out, this ground too must fail.
	
	
	The applicant highlighted the applicant’s subjective case as providing some support for this ground beyond the issue of sentence structure, but did not point to any error in the way in which the sentencing judge dealt with that evidence. The points made by the applicant can be quickly dealt with.
	
	
	The high degree of family and community support for the applicant was referred to, but it is acknowledged by the applicant that the sentencing judge was fully aware of these features of the evidence, and gave them full weight in making a finding of special circumstances in the applicant’s favour, with a generous reduction in the overall NPP.
	
	
	The applicant also pointed to the acceptance by the sentencing judge that the applicant had a substance abuse disorder as a feature that should have ameliorated the penalty imposed. Having regard to the finding of special circumstances, which was based in part on his Honour’s cognisance of the applicant’s history of drug and alcohol misuse and the efforts he had made and continued to make to rehabilitate himself, it could not be seriously argued that more was called for by way of amelioration of penalty. To further reduce the sentences imposed by reference to the applicant’s drug addiction would be to fall into the error of double counting.
	
	
	As the applicant acknowledged in his written submissions and during the course of the hearing before this Court, to establish a complaint of manifest excess he must demonstrate that the sentences imposed upon him were unreasonable or unjust: R v Dinsdale [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325.
	
	
	The question for this Court is whether the length of the sentences is demonstrated to be outside the exercise of sound sentencing discretion, in the context of the maximum prescribed penalty, the standard NPP where applicable, the place which the criminal conduct occupies on the scale of seriousness of offences of the kind in question, and the personal circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	Here, the sentencing judge concluded that the applicant’s crimes were serious, although falling below the mid-range in terms of objective gravity. The applicant takes no issue with that assessment. Indeed, nothing advanced by the applicant is capable of demonstrating that the sentences imposed by his Honour falls outside the range of sound sentencing discretion.
	
	
	His Honour carefully considered the objective gravity of the applicant’s crimes, and took into account all relevant subjective considerations. With a discount on sentence of 25% for the early plea and a finding of special circumstances – both, arguably, very generous - the sentencing judge arrived at the sentences imposed upon the applicant. There was no error in their determination.
	
	
	The applicant has failed to make out this ground. Having regard to its dependence upon ground 1, I would not grant leave to argue this ground.
	


ORDERS


	
	The orders of the Court are:
	



	
	The time for filing an application for leave to appeal against sentence is extended; and
	
	
	Leave to appeal is refused.

		11 March 2016",2016-03-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768990,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 35) [2016] NSWSC 301,"Judgment EX TEMPORE – REVISED


	
	Earlier in these proceedings, a subpoena was issued at the request of the accused McNamara to the Registrar of the District Court of NSW, seeking production of a large number of documents which are more fully enumerated in the schedule to the subpoena. It is not necessary, for the purposes of determining the present application, to detail the nature of those documents any further.
	
	
	Upon production of the material, I granted the parties access to it. That access order obviously included access being exercised by the legal representatives of the accused McNamara. In the course of inspecting the material which was produced Mr Reslan, McNamara's solicitor, located a sealed envelope which was endorsed to the effect that it was not to be opened other than by an order of a judge of the District Court of New South Wales, or a judge of any superior court.
	
	
	Mr Reslan, with commendable propriety for which I am grateful, immediately drew the existence of the envelope to my attention. Upon examination, it became immediately apparent to me that its contents were of a kind which, prima facie, may lend themselves to a claim for public interest immunity.
	
	
	I determined that the most appropriate course was to provide the material to the solicitor for the New South Wales Police (being the likely claimant) so as to give the Commissioner an opportunity to inspect the material and make some determination. Prior to doing so, I foreshadowed my intentions to the parties, all of whom consented to that course being adopted.
	
	
	I was subsequently advised by counsel for the Commissioner, Ms Kumar, that a claim would be made.
	
	
	Yesterday I was provided, in support of that claim, with an open affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Lanyon of the New South Wales Police of 15 March 2016. That was accompanied by a confidential affidavit of Mr Lanyon sworn on the same day, together with exhibit MAL1 to that affidavit. Exhibit MAL1 contains the material which is the subject of the claim.
	
	
	As is generally the case in matters of this nature, the open affidavit has been provided to Ms Shead who appears for McNamara, but the confidential affidavit has not. The provision of evidence in a confidential form is a practice which is recognised as being appropriate in matters of this nature: R v Meissner (1994) 76 A Crim R 81 at 85; National Crime Authority v Gould (1989) 90 A Crim R 489 at 497.
	
	
	The inability of Ms Shead to be made aware of the contents of the confidential affidavit has placed her in a position where she has simply submitted to me that I should determine the matter by reference to the balancing exercise contained in s. 130 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”). In conducting that balancing exercise, she has urged that I take into account the issues in the trial, the case which is to be brought by McNamara and the fact that, in the circumstances of the present case, a “cut throat” defence is being mounted by each of the accused.
	
	
	Section 130 of the Act is in the following terms:
	


130 Exclusion of evidence of matters of state

(1)  If the public interest in admitting into evidence information or a document that relates to matters of state is outweighed by the public interest in preserving secrecy or confidentiality in relation to the information or document, the court may direct that the information or document not be adduced as evidence.

(2)  The court may give such a direction either on its own initiative or on the application of any person (whether or not the person is a party).

(3)  In deciding whether to give such a direction, the court may inform itself in any way it thinks fit.

(4)  Without limiting the circumstances in which information or a document may be taken for the purposes of subsection (1) to relate to matters of state, the information or document is taken for the purposes of that subsection to relate to matters of state if adducing it as evidence would:

(a)  prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia; or

(b)  damage relations between the Commonwealth and a State or between 2 or more States; or

(c)  prejudice the prevention, investigation or prosecution of an offence; or

(d)  prejudice the prevention or investigation of, or the conduct of proceedings for recovery of civil penalties brought with respect to, other contraventions of the law; or

(e)  disclose, or enable a person to ascertain, the existence or identity of a confidential source of information relating to the enforcement or administration of a law of the Commonwealth or a State; or

(f)  prejudice the proper functioning of the government of the Commonwealth or a State.

(5)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to take into account the following matters:

(a)  the importance of the information or the document in the proceeding;

(b)  if the proceeding is a criminal proceeding--whether the party seeking to adduce evidence of the information or document is a defendant or the prosecutor;

(c)  the nature of the offence, cause of action or defence to which the information or document relates, and the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding;

(d)  the likely effect of adducing evidence of the information or document, and the means available to limit its publication;

(e)  whether the substance of the information or document has already been published;

(f)  if the proceeding is a criminal proceeding and the party seeking to adduce evidence of the information or document is a defendant--whether the direction is to be made subject to the condition that the prosecution be stayed.

(6)  A reference in this section to a State includes a reference to a Territory.


	
	The provisions of s. 130 reflect, in general terms, the common law as stated in Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43; (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 38, and Conway v Rimmer (1968) AC 910 at 940.
	
	
	As well as the material which is the subject of the claim, I have read carefully the confidential affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Lanyon.
	
	
	I am mindful of the issues in the trial, and of the nature of the case that McNamara seeks to bring. I have taken into account those matters set out in ss. 130(4) and (5) of the Act. Without dealing individually with those matters, and having conducted the balancing exercise, I am satisfied the public interest in admitting into evidence the contents of exhibit MAL1 is outweighed by the public interest in preserving its secrecy and confidentiality. I am satisfied, in particular, that the content of exhibit MAL1 falls into a well-recognised, category of material, disclosure of which the courts have accepted may harm the public interest. In that respect, I have had particular regard to observations made in Sankey (supra), as well as the observations of Kirby P (as his Honour then was) and McHugh JA (as his Honour then was) in Cain v Glass (No 2) (1985) 3 NSWLR 230 at 233 and 247 respectively.
	
	
	It is obviously necessary that the confidentiality of the material contained in exhibit MAL1 be preserved. For that reason, it would be inappropriate for me to deal with the matter in any further detail. However, for the reasons expressed, and having conducted the balancing exercise, I uphold the claim which has been made on behalf of the Commissioner.

		15 June 2016",2016-03-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768995,Application of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 277,"Judgment


	
	On the application of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police I yesterday made orders under s 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) in terms sought, for forfeiture to the Commonwealth of a sum of money, of approximately $77,000. Those funds were in the custody of the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy, having become the subject of restraining orders made by Button J in August 2015 (see Application of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2015] NSWSC 1137), it being suspected that they were proceeds of offences under the Cybercrime Act 2001 (Cth), the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and s 400.9 of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The offences involved the hacking of certain share trading accounts, market manipulation and money laundering.
	
	
	These are the reasons why the orders sought were made.
	
	
	Section 49 provides that the Court must make an order that restrained property be forfeited to the Commonwealth, if the conditions specified there are met.
	
	
	Button J’s orders were made on affidavit evidence of Ms McLean, an officer of the Federal Police. By motion filed in March 2015, Saxo Bank A/S sought orders under s 29 and s 31 of the Act, excluding what it claimed to be its interest in the restrained money from the August order. That application was later withdrawn. In those circumstances under s 49(3), the requirements of s 49(1)(c) did not apply to this application.
	
	
	On the affidavit evidence of Ms Cooper, also a member of the Federal Police, and of Ms Horan, a litigation assistant employed by the Federal Police, I was satisfied that the other requirements of s 49 had been met.
	
	
	The evidence established that the application, supporting materials relied on, orders and further affidavits and other relevant materials had been served by the Commissioner on those interested in the application Saxo Bank A/S of Denmark; Morgan Stanley Australia Securities Limited and Mr Dmitri Stahrukhin, who had been identified by the market regulator in Denmark, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, as the person operating the suspect account involved in the offending discussed by Button J in the August 2015 judgment, but who was not identified as having any interest in the money the subject of the application.
	
	
	ASIC had also contacted Mr Starukihn to advise him of the suspected involvement of his account in market misconduct. There was also no response to the request that he contact ASIC.
	
	
	Steps have been taken to put victims of these unauthorised trades into the position they were in before their accounts were hacked. Accordingly, they were not identified as having any interest in the restrained property. Nor have any other individuals been identified as having any potential interest in the restrained property.
	
	
	There was no appearance by any of those served, to oppose the forfeiture order sought by the Commissioner.
	
	
	The Commissioner is a “responsible authority” for a restraining order as that term is defined in the Dictionary to the Act. The restraining order has been in force for longer than 6 months. Ms Cooper’s evidence addressed the circumstances in which the application for the restraining order made by Button J came to be made; following ASIC investigation of suspicious trading in 13 securities listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, through identified online accounts. The advice of affected clients was that they had not authorised that trading.
	
	
	The result was steps being taken to withhold profits which totalled some $AUD113,036.50 from these trades. Only some of those profits were then held by Morgan Stanley, some trades having already earlier been settled, before ASIC’s notification was given to Morgan Stanley. It was the remaining profits which became the subject of Button J’s restraining order.
	
	
	This evidence, I was satisfied, also established that the restrained moneys was the proceeds of relevant offending and that it was in the public interest to make the orders sought. There was, accordingly, no basis on which the order sought by the Commissioner could be refused and accordingly, orders in the terms sought were made.

		19 April 2016",2016-03-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769008,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 36) [2016] NSWSC 302,"Judgment EX TEMPORE – REVISED


	
	The accused are charged with murder, as well as supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine. The Crown seeks to lead expert evidence from Detective Sergeant Marc Scholtes of the value of methylamphetamine. Part of that evidence is objected to by Ms Shead, counsel for McNamara. In raising that objection, Ms Shead relied upon s. 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	In a statement of 25 August 2014 (at paragraph 27) Detective Scholtes set out a table of what he described as the “common quantities and price ranges” for methylamphetamine. In paragraph 36 he expressed the view that on the assumption that 2780gm of methylamphetamine in crystal or ice form was sold by the kilogram (or in other words, sold in bulk), a return of between $540,000 and $702,000 could be expected. No objection is taken by Ms Shead to that part of his evidence.
	
	
	Having dealt with some other matters, the statement of Det. Scholtes continued (the following paragraphs being those to which Ms Shead objected):
	


“37. As I referred to in paragraph 27 of my statement, 0.1gm street deals of methylamphetamine in crystal or ‘ice’ form range from $50 to $150. Assuming 2780g of pure methylamphetamine in crystal or ‘ice’ form was sold by 0.1g street deals one would expect a return of $1,390,000 and $4,170,000.

38. In my experience in the investigation of methylamphetamine supply, the purity of methylamphetamine hydrochloride at street level can vary greatly and ranges from 1% to 20%. For ease of calculation the following calculations are based on the combined purity of the substances being 70%.

39. As referred to in paragraph 27 of my statement, the wholesale value of methylamphetamine in diluted or powder form ranges between $70,000 and $110,000 per kilogram. Assuming 2780g of pure methylamphetamine hydrochloride had been diluted to methylamphetamine with a conservative purity of 10% to produce 19.46 kg of methylamphetamine (rounded down to 19.40 kg for ease of calculation and based on the range of $7,000 to $11,000 per 100g) and sold by the kilogram m, One would expect a return of between $1,358,000 and $2,134,000.

40. As referred to in paragraph 27 of my statement, 0.1 g street deals of methylamphetamine in diluted or powder form range from $50 to $100. Assuming 19.46kg (19,460g) of methylamphetamine was sold at 0.1g street deals, one would expect a return of between $9,730,000 and $19,460,000.”


	
	Ms Shead submitted that whilst there was no issue as to the witness' expertise, the evidence in paragraphs (37) to (40) inclusive was highly prejudicial. She submitted that it was based not only on variations and/or fluctuations in price, but upon complete speculation about what the accused were going to do with the methylamphetamine which is the subject of the counts of supply against them.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Det. Scholtes’ opinion was evidence of what the accused potentially stood to gain from the alleged supply. The Crown submitted that the accused should not derive some unfair advantage based only on the proposition that they were to sell the methylamphetamine in bulk. It was submitted that there was an inference available that the accused were in fact going to ""do something"" with the drugs.
	
	
	In my view, there are two difficulties in admitting the evidence to which objection is taken.
	
	
	Firstly, as will be evident from paragraphs 37 and 38 of Det. Scholtes’ statement, this part of his opinion is based on data which, to put it bluntly, varies wildly.
	
	
	Secondly, there is no evidence that the accused were in fact going to engage in any supply of “street deals” of methylamphetamine. Apart from a jug and spoon said to have been purchased by McNamara around the time of the deceased’s death, there is no evidence of either accused being in possession of any kind of “drug paraphernalia” which might be consistent with an intention to supply “street deals” of the drug. Indeed, whether in the circumstances of the present case the items purchased by McNamara could be properly described as “drug paraphernalia” is itself questionable.
	
	
	For those reasons, I am satisfied that although relevant, the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. Accordingly, I propose to exclude it.

		15 June 2016",2016-03-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769014,R v Turnbull (No. 2) [2016] NSWSC 678,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused, Ian Robert Turnbull, is to stand trial in this Court in April 2016 on a charge of murder and a charge of detaining a person with the intention of obtaining an advantage. The background to the trial may be found in my judgment on venue: R v Turnbull (No 1) [2016] NSWSC 189.
	
	
	For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that the Accused is charged with the murder of Glendon Turner. He was employed as a Compliance and Regulation Officer for the Office of the Environment and Heritage, Department of Premier and Cabinet. His role involved investigating illegal land clearing and prosecuting individuals for breaches of s.12 Native Vegetation Act 2003.
	
	
	There is no issue that the Accused shot the deceased on 29 July 2014. The Accused proposes to raise the partial defences of substantial impairment and extreme provocation. I am the Judge allocated to preside at the trial.
	
	
	On behalf of the Accused, a subpoena filed on 22 February 2016 issued, directed to the Proper Officer, The Office of Environment and Heritage (""the Applicant"").
	
	
	By Notice of Motion filed 3 March 2016, the Applicant sought to have set aside various paragraphs of the subpoena. By the time the hearing of the Notice of Motion came before me on 17 March 2016, the paragraphs under challenge had reduced to three, being paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the subpoena. Those paragraphs seek:
	


“2.    All document including correspondence, emails, file notes and any other written materials, recording or relating to any complaints made that concern or involve Mr Turner during the period, including complaints made by:

(a)    Ms Anna Simmons; and

(b)    Mr John Kennedy.

3.    All documents including correspondence, emails, file notes and any other written materials, recording or relating to the taking of any disciplinary, educational, counselling or other action against Mr Turner in relation to any of the complaints referred to in paragraph 2 above.

4.    All emails sent by Mr Turner during the period that record, refer to or relate to any of the following:

(a)    Ian Turnbull;

(b)    Roger Turnbull;

(c)    Grant Turnbull;

(d)    Cory Turnbull;

(e)    the property known as Strathdoon;

(f)    the property known as Colorado; and/or

(g)    the property known as Roydon.”


	
	The Applicant has read affidavits of Nicholas Allan affirmed 3 March and 16 March 2016 on the application. In addition, a copy of a tendency notice dated 15 March 2016, indicating the intention of the Accused to adduce tendency evidence under s.97 Evidence Act 1995, was placed before the Court.
	
	
	Counsel for the Applicant submits that the challenged paragraphs of the subpoena constitute a fishing expedition: Alister v The Queen [1984] HCA 85; 154 CLR 404 at 414; R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at 18. To the extent that the Accused indicated an intention to rely upon extreme provocation in support of those paragraphs of the subpoena, it was submitted that the proposed defence was hopeless: Darcey v Pre-Term Foundation Clinic [1983] 2 NSWLR 497 at 502. In this regard, submissions were directed to suggested deficiencies in the Accused's tendency notice.
	
	
	Counsel for the Accused submitted that a legitimate forensic purpose had been demonstrated and that it appeared to be “on the cards” that the documents would materially assist the Accused: Perish v R [2015] NSWCCA 237 at [56]. The written submissions for the Accused articulated the basis upon which it could be said that this conclusion should be reached. In this respect, reference was made to both substantial impairment and extreme provocation.
	
	
	The provisions concerning extreme provocation were inserted in s.23 Crimes Act 1900 in 2014. To my knowledge, this is the first trial where the proper construction and application of this partial defence will be considered.
	
	
	Further, the factual context in which it is sought to be raised in this case is an unusual one.
	
	
	In relation to substantial impairment, I have been provided with the psychiatric reports of Dr Olav Nielssen (dated 11 February 2016) and Professor David Greenberg (dated 23 February 2016), both experts retained for the Accused, and of Dr Adam Martin (dated 17 February 2016), the expert retained by the Crown. These reports provide assistance in understanding how the “on the cards” test may apply to documents caught by this subpoena with respect to substantial impairment.
	
	
	On the limited material before the Court, I am not in a position to effectively dismiss out of hand the Accused's intention to rely on extreme provocation by a conclusion that his desire to do so is hopeless.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that the appropriate course is to require production to the Court of documents falling within paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the subpoena, for the purpose of the Court determining whether the Accused has satisfied the requirements for being granted access to them. This process will involve the Court having in mind, as well, the psychiatric reports to permit the relevant test to be applied insofar as the documents are sought for purposes associated with substantial impairment.
	
	
	I do not consider that the present application can be determined properly without that step being taken. I will make orders for production of the documents to the Court in the near future to enable me to undertake that function.

Introduction


	
	This is an application brought by Mr Dragan Cvetkovic (the applicant) for an inquiry into a conviction and sentence, pursuant to s 78(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (the Act). It relates to an offence of wounding with intent to murder that is said to have occurred on 6 June 2007. The applicant was found guilty of that offence by a jury in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney on 22 July 2009; convicted of it on 7 August 2009 by her Honour Judge Sweeney; and, on the same date, sentenced by her Honour to a head sentence of imprisonment for 17 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 13 years, each to date from 6 June 2007.

Test to be applied


	
	With regard to the test that I am to apply to the material placed before me, in Application of Peter James Holland under s.78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251, Johnson J said at [6]:
	


The test is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s.79(2). With respect to repealed s.475 Crimes Act 1900 (which used similar words), it was said that this view may be formed where the material causes the person considering the matter unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245. This formula has been applied since the repeal of s.475 and its replacement by the provisions now contained in s.79(2): Application of Pedrana (2000) 117 A Crim R 45 at 463 [28]; Application of Suey [2001] NSWSC 543 at [18].


	
	I respectfully adopt that formulation. I have therefore approached my task on the basis that, having read all the material with which I have been provided, I should ask myself whether I feel a sense of unease or disquiet about the conviction entered, or the sentence imposed, or both.
	


Grounds of application


	
	The applicant prepared the documents upon which he relies himself. Indeed, he has been, as I understand it, unrepresented throughout all of the litigation to do with this matter.
	
	
	The following grounds were set out in Part 3 of the written application of 25 June 2015 (some bolding has been deleted, but otherwise the passages are verbatim):
	


3.1   On Conviction

[1] Ground 1: The prosecutor did not prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Both expert witnesses in psychiatry allowed for possibility that my act in stabbing my wife and myself was involuntarily. The evidence of my behaviour (i) immediately before the incident, (ii) during the incident, (iii) immediately after the incident, (vi) in the week before the incident, (v) on the day of the incident and (vi) shortly after the incident substantially supports lack of guilt even on the balance of probabilities standard. The state of evidence and the law warrant acquittal.

[2] Ground 2: Nine false or misleading exhibits admitted in to evidence in the trial and the actual bias of the trial judge amount to substantial miscarriage of justice and warrant retrial.

3.2   On Severity of Sentence

[3] Ground 3: The sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly excessive and unduly harsh as it could be inferred from:

[a]   10 specific mitigating factors: s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW;

[b]   6 additional objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence; Section 21A(1)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW;

[c]   Severity of sentences given in 6 similar cases.

[4] Ground 4: General deterrence: The trial judge erred in law and fact by including, or not excluding, general deterrence as it has little, if any, weight, as I was suffering from the major depressive illness at the relevant time and as such I was not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.

[5] Ground 5: Standard non-parole period imposed by the trial judge was too excessive: Muldrock's Case (Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39).


	
	As well as that, although not identified as a ground, the applicant also sought to rely upon “new evidence”, as follows:
	


PART 4: SUBMISSIONS ON NEW EVIDENCE

[6] Victims compensation: Provisional Order for Restitution issued by the Commissioner of Victims Rights, Victims Services, file No. RT 145136, Debt No Do80574 dated 11/05/2015, enclosed as Annexure at page 34. For relevance see paras [84] and [85] below.

Material placed before me


	
	The applicant relied upon the following filed material.
	
	
	First, the document entitled “Application for an Inquiry into Conviction and Sentence” to which I have already referred. This consisted of 43 pages. It included the grounds, extensive written submissions, and an overview of the transcripts and exhibits of the trial (that document seemed in truth to be a certificate pursuant to r 23C(c) of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW).
	
	
	Secondly, a document entitled “Provisional Order for Restitution”.
	
	
	Thirdly, a statement of an ambulance officer of 11 July 2007.
	
	
	Fourthly, photocopies of a number of photographs, showing a woman in a hospital bed (whom one can infer is the victim), a damaged piece of clothing (which one can infer was the victim’s), and a large number of sutured wounds to the back and shoulders of a person (whom one can infer is also the victim).
	
	
	Fifthly and finally, the submissions previously made by the applicant in an unsuccessful appeal against conviction to the New South Wales Criminal Court of Appeal.
	
	
	I received the following from the Attorney-General of New South Wales in opposition to the application.
	
	
	First, written submissions prepared by counsel, pursuant to s 79(4) of the Act.
	
	
	Secondly, copies of the following authorities referred to in those submissions: Cvetkovic v R [2010] NSWCCA 329; Cvetkovic v The Queen [2011] HCASL 133; Cvetkovic v R [2013] NSWCCA 66; Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; Application by Frank Sinkovich pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 1342; and Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37.
	
	
	It is immediately noteworthy that the applicant has not provided me with a transcript of the trial, the summing-up, or copies of the exhibits tendered in the trial. It is true that he has provided me with an overview of the transcript, but it contains no useful detail.
	
	
	As well as that, the overview certifies that the transcript and exhibits are available from the Registrar of the District Court at Sydney. Contrary to the position seemingly adopted by the applicant, I do not consider it my role to pursue those documents that may be relevant to the application. Pursuant to the legislation, it is the role of the applicant to place material before me in support of the application, and the role of the Attorney-General to place written submissions to the contrary before me, if the Attorney-General wishes to do so.
	
	
	Nor have I been provided by the applicant with a transcript of the proceedings on sentence, copies of the exhibits on sentence, or a copy of the remarks on sentence. The written submissions of counsel do quote a number of portions of the remarks on sentence, but by no means the entirety of them.
	


Procedural background


	
	This relatively simple matter has been the subject of a great deal of litigation. I now set out a summary of that litigation, bearing in mind that I do not have the materials to which I have referred above.
	
	
	As I have said, the offence leading to the conviction was committed on 6 June 2007.
	
	
	It seems that a pre-trial hearing of six days’ duration was conducted in the District Court at Sydney in March 2009. It seems there were further pre-trial proceedings on 18 May 2009, and that a jury was empanelled on 19 May, but discharged on 20 May 2009.
	
	
	On the latter date, the trial that led to the conviction commenced. The applicant was arraigned on three counts, on two of which he was acquitted. Because those acquittals do not form any part of the application, I shall not discuss them further.
	
	
	As I have said, a verdict of guilty on the count of wounding with intent to murder was returned on 22 July 2009, and the applicant was sentenced on 7 August 2009.
	
	
	From 19 to 22 July 2010, an appeal against conviction was heard in the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales. It was unanimously dismissed on 21 December 2010: see Cvetkovic v R [2010] NSWCCA 329.
	
	
	On 8 June 2011, an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia against that conviction was refused on the written submissions: see Cvetkovic v The Queen [2011] HCASL 133.
	
	
	On 23 November 2011, the applicant made a written application to the Governor of New South Wales petitioning for the exercise of the Royal prerogative of mercy. Her Excellency declined the application.
	
	
	On 1 October 2012, the applicant made a further written application to the Governor, which was treated as an application under Pt 7 of the Act. That was deferred until a pending application for leave to appeal against sentence was dealt with fully.
	
	
	On 5 March 2013, an application for leave to appeal against sentence was heard in the New South Wales Criminal Court of Appeal. On 3 April 2013, it was unanimously dismissed: see Cvetkovic v R [2013] NSWCCA 66.
	
	
	On 14 August 2013, the High Court refused special leave with regard to the application for leave to appeal against sentence on the written submissions: see Cvetkovic v The Queen [2013] HCASL 131. Thereafter, the second petition to the Governor was declined.
	
	
	I interpolate to say that the history that I have summarised above sharply raises whether s 78(3) applies. In particular, if it be the case that the applicant is seeking simply to reagitate a matter that has already been agitated and rejected in the appeals against conviction and sentence, and the applicant cannot point to any special facts or circumstances, there must be a real question whether I should refuse to consider some or all of the application: see Application of Ivan Robert Marko Milat under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 209 at [19]-[22].
	


Evidential background


	
	I turn now to set out the understanding of the trial and proceedings on sentence that I have been able to develop from the material placed before me, bearing in mind the absence of the materials to which I have referred.
	
	
	According to the judgment of the Criminal Court of Appeal in 2010, it was undisputed at trial that, on 6 June 2007, the applicant stabbed his wife repeatedly whilst the two of them were sitting in a motor vehicle in a car park, he in the driver’s seat and she in the front passenger seat. The “defence” relied upon at trial was sane automatism. To express that concept more correctly, the applicant submitted to the jury that they would have a reasonable doubt about whether the Crown had proven that the stabbing had been committed voluntarily; that is, by way of willed movements of his muscles: see generally Ryan v R [1967] HCA 2; (1967) 121 CLR 205.
	
	
	The defence that he was not guilty on grounds of mental illness was not relied upon by the applicant. That meant that he was contending that he should be acquitted outright, and not detained indefinitely in a mental hospital. It also meant that the evidence upon which he relied to raise a reasonable possibility that his acts were not voluntary could not encompass a defect of reason, arising from a disease of the mind, that led him to fail to understand the nature and quality of his act, or fail to appreciate that it was wrong: see M’Naghten’s Case [1843] 8 ER 718; R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182; and R v Youssef (1990) 50 A Crim R 1. If it did, he would be not guilty on the ground of mental illness, and subject to indefinite detention.
	
	
	The Crown case included a number of powerfully probative pieces of evidence that the stabbing was indeed voluntary.
	
	
	First, it was not disputed that, on the day of the stabbing, the applicant had been told that his marriage was definitely at an end, in a context of longstanding acrimony. That provided evidence of motive.
	
	
	Secondly, it was not disputed that the applicant had stabbed the victim with a “gyprock saw” that he had brought with him to the meeting with the victim. It was secreted in a bag that was in his possession. He had purchased it the day before. Those undisputed facts provided evidence of premeditation and planning.
	
	
	Thirdly, it was not disputed that, after inflicting injuries to the victim, the applicant inflicted injuries upon himself in a purported suicide attempt. Those events provided evidence that the mind of the applicant was engaged with his actions, in that murder/suicide in the context of relationship breakdown is, regrettably, not particularly rare.
	
	
	Fourthly, it was not disputed that, after the stabbing, the applicant started the motor vehicle, engaged its gears, and drove it, thereafter hitting a police officer in the leg and colliding with several vehicles whilst driving towards the exit of the car park. That was powerful evidence that, immediately after the events in question, he was not acting as an automaton.
	
	
	Fifthly, the applicant was apprehended at the scene, and shortly thereafter examined by an ambulance officer. He was assessed as having a Glasgow Coma Score of 15; that is, a completely uncompromised state of consciousness.
	
	
	Sixthly, in a recorded interview later that evening, the applicant said “I wanted to cut pain and suffering that we exposed for years [sic] and terminate our lives. I do realise that this probably from someone else’s perspective is wrong but I felt that this is only option for my life”. That recorded statement of the applicant was powerful evidence that, at the time of the stabbing (and subsequent suicide attempt) he was acting with the intention of bringing about the results that he desired: namely, the death of the victim and thereafter himself. That admission was completely contrary to the proposition that the stabbing was involuntary.
	
	
	Seventhly, the eminent forensic psychiatrist Dr Nielssen was called in the Crown case. He expressed the opinion that, although the applicant was suffering from depression on the day in question, he did not have available to him the defence of mental illness. Nor did Dr Nielssen consider that the applicant was affected by sane automatism on the day of the stabbing.
	
	
	Turning to the defence case, the applicant gave evidence. He also called as a witness another eminent forensic psychiatrist, Dr Westmore. Dr Westmore gave evidence (despite the fact that it was not the case for the applicant) that the applicant did indeed have available to him the defence of mental illness. On the other hand, Dr Westmore did not consider that the applicant was subject to sane automatism at the time of the stabbing.
	
	
	In other words, no psychiatrist gave evidence in the trial that he or she was of the affirmative opinion that, at the time of the stabbing, the applicant was subject to sane automatism. And there is no material to suggest that, before or after that time, any psychiatrist has ever expressed that opinion.
	


Ground one - conviction 


	
	It is in that context of a number of separate aspects of the evidence that spoke powerfully of a voluntary, indeed pre-meditated and motivated stabbing, that the applicant made a number of written submissions in support of ground one.
	
	
	First, he submitted that, in cross-examination, both Dr Nielssen and Dr Westmore allowed for the possibility that the stabbing may have been automatic.
	
	
	Secondly, an offer to drive the victim some distance, made by the applicant shortly before the stabbing, suggests that he was not intent on doing her any harm.
	
	
	Thirdly, the fact that he picked up the saw with his left hand, even though he is right-handed, suggests that he was not acting voluntarily.
	
	
	Fourthly, evidence from the victim and others that he said nothing during the stabbing supports the proposition that he was acting involuntarily.
	
	
	Fifthly, evidence that, whilst onlookers were seeking forcefully to stop him stabbing the victim, the applicant did not resist or even flinch, suggests that he was in an automatic state.
	
	
	Sixthly, his manner of driving after the stabbing, including the engine of the car being revved very loudly, supports the same proposition.
	
	
	Seventhly, detailed analysis of the presentation of the applicant that led to him being given the highest score on the Glasgow Coma Scale shows that that assessment is open to question.
	
	
	Eighthly, the behaviour of the applicant in the week before the incident (which included visiting a number of law firms with regard to some pending litigation, completing a sailing course, and booking a hotel room in the city of Sydney) was not supportive of an intention to commit murder and thereafter suicide.
	
	
	Ninthly, the behaviour of the applicant on the day in question (in a nutshell, making various preparations for the future) was not suggestive of an intention to murder his wife and then kill himself.
	
	
	Tenthly and finally, the fact that, when spoken to by police after the stabbing, the applicant expressed surprise at what he had done, openly incriminated himself, and expressed remorse for his actions suggests that he had been acting involuntarily.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this ground, there are a number of reasons why I do not propose to remit the question of the conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal, or to order an inquiry, on the basis of it.
	
	
	The first is because I have not been provided with a transcript of the evidence at trial (along with other necessary materials). Without those, it is very difficult to make an assessment of the evidence at the trial.
	
	
	The second and wholly separate reason is because consideration of the compendious judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of 21 December 2010 in the conviction appeal reveals that the arguments that have been made to me were made to the Court of Criminal Appeal. They were painstakingly dealt with in the judgment of Campbell JA, which extended over 429 paragraphs. The application simply seeks to repeat those arguments, all of which were rejected years ago by three judges of that Court. No special facts or circumstances have been shown. In the circumstances, I propose not to deal with that portion of the application, pursuant to s 79(3)(a)(i) of the Act.
	
	
	Thirdly, and assuming that I am wrong with regard to the two factors above, the material placed before me raises no sense of disquiet or unease in my mind about this conviction. To the contrary, I consider that the summary that I have provided shows that this was an extremely strong Crown case of a voluntary act.
	
	
	In that regard, I turn to deal briefly with the matters relied upon by the applicant.
	
	
	First, on the extracts with which I have been provided, the two forensic psychiatrists spoke of sane automatism as being a mere or hypothetical possibility; as one knows from experience, most expert witnesses will eventually concede in cross-examination an answer along the lines of “well, anything is possible”. It may be that each of them was accepting that sane automatism could not be ruled out as a mere possibility. But that is not the same as either witness accepting that sane automatism was a reasonable possibility, upon which a reasonable doubt could or should be founded.
	
	
	Secondly, whether the applicant offered to drive the victim somewhere shortly before the stabbing is not significant, let alone determinative, as to whether the stabbing itself was a willed act. Indeed, the fact that his mind was fully engaged at that earlier stage may suggest the contrary.
	
	
	Thirdly, the fact that the applicant may have picked up the weapon with his left hand rather than his right is of no great moment to the question.
	
	
	Fourthly, the fact that the applicant stabbed the victim repeatedly without screaming or shouting may well indicate grim determination, and is not very significant with regard to automatism. So is the fact that he was unflinching and silent when others sought to stop him.
	
	
	Fifthly, the manner of driving of the applicant is suggestive of a person who wished to leave the scene urgently, thereby demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. It says very little in favour of the proposition that the stabbing was involuntary. Again, the fact that the applicant was able to engage in driving a motor vehicle very shortly after the stabbing argues firmly to the contrary.
	
	
	Sixthly, as for the Glasgow Coma Scale result, detailed analysis of the material underpinning it cannot persuasively detract from its simple force: the expert opinion was that there was nothing wrong with the consciousness of the applicant when he was assessed.
	
	
	Seventhly, as for the behaviour of the applicant in the week preceding the stabbing and earlier on the day itself, none of those actions supported in the slightest the proposition that he was prone to automatic states; yet again, quite the contrary.
	
	
	Separately, the mere fact that, in the hours or days prior to the stabbing itself, the applicant may not have possessed a firm intention to murder his wife and kill himself is of very little weight with regard to the real question. I repeat that that question is whether I experience a sense of doubt or unease about whether, at the time when he repeatedly stabbed his wife, there is a reasonable possibility that the applicant was acting involuntarily.
	
	
	Eighthly, it is impossible to interpret the things recorded as being said by the applicant to the police as anything other than a cogent admission of guilt, including an admission of premeditation and motive (“I wanted to…terminate our lives”).
	
	
	To summarise: there was a very strong circumstantial case that the applicant was acting voluntarily when he stabbed the victim repeatedly. The matters that he has raised are unpersuasive. They have been dealt with comprehensively by the court entrusted with reviewing convictions for serious offences. And overarching the whole matter is an almost insuperable difficulty for the applicant: he seeks to raise a reasonable possibility of sane automatism without any psychiatric evidence, proffered either at trial or in the seven years since its conclusion, to support it.
	
	
	Finally, leaving aside the evidence at trial for the moment, and bearing in mind that I am making a determination based upon all of the material placed before me, it is noteworthy that, at p 4 par 20 of the application dated 25 June 2015, the applicant himself has written, with regard to the gyprock saw, “I bought it with thoughts that I may use it to stab myself and my wife”.
	
	
	That statement is surely a recent acceptance that, at the time of the purchase of the implement that was used to stab the victim, its subsequent use in precisely that way was, at the least, foreseen by the applicant as a distinct possibility. That statement of the applicant, made eight years after the event, argues powerfully in favour of the stabbing having been a voluntary act.
	
	
	In short, reflecting upon all of the material placed before me (as against the contingency that I am wrong in my belief that I require the transcript, and also wrong in my exercise of discretion pursuant to s 79(3)(a)(i) of the Act), nothing that the applicant has raised in support of ground one causes me to have any disquiet or unease about this conviction.
	


Ground two - conviction


	
	As can be seen, the first part of this ground focuses upon nine allegedly false or misleading exhibits in the trial. I have not been provided with any of them, or even photographs of all of them.
	
	
	To give but one example, the applicant has written verbatim the following about clothing of the victim (or photos thereof) that I presume was tendered in the Crown case (again, some bolding has been deleted):
	


[73] Exhibits ""D"", ""E"", ""AE"" and ""AF"": 17 cuts on my wife's right side of the jacket (9 cuts) and jumper (8 cuts) where she sustained no injury: All injuries, which my wife sustained during the incident, are on the left-hand-side of her body. The most of them are scattered on the left side of her back, and the top and front part of her left shoulder. The issue how the cuts on the jacket and jumper can be on the opposite side, the prosecutor explained as if the jacket was pulled from the right to the left side, hence the cats on the right side (T:1966-7;43-7). Issue: This explanation is out of sense for the following reasons. First, my wife was not wearing the jacket at the time of the incident (T:142;33); she took it off before entering the car and placed it on the back seat. Second, the jacket in no circumstances could be pulled from the right to the left side so much to align cuts on the right side with the stabbing marks on the left side of my wife's body. Third, if hypothetically the jacket and jumper would be pulled from right to left, then the hand pulling the clothes would be holding the sites where the cuts were made preventing the alleged cuts to be made. To understand this see the position of the cuts on the jacket and the jumper (exhibit ""AE"", Jacket front, photos 121 and 122, Jacket, back, photos 124 and 125, Jumper front, photos 96 and 97, Jumper back, photos 101,102 and 105) and the injuries on my wife (to her front, Exhibit H, photos 13 and 14 and back photos 16 and 17); see 6 photographs enclosed as Annexure, pages 38-43. Forth, my wife sustained 1st and all injuries (21) 1st to her back.26 However, on the back of the jacket (Annexure, page 42) there are only 4 cuts, 2 in the middle and 2 on the right shoulder, where my wife did not sustain any injury. In addition there are no cuts at the right back side of the jumper (Annexure, page 43). Fifth, the cuts on the outer layer (the jacket, all 10-15 mm in length, Exhibit ""AE"" photos 122 and 125 Detective Windas T: 1242-43) are significantly smaller than those on the inner layer (the jumper, 60,40, 25, 25,10,20,15 and 20 mm in length, Exhibit ""AE"" photos 96,97 and 105, Detective Windas T:1243-47). Argument: The cuts on the outer layer cannot be smaller than those on the inner layer. Those cuts, on the jacket and the jumper right side, were made by police after the incident and the jacket was blood-drenched. The effect of the added evidence: by putting additional cuts on and blood-staining of my wife's jacket and jumper my wife's injuries and the whole incident seemed much more revolting to the jury. My endeavours to prove these discrepancies during the trial put me in even more disadvantageous position in the eyes of the jury.

[footnote omitted]


	
	There are a number of reasons why the first part of ground two does not lead me to refer the conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal, or order an inquiry.
	
	
	The first is that, having neither the benefit of the trial transcript, nor photographs of the exhibits, nor the summing-up, it is very difficult for me to assess the merits of this ground properly.
	
	
	The second is that it can be seen that this complaint about the exhibits was also made in the appeal against conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal. It was dealt with at length in the Court of Criminal Appeal: see Cvetkovic v R [2010] NSWCCA 329 at [184]-[187]. There is nothing to suggest that any new material is contained in what has been placed before me. Nor is anything special established. Pursuant to s 79(3)(a)(i) of the Act, I decline to reconsider the question of these exhibits.
	
	
	The third is as follows. As Simpson and Whealy JJ (as their Honours then were) remarked in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the issue at trial was in truth extremely simple: had the Crown proven beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was acting voluntarily (in the sense of performing willed movements of his muscles) when he repeatedly stabbed the deceased? There was never the slightest dispute that it was the applicant who stabbed the victim, and who inflicted multiple wounds upon her person. For that reason, detailed analysis of (for example) photographs of the clothing of the victim, in an effort to discern whether there is some discrepancy between the description of the location of her injuries and damage to her clothing, is irrelevant to the issue that has been litigated over many years between the Crown and the applicant.
	
	
	The fourth is because the mere fact that, at trial, an accused person asserts that a relevant exhibit is misleading, or has been tampered with, or indeed is wholly false, is not a basis for objection, and for the tender of the exhibit being rejected. Commonly enough, accused persons dispute the Crown case, including exhibits that are tendered as part of it. In that sense, the complaint of the applicant that some exhibits should have been ruled inadmissible because of their falsity is misconceived. Rather, it was a matter of the applicant at trial disputing the authenticity of the exhibits before the jury, and making submissions to the jury as to why they would not accept their accuracy.
	
	
	For those reasons, the first basis of ground two does not lead me to refer the conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal or order an inquiry.
	
	
	The second basis of ground two is the assertion that the trial judge was actually biased against the applicant. For a number of reasons, I decline to refer the conviction or order an inquiry on the basis of that submission.
	
	
	The first is that I have no transcript of the pre-trial hearings, or of the proceedings after arraignment.
	
	
	The second is that precisely the same submission was made to, and rejected by, the Court of Criminal Appeal over five years ago. Indeed, more extensive complaints were made in that forum about the conduct of the trial by her Honour. A ground asserting wrong interlocutory decisions was dealt with between [197] and [374] of the judgment of Campbell JA. A ground asserting that there had been a miscarriage of justice, including as a result of the alleged unfairness of the conduct of the trial judge, was dealt with between [375] and [419]. In particular, a complaint of misconduct or actual bias was dealt with at [376] to [385] of the judgment of his Honour. Again, no special fact or circumstance is relied upon that would cause me to revisit those questions.
	
	
	For that reason, I would exercise my discretion pursuant to s 79(3)(a)(i) of the Act to decline to deal with this aspect of ground two.
	
	
	Thirdly, it is well-established that procedural or legal failings in a trial or proceedings on sentence can found a referral pursuant to the Act: see Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; (2003) 214 CLR 318 and Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383. Nevertheless, the circumstances of this matter include that the trial took place approaching seven years ago. There has been a fully litigated conviction appeal, along with a rejected application for special leave to the High Court. In those circumstances, I consider that my focus must surely be upon whether I have a doubt or a sense of unease about the correctness of the conviction – in the sense of whether or not the applicant is actually guilty of the offence of which he was convicted – rather than upon asserted legal or procedural failings in the trial that led to that conviction.
	
	
	In short, nothing in the second basis of ground two leads me to experience unease or a sense of disquiet and refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal or order an inquiry.
	


Conclusion with regard to conviction


	
	In summary then, with regard to the application for referral of the conviction, nothing placed before me, either individually or in combination, leaves me with a sense of unease or disquiet about the fact that the applicant has been convicted of the offence of wounding with intent to murder. For that reason, I do not propose to refer the conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal or order an inquiry.
	
	
	I turn now to discuss the grounds for referral of the sentence.
	


Ground three - sentence


	
	It can be seen that this ground is, in a nutshell, an assertion that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive, in that 10 mitigating features and 6 “additional objective or subjective” features were given either inadequate weight or no weight by her Honour. It is also said that a comparison of the sentence imposed upon the applicant with sentences imposed upon other offenders for the same offence supports the same proposition.
	
	
	There are a number of problems with this ground.
	
	
	The first is that, as I have said, I have neither the proceedings on sentence nor the remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The second is that, as the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of 3 April 2013 demonstrates, the following grounds of appeal against sentence were notified and pressed:
	


Ground 1

The trial judge erred in finding that the objective seriousness of the offence was of high range.

Ground 2

The trial judge erred in fact by:

(a) placing insufficient weight on the fact that the Applicant also harmed himself seriously;

(b) placing too much weight on premeditation, when the premeditation was just background thought, and the Applicant was extensively endeavouring to get on with his life;

(c) placing insufficient weight on the evidence that 30 hours before the incident the Applicant was in 2 states of mind, one thinking of harming himself and his wife and second extensively reorganising his life to get on with it;

(d) placing insufficient weight on the evidence that immediately before the incident the Applicant offered to drive, which is inconsistent with the harm which happened only minutes thereafter;

(e) failing to recognise that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial: the incident with the victim lasted less than 2 minutes, the wounds on the victim, whilst being many in number, the most of them were superficial, scattered at the top left side of the back and the left shoulder. The victim did not sustain any permanent injury, was discharged from the hospital 8 days after the incident, and was back to work 11 days thereafter. The seriousness of the injury and emotional harm is of low to mid range.

(f) placing to much weight on the victim's impact statement and ignoring the fact that the victim did not sustain any permanent injury, was discharged form the hospital 8 days after the incident, and was back to work 11 days thereafter;

(g) placing insufficient weight on the fact that the Applicant did express his remorse for the incident in his interview with police shortly after the incident, using words ""/ am really sorry that I caused a public disaster.""

(h) placing insufficient weight on the evidence that during the incident the Applicant was in a dazzling state of mind and in shock, barely aware and in control of what was happening;

(i) placing insufficient weight on the psychiatric evidence on depression and that both psychiatrists agreed that it was the depression which caused loss of control and was the underlying cause of the incident.

Ground 4

The trial judge erred in including, or not excluding, general deterrence as it has little, if any, weight, as the Applicant was suffering from the major depressive illness at the relevant time and as such was not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.

Ground 5

The sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly excessive and unduly harsh. The trial judge erred in ignoring or not considering length of sentence given in other similar cases ranging from full term 7 to 10.8 years, non-parole 5 to 8 years. The applicant relies on 6 such cases.


	
	As for ground 3, although not quoted in the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment or otherwise provided in verbatim form to me, one can reconstruct it from that judgment as follows:
	


Ground 3 alleges that the trial judge erred in not allowing a discount to the sentence for a series of alleged mitigating factors.

Ground 3(a) alleges that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial.

Ground 3(b) alleges that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.

Ground 3(c) alleges that the applicant was acting under duress.

Ground 3(d) relies upon the fact that the applicant does not have any record of previous convictions.

Ground 3(e) alleges that the applicant was a person of good character.

Ground 3(f) alleges that the applicant is unlikely to re-offend.

Ground 3(g) is that the applicant has good prospects of rehabilitation.

Ground 3(h) relies on the remorse allegedly shown by the applicant.

Ground 3(i) alleges that the applicant was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of his major depressive illness.

Ground 3(j) is the degree of the pre-trial disclosure by the applicant and assistance to law enforcement authorities.


	
	In other words, it can be seen that the applicant has already litigated, in great detail, this very question of aggravating and mitigating features in the Court of Criminal Appeal. He has also litigated the question of comparative sentences. He points to no special circumstances or facts. In the circumstances, I would exercise my discretion under s 79(3)(a)(i) of the Act not to deal with that again.
	
	
	The third is that, assuming I am wrong in my approach above, and should contingently consider the mitigating factors and additional objective or subjective features to which the applicant refers at pp 21 to 23 of his submissions, they are hardly persuasive. To give but one example, he has submitted that the effects of his crime upon the victim were “not substantial”. In the circumstances that I have outlined, not least of which is the photograph of the injuries to the victim that the applicant himself placed before me, that submission must be peremptorily rejected.
	
	
	The fourth is that it was inevitable, in all of the circumstances that I have briefly summarised, that the applicant would be sentenced to a very long period of imprisonment. Neither the factors to which the applicant invites attention nor the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in other matters to which the applicant refers create in me the requisite mental state with regard to whether the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	In short, nothing in the third ground leads me to the view that I should have a sense of doubt or disquiet about the sentence imposed, and I would not refer the matter on the basis of it, nor order an inquiry.
	


Ground four - sentence


	
	As can be seen, this is an assertion that, because of the depressive illness from which the applicant claims he was suffering at the time, general deterrence had “little, if any weight”. Again, there are a number of problems with this submission.
	
	
	The first is the absence of the proceedings on sentence, and especially the remarks on sentence, from the filed material.
	
	
	The second is that this contention has been comprehensively and explicitly litigated before the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2013, which rejected it: see Cvetkovic v R [2013] NSWCCA 66 at [44] - [53], and ground 2(i) extracted above. Neither a special fact nor special circumstance is established. For that reason, I exercise my power under s 79(3)(a)(i) of the Act not to deal with the question.
	
	
	The third is that, assuming I am wrong in the above approach, I reject the proposition that, merely because the applicant was suffering from a depressive illness at the time he stabbed his wife 30 times with the intention of murdering her, general deterrence had “little if any” role to play in sentence.
	
	
	For those reasons, I do not propose to refer the sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal or order an inquiry on the basis of ground four.
	


Ground five - sentence


	
	It can be seen that this ground is founded upon the well-known decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
	
	
	In his written submissions, the applicant has simply said this:
	


[107] The trial judge erred in setting up standard non-parole period for my alleged offence within the mining of the HCA Muldrock's case. I did not pursue that claim in my appeal with the NSWCCA on 05 March 2013 as I did not know what meaning would it have on my case. Today I still do not know what effect it would have on my case, I kindly appeal to the court to consider my case in line with the Muldrock's case.


	
	As I have said, neither party has provided me with the entirety of the remarks on sentence. Counsel for the Attorney-General has, however, extracted what her Honour said about the question in the remarks on sentence. At par 94 of the written submissions it is said:
	


94. On 7 August 2009, during the District Court sentence proceedings, Judge Sweeney said the following:

""Having assessed the offence as in the high range of seriousness, and noting the standard non-parole period prescribed at 10 years for an offence in the mid range of seriousness after trial, and there being no reasons which have been advanced to me or are apparent from the circumstances of the offence or offender to depart from the standard non-parole period, the non-parole period I fix must be more than the standard non-parole period of 10 years.""

[footnote omitted]


	
	On its face, that portion of the remarks on sentence is strongly suggestive of a “Muldrock error”. Counsel for the Attorney-General does not submit otherwise.
	
	
	Counsel goes on, however, to submit that one can see that the Court of Criminal Appeal dealt with that question, despite the fact that (as can be seen from the grounds of the sentence appeal that I have extracted) “Muldrock error” did not form the basis of any ground of appeal. The written submissions point to [74] of the judgment of McCallum J (in which Price and Schmidt JJ agreed), where the following was said:
	


The six cases identified by the applicant in support of this ground must be considered with those principles in mind. Each was a case of wounding with intent to murder, carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. It may be noted, however, that five of the six were determined prior to the introduction of standard non-parole periods, which came into force on 22 November 2002: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002, schedule 1[4]. The standard non-parole period of 10 years for the offence of wounding with intent to murder now stands as a second legislative guidepost (in addition to the maximum penalty of 25 years) to which the court must have regard among the full range of factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence: Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27].


	
	In short it was said for the Attorney-General that, although there was a “Muldrock error” at first instance, it has already been determined to have been of no moment by the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	To my mind, that submission is open to serious question. Reading [74] as a whole and in the context of the entire judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, it does not appear to be a reference to what the learned sentencing judge at first instance said about standard non-parole periods; indeed, the passage of the remarks on sentence to which I have referred is not quoted in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal. Rather, I consider that [74] could well be making the point that a comparison of a sentence that was subject to the regime of standard non-parole periods with other sentences imposed for the same offence before that regime commenced must be undertaken cautiously; such an approach is uncontroversial, and has often been adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal: see Pfitzner v R [2010] NSWCCA 314 at [43].
	
	
	On the material placed before me, I consider that there is a possibility that a “Muldrock error” occurred with regard to this sentence, which was, it should be noted, imposed after a trial in 2009, and therefore after the judgment in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, and before the judgment in Muldrock v The Queen. 
	
	
	I also consider that there is a possibility that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not considered that potential error (that could not be the subject of any complaint by the applicant, because “Muldrock error” was neither notified nor argued by the self-represented applicant as a ground of appeal against sentence).
	
	
	I do not believe, however, that I can be determinative about the question. That is for the simple reason that I do not have the entirety of the remarks on sentence. It is well established that, in order to determine whether a “Muldrock error” has indeed occurred, it is essential for one to have regard to the entirety of the remarks on sentence: see, for example, Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153 at [31]; and Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [43].
	
	
	In short, on the material provided to me, I am not prepared to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the basis that an uncorrected “Muldrock error” occurred at first instance. Although I think that that is possible, I decline to burden that court when an analysis of the complete remarks on sentence may show that there was no such error at all.
	
	
	Instead, I defer this aspect of the matter, and only this aspect, pursuant to s 79(3A)(c) of the Act. I invite counsel for the Attorney-General to provide both my Associate and the applicant with a complete copy of the proceedings on sentence and the remarks on sentence. Thereafter, I invite brief written submissions from both parties within four weeks of the provision of those materials, focused only on the question of “Muldrock error” at first instance, and whether it has been determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	


Further ground - sentence


	
	This submission relies upon a document entitled “Provisional Order for Restitution” on the letterhead of “Victims Services”, which is expressed to be within the Department of Attorney-General & Justice. In short, it is a letter from the Acting Commissioner of Victims Rights to the applicant dated 11 May 2015 showing that the victim received victims support payments in a total sum of $10,000.
	
	
	The applicant relies upon the document in support of the proposition that “it throws a different light on circumstances which existed at the time of sentence”. In written submissions he submits that the victim was only awarded $10,000, out of a maximum available of $50,000. He submits that one can therefore infer that the harm done to the victim must have been in the “low range”.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this submission, it will be appreciated that I have been told nothing of the background to that document, or the statutory structure, or other payments that may have been made to the victim, or any other sources of recompense or support that she may have had. Shorn of context, the document falls a long way short of leading me to possess a sense of unease or disquiet about the sentence imposed.
	
	
	Separately, as I have said, one is entitled to reject without lengthy consideration the proposition that a woman who was stabbed thirty times by her husband with an intent to murder her suffered harm that was “low range”.
	
	
	For those reasons, I do not intend to refer the sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal, or order an inquiry, on the basis of that document.
	


Conclusion - sentence


	
	On the entirety of the material placed before me so far, I have no sense of disquiet or unease about the sentence imposed.
	
	
	As part of that, I am unable to come to any settled view about the possibility of an uncorrected “Muldrock error”, not having had the benefit of the entire proceedings on sentence and remarks on sentence.
	


Conclusion - both aspects


	
	Accordingly, I do not propose to refer either the conviction or the sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal, or to order an inquiry.
	
	
	I do consider, however, that the question of “Muldrock error” allegedly affecting the sentence should be deferred, pending receipt of further material. To be clear: I defer no other aspect of the matter.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	The application of Dragan Cvetkovic of 25 June 2015 pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) is refused, except in accordance with order 2.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 79(3A)(c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), the application is deferred for further consideration by me, but only with regard to the issue of whether a “Muldrock error” affected the sentence at first instance.

2769022,O’Connell v R [2016] NSWCCA 43,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Fullerton J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Fullerton J.
	
	
	FULLERTON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal a sentence imposed by Maiden DCJ on 12 May 2014 following his pleas of guilty to multiple charges involving sexual assaults of two children in separate incidents between 2010 and 2013 contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and his use of both children, also in separate incidents, for the production of child abuse material and for pornographic purposes contrary to s 91G(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The applicant also invited the sentencing judge to take into account on sentence further offences against s 91 of the Crimes Act in two Forms 1.
	
	
	The applicable maximum penalties for each of the counts on the indictment ranged from 10 to 14 years. In respect of the two counts of aggravated indecent assault on the two children (aged respectively 9 and 12 years) under s 61M(2), a standard non-parole period of 8 years applies.
	
	
	After allowing a discount of 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty, separate sentences were imposed on each of the five counts on the indictment, with the offences on the Forms 1 taken into account on counts 2 and 5 as follows:
	


The offences involving the child TM aged 9 years

1. Aggravated indecent assault on a person under 16 years contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act.

2 Using a child under 14 years for pornographic purposes contrary to s 91G(1) of the Crimes Act (since amended).

Concurrent sentences of 3 years 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months and 21 days.

The offences involving the child KT aged 12 years

3. Aggravated indecent assault on a person under 16 years contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act.

4. Using a child under 14 years of age for the production of child abuse material contrary to s 91G(l)(a) of the Crimes Act.

5. Producing child abuse material contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act.

Concurrent sentences of 4 years 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years 11 months and 19 days.


	
	Although neither the Crown nor the applicant’s counsel addressed the sentencing judge on the issue of special circumstances, in respect of each of the individual sentences set out above the sentencing judge altered the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term provided for in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to 66 per cent.
	
	
	After orders were made for partial accumulation of the two concurrent sentences, a total effective sentence of 5 years 6 months imprisonment was imposed comprised of a non-parole period of 3 years 11 months and 19 days, representing between 72 and 73 per cent of the overall sentence.
	


The sole ground of appeal


	
	The sole ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in failing to give practical effect to his finding of special circumstances when imposing the total effective sentence, and that on re-sentence this Court would find special circumstances and impose a total effective sentence to reflect that finding.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that even accepting that his Honour appears to have intended that the finding of special circumstances should translate into the aggregate sentence (which, in the Crown’s submission, is by no means clear) and even accepting that this is a sentencing error requiring the applicant to be re-sentenced, this Court would come to the positive finding under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) that no other sentence than that imposed by the sentencing judge as the total effective sentence was warranted at law.
	
	
	In the Crown’s submission, the appeal should be dismissed because there was no principled basis upon which a finding of special circumstances could have been made by the sentencing judge and, although there is no Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the individual sentences where that finding was given effect to, this Court would not, in the exercise of its sentencing discretion, allow for an extended period of supervision on parole, there being nothing in the material before the sentencing judge or relied upon by the applicant on re-sentence which would justify a lowering of the effective non-parole period below the statutory ratio.
	


The proceedings on sentence


	
	With the issue on the appeal being confined in that way, it is unnecessary to detail the course of the applicant’s offending against two young girls, each of whom were entrusted to his care by their parents being friends of his daughter, as set out in the agreed facts tendered on sentence. In summary, the assault of the younger victim involved the applicant placing his erect penis at her mons pubis. He then exposed her genitalia by lowering her pajamas where he photographed her genitals and one of her exposed buttocks. Three years later, the assault on the 12-year-old victim involved the applicant putting his mouth on the outside of her genitals and kissing her on the mouth. On a separate occasion, he had her dress in lingerie and then photographed her.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found the objective seriousness of the offending across all offences ranged between high mid-range offending and offending at the high range. There is no challenge to that finding.
	
	
	His Honour also had appropriate regard to victim impact statements from both young girls.
	
	
	The applicant tendered a report from Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, and a testimonial from Craig Terence Anderson, a long-standing friend, who said that the applicant has expressed remorse for his actions and is intent on “getting his life back on track”, which Mr Anderson expresses confidence the applicant will succeed in doing.
	
	
	Insofar as the applicant’s personal history is concerned, Dr Westmore noted the applicant’s stable family life, his educational achievements and his work history. He was working as a supplier of medical products for 13 years before leaving that position two months prior to his examination in Dr Westmore’s rooms in the weeks preceding sentence.
	
	
	Dr Westmore noted the applicant’s self-reported psychosocial history and concluded that he appeared to be adult-focused in his sexual interests but that he developed sexual thoughts, feelings and impulses towards under-aged girls, including pre-pubescent and probably teenage girls, after exposure to pornography on the internet.
	
	
	Dr Westmore went on to observe:
	


His [offending] behaviour has not only incorporated actions and activities involving two underage victims, but there are also images and internet material consistent with this particular theme.

I note he is now aged 46 and if he did suffer from the condition, Paedophilia, then I would have expected an earlier expression of this sexual orientation/condition prior to him turning age 46.

There are clearly limits associated with a single cross-sectional interview, but [the applicant], in a spontaneous way, expressed quite a comprehensive understanding about why his actions were wrong and he also has insight into why his actions and are wrong and he also has insight into the damaging aspects of the offending behaviour. He continues to have ongoing support from his family of origin and he is, as noted, probably of above average intelligence. He does not have an Antisocial Personality Disorder.

[The applicant] was also able to say that he had wondered, before being apprehended, how he might seek assistance for the emerging and inappropriate thoughts, feelings and impulses to act in a sexual way towards underage girls. He said however he was in a dilemma because if he reported having those sorts of feelings or having acted in that way towards the victims, then there would be a need for the offending behaviour to be reported and clearly, at that stage, he did not want that to occur, because of the inevitable legal consequences.

I do think this man is going to be a very good candidate for a Sex Offenders’ Programme. I think he is well motivated to attend such a programme, he will be able to relate to the programme from a psychological perspective and I think he will participate well in the programme. While predicting future risks is always difficult and it should always be qualified by the mental health professional, if [the applicant] can successfully participate in and complete a Sex Offenders’ Programme, whether this be within a prison system or outside a prison system, then I think his risks of re-offending will be significantly reduced.


	
	The applicant gave evidence on sentence that he was remorseful and acknowledged the repeated breaches of trust in his sexual abuse of the two young girls. He gave evidence that he knew he had a problem before he offended but did not know how to get help. On the other hand, he denied having sexualised feelings towards prepubescent girls and could offer no rational or logical reason for his offending. I note he reported to Dr Westmore that he had accessed internet sites depicting prepubescent girls before he committed the offences on indictment. It would seem this offending was the subject of the offences on the Forms 1. The applicant did admit the offending gave him a degree of sexual gratification but he denied planning the offences. That said, the applicant’s admitted conduct the subject of the charges under s 91G of the Crimes Act which involved him taking photographs of the genitalia of the girls when they were sleeping does not indicate impulsive or opportunistic offending.
	
	
	The applicant also gave evidence that he was willing to undertake the sex offender program recommended by Dr Westmore and that he has the support of his parents and the offer of employment upon his release from custody.
	


The finding of special circumstances


	
	The sentencing judge made reference to special circumstances in two passages in his sentencing reasons. Immediately after he referred to the discounts for the pleas of guilty he said he would find special circumstances, a finding which he said he would develop after considering the applicant’s subjective circumstances.
	
	
	After referring to the applicant’s expressions of remorse as reported upon by Dr Westmore, and the applicant’s evidence of remorse, the sentencing judge said:
	


The offender gave evidence before this court and in respect of his repeated remorse to the Court and to the victims, it was apparent to the Court that he is a person who is intelligent and that he is a person who is prepared to seek assistance in the future regarding his dysfunctional behaviours. What the Court cannot be satisfied of is, however, that he fully understands the injury and hurt that he has caused to both victims and to the friends and family of those particular young women. In terms of the need for photographing and the need for the photographing to be done when the children were sleeping, his explanation to my mind was unsatisfactory. There is no evidence that the taking of the photographs was to be used at a later time or for any other commercial or other purpose but there is no reason for it and the Court cannot find other than that the photographs were there, that this in any way amplifies his offending behaviours but it certainly does highlight the need for him to have assistance probably much greater than he suspects or is prepared to acknowledge at this point of time.

The offender stated that his words in respect of remorse most certainly and that he was completely in breach of trust and, as I have said, expressed his acknowledgement of his actions to them. At that time, those words being said, the reaction of this particular judicial officer was that words are not enough and I will dismiss from these reasons and from my decision any personal feelings that I may have or reaction to the evidence that he gave. I do however find that he has expressed remorse and that at least he has started to rehabilitate himself by acknowledging the need for such assistance in the future, that is, that he will start upon the well-known course for sexual offenders administrated by the Corrective Services organisation. That being so, I am of the view that I will make a finding of special circumstances and that I will then recommend that he commence those course or courses that may be appropriate to him to that service.


	
	His Honour’s reasons for finding special circumstances seem to be for the purposes of rehabilitation based exclusively on the applicant’s acknowledgment that he needs professional intervention to address his paraphilia in the future, and his willingness to participate in a sex offender program whist in custody as a first step in that process.
	
	
	It is clear that the applicant’s willingness to access custody-based programs per se could not justify a finding of special circumstances under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act since it operates to extend the period of supervision on parole. The Crown also emphasised there was no evidence led on sentence as to how or why the applicant's participation in a community-based treatment program on his release requires any extension of the period under supervision, and nothing in the remarks on sentence to suggest that his Honour considered that question. It follows, in the Crown’s submission, that the applicant has received the benefit of a finding of special circumstances in the structure of the individual sentences to which he was not entitled and, even if his Honour might have intended that after partial accumulation the ratio of the effective non-parole period to the total effective term should also be adjusted, this Court would not make that adjustment.
	
	
	I note that there is nothing in the sentencing remarks or in his Honour’s dialogue with the parties in the process of his Honour fixing the ratios between the non-parole period and the balance of term in the individual sentences, including in the calculus that he appeared to employ after withdrawing to his chambers, that gives any insight into whether he turned his mind to whether his finding of special circumstances should also be reflected in the total effective sentence. It may be that the ultimate adjustment in the total effective sentence, by a measure of between 72 and 73 per cent was what his Honour intended. However, if that were the case it would be reasonable to expect he would have said so.
	
	
	In CM v R [2013] NSWCCA 341 the Court considered a ground of appeal the same as this one. R A Hulme J said:
	


[39] A finding of special circumstances does not compel a variation in the non-parole period. But if no variation is made, a judge is expected to give reasons as to why the finding is not being reflected in the ultimate term: Saad v R [2007] NSWCCA 98 at [33]-[36]; Heron v R [2006] NSWCCA 215 at [31]-[32]. This Court may also intervene where the result of accumulation of multiple sentences is to remove the effect of a finding of special circumstances: Stoeski v R [2008] NSWCCA 230 at [25]; Cicekdag v R [2007] NSWCCA 218 at [47]-[49].

[40] Where there is no adjustment of the 3:1 ratio of non-parole period to parole period reflect in the overall term, it may either reflect what the sentencing judge specifically intended, or it may be the result of inadvertence or miscalculation. A recent example of the former may be found in Houri v R [2013] NSWCCA 279; see also Phipps v R [2008] NSWCCA 178; and Stoeski. Examples of both varieties of the latter can be found in the cases collected by McClellan CJ at CL in Fina'i v R [2006] NSWCCA 134 at [31]-[40]. Appeals asserting such error are not uncommon, and as Howie AJ remarked in Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247 at [24], their success will often ""depend upon what can be gleaned of the Judge's intention from the sentencing remarks"".


	
	Despite the fact that the parties had made no submissions on the issue of special circumstances at all, and despite the absence of any clearly articulated reasons for the finding of special circumstances that was made or whether it should translate into the effective sentences after the individual sentences were partially accumulated, I am prepared to accept that his Honour did intend that there should be the same adjustment in the statutory ratio, and that his failure to make allowance for it must have been through oversight or miscalculation or both.
	
	
	That being the case, the applicant has made out a sentencing error that requires this Court to apply s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	Since the appeal is limited to the question whether the sentencing judge erred in failing to adjust the non-parole period in accordance with his conclusion that special circumstances warranted such an adjustment pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, it is not necessary for this Court to consider whether the non-parole period and the additional term, taken together, were affected by an error of law. The only question for this Court was the propriety of the proportion of the sentence constituted by the non-parole period. Accordingly, it is necessary for this Court, in accordance with the principles in Kentwell v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 96, to independently consider the application of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to the applicant’s sentence and, in substance, if a lesser non-parole period should have been imposed, quash the sentence and pass the appropriately adjusted sentence.
	


The evidence on re-sentence


	
	The applicant swore an affidavit which was read on sentence. In it he confirmed his willingness to enrol in the custody-based intensive treatment sex offender program (CUBIT) but said that he was told he was not a suitable candidate because he had been assessed at a low risk of reoffending. He also detailed two occasions when, as a young boy, he was indecently assaulted by members of the clergy at a Catholic college which he appears to suggest may explain his offending against the two young girls. He said he has written to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse about the assault and has been interviewed. He restated his remorse and apologies for the harm he has caused his victims.
	
	
	Having considered the material upon which the applicant relies on re-sentence, I am not persuaded that this Court should intervene and reduce the minimum time the applicant is to serve in custody by extending the time he will be under supervision on parole, even if only by the margin of five months the applicant proposes. That is, I am unable to come to the positive finding that some other sentence is warranted in law under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	In my view, the evidence at the sentencing hearing, as supplemented by the evidence of re-sentence upon which the applicant relies in this Court, does not allow for a finding of special circumstances - a finding of fact that in the first instance has to be resolved in the applicant’s favour if this Court is to intervene and allow for a further adjustment in the statutory ratio. I note it is not suggested by the applicant’s counsel that the order for partial accumulation of one year should attract a finding of special circumstances, and neither could it have been when the measure of accumulation was so modest for two distinct courses of very serious offending separated by three years. Neither is it suggested that there is any other basis the finding other than the applicant’s continued preparedness to seek treatment.
	
	
	Although the sentencing judge found that treatment would facilitate the applicant’s rehabilitation, and implemented the finding of special circumstances in the adjustments he made to the statutory ratios in the individual sentences for that reason, it is not a finding by which this Court is bound. For my part, I can find nothing in the evidence, or anything put by way of submission, addressing why the applicant’s continued willingness to seek treatment in the community will better enhance his prospects of rehabilitation as to which he appears to have made good progress in prison, incidentally leading to the inference that no extended period under supervision would be needed at the expiry of the non-parole period.
	
	
	I do not accept that that what appears to be his positive progress in the process of his rehabilitation to date, including taking education courses and attending church and maintaining his relationship with family and friends, in combination with what he reports as his low risk of his reoffending and the unavailability of a custody-based program for that reason, qualifies as a special circumstance for the purposes of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Even if a finding of special circumstances were available, I am not satisfied that that any further adjustment of the statutory ratio in the total effective sentence from between 72 per cent to 66 per cent, the effect of which would be to reduce the effective non-parole period by five months, would be justified in this case (the discretionary question). Even where special circumstances exist, a sentencing court is not obliged to alter the ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence. The question for the sentencing court is whether a longer period of supervision in the community should be allowed. In this case I am not persuaded it should be.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I would propose the following orders:
	


1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.

		18 March 2016",2016-03-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769025,Fuller v R [2016] NSWDC 31,"Judgment


	
	John Fuller (the appellant) appealed against findings of guilt in respect of two offences allegedly committed by him on 3 March 2014. The two offences were “offensive conduct whilst on inclosed lands”, particularly on the property of Greater Lithgow City Council (“the Council”) chambers (s 4A Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901) and a charge of “intimidate intending to cause fear of physical or mental harm committed towards Marie Statham” (“the Mayor”) (s 13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007).
	
	
	In respect of the first matter, the particulars in the Court Attendance Notice are that the appellant remained upon the inclosed lands of the Council at 180 Mort Street Lithgow after being requested by Roger Bailey, the General Manager in charge of the said lands, to leave those lands, and while remaining upon the said lands did conduct himself in a manner as would be regarded, in the circumstances, as offensive by a reasonable person. This is alleged to have occurred in the Council chamber in the course of a meeting of the Council in the presence of members of the public.
	
	
	The second charge was related to threatening conduct towards the Mayor. This allegedly occurred in the committee room adjacent to the chamber after the meeting of the Council was adjourned.
	
	
	The prosecution must prove the guilt of the accused of each allegation beyond reasonable doubt. The accused has no onus upon him at all. The burden of proof of guilt, never shifts to a defendant.
	
	
	There was an extensive hearing before the learned Magistrate at Lithgow Local Court on 6 February and 29 May 2015. I have read the transcript of those proceedings and the judgment of the learned Magistrate which I take into account in accordance with the decision of Charara ([2006] NSWCCA 244). I have read the documentary exhibits and listened to the recording of the proceedings within the Council chamber concerned primarily with the offence relating to inclosed lands, but related in time to the matters giving rise to the intimidation charge.
	
	
	At the Local Court there was also oral evidence from Roger Bailey, the General Manager of Lithgow City Council, Andrew Muir, a long-time employee and Councillors including Marie Statham, the Mayor, and Peter Pilbeam, a Councillor present at both the meeting in the chamber and the subsequent confrontation in the committee room giving rise to the charge of intimidation. A number of documentary exhibits were admitted particularly a recording (originally for Council meeting purposes) of part of the appellant’s interventions and his ejection from the Council’s meeting. The appellant gave evidence. He represented himself.
	
	
	With regard to the relevant findings of the Magistrate concerning matters in respect of which he has an advantage over the reading of the written word, I note that so far as the Councillors and employees were concerned they … “each impressed … as a witness who was not prone to embellish or exaggerate what took place firstly in the chamber and secondly in the committee room. Each gave an account of a very aggressive, hostile, menacing person who was burning with rage at his perception of the council having been astonishingly inactive in their efforts to fix what he considers to be this problem on his property”.
	
	
	The Magistrate noted in the hearing of the matter, as with the hearing of the matter in this court, that within the chamber, there was no “issue” that the appellant “audibly yelled in a way that could for any person be described as objectionable … discourteous, impolite, unmannerly”.
	
	
	The Magistrate noted in the hearing of the matter at the Local Court that the appellant had been “belligerent” and … “to say that (he) has been discourteous is an understatement”. Likewise, “to say he has been aggressive, combative, bellicose or antagonistic is an understatement. He has in the conduct of these proceedings throughout been entirely offensive”. The observations of the Magistrate about the conduct of the appellant at the Local Court I have ignored, bearing in mind that generally speaking throughout the conduct of the current proceedings he has generally been courteous. Applications he has made for adjournment and the like have been generally reasonable. Likewise I do not take into account the Magistrate’s comments about the way the appellant conducted his case before the Local Court other than as it reflected concessions or “admissions” as to relevant facts.
	
	
	The matter came before me at the Bathurst District Court but was unable to proceed for several reasons which are now of no moment. Rather than leave the matter at Bathurst, bearing in mind I had read the transcript and listened to and read the exhibits in anticipation of dealing with the appeal later in the sittings, the matter was transferred to Sydney. It was further delayed to enable the appellant to seek legal aid from the Legal Aid Commission.
	
	
	When the matter came back before me to proceed the appellant appeared unrepresented, his legal aid appeal rights having been exhausted. I heard submissions from him on the material available to the Local Court on Friday 26 February 2016. I made orders dismissing the appeals and then dealt with a related severity appeal. I indicated I would publish my reasons later, which I now do, because I was part heard in a criminal trial and had sentence matters waiting to be heard that same afternoon.
	
	
	The appellant had sought to lead fresh or additional evidence which application was refused at Bathurst.
	
	
	Although I am not reviewing the learned Magistrates findings, I am required to consider the available evidence and form my own view of the matter, I note his Honour’s treatment of the legal issues and find little to disagree with, but note that I am not reviewing the Magistrates treatment of legal issues.
	
	
	With regard to the offence contrary to s 4A “Inclosed Lands Protection Act” I have regard to the decision of DPP v Strange (2011) 80 NSWLR 412. I also have regard to the definition of ‘inclosed lands’ in s 3 of the Act. Having regard to his Honour’s consideration in that judgment of s 3 of the Act in that decision and what is contemplated by the legislation to be considered as “inclosed lands”, it is quite clear from his Honour’s judgment and the authorities to which his Honour refers ([41]-[75]) that the relevant area where it was alleged the offence was committed was “inclosed lands”, it being within the premises of the Council, within the “Council chamber”, where the members of the Council conducted public meetings.
	
	
	As to “offensive conduct” there is much authority on this matter (eg. Ball v McIntyre (1966) 9 FLR 237, Worcester v Smith (1951) VLR 316 (at 318), R v Smith (1974) 2 NSWLR 586, Kinney v Police (1971) NZLR 924, Jeffs v Graham (1987) 8 NSWLR 392). I am concerned with offensive conduct to a reasonable person, who is not “thin skinned” or “overly sensitive”, that is against “good taste” or “good manners”, that is “hurtful”, “abusive”, “annoying”, “displeasing” and/or “insulting”. The test for offensive conduct requires satisfaction that the conduct of the defendant was calculated to offend a reasonable person present, it is an objective test. It is not conduct punishable to “scoop up minor troubles” nor prosecute “irregular”, “inconvenient” or “exhibitionist” activity.
	
	
	The recording of part of the Council proceedings, which the appellant acknowledged recorded his voice, establishes beyond reasonable doubt, in conjunction with the appellant’s own evidence and the evidence of witnesses in the prosecution case, that at relevant times the appellant was physically within the Council Chamber, that because of continual interjections by the appellant the Council members carried a motion, after two warnings to him to behave, to eject him from the Council chamber, that Mr Bailey on the instruction of the Council members directed the appellant on the passing of the motion to leave the chamber (on at least two occasions) and the appellant declined to leave the premises. He talked over the top of people, shouting out, acting in a threatening fashion towards the General Manager when he approached the appellant to ask him to leave, shouting at the members of the Council after he was asked to leave. The recording of the relevant part of the proceedings, in the context of earlier disruptive conduct of the appellant established by the other evidence, that lead to the motion to eject him, shows clearly the agitated state of the appellant and his complete unwillingness to listen to any reason expressed to him, as well as his offensive manner of speaking towards members of the Council and the General Manager.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence in chief at the Local Court was that he raised his voice because his father (who was also present at the meeting was “deaf”) and he “forgot that (he was) dealing with normal people”. In cross examination he further stated he was not “shouting” or “ranting” but, he “may have raised his normal voice”. He expressly denied going into the committee room.
	
	
	I have taken into account the evidence given by the appellant in relation to this allegation and his submissions before me on the hearing of the appeal. His evidence in chief did not expressly deny a number of specific allegations, but sought to address his grievances with the Council. The critical issue for determination in relation to the “Inclosed Lands” offence being whether the conduct of the appellant constituted “offensive conduct”. The evidence at the Local Court about the events inside the chamber, supported by the recording which amply demonstrates the truth of the evidence of the relevant witnesses in the prosecution case, establishes that the appellant conducted himself at that time in an angry, hostile, belligerent, aggressive and menacing way. There is no doubt that his conduct within inclosed lands was clearly against “the standard of good taste or good manners”, was “hurtful”, was “threatening, abusive and insulting”. I am mindful, as the authorities make clear, that “reasonable minds may come to different conclusions” as to what a reasonable person may view of particular conduct, noting that the “so called reasonable man is reasonably tolerant and understanding”. Here the conduct was “calculated to wound the feelings, arouse anger or resentment or disgust … in the mind of the reasonable person”. It was “insulting”, “hurtful” and “against good manners”. A reasonable person would not be “thin skinned” to be offended by the words and conduct of the appellant.
	
	
	In relation to the charge of ‘intimidation’ the evidence at the Local Court also established beyond reasonable doubt that after committing the first offence, the appellant having been asked to leave the Council chambers, the Mayor, Council members and members of staff of the Council moved to the adjacent committee room, closing the door behind them. This area was an area not part of the generally accepted area allowing public access without invitation during council meetings. The belligerent, aggressive conduct of the appellant inside the chamber was demonstrated by him again when he metaphorically “burst” into the committee room and directed his aggressive conduct towards the Mayor. Her evidence was that he was “yelling and screaming” demanding to know where she was. She asked him to leave the committee room and eventually at least one of the Councillors told him to get out of the room and moved him outside the room. The Mayor said that was the first time she had been “scared” since she had been a Councillor and that she was “scared stiff”.
	
	
	The Mayor said in cross examination, in answer to a question from the appellant: “You were totally out of control, you were a rage”. She indicated that he had his arms “up” in a threatening manner in the course of asserting that it was her belief the appellant came through a door that was “closed”.
	
	
	Her account of the aggressive conduct of the appellant towards her is supported by the witnesses called in the prosecution case present. The General Manager described the appellant as “bursting” through the door suddenly, “all fired up”, approaching the Mayor and “yelling” at the Mayor who was closest to the door. The appellant was “every red in the face, eyes were very wide open”. He “lunged”, or pushed, “towards a councillor” (someone other than the Mayor) and had to be “pushed” out the door of the room. He was described as being “quite aggressive towards the Mayor and the Councillors there”, after he “burst” through the door.
	
	
	The conduct of the appellant in the committee room, was abusive, threatening, angry and a continuation of his endeavours to vent his spleen. It is to be assessed in the context of his presence, uninvited, in a room to which the Mayor and others had moved to get away from him. His conduct was deliberate, directed at the Mayor personally, calculated to cause her apprehension for her personal safety. It constituted harassment of the Mayor in circumstances where he well knew that his participation in “discussions” with Council members had been terminated because of his abusive and insulting conduct which he had steadfastly refused to stop even as he was being ejected from the Council chambers. He intended to ‘intimidate’ the Mayor as is required by s 13 of the Act. He has offered in evidence and submission no answer to these matters.
	
	
	Having regard to the terms of s 13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the totality of the evidence that the appellant intentionally acted to cause the Mayor to feel “fear of physical and mental harm”, intentionally directing his anger at the Mayor. S 7 of the Act states that intimidation “means” … “conduct amounting to harassment or molestation of or … any conduct that causes a reasonable apprehension of injury to a person, or of violence or damage to any person or property”. His conduct was clearly “harassment” of the Mayor, as well as creating a reasonable apprehension of violence to her. These matters are established beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Throughout the conduct of the appeal, as is apparent from the transcript from the conduct of the case in the Local Court, the appellant has demonstrated that he is entirely fixated with what he regards as the failure of the Council to act properly and reasonably in relation to his property at Cullen Bullen, leading he tells me to litigation in the Land and Environment Court. He has made assertions about the Council acting illegally, that members of the Council not wanting to listen to him and that in relation to these matters he had “not done anything wrong”. He said that at the Local Court and in submissions to this Court. Even during the playing of the recording of his conduct within the Council chamber at the Bathurst sittings he acted oblivious to what was self-evident and apparent from the recording. He asserts that it was quite acceptable for him to do and say what he wanted in order to make the points that he wanted to make to the Council, it not being in dispute that he was angry towards the Council and its elected representatives and staff and that he was relevantly present in the Council chamber at least. That anger manifested itself in the conduct which has been established beyond reasonable doubt to prove his guilt of each charge.
	
	
	The orders made, and reasons for penalties imposed are separately recorded on 26 February 2016.

		23 March 2016",2016-03-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769029,R v A2; R v Magennis; R v Vaziri (No. 23) [2016] NSWSC 282,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	JOHNSON J: In 1994, the Parliament in this State enacted s.45 Crimes Act 1900 for the purpose of prohibiting female genital mutilation (“FGM”). The offence was punishable by imprisonment for seven years. In 2014, Parliament increased the maximum penalty for offences under s.45 to imprisonment for 21 years. The events giving rise to this case occurred at a time when the maximum penalty was seven years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	Since 1994, there has been one case (in June 2015) where an FGM offence proceeded by way of a plea of guilty in the District Court.
	
	
	The present prosecution arises out of events between 2009 and 2012. Those events concerned what happened to two young sisters when each of them was about seven years old. Those girls have been referred to for the purpose of these proceedings as C1 and C2, not out of any disrespect, but so that their identities were protected.
	
	
	At a trial which took place between September and November 2015, a jury convicted the three Offenders of FGM offences or offences associated with FGM. The mother of the two sisters, referred to as A2 so as not to identify the young girls, was convicted of mutilating the clitoris of each young girl with those events occurring in about 2009 (in the case of C1) and in 2012 (with respect to C2).
	
	
	The Offender Kubra Magennis was convicted of mutilating the clitoris of each of C1 and C2. It was the Crown case that Kubra Magennis performed these acts upon each girl at the request of their mother, A2.
	
	
	The Offender Shabbir Vaziri was found guilty of being an accessory after the fact of the offence of mutilating the clitoris of each of C1 and C2.
	
	
	For the purpose of these proceedings, the Court has been called upon to make legal determinations in a range of areas where little (if any) precedent exists. The jury at the trial of the Offenders was the first in Australia to determine the question of guilt of persons charged with FGM offences.
	
	
	It is now the task of this Court to pass sentence upon the Offenders. As will be seen, the unusual and effectively novel circumstances of this case pose questions for this Court not often confronted in sentencing criminal offenders.
	


Facts of Offences


	
	The starting point is to make findings of fact for the purpose of sentence concerning the offences. The primary constraint is that the view of the facts adopted by me, for the purposes of sentencing, must be consistent with the verdicts of the jury: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378. The Court may not take a matter into account on sentence, in a way that is adverse to the interests of an offender, unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are matters which the offender relies upon to reduce penalty, it is enough if those matters are proved by the offender on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at 281 [27]-[28].
	
	
	It is appropriate, at the outset, to say something about the police investigation in this case.
	
	
	The events giving rise to this trial came to light when information was received by police and child protection authorities prior to 29 August 2012 concerning the commission of suspected FGM offences. As a result, an investigating approach was devised where a police officer and social worker (both female) would speak to each of C1 and C2 separately whilst at school on 29 August 2012, without notice to their parents. Each interview was video-recorded and became part of the evidence-in-chief of each child at trial. Accordingly, the jury was able to see what each girl was asked, and how each responded to questions about sensitive events, without any opportunity for others to influence what each child was to say at the interview.
	
	
	Thereafter, contact was made with A2 and her husband and they were invited to attend to speak to police and child protection officers.
	
	
	Police had secured warrants, lawfully obtained under the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW) and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth). As a result, conversations were recorded in various locations (involving, in particular, A2). Telephone conversations, between a variety of people, were recorded over a period between 29 August and 2 October 2012. The conversations which were recorded took place in a mixture of languages - English, Gujarati, Hindi and Lisan al-Dawat. A thorough process of translation was undertaken so that there was no real issue at trial concerning the transcripts (in English) which were placed before the jury without objection.
	
	
	The electronic evidence formed a critical part of the investigation, providing evidence of the spontaneous and unguarded statements of each of the Offenders (and others) concerning what had been done to C1 and C2 and how persons were to respond to the investigation.
	
	
	The methods used by police were thorough and commendable in the context of investigation of FGM offences which, it has been said, are difficult to detect, investigate and prosecute.
	


The Trial Issues


	
	The areas of contest at the trial of the Offenders were relatively confined. There was no dispute that at the places and times alleged in the indictment, the Offender Kubra Magennis used a metal instrument to come into physical contact with the genital area of each of C1 and C2. On each occasion, the Offender A2 was present and she had requested Kubra Magennis to so act. Each girl was lying on a bed naked from the waist down during the event.
	
	
	Before the trial, I had ruled that the term “mutilate” in s.45 means to injure to any extent: R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1221. The written directions to the jury on the elements of the offences included the following:
	


“3   The word ‘mutilate’, in the context of female genital mutilation, means to injure to any extent. It is not necessary for the Crown to establish that serious injury resulted. In the context of this trial, a nick or cut is capable of constituting mutilation for the purpose of this alleged offence.

4   The word ‘clitoris’ includes the clitoral hood (or prepuce).”


	
	The issues in dispute were as follows. The Crown said that, on each occasion, what was happening was a form of FGM where some injury was caused by the Offender Magennis to the clitoris of each child. The defence denied that any injury was caused to either child, with the cases of the Offenders being conducted upon the basis that, in the case of each girl, this was a form of symbolic ceremony where metal (said to be forceps) were laid upon the outside of the child’s genital area, but that no injury was caused to either child.
	
	
	The written directions to the jury identified the disputed issues to be determined by the jury as being “whether the use of an instrument by Kubra Magennis caused a cut or nick to the clitoris” of each child.
	
	
	In light of the evidence of telephone conversations to which Shabbir Vaziri was a party, senior counsel appearing for him conducted the trial upon the basis that the charges of being an accessory after the fact to the s.45 offences stood or fell upon the basis of the jury’s determination of the principal issue, namely, whether injury to the clitoris to any extent had been identified upon each girl.
	
	
	By their verdicts, the jury clearly rejected the claim that what was occurring was some symbolic ceremony not involving the infliction of any injury to each child. The facts which I now proceed to find are consistent with the verdicts of the jury.
	


The Dawoodi Bohra Community


	
	Each of the Offenders are members of the Dawoodi Bohra community in Sydney. The Dawoodi Bohra community is a world-wide subsect of Shia Islam. As will be seen, there are Dawoodi Bohra communities in many parts of the world. The principal centre for the community is Mumbai in India, where its religious leadership is based. There is a substantial Dawoodi Bohra community, as well, in Eastern Africa, in particular, Kenya.
	


A2 and Kubra Magennis


	
	A2 was born (in 1977) and raised in Kenya. She entered into an arranged marriage in 2000 and came to Australia with her husband in about 2001. She has four children, including C1 and C2.
	
	
	Although there was no evidence before the jury as to this, there is evidence in the presentence report before me which indicates that A2 herself (whilst in Kenya) was subjected as a little girl to “khatna”, described in the presentence report “as a rite of passage for girls in this culture when they reach seven years of age”. A2’s own experience sheds light upon her own approach when it came to C1 and C2, as each of them approached seven years of age. Although she did not give evidence at the trial, it is apparent from all the evidence in the trial and on sentence, that she is an intelligent and well-educated woman, having qualified as a pharmacist.
	
	
	Kubra Magennis was born in Kenya in 1943 and came to Australia in 1977, after a period residing in the United Kingdom. She is, by training and occupation, a nurse and midwife. She gave evidence at trial before the jury. Clearly, the jury rejected her evidence that these were symbolic acts only without infliction of any injury.
	
	
	Consistent with the verdicts of the jury, I am satisfied to the criminal standard that Kubra Magennis inflicted injury to the clitoris of each girl. I am satisfied that she was selected by A2 to undertake these procedures because of her training and expertise as a nurse and midwife and her membership of the Dawoodi Bohra community.
	


The Offences


	
	In about 2009 or 2010, C1 was taken by her mother, A2, to a house in Wollongong where Kubra Magennis carried out the FGM procedure on her. For this purpose, C1 was required to lie on a bed naked from the waist down.
	
	
	Present in the room were A2, who requested Kubra Magennis to carry out the procedure, together with C1’s grandmother (A5) and, from time to time, the woman who owned the home in Wollongong (A3, C1’s paternal grandaunt). Despite their efforts in evidence to minimise their knowledge of what was occurring in the bedroom, I am satisfied that each of A3 and A5 was well aware of what was happening and why. Each was aware that “khatna” was being performed involving the infliction of injury.
	
	
	Kubra Magennis used a metal instrument for the purpose of cutting or nicking the clitoris (including the clitoral hood or prepuce) of C1. The precise nature of the instrument used for this purpose has not been established. C1 described it as “like a silver tool-ish thing” which “looked a bit like a scissor” (T120). Kubra Magennis maintained that she used forceps which had been provided to her by A2. I am satisfied that whatever instrument was used, it was able to cut or nick the clitoris and that it was so used upon C1.
	
	
	In her interview on 29 August 2012, C1 said that “khatna” involved “a little cut … in your private part” and that this was what happened to her.
	
	
	I am satisfied that what was done to C1 accorded with the description given by A2 in a conversation she had with her husband, A1, which was lawfully recorded by surveillance device on the afternoon of 29 August 2012. In the course of a conversation concerning “khatna” or female circumcision, A1 asked “In us do they cut skin … or do they cut the whole clitoris?” A2 replied, “No … they just do little bit … just little” (Exhibit AH, pages 8-9).
	
	
	Further light was shed upon what was done to C1 in the evidence given at the trial by Kubra Magennis. She recounted an occasion, when she lived in London in the 1960s, when the wife of a Dawoodi Bohra cleric approached her (Magennis) as a midwife, to perform “khatna” on a girl (T1534-1635). According to Kubra Magennis, the cleric’s wife explained “khatna” - “We have a skin nick … you are a midwife, you are intelligent, you know exactly the vaginal parts …”. Kubra Magennis denied that she had carried out such a procedure then or at any other time. I am satisfied, however, that what was described in this incident explains “khatna” as performed in this case, as well as why Kubra Magennis was asked to carry out the procedure utilising, as it did, her skills as a midwife.
	
	
	When interviewed by investigating officials in August 2012, C1 said that it hurt when this procedure was carried out upon her. She was told to have a shower and she did so.
	
	
	After the procedure was carried out on C1, she was told by her mother not to discuss it with anyone. This aspect was confirmed in a recorded conversation in A2’s motor vehicle on the afternoon of 29 August 2012, when she remonstrated with C1 and C2 (referring to the interviews with the girls which had taken place earlier that day):
	


“You told them everything. I told you not to say, any one. I told you not to say. Now we are in trouble because of this. I told you this is a big secret. This is what she came to find out. Now we are in trouble because of that. We told you my child this is a big secret, never tell anyone.”


	
	In 2012, a similar procedure was undertaken on C2 at her parent’s house in Sydney. Once again, Kubra Magennis performed the procedure in the presence, and at the request, of A2. Once again, C2’s grandmother (A5) was present when the procedure was undertaken.
	
	
	C2 was asked to lie on a bed and she was naked from the waist down. I am satisfied that the procedure undertaken on C2 involved a cut or nick to the clitoris (including the clitoral hood or prepuce). Apart from her youth, I note that C2 has a mild intellectual disability. When interviewed in August 2012 by investigating officials, she said that what had happened to her had “hurt … in [her] bottom”.
	
	
	The medical evidence at trial did not demonstrate that any substantial injury, with long-term physical consequences, had been inflicted to either girl. Further medical examinations carried out after trial indicated that there was no sign of physical injury. These post-trial examinations, of course, were made years after the procedures were carried out on each of C1 and C2.
	
	
	In expressing these findings concerning the infliction of injury, I have taken into account the very substantial body of evidence adduced by the Crown at trial, extending far beyond the accounts given by each young girl and the trial medical evidence. In particular, there was electronic evidence of conversations involving the Offenders and others, obtained by the use of lawfully obtained surveillance device warrants or telephone interception warrants.
	
	
	It is sufficient to note that this electronic evidence provided powerful support for the Crown case that what happened to each girl involved “khatna” or female circumcision, with some injury being inflicted for that purpose. That electronic evidence was clearly inconsistent with the performance of some symbolic ceremony where a metal object was placed on the outside of each girl’s genital area, with no infliction of injury.
	


Shabbir Vaziri


	
	The Offender Vaziri was born in India in 1956. In 2009, he came to Australia with his family to take up the position as Sheikh or religious leader at the Dawoodi Bohra Mosque at Auburn. He occupied that position until it was terminated by the Dawoodi Bohra leadership in Mumbai in February 2016.
	
	
	The Offender Vaziri was found guilty by the jury of being an accessory after the fact to the FGM offences committed upon C1 and C2. Between 12 August 2012 and 9 October 2012, he assisted A2 and Kubra Magennis by encouraging them, potential witnesses and other members of the Dawoodi Bohra community to lie to police, or to not disclose relevant information to police. In addition, the Offender Vaziri was himself involved in putting forward false information to police. He gave that assistance so that A2 and Kubra Magennis could escape arrest, trial or punishment for their offences.
	
	
	The Crown case against the Offender Vaziri was contained largely in the recorded telephone conversations. Clearly, the jury was satisfied, as am I, that the Offender Vaziri knew that FGM offences had been committed against each of C1 and C2.
	
	
	The conversations revealed an understanding on his part as to the nature of “khatna” and the fact that it was illegal in this State. He was aware of the fact that the Offender Magennis had carried out the procedure in each case. He took active steps to promulgate a false story, whereby investigating authorities were to be informed that what had happened was a type of check up by the Offender Magennis of each girl to see if any FGM procedure had been undertaken on them following a journey to Eastern Africa (the “Africa checking story”).
	
	
	The electronic evidence demonstrated the creation of the “Africa checking story”, and its further dissemination with each Offender being involved in that process, together with others, including A1, the husband of A2.
	
	
	Some examples of the Offender Vaziri’s conduct will serve to illustrate the nature of his offences.
	
	
	The significance of the Offender Vaziri to the FGM investigation is demonstrated by his very early involvement in telephone conversations on the afternoon of 29 August 2012. Soon after 3.00 pm that day, A1 called Vaziri to tell him that “There has been a little problem”, with police and a social worker having gone to C1 and C2’s school to speak to them. A1 tells Vaziri, “It seems that [C1] has already told that one everything that khatna has happened here”. A1 asks Vaziri, “I want to know that, what reply should I give to these people? What to tell?”.
	
	
	In the course of that conversation, the “Africa checking story” was hatched. The Offender Vaziri enquired of A1 whether A1’s family had been to India in recent times. The two men agreed that Africa should be the place nominated in the conversation. The Offender Vaziri said (Exhibit AA. Tab 3):
	


“This is my idea. May tell that ‘In fact we had gone for the birthday and we, um, had left at our neighbours who, who has a travellers lodge over there, and do not have the knowledge as to what has happened.”


	
	Over a number of conversations between different people, the “Africa checking story” was developed as a means of explaining why the Offender Magennis had been touching the genital areas of the two girls, and also to provide a possible (false) explanation if injuries were detected in the girls.
	
	
	A1 and Vaziri spoke again in the evening of 29 August 2012 along similar lines. A1 updated Vaziri on what was happening, including the involvement of Kubra Magennis.
	
	
	The importance of the involvement of Vaziri is illustrated by a telephone conversation between A2 and Kubra Magennis at about 5.50 pm on 29 August 2012 which included the following:
	


Magennis: “What does this Elder Brother [Vaziri] say?”.

A2: “We phoned the Elder Brother immediately. That one says ‘Do not confess at all that you have got done here’”.


	
	At 5.13 pm on 30 August 2012, Vaziri rang Kubra Magennis and discussed the investigation. She told Vaziri that she had telephoned Sheikh Zafar (in India) and she had told him “At my age, I do not want to go to sit in a gaol”.
	
	
	At 6.17 pm on 1 September 2012, Yamanisab (from the Dawat office in Mumbai) rang Vaziri and discussed the investigation. In the course of the conversation, Vaziri explained that the “Africa checking story” was being used.
	
	
	Soon after 4.00 pm on 10 September 2012, Vaziri spoke to another member of the Dawoodi Bohra community by telephone. The two men discussed a police canvass being undertaken amongst members of the Dawoodi Bohra community. A female member of the community had told police that “I haven’t done [khatna]. We do not believe in this”. Vaziri and the other man agreed that if everyone answered in that way “All avenues close for them” and “they [the police] shut down”.
	
	
	Again, on 10 September 2012, Vaziri spoke by telephone to a female member of his community. She told him that police had come that day to speak to her about “khatna”.
	
	
	She said:
	


“Female: I was so scared. They asked me about circumcision khatna. I wanted to avoid that word. Then they translate into English.

Vaziri: What did you say?

Female: I said I do not know meaning. You do this ... they said you do the child for seven years. Who do? I said I did not know. Not any idea. That’s what I said Sir.

Vaziri: Very good. Very good.

…

Vaziri: … If they ask you again, you have to say them, I am not saying … mean we do not do it. … You should say we do not do.”


	
	In a later conversation on 10 September 2012, the Offender Vaziri said to a Dawoodi Bohra community member, “If someone asking you or your wife, this should be your answer. We do not believe in it”.
	
	
	As mentioned earlier, senior counsel for Vaziri conducted the trial upon the basis that the real issue concerning his guilt was the “injury” issue. This approach was understandable given the content of the recorded telephone conversations.
	


The Objective Seriousness of the Offences


	
	Assessment of the objective seriousness of FGM offences involves consideration of the degree of physical injury caused, any ongoing physical or psychological injury, the age of the person upon whom the FGM procedure has been performed and the relationship between the offender and the victim. Other factors may also be relevant depending upon the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	Offences under s.45 are not confined to any particular age group.
	
	
	Section 45 prohibits excision, infibulation or other forms of mutilation of specified parts of the female genital area, including the clitoris. A case of excision or infibulation is likely to be objectively more serious than a case of mutilation not involving those features. The World Health Organisation (WHO) FGM classification reflects this form of hierarchy, with excision and infibulation being two of the four categories: R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 2) at [204].
	
	
	The present case is one of mutilation to the clitoris in the form of infliction of injury, by way of a cut or nick to the clitoris (including the clitoral head or prepuce) of each girl. This case represents an example of Type 4 FGM, involving a harmful procedure to the female genitalia.
	
	
	As noted in R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 2) at [239], s.45 is directed to procedures undertaken in a delicate, sensitive and intimate part of the female anatomy, usually of young girls. It is necessary to keep in mind that FGM offences involve infringements upon the rights of children to physical integrity, and violations of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989). In addition, the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights classified FGM as a form of violence against women.
	
	
	The medical evidence indicates that there is no permanent scarring or other residual physical injury to either C1 or C2.
	
	
	The Court should proceed upon the basis that there are likely to be some adverse psychological consequences for each girl as a result of the commission of these offences. Given their present ages, this aspect cannot be quantified, but the existence of ongoing psychological harm is to be expected in a case such as this.
	


A2


	
	A2 was the mother of each girl. She was in a position of particular trust with respect to each of them. It was her obligation to protect each girl and not to cause some procedure to be carried out upon them involving injury. Each girl was very young (about seven years old) and vulnerable. C2 was especially vulnerable as she has an intellectual disability.
	
	
	The breach of trust implicit in offences by a mother upon young girls is a significant factor in the assessment of objective seriousness of the offences. The fact that A2 herself had had such a procedure carried out upon her when she was seven years of age, may serve to explain how she came to request such procedures to be performed upon her own daughters. However, that aspect provides limited assistance to A2.
	
	
	A2 is a well-educated and intelligent woman with professional training. She had lived in Australia for a number of years before the commission of the offence upon C1 in about 2009. The laws and norms applicable to A2 were those of Australia and, in particular, the State of New South Wales. I am satisfied that A2 was aware that the procedures undertaken on C1 and C2 were unlawful.
	
	
	Having regard to these factors, I conclude that A2’s offences are of considerable objective seriousness.
	


Kubra Magennis


	
	The Offender Magennis had lived in Australia since the late 1970s. She was a nurse and midwife. She was selected to undertake the FGM procedures for that reason. Her abuse of her professional vocation aggravates her offences against C1 and C2.
	
	
	It was the case that A2 asked the Offender Magennis to perform these procedures, but this does not assist the Offender Magennis. I am satisfied that the Offender Magennis was well aware of the laws applicable in New South Wales which prohibited procedures of this type.
	
	
	Like A2, the offences of Kubra Magennis are of considerable objective seriousness.
	


Shabbir Vaziri


	
	The Offender Vaziri was in a primary position of responsibility in the Dawoodi Bohra community in Sydney at the time of the commission of the offences. He was the religious leader of the community.
	
	
	Rather than honestly assisting the investigating authorities to ascertain what had happened and why, he played a leading role in the creation of a false story for the purpose of deflecting investigation of the offences, which he well knew had been committed. Further, he encouraged and directed members of the Dawoodi Bohra community to give false accounts to police whilst the offences were being investigated.
	
	
	It does not assist the Offender Vaziri that he may have accepted culturally that procedures of this type could occur in the Dawoodi Bohra community. I am satisfied that he was well aware that conduct of this type was contrary to the criminal law of this State. He used his position of authority and responsibility to seek to undermine and deflect the law, rather than to promote it.
	
	
	His offences extended over a period of weeks and involved a course of conduct on his part.
	
	
	An assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences of A2 and the Offender Magennis is also relevant to an assessment of the Offender Vaziri’s offences, given that his crimes involved him as an accessory after the fact to the primary offences of the other Offenders.
	
	
	I conclude that the accessorial offences of the Offender Vaziri are of considerable objective seriousness.
	


Subjective Circumstances of Offenders

A2


	
	A2 was about 32 years old at the time of the offence against C1, and about 35 years old at the time of the offence concerning C2. She is now 39 years of age.
	
	
	A2 has no criminal history. She has an older brother and two younger sisters. Her parents continue to reside in Kenya. She graduated in pharmacy from the University of Nairobi in 2001. Since coming to Australia she has worked, from time to time, as a pharmacist.
	
	
	I have mentioned aspects of A2’s upbringing and education earlier in these remarks. A2 has two daughters younger than C1 and C2. She has made clear, in documents before the Court on sentence, that she does not intend to have “khatna” carried out on these girls. There is evidence before the Court that Family and Community Services officers have assessed A2’s family and have concluded that none of the children need to be removed from the care of their parents (Exhibit 10). This is a significant factor on sentence.
	
	
	A report of Mr Roderick Lander, psychologist, dated 2 February 2016 was received on sentence with respect to A2. She expressed concern to Mr Lander of the impact upon her children if she received a full-time custodial sentence. Mr Lander did not identify any psychological issue with A2, apart from elevated levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms resulting from these proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Lander noted that A2 continues to receive strong support from her family and husband, and that she has a strong affiliation with her religious community and appears to have a single-minded dedication to the care of her children.
	
	
	A number of character references describe A2, amongst other things, as a dedicated mother and a soft-spoken person.
	
	
	Reference will be made shortly to issues concerning the attitude of A2 towards C1 and C2 as victims of these offences.
	


Kubra Magennis


	
	Kubra Magennis was about 66 years old at the time of the offence upon C1, and about 68 years old at the time of the offence involving C2. She is now 72 years of age. She has no criminal history.
	
	
	As mentioned earlier in these remarks, Kubra Magennis was born in Kenya and came to Australia in 1977. She had lived and worked in the United Kingdom for a period before then.
	
	
	Kubra Magennis has two children from her first marriage. She has remarried and lives with her husband. She has the ongoing support of her husband and her daughter from her first marriage.
	
	
	Kubra Magennis worked in Australia as a nurse and midwife between 1995 and 2007, although she has since retired.
	
	
	The evidence establishes that Kubra Magennis suffers from a number of significant health problems.
	
	
	A report of Dr Hashim Kachwalia, cardiologist, dated 10 December 2015 addresses a number of health issues including hypertension, diabetes mellitus (which is difficult to control), significant renal impairment, stroke and osteoarthritis which restricts her mobility. She has been an inpatient for different conditions in 2010 (stroke) and 2015 (multi-organ dysfunction) followed by renal failure. She has mobility problems and there are significant cardiac risk factors.
	
	
	A report of Dr David Rosen, neurologist, of 20 January 2016 concluded that she will require close monitoring and management of cerebrovascular risk factors, including her diabetes mellitus and hypertension to minimise the risk of stroke. Dr Rosen noted that Kubra Magennis is at risk of falling and injuring herself and requires management of her multi-factorial gait disorder. Dr Rosen expressed the opinion that a full-time custodial sentence would give rise to particular difficulties in the management and treatment of the serious health issues affecting the Offender Magennis.
	
	
	In a report dated 22 December 2015, Dr Patrick Wong, her treating general practitioner, outlined the range of medical problems experienced by Kubra Magennis and observed that it would be difficult to implement the complex treatment plans required in a custodial setting.
	
	
	A report of Dr Stephen Ong, ophthalmic surgeon, dated 1 February 2016 diagnosed a right superior retinal artery occlusion and bleeding on the retina due to systemic diabetes. Dr Ong expressed the opinion that if Kubra Magennis is unable to attend ongoing, 12-weekly ophthalmic care, there is a strong likelihood that she will experience loss of vision which is unlikely to be reversible.
	
	
	A report of Dr Jacqueline McMaster, neurosurgeon, dated 2 February 2016 concerned the leg and back problems which she experiences, and the forms of treatment which are likely including injections and the prospect of surgical intervention in the form of a spinal fusion.
	
	
	A report of Dr Andrew Jeffreys, consultant nephrologist, dated 7 December 2015 lists the Offender’s medical problems, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, radiculopathy, and acute renal failure secondary to sepsis in 2014, which required dialysis for two months. He confirmed the picture emerging from other reports that she required ongoing monitoring and treatment to minimise further deterioration. Reports of Mr Matthew Jessimer, clinical psychologist, dated 13 January 2016 were tendered at the sentencing hearing. Mr Jessimer stated that Kubra Magennis currently meets diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. He stated that there were various symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder which appeared to relate to the current legal situation. He stated that Kubra Magennis was very concerned about the impact of imprisonment upon her range of significant health issues.
	
	
	A number of character references were tendered which spoke of her general good character, in the various contexts in which the authors had associated with her.
	


Shabbir Vaziri


	
	Shabbir Vaziri was 56 years old at the time of the offences. He is now 59 years of age. He has no criminal history.
	
	
	Vaziri was born in India and came to Australia in 2009 with his wife and two older sons. Whilst serving as Sheikh at the Auburn Mosque, his residence and finances were supported by members of the Dawoodi Bohra community.
	
	
	A report of Dr Jacqueline McMaster dated 2 December 2015 stated that the Offender Vaziri had undergone surgery in August 2015 to remove a tumour. He requires ongoing assessment to determine that there is no recurrence.
	
	
	A medical assessment was undertaken concerning Vaziri by Dr Gulzar Hussein on 17 December 2015. Dr Hussein noted that he required treatment for hypertension and ongoing assessment concerning the surgery undertaken in August 2015.
	
	
	A number of character references spoke highly of the work undertaken by Vaziri amongst the Dawoodi Bohra community in Sydney.
	


Expressions of Contrition and Remorse and the Effect of the Offences on C1 and C2

A2


	
	At the sentencing hearing on 5 February 2016, an unsworn letter from A2 was tendered in which she said “I take this opportunity to sincerely and deeply convey my heartfelt apology for having attended a ritual which has been found to be illegal. I also regret the difficulties this has caused my children, my husband, the Court and police. It is with profound sorrow I would like to assure that such an incident will not recur”.
	
	
	I indicated that I would give limited weight to this expression of contrition which arose after trial. I noted, as well, that there was no evidence of A2 having apologised to her children, C1 and C2, for what occurred to them. In raising this issue, I had in mind that even on the defence case (which was rejected by the jury), the placing of a metal object on the naked body of a child would itself be unlawful as an assault. So much was accepted by defence counsel.
	
	
	I noted further that, to the extent that there was a report of Alison O’Neill, psychologist, tendered on behalf of A2 which involved a further psychological examination of C1 on 13 January 2016, the report did not constitute a form of victim impact statement concerning C1. Rather, the focus of attention was upon the possible impact on C1 if her mother was imprisoned. I should observe that Ms O’Neill had examined C1 for the purpose of issues surrounding compellability of C1 and C2 as witnesses, the subject of my judgment R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 1306 at [131]ff. Understandably, C1 expressed real concern to Ms O’Neill at the prospect of her mother being sentenced to full-time imprisonment.
	
	
	During the adjournment between 5 and 18 February 2016, the legal representatives for A2 arranged for a meeting between A2 and each of C1 and C2, in the presence of Ms O’Neill.
	
	
	In a further report dated 15 February 2016, Ms O’Neill outlined what had happened. In her presence, A2 apologised to each of C1 and C2 orally and in writing. Ms O’Neill reported that C1 listened attentively to her mother, and appeared to have a thorough understanding of the meaning and purpose of the apology, but that C2 did not. C1 advised that she understood that her mother was apologising for the “khatna” ceremony and the Court process. C1 said that her mother had apologised before and that hearing the formal apology then “sort of” helped but she could not explain how or why. In the absence of her mother, C1 said that the apology helped “a tiny bit”. C1 said that “her mother did not need to apologise because the situation had been hard for them both”. Ms O’Neill spoke about “the responsibility resting with adults and not with her as a child”.
	
	
	Ms O’Neill stated that the impression gained was that A2’s apology to her daughters was sincere and that it was of some help to C1, but not C2. She noted that C2’s intellectual disability affected this aspect. Ms O’Neill concluded that “The most helpful part of the sessions for [C1] is that it will likely serve as a reference point for her in the future, when reflecting about her role and the issues, her mother’s apology, and if she has any outstanding questions for her mother as she matures into womanhood”.
	
	
	The written apology provided by A2 to C1 should be mentioned. It stated:
	


“When you were seven I had a khatna ceremony performed on you.

This has been a practice in our culture for about fourteen centuries. 

The police arrested me and I was charged and you gave evidence. I am very proud of you, you did the right thing and upheld the law when you were asked to do so.

The courts have found that in putting you through the khatna ceremony you were injured and I was responsible. I accept this decision. 

I now unreservedly apologise to you. I thought I was doing what was required culturally but I accept that is wrong and breaches the law in NSW. 

I want you to know that there is no way that your sisters, [the third and fourth daughters], or anyone else I come into contact [with] will go through a khatna ceremony of any description if I can prevent it.

I am very proud of you and the way you have dealt with everything you have been through with the police and courts.

Again, I am very sorry to have put you through this.

My love always.”


	
	Observing C1 in her 29 August 2012 interview, and in the witness box, indicated that she was and is an intelligent, thoughtful and caring person. This impression is confirmed by Ms O’Neill’s recent reports and the earlier psychological reports which related to her. She told the investigators on 29 August 2012 that what had happened to her had also happened to her sister, C2. As the eldest daughter in the family, it may be confidently expected that C1 will help, support and protect her younger sisters. Her strength and fortitude in the events which have transpired since August 2012 should be acknowledged by the Court.
	
	
	A letter along similar lines, with some variations, was provided to C2. In her own way, C2 has shown strength in the events surrounding this case since 2012.
	
	
	Although the steps taken by A2 following the sentencing hearing on 5 February 2016 may be seen as being responsive to the expression of the Court’s concern on 5 February 2016, I am satisfied that the apologies by A2 to C1 and C2 are genuine and demonstrative of remorse on her part. There is evidence that she has accepted responsibility for her actions. Further, the steps taken by A2 provide a measure of understanding for her children, in particular for C1.
	
	
	I accept that A2 is a loving mother for all her daughters. I consider it highly unlikely that she will take any step adverse to the health and best interests of her children, including her two younger daughters. I am fortified in this conclusion by the approach of the Department of Family and Community Services, which has accepted that the family should remain together.
	


Kubra Magennis


	
	There has been no expression of remorse on the part of Kubra Magennis. It is clear that the jury did not accept her evidence on the critical issues as to what was done to each of C1 and C2.
	


Shabbir Vaziri


	
	Shabbir Vaziri did not give evidence at the trial.
	
	
	At the sentencing hearing on 5 February 2016, an unsworn letter from him was tendered, in which he expressed sadness that “In my eagerness to save my community members from embarrassment of having done something that may be regarded as illegal, I advised them in a manner that did not best serve the law of the land and the investigation that the police were conducting”. He stated that he was “overcome with remorse and regret this and hope the court is able to look at my situation with kindness”.
	
	
	In the course of submissions on 5 February 2016, I indicated that I would give little weight to this expression of contrition made after trial.
	
	
	I noted, as well, that there was no indication from Vaziri (or the other Offenders) that he (or they) had taken or would take steps to discourage the performance of “khatna” in the Dawoodi Bohra community. What followed next in this regard will be referred to shortly.
	


Issues of Personal and General Deterrence

Personal Deterrence


	
	The fact that A2 came to commit these offences, against the background of herself being subjected to “khatna” as a seven-year old girl in Kenya, gives rise to consideration as to the role of personal deterrence on sentence. The fact that she is an intelligent woman with a professional qualification living in the Australian community did not, of itself, give rise to a change in thinking on her part when it came to her elder daughters, C1 and C2.
	
	
	However, the process of investigation and conviction and, in particular, the steps she has taken more recently with respect to C1 and C2 as reported by Ms O’Neill, serve to reduce significantly the role of personal deterrence in her case. It, nevertheless, remains a factor on sentence.
	
	
	Kubra Magennis committed these offences utilising her skills as a nurse and midwife, against a background of what I accept was her cultural adherence to the practice of “khatna” in the Dawoodi Bohra community.
	
	
	Given her age and ill health, I do not consider that she constitutes a real threat to the community by way of the risk of her performing “khatna” on anyone else. During the recorded telephone conversations, Kubra Magennis said that she would not carry out procedures of this sort again. The process of investigation, prosecution, conviction and sentence will, in my view, fortify the conclusion that she is most unlikely to offend again in this respect. Personal deterrence is thereby reduced in its significance on sentence.
	
	
	The evidence at the trial indicated the adherence by Shabbir Vaziri to long-standing cultural practices of the Dawoodi Bohra community involving “khatna”. Personal deterrence remains a relevant consideration with respect to him. He has not personally forsaken his beliefs in this respect.
	
	
	It may be suggested that the steps being taken by the Dawoodi Bohra community in Australia and internationally (involving edicts concerning “khatna”) may provide some assistance to Shabbir Vaziri. As will be mentioned shortly, the world is being informed of the rejection by the Dawoodi Bohra community, in a wide range of places, of the practice of “khatna”. However, I am not satisfied that these steps were personally driven by Shabbir Vaziri.
	
	
	Personal deterrence remains a factor on sentence in his case.
	


General Deterrence


	
	As things stood following the verdicts of the jury in November 2015, there was a very substantial role to be played by way of general deterrence on sentence of these Offenders.
	
	
	This remained the case at the sentencing hearing on 5 February 2016. There was no sign that any of the Offenders had taken any steps to bring about a change in attitude on the part of the Dawoodi Bohra community to the practice of “khatna”. Discussion with counsel during the hearing on 5 February 2016 emphasised the absence of any evidence of such steps being taken by, or on behalf, of the Offenders.
	
	
	In advance of the resumed sentencing hearing on 18 February 2016, the position changed. Evidence was adduced on 18 February 2016 from Tafazzulhusen Ismal Shamsi, a trustee of the Dawoodi Bohra Trust in all States of Australia, except Victoria.
	
	
	Put shortly, there is evidence that a form of guidance or edict had issued from the Anjuman-e-Burhani (Sydney) on 9 February 2016 noting that “Khafd (also known as khatna and female circumcision)” had been interpreted in this case as being within the meaning of FGM and s.45 Crimes Act 1900 and that, as a result “Khafd is illegal, whether it is carried out within any of the States of Australia or overseas”. The document declared that “All parents and guardians are hereby directed in the strictest terms not to carry out khafd under any circumstances”.
	
	
	The evidence before the Court on 18 February 2016 revealed that similar edicts had issued from the Trusts administering and managing the affairs of the Dawoodi Bohra communities in:
	



	
	Melbourne, Australia;
	
	
	Molndal, Sweden;
	
	
	London, Bradford, Nottingham, Manchester, Birmingham and Leicester in the United Kingdom.
	



	
	Each of the edicts, which were issued in these cities to the relevant Dawoodi Bohra community, included a recital as follows:
	


“Further, it is noted that a number of members of the Dawoodi Bohra community in Sydney, Australia have been convicted in November 2015 by the Supreme Court of New South Wales for undertaking khafd, which emphasises the seriousness of the crime”.


	
	Each edict directed that “khafd” must not be performed, nor should children be taken overseas for the purpose of “khafd” being performed.
	
	
	Apart from the making of these edicts in the different places referred to, there is evidence that the actions of the Dawoodi Bohra communities in these places has received substantial media coverage including, importantly, in India. As I have said, Mumbai is the principal centre for the world-wide Dawoodi Bohra community and the place of residence for its religious leader, the 53rd Dai al-Mutlaq, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin.
	
	
	An electronic article published in the “Mumbai Mirror” on 11 February 2016 included the following under the heading “Fight Against Khatna Gets a Shot in the Arm from Down Under”:
	


“The Jamaat in Australia issues an edict outlawing female genital mutilation, infusing fresh blood in the fight waged by Dawoodi Bohra women here”.

The article continued:

“The crusade of Dawoodi Bohra women in the country against female genital mutilation (FGM) - or Khatna, as it is known in the community - has found fresh inspiration from overseas, with the Jamaat in Australia directing all Bohras there to stop the practice.

A decree stating as much was sent out on Tuesday, by the Anjuman-e-Burhani (Sydney), the Trust that manages the affairs of Australia’s Dawoodi Bohra Jamaat. It directs all parents and guardians ‘in the strictest terms not to carry out khafd (Khatna) under any circumstances’, in concurrence with the law of the land which bans FGM of any kind.

The development comes at a time when many women from the community here in India which has 1.5 million followers, have raised their voice against the hoary ritual, which they say amounts to child abuse. An online petition under the name of ‘Speak Out on FGM’ has garnered more than 50,000 endorsements so far, by people both within and outside the community.

The Bohras, a sub-sect of Shia Islam, are the only community in India known to practise FGM, in which the hood of the clitoris is cut at the age of six, causing the girls immense physical and psychological trauma. According to a survey, more than 80% of Bohra women have been circumcised.

The notice in Australia further instructs them not to take anyone out of the country to perform Khatna: ‘Should you engage in this illegal act, you will be doing so against specific warning of Anjuman-e-Burhani (Sydney), and the consequences of breaking the law will be solely yours’.

…

Masooma Ranalvi, who is spearheading the anti-FGM campaign in India, told Mumbai Mirror that such a move will boost confidence among Dawoodi Bohra women who have been affected by this practice. ‘This is a very strong, clear message. The community leadership should take this opportunity to issue such clear edicts to Dawoodi Bohras all over the world. In the US and the UK, already there are very strong anti-FGM laws. A message from the Jamaats there will go a long way in showing that we truly believe in remaining loyal to the law of the land we live in’.”


	
	Further electronic articles in India publicising the edicts appeared in “The Covai Post” dated 12 February 2016 and the “IB Times” dated 16 February 2016.
	
	
	Since 18 February 2016, a number of other Dawoodi Bohra communities have taken similar steps by issuing edicts to their communities. This has been done in the United States in Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Dallas, San Diego and San Antonio. Similar action has been taken in New Zealand, Ireland and Norway. Very importantly, an edict along similar lines was issued on 16 March 2016 by Anjuman-e-Said-ee (Nairobi), a society organising and conducting the affairs of the Dawoodi Bohra Jamaat of Nairobi in Kenya. A large Dawoodi Bohra community resides in Kenya, where both A2 and Kubra Magennis were born.
	
	
	These further developments point to an ongoing pattern of attitudinal change in the Dawoodi Bohra community, against a background of centuries old adherence to the practice of “khatna”. Although it is a matter for Governments and Courts far flung from this State, it is hoped that the current movement will flow through to the Dawoodi Bohra communities in India as well.
	
	
	In R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346, Simpson J (as her Honour then was) said at 413 [35] that “in considering general deterrence it is necessary to consider the class or pool of individuals at whom deterrence is directed”.
	
	
	In circumstances where the issue of general deterrence in this case commences, at least, with the Dawoodi Bohra community, it may be said that the steps taken in Australia and internationally very substantially serve the purpose of general deterrence. Authoritative statements have been made, in no uncertain terms, forbidding the practice of “khatna” in those communities. Further, and very importantly, these steps had been publicised internationally with major prominence in India, where the centre of the Dawoodi Bohra community is based and where a powerful movement has developed, and continues to grow, amongst women in the Dawoodi Bohra community urging the cessation of the practice.
	
	
	To the extent that the Crown submitted to this Court that the steps contained in these edicts may, at a later time, be reversed, I am satisfied that events have moved well past the point of no return. The formal and public acceptance by Dawoodi Bohra communities in different countries has served to fortify the movement towards eradication of this form of FGM in Dawoodi Bohra communities throughout the world. In this way, an important purpose of the criminal law and the principles of sentencing has been advanced.
	
	
	Insofar as the principle of general deterrence operates to seek the prohibition and eradication of FGM in all its forms and in all communities, the steps which have now been taken in the Dawoodi Bohra community serve that general purpose as well. This may be seen as a vindication of the processes of the criminal law.
	
	
	I keep in mind that the effectiveness of these steps will lie in the genuineness of the intent which is said to lie behind them, and the acceptance of members of the Dawoodi Bohra community that the message being conveyed should be followed. I accept that the steps taken to this point are genuine so that there is every reason to expect that members of the Dawoodi Bohra community will follow the edicts of their religious and community leaders, all of which is intended to promote the safety of children in their community.
	


Determining Appropriate Sentences


	
	In approaching the question of sentence in this case, it is helpful to keep in mind the purposes of sentencing as identified in s.3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That section states:
	


“3A    Purposes of sentencing

The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:

(a)    to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)    to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c)    to protect the community from the offender,

(d)    to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e)    to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)    to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g)    to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.”


	
	The purposes of sentencing, as contained in s.3A, are well recognised as involving different, and sometimes conflicting, purposes: R v Pogson [2012] NSWCCA 225; 82 NSWLR 60 at 85 [112] (citing Veen v The Queen [No. 2] [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 476-477).
	
	
	I shall refer to each of these purposes, with the first purpose (the need for adequate punishment) to be considered last.
	


Prevention of Crime by Deterring the Offender and Others from Committing Similar Offences (s.3A(b))


	
	I have referred earlier to the issues of personal deterrence and general deterrence in the context of this case.
	
	
	The need for personal deterrence is reduced with respect to each Offender, but remains nevertheless relevant to the sentencing process.
	
	
	The concept of general deterrence must be considered in light of the nature of the conduct prohibited by s.45 Crimes Act 1900. It may be said that persons who may commit FGM offences lie within a limited part of the New South Wales community where cultural and religious practices and beliefs play a part. The concept of general deterrence operates with respect to a limited number of persons in the community who may contemplate the use of FGM practices. In the present case, the Dawoodi Bohra community in Australia is relatively small. Beyond Australia, the Dawoodi Bohra community is much larger.
	
	
	I have referred earlier to edicts which have issued to Dawoodi Bohra communities in various parts of the world and the resulting media publicity. It may be said, in the unusual circumstances of this case, that the deterrent purposes of sentencing contained in s.3A(b) are substantially met. The purposes set out in s.3A(b) are preventative or protective in nature. They form part of the legal framework where the imposition of sentence operates, directly or indirectly, to protect the community.
	


Protection of the Community from the Offender (s.3A(c))


	
	There is, of course, some overlap between the various purposes of sentencing set out in s.3A. Protection of the community from an offender may be advanced in a number of ways, including personal deterrence and the taking of steps to rehabilitate an offender. In some cases, protection of the community from the offender may involve incapacitation of the offender by way of imprisonment, in particular where the person has committed serious offences and has a history of committing serious offences.
	
	
	In the present case, the community at risk from the Offenders is the Dawoodi Bohra community. For reasons expressed earlier, I do not consider that any of the Offenders constitute a real threat to the community.
	


Promoting the Rehabilitation of the Offender (s.3A(d))


	
	It has been said that rehabilitation, as an object of sentencing, is aimed at the renunciation by an offender of his or her wrongdoing and his or her establishment or re-establishment as an honourable law abiding citizen: Vartzokas v Zanker (1989) 51 SASR 277 at 279; R v Pogson at 85-86 [112]-[120]. The distinctive method of rehabilitation is to alter an offender’s value system, or at least to alter an offender’s response to certain types of situations, with its aim being to prevent offences being committed: Ashworth and Zedner, “Preventive Justice”, Oxford University Press, 2014, pages 17-18.
	
	
	With respect to each of the present Offenders, his or her rehabilitation will be promoted by the development of insight into the harm done by FGM (“khatna”) and the rejection of beliefs which supported its use.
	


Making the Offender Accountable for His or Her Actions (s.3A(e))


	
	The conviction of the Offenders, and the imposition of sentences upon them, will serve to make each of the Offenders accountable for his or her actions.
	


Denouncing the Conduct of the Offender (s.3A(f))


	
	The imposition of sentence upon the Offenders will serve to denounce the criminal conduct of each of them.
	


Recognising the Harm Done to the Victims of the Crimes and the Community (s.3A(g))


	
	There has been limited recognition, on the part of each of the Offenders, of the harm done to the victims, C1 and C2, by reason of these offences. The evidence suggests there has been increased recognition on the part of A2, culminating in the process of apology to each girl, referred to earlier in these reasons.
	
	
	In the case of Kubra Magennis and Shabbir Vaziri, the recognition of the harm done to the victims has not reached the level which applies to A2.
	
	
	It is necessary for the Court to consider, as well, the need for a sentence to recognise the harm done to the community by reason of the offences.
	
	
	Harm done to the community, through offences of this type extends beyond the individuals affected and the harm done, in this case, to the Dawoodi Bohra community. The general community is harmed as well by the commission of FGM offences against young children who form part of it.
	


Ensuring that the Offender is Adequately Punished for the Offences (s.3A(a))


	
	It is necessary to draw together the various factors, for the purpose of passing sentence on each Offender which ensures that each one is adequately punished for his or her offences. The sentences to be imposed must be proportionate to the objective seriousness of the offences. As well, the sentences must take into account the subjective circumstances of each Offender and other matters relevant to sentence, including the purposes set out in s.3A.
	
	
	There is no other sentencing decision which provides real assistance to the Court concerning these Offenders. The sentence imposed in the only other FGM case in this State arose in circumstances which are significantly different to the present cases. In R v FA (District Court of NSW, 5 June 2015, unreported), his Honour Judge Blackmore SC imposed a suspended sentence with respect to an offence of procuring FGM under s.45(1)(b) as it then stood, in circumstances where the offender took his infant child to Indonesia with the procedure being carried out by a nurse at a clinic. The offender made full admissions to police and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. In the circumstances of that case, a suspended sentence of imprisonment was considered appropriate.
	
	
	In the present cases, each Offender went to trial, as was his or her right. Clearly, there is no discount to be applied for pleas of guilty. I accept that the Offenders facilitated the administration of justice in the way, in which the trial was conducted (confined to one issue), so that each is entitled to call in aid on sentence ss.21A(3)(l) and 22A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have taken that aspect into account in each case.
	
	
	With respect to each Offender, I have set out my reasons as to why his or her offences were of considerable objective seriousness. Although the physical injury caused to each girl was at the lower end, there are other features in each case which bear upon the assessments which I have expressed.
	
	
	Each Offender has a number of subjective circumstances operating in his or her favour. A2’s own background and personal experience of “khatna” is important, together with evidence which demonstrates her capacity and devotion as a mother generally. She is a vital member of her family, entrusted with the upbringing of her young children.
	
	
	Kubra Magennis has a range of significant health issues which affect her and these are relevant on sentence, as is her age.
	
	
	Shabbir Vaziri has health issues which are relevant as well to an assessment of his subjective circumstances.
	
	
	I have expressed views already with respect to issues of personal deterrence and general deterrence and these need not be repeated.
	
	
	Three issues arise at this point:
	



	
	the Court must consider, with respect to each Offender, whether, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate: s.5(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999;
	
	
	if the Court determines that imprisonment is appropriate, it is necessary to determine the length of any sentence, without regard to the manner in which it is to be served: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [25]-[26]; Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at 165-166 [70]-[71];
	
	
	once the length of sentence of imprisonment has been determined, the Court is then to consider whether an alternative form of imprisonment is available, and whether that alternative should be utilised: R v Zamagias at [25]; Douar v R at 166 [72].
	


A2


	
	With respect to the offences of A2, I am satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. After taking into account all relevant objective and subjective factors and the purposes of sentencing, I am satisfied that the terms of imprisonment which are appropriate with respect to A2 are as follows:
	



	
	for the offence against C1, imprisonment for a period of 12 months;
	
	
	for the offence against C2, imprisonment for a period of 12 months.
	



	
	As there are two offences and two separate victims, I am satisfied that there should be some measure of accumulation as between the two sentences, so that the total head sentence will involve a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment.
	
	
	The third step involves consideration as to whether the sentences of imprisonment should be suspended, or whether the Court should consider the service of the sentences by way of home detention or intensive correction order. In considering these options, it is necessary to keep in mind that each of these steps involves a substantially less onerous sentence than one of immediate imprisonment. The Court must exercise discretion to determine whether, in the circumstances of the case, a discretionary exercise in favour of the Offender should be made.
	
	
	In my view, the imposition of a suspended sentence under s.12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is not appropriate with respect to A2. Nor am I satisfied that the Court should consider the use of an intensive correction order under s.7 of that Act.
	
	
	A Court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than 18 months may make a home detention order, directing that the sentence be served by way of home detention under s.6 of that Act. Before taking that course, the Court must obtain an assessment report as to the suitability of the Offender for home detention: ss.74ff Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Section 76 of that Act provides that home detention is not available for certain offences. I am satisfied that an offence under s.45 Crimes Act 1900 is not excluded by operation of s.76. Nor does A2 have a history which excludes her from consideration for home detention under s.77 of the Act.
	
	
	If A2 is sentenced by way of an immediate custodial sentence, I am satisfied that there would be significant hardship for her children, including C1 and C2. A sentencing outcome which would see these children (who are victims of these offences) being punished in a practical way, would not serve the interests of justice in this case. As I have noted, the relevant authorities have determined that the children may continue to reside safely with A2 and her husband. The evidence indicates that she is generally a caring mother for her children.
	
	
	The use of home detention would involve a penalty on A2 which would permit her, whilst serving her sentence, to continue to exercise her duties and responsibilities towards her family. This is an important factor in the exercise of discretion as to the use of home detention in her case.
	
	
	I propose to refer A2 for assessment as to suitability for home detention after imposing the period of imprisonment which I have foreshadowed.
	


Kubra Magennis


	
	I turn to consider the three identified questions with respect to Kubra Magennis. Having considered all relevant objective and subjective factors, and the purposes of sentencing, I am satisfied that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate in her case.
	
	
	In determining the term of imprisonment which is appropriate, although different objective and subjective factors apply in her case to that of A2, I am satisfied that the period to be imposed should be the same as that which I have stated with respect to A2.
	
	
	In relation to the offence against C1, a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment is appropriate. For the offence against C2, a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment is appropriate. There should be an element of partial accumulation so that the total head sentence will be one of imprisonment for 15 months.
	
	
	If this point was reached, counsel for Kubra Magennis submitted that the Court should consider alternatives to immediate imprisonment, including a suspended sentence, home detention or an intensive correction order (T116.15-23, 18 February 2016). I am satisfied that a suspended sentence is not appropriate in the circumstances of this case. Nor do I consider that the use of an intensive correction order is appropriate in the case of Kubra Magennis.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Court should consider, in the exercise of discretion, an order requiring the sentence of imprisonment to be served by way of home detention. In the case of Kubra Magennis, I have in mind the very substantial health issues which surround her, together with her age, and the difficulties identified in the medical evidence relating to her management in the correctional system.
	
	
	After imposing the sentence of imprisonment upon her, I propose to make an order referring Kubra Magennis for assessment as to suitability for home detention. Once again, I express my satisfaction that she is not excluded from that sentencing option by anything contained in ss.76 and 77 of the Act.
	


Shabbir Vaziri


	
	The offences of Shabbir Vaziri are accessorial in nature. He was not present at the time of the commission of the FGM offences upon the two young girls. However, as I have explained earlier, his offences are of considerable seriousness. They involve the religious leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community in Sydney seeking to deflect the police investigation and encourage the making of false statements concerning the practice of “khatna” in his community.
	
	
	Turning to the three identified questions with respect to Shabbir Vaziri, I express my conclusion that, having taken into account all relevant objective and subjective factors and keeping in mind the purposes of sentencing, no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate in his case.
	
	
	Although there are different objective and subjective factors which bear upon the determination of sentence for Shabbir Vaziri, I am satisfied that the period of the sentence which should be imposed in his case ought be of the same duration as applied to A2 and Kubra Magennis.
	
	
	A sentence of imprisonment for 12 months is appropriate for his offence of being accessory after the fact to the FGM offence on C1. A sentence of 12 months of imprisonment is appropriate for his offence of being an accessory after the fact to the FGM offence on C2. Some measure of accumulation is appropriate so that the total effective sentence will be one of 15 months’ imprisonment.
	
	
	If this point was reached, senior counsel for Shabbir Vaziri requested the Court to consider alternatives to immediate incarceration, including the suspension of the sentence or the use of home detention or an intensive correction order (T124.32, 18 February 2016).
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the use of a suspended sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of this case. Nor do I consider that the use of an intensive correction order is appropriate.
	
	
	With respect to the option of home detention, I note that Shabbir Vaziri lives with his family in Sydney, although his employment as religious leader at the Auburn Mosque has been terminated. I take into account that he has health difficulties, which is relevant to the exercise of discretion. As Shabbir Vaziri is to be sentenced as an accessory after the fact to the FGM offences, the use of home detention for the principals is a relevant factor on sentence. I am satisfied, in all the circumstances of the case, that it is appropriate to seek an assessment as to the suitability of home detention in the case of Shabbir Vaziri.
	
	
	I note that the period of imprisonment, in the case of each Offender, does not exceed the statutory limit of 18 months for the purpose of consideration of home detention: s.6(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Having indicated the sentences for each offence, I propose to proceed by way of aggregate sentence in each case. Each Offender will be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 15 months. It is necessary to fix a non-parole period as s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applies. I propose to fix a non-parole period of 11 months in each case. I have rounded this figure down slightly from a mathematical calculation of 75% of the head sentence. To that limited extent, there is a finding of “special circumstances” for each Offender.
	


Orders

A2


	
	A2, would you please stand. Having been found guilty by the jury on 12 November 2015, you are convicted of each of the offences under s.45 Crimes Act 1900 with respect to C1 and C2.
	
	
	For these offences, I impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 15 months.
	
	
	I fix a non-parole period of 11 months.
	
	
	Having imposed this sentence of imprisonment, for the purpose of s.80(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I refer you for assessment as to your suitability for home detention.
	
	
	To allow that assessment to be undertaken, I stand over the sentencing proceedings to 2.00 pm on 22 April 2016.

	I continue your bail on existing terms for the purpose of the adjournment until 2.00 pm on 22 April 2016.
	


Kubra Magennis

	I note that the referral for assessment, for the purpose of s.80(2) of the Act, stays the execution of the sentence and also the operation of s.48 of the Act in relation to the sentence.
	
	
	I continue your bail on existing terms for the purpose of the adjournment until 2.00 pm on 22 April 2016.
	


Shabbir Vaziri 


	
	Shabbir Vaziri, would you please stand. Having been found guilty by the jury on 12 November 2015 of each offence, I convict you of the offences of being an accessory after the fact to offences under s.45 Crimes Act 1900 committed upon C1 and C2.
	
	
	I sentence you to an aggregate term of imprisonment for 15 months.
	
	
	I fix a non-parole period of 11 months.
	
	
	Having imposed this sentence of imprisonment, for the purpose of s.80(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I refer you for assessment as to your suitability for home detention.
	
	
	To allow that assessment to be undertaken, I stand over the sentencing proceedings to 2.00 pm on 22 April 2016.
	
	
	I note that the referral for assessment, for the purpose of s.80(2) of the Act, stays the execution of the sentence and also the operation of s.48 of the Act in relation to the sentence.
	
	
	I continue your bail on existing terms for the purpose of the adjournment until 2.00 pm on 22 April 2016.
	
	
	I request that the assessments to be made with respect to each Offender for the purpose of suitability for home detention be provided to the Court by 20 April 2016.
	
	
	Before concluding these remarks, I wish to make a final observation. The maximum penalty for these offences, at the time of their commission, was imprisonment for seven years. Parliament has trebled the maximum penalty for FGM offences now contained in ss.45 and 45A Crimes Act 1900 to imprisonment for 21 years. That maximum penalty applies to offences committed after 20 May 2014. Had the maximum penalty for the present offences been 21 years’ imprisonment, a significantly different sentencing outcome would have resulted in these cases. I mention this for two reasons. Firstly, the sentencing outcome in this case (as opposed to sentencing principles) will have little relevance for FGM offences committed after 20 May 2014. Secondly, the substantially increased maximum penalty stands as an important legislative guidepost for the purpose of sentence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 132 [27]. It is well established that an increase in the maximum penalty for an offence must be reflected in sentences imposed by the Courts: Muldrock v The Queen at 133 [31].

2769044,R v Williams [2016] NSWDC 179,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The offence I am about to describe is distressingly commonplace. Offences of this type are not often dealt with in the District Court and indeed this offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court, although it would have been quite wrong to do so given the jurisdictional limit that applies when a magistrate is sentencing.
	
	
	Too often offenders are prepared to break into people’s houses and take whatever they can in an effort to fund drug use or to meet living expenses. Rarely do offenders spend the proceeds of such crimes on luxuries. But most offenders think nothing of the consequences to a householder having his or her home broken into and items, often of sentimental value, taken from it. The fact that an offence is commonplace does not mean that it is not serious.
	
	
	It is notorious that those whose homes have been broken into are detrimentally affected by the experience, they become less sure of themselves, less confident and often increased security features are installed. There is no evidence that any particular harm was occasioned in the present case or that any changes to security came about. What I am talking about is offences of break, enter and steal generally. That is the offence that the offender has committed now on ten occasions over the course of a lengthy criminal history. This offence was committed after a 16-year-old resident of a home in Killara left her home after her mother had left earlier. In contrast to the offender, the 16‑year‑old girl was heading off to work. She locked all the windows and doors except for the window directly adjacent to the front door. At some time whilst she was absent from the home the offender has arrived and used an unspecified object to jemmy open the top pane of that window. He then entered the house, in the process cutting himself leaving behind a blood stain which would ultimately lead to his detection.
	
	
	Once inside he entered the master bedroom and removed a number of things, a quantity of jewellery which consisted of a silver necklace and costume jewellery, a silver and gold bracelet, a number of silver and gold rings with gemstones as well other property a camcorder, a camera and a wallet which contained a credit card. The total value of the property stolen was $5,150. This is not a terribly significant amount, but in my view it is quite wrong to focus too much on the monetary value of items taken. It would not be surprising at all to learn some of the items taken and not recovered were of sentimental value, jewellery often is. Certainly the offender did not know and clearly he did not care.
	
	
	After taking that property he left the home and it was later that day when the young girl returned home from work that she discovered what had happened.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I impose upon him will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	The offender was arrested on 21 July 2015 some months after committing this heist. Mr Dick who appears for the offender today helpfully went through the guideline judgment of R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 which sets out a number of factors which judges should consider in assessing the objective gravity of an offence. There was, in this case, some planning but nothing to suggest that the planning was out of the ordinary. Very few break, enter and steal offences do not involve some level of planning. There was no-one home, there was no gratuitous vandalism, the offence occurred in daylight hours and there is no evidence of unexpected trauma suffered by the residents.
	
	
	Mr Dick accurately submitted that the monetary value of the property taken was relatively low but I have already commented on the likely other value that the property had to its rightful owners.
	
	
	The offender’s background is made known to me in an affidavit which he swore and to which the Crown had no objection. The offender’s father was a person who, it has to be said, was not the best influence upon his children after being forced to give up a promising rugby league career because of injury. He would spend most of his time drinking and his sources of income included prize fighting or pool playing. Mr Williams reports that his father would often come home drunk, beat his mother up and vandalise their home. Significantly when Mr Williams was but 12 years of age he walked into his parent’s bedroom to find his father there with another man in possession of duffel bags full of cash, balaclavas and hand guns. They had apparently just robbed a bank.
	
	
	Thus Mr Williams was exposed to both violence and criminality from a very early age. His mother on the other hand has been supportive of him and remarkably she still is supportive of him despite the trouble he must have caused her over his lengthy career. She is in court today which demonstrates in a concrete way support for her son. Given the trouble he must have caused his mother, Mr Williams probably recognises that he owes her quite a bit. In his affidavit he says that upon release from custody he plans to live with his mother and support her. Hopefully he will do what he says he will do, and hopefully he will look after her as she grows older and eventually reaches the stage where she will need the support of her children, including of course the offender.
	
	
	The offender’s problems with crime began as they often do in the context of problems with drugs. His experience in early high school was such that he would associate with other drug using students and each day they would go to the park to drink, smoke cannabis and play football. His drug use escalated to rohypnol, valium and serepax, speed when he was 14.
	
	
	The offender has spent a great deal of his life in custody, he went to his father’s funeral in handcuffs because he was in prison at the time. He went to a brother’s funeral, he having died of an accidental heroin overdose, also in handcuffs because once again he was in prison at the time. He is a man who has a very significant criminal history. As well as the nine earlier convictions for break and enter, he has three convictions for armed robbery and four convictions for firearms offences. This is clearly a case where the offender’s continuing attitude of disobedience to the law means that a sentence with a significant component of personal deterrence needs to be imposed.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the Crown’s objection I will make a finding of special circumstances in this case. The Crown’s point was a good one. Those who have abused leniency shown to them in the past by committing offences whilst on parole can scarcely claim any entitlement to a reduction of their non‑parole period. However, when a wider view is taken of the purposes of sentencing which after all are primarily to protect the community I consider it appropriate to make a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour.
	
	
	He is now 50 years of age. He must be getting too old for this. He will benefit from an extended period of supervision on parole as he attempts to reintegrate into the community after what must clearly be a significant risk that he is already institutionalised.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since 21 July 2015 so the sentence I will now announce is to commence from that date. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years. It will expire on 20 January 2018. I set a head sentence of four years. Mr Williams is referred to the Drug Court.

		24 August 2016",2016-03-23 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769045,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 38) [2016] NSWSC 329,"Judgment EX TEMPORE – REVISED


	
	Ms Shead, who appears on behalf of McNamara, has requested the Crown to make available Juan Carlos Battisti for the purposes of cross-examination. Ms Shead will seek to elicit from Mr Battisti part of the contents of a statement he made to police on 2 November 2015. In short, the statement of Mr Battisti discloses that he and Mr McNamara became acquainted some years ago as a consequence of their regular attendance at a gymnasium. For present purposes, the focus is on paragraph 7 of Mr Battisti's statement which reads as follows:
	


“On the next occasion I trained with Glen I said to him, 'I was surprised to see how old and small Roger Rogerson is'. Glen said words to the effect, 'that little old guy is still as dangerous now as ever’. The only other time Glen mentioned Roger Rogerson to me was when I rang him on this one occasion. I don't know the exact date but it was sometime after the book launch I rang Glen to see if he was coming to training and Glen told me that he wouldn't be coming because he was travelling back to Sydney from Griffith, then in a smart arse way Glen said, 'Be careful what you say because my mate Rogerson is here with me'. When Glen said this to me, I felt like he was big noting and upping himself, After he said this I spoke to one of the guys in the boxing class and told them what Glen had told me” (emphasis added)


	
	Ms Shead will seek, in particular, to elicit the italicised part of Mr Battisti’s statement. On the evidence, the conversation to which Mr Battisti referred occurred in about 2012 or 2013.
	
	
	Ms Shead submitted that the evidence was relevant and admissible on two bases. Firstly, she submitted that the evidence of what Mr McNamara had said to Mr Battisti went to McNamara's knowledge of Rogerson’s general demeanour and his consequent fear of Rogerson, and that this was relevant to his proposed defence of duress. Secondly, she submitted that the evidence was relevant to rebut a proposition which was expected to be put to McNamara in cross-examination, to the effect that his proposed defence of duress is a recent invention. Ms Shead submitted that it was crucial to McNamara's case that any suggestion of recent invention or fabrication be rebutted. Having stressed the importance of the evidence from the point of view of her case, Ms Shead further submitted that any prejudice to Rogerson which might be caused by the evidence being admitted could be ameliorated by a direction from me. She submitted, consistent with authorities to which I referred in determining an earlier application to discharge the jury (see R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No. 34) [2016] NSWSC 259 at [45]-[49]) that I would necessarily be confident that the jury would adhere to, and apply, any such direction.
	
	
	Mr Thomas, on behalf of Rogerson, submitted that the evidence would, if admitted, be unfairly prejudicial and that such unfair prejudice substantially outweighed any probative value that the evidence might otherwise have. In support of that proposition, he stressed what he described as the ""general"" nature of what had allegedly been said. As I understood it, Mr Thomas was submitting that the terms of what Mr McNamara had allegedly said were non-specific, and thus lent themselves to being misleading and/or confusing. In advancing these submissions Mr Thomas relied upon s. 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) which is in the following terms:
	


135 General discretion to exclude evidence 

The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or

(b) be misleading or confusing, or

(c) cause or result in undue waste of time.


	
	Reliance on s. 135 of the Act proceeds on the assumption that the evidence is otherwise relevant. The section requires me to undertake a balancing exercise, the nature of which was explained by Basten JA in Dyldan Developments Pty Ltd v Jones (2008) NSWCA 56 at [78].
	
	
	In my view, the probative value of the evidence is low for a number of reasons.
	
	
	Firstly, the terms of what McNamara allegedly said to Mr Battisti are, as Ms Shead expressly conceded, vague. To state the obvious, and as Mr Thomas submitted, a person may be regarded as ""dangerous"" for a number of different reasons, and in a variety of different contexts.
	
	
	Secondly, it is not insignificant that Mr Battisti's statement also makes reference to a further conversation he had with McNamara, in the course of which he (McNamara) described Rogerson as ""my mate"". Prima facie at least, that may be regarded as being inconsistent with a belief that McNamara was in fear of Rogerson because he was said to be dangerous. At the very least, the second conversation to which Mr Battisti renders the evidence of the earlier statement potentially misleading and/or confusing.
	
	
	Thirdly, the statement attributed to McNamara was made in either 2012 or 2013. Irrespective of which it might be, it is a significant period of time before the events to which this trial is related took place. The fact that the statement is somewhat remote in time is a factor which goes to lessen its probative value.
	
	
	As against those considerations, and for obvious reasons, the terms of what McNamara is alleged to have said to Mr Battisti create a danger of unfair prejudice to Rogerson.
	
	
	For all of those reasons, I have come to the view that the probative value of the evidence is low. Such probative value as the evidence might have is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial to Rogerson, and/or be misleading and confusing. Accordingly, the evidence will be excluded.

2769050,Lynn v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 57,"Headnote

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant was convicted of the indictable offence of manslaughter. On 7 November 2008, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months.

On 17 December 2013, Hidden J ordered, pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act), that the appellant be subject to a high risk violent offender extended supervision order for a period of three years. The appellant was further ordered to comply with certain conditions scheduled to the court’s order.

The appellant filed summons seeking leave to appeal on 1 September 2015. The appellant contended that the trial judge erred in law in his construction of the phrase “unacceptable risk” in s 5E(2) of the Act. In particular, the appellant contended that the proper construction of the phrase “unacceptable risk” entails consideration of the consequences for an offender of making an order, including the impacts on the individual’s personal liberty.

Beazley P, Basten JA (Gleeson JA agreeing):

(1)   Sections 5F and 5G provide for the kinds of orders that may be made under the Act. The Court’s determination of an application for such an order is made under s 9: [47], [48], [110]-[111].

(2)   Pursuant to s 9, the court has a discretion whether to make one or other of the orders for which ss 5F and 5G provide or to dismiss the application: [48], [149], [112]-[113].

(3)   A finding that a person poses an “unacceptable risk” within the meaning of s 5E(2) is the gateway to the power to make an order of the kinds specified in ss 5F and 5G: [55], [148].

   State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWCA 280 at [24]

(4)   The meaning of the phrase “unacceptable risk” is a question of statutory construction, to be determined having regard to its context and purpose: [49]-[61].

   Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue [2009] HCA 41; 239 CLR 27 at [47]; Certain Lloyd's Underwriters Subscribing to Contract No IH00AAQS v Cross [2012] HCA 56; 248 CLR 378 at [28]; CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2; 187 CLR 384 at 408; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355 at [69]

(5)   The purpose of the Act may be found, inter alia, in the objects provisions of the Act. Whether this is so will depend upon the provisions of the objects clause, as statutory objects are not always harmonious. The objects provisions of an Act cannot control clear statutory language: [54].

   Russo v Aiello [2003] HCA 53; 215 CLR 643 at [5]; Pitt & Badgery Ltd v Sydney Municipal Council (1908) 24 WN (NSW) 203 at 204; Birch v Allen [1942] HCA 17; 65 CLR 621; Wacando v Commonwealth [1981] HCA 60; 148 CLR 1 at 16; Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd (1996) 91 LGERA 31 at 78.

(6)   The right of an offender to his or her personal liberty at the expiry of the sentence of imprisonment being served is not relevant to the determination of whether a person poses an “unacceptable risk” for the purposes of s 5E(2). [44], [55]-[58], [128], [148].

(7)   In determining whether and what order to make, the Court is required to take into account the factors specified in s 9(3), as well as any other matter it considers relevant. This may include the fact that the proposed order will place constraints on the individual’s liberty and privacy: [48], [131], [149].

Basten JA:

(8)   The nature of the appeal contemplated by s 22 of the Act is that of an appeal by way of rehearing. On an appeal pursuant to s 22 of the Act, the Court has the power to make such order as could have been made at first instance, if thought appropriate: [81]-[94], [95]-[97].

(Gleeson JA agreeing):

(9)   The exercise required by s 5E in considering an application for an extended supervision order can be considered as four interlocking steps. The steps are to identify (i) the nature and seriousness of the risk posed by the offender with respect to further serious violence offences, (ii) the appropriate conditions which might be imposed as part of an extended supervision order, (iii) the likely effect of such an order in removing or diminishing the risk and (iv), if an order is otherwise appropriate, whether there are factors personal to the offender which would militate against making the order: [124], [148]

(10)   The court will engage in a “balancing exercise” when seeking to impose the least intrusive conditions consistent with its assessment of the risk posed by the offender and a further assessment as to what conditions are likely to be effective. The interests of the offender in liberty and privacy are properly treated as relevant considerations in ensuring that unjustifiable conditions are not imposed: [129]-[130], [148].

Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: Scott David Lynn is a “violent offender” within the meaning of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act). The “serious violence offence” which constituted the index offence was the indictable offence of manslaughter, in respect of which Hidden J, on 7 November 2008, sentenced Mr Lynn to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. The details of Mr Lynn’s criminal history and personal background are otherwise to be found in his Honour’s reasons for judgment: State of NSW v Lynn [2015] NSWSC 665.
	
	
	On 17 December 2013, Hidden J made an order pursuant to the Act that Mr Lynn be subject to a high risk violent offender extended supervision order for a period of three years from the date of the order. He was further ordered to comply with conditions set out in schedule A to the court’s order. His Honour noted that in accordance with s 10 of the Act, Mr Lynn’s obligations under the extended supervision order were suspended for any period that he was in lawful custody.
	
	
	Mr Lynn sought leave to appeal from his Honour’s orders. The Court directed that the summons seeking leave to appeal and the appeal be heard concurrently. If the appeal were to succeed, Mr Lynn sought an order that the matter be remitted to a first instance judge of the Supreme Court for redetermination. In addition to a grant of leave, Mr Lynn required an extension of time in which to file his summons.
	
	
	Mr Lynn did not apply for legal aid until 27 February 2014, approximately two weeks after the expiry of the time for filing a summons for leave to appeal: Uniform Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) (UCPR), r 51.10(1)(b). Legal aid was granted in April 2015. Ms Robinson, the solicitor with carriage of the matter at Legal Aid NSW, filed three affidavits in which she explained the delay in the grant of legal aid and in bringing the appeal. Except for a period during which it would appear no attention was given to the matter at Legal Aid NSW, the solicitor with the carriage of the matter from time to time attended to the matter diligently.
	
	
	One matter that caused delay in considering whether legal aid would be granted was the unavailability of the judgment in the matter. Enquiries made to the Court by the Legal Aid solicitor with carriage of the matter revealed that judgment had been delayed during a period when the primary judge was unwell. Once judgment was delivered on 29 May 2015, there were a number of protocols to be observed by Legal Aid NSW, including obtaining independent legal advice, before a final decision was made as to whether to grant legal aid.
	


Preliminary matters


	
	Although an appeal is brought from a court’s judgment or orders and not the reasons for judgment, the basis for bringing an appeal is usually founded in the court’s reasons. The delay in the court’s delivery of its reasons for judgment was in no way the fault of Mr Lynn. Nor was the delay in the grant of Legal Aid attributable to any conduct by Mr Lynn. The only delay for which he was responsible was that relating to his application for legal aid. In my opinion, that delay of a few weeks after Mr Lynn’s release was insufficient to disentitle him from the favourable exercise of the discretion to extend time.
	
	
	However, I observe that the affidavit evidence explaining the delay reveals that the processes of Legal Aid NSW are inadequate to ensure the timely filing of appeals in accordance with the Court’s rules. This is a matter that should be brought to the attention of the relevant authorities, as observance of the rules of Court, particularly those relating to the time in which proceedings are to be commenced, is vital to the proper administration of justice.
	
	
	A further, and fundamental, consideration in determining whether to grant an extension of time is that the orders made by his Honour on 10 January 2014 imposed significant restrictions on Mr Lynn’s liberty. That factor outweighs the short period of delay for which Mr Lynn was responsible. I consider that the time for filing the summons for leave to appeal should be extended until 1 September 2015, when the summons seeking leave to appeal was filed.
	
	
	I also consider, in circumstances where Mr Lynn’s liberty is at stake, that there should be a grant of leave to appeal. The respondent did not oppose the grant of leave on either basis. It will thus be convenient to refer to Mr Lynn in these reasons as the appellant. However, for the reasons which follow, I consider that the appeal should be dismissed.
	


Issues on the appeal


	
	The appellant’s essential challenge to the primary judge’s determination was that his Honour erred in law in his construction of the phrase “unacceptable risk” in s 5E(2) of the Act. On the appellant’s argument, the proper construction of that phrase required his Honour, in making an order under the Act, to take into account that the prior custodial sentence imposed by the Court having been served in full, the person potentially subject to the order would otherwise be entitled to their personal liberty.
	
	
	A challenge to the conditions imposed by his Honour in respect of the appellant’s release on the extended supervision order was abandoned during the course of the hearing.
	


The legislation


	
	The Act, which by reference to its Long Title is, relevantly, an “Act to provide for the supervision and detention of high risk … violent offenders”, permits the making of an extended supervision order or an extended detention order for a “high risk violent offender”, whose custodial sentence has otherwise expired, or is about to expire.
	
	
	Part 1 of the Act contains preliminary provisions, including a statement of the objects of the Act: s 3, and the definition of terms in the Act: s 4.
	
	
	The primary object of the Act, as stated in s 3(1), is:
	


“… to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of … high risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.”


	
	Section 3(2) provides that another object of the Act is to encourage such offenders to “undertake rehabilitation”.
	
	
	Section 4 contains the following relevant definitions:
	


“extended supervision order means an order for the supervision of an offender made under section 5C or 5F.

…

high risk violent offender—see section 5E.

high risk violent offender continuing detention order means a continuing detention order made under section 5G.

…

offender means [relevantly] a violent offender.

…

serious violence offence—see section 5A.

…

violent offender means a person over the age of 18 years who has at any time been sentenced to imprisonment following his or her conviction for a serious violence offence.”

The appellant is a “violent offender” within the meaning of the definition in s 4.


	
	Section 5A provides, relevantly:
	


“5A   Definition of ‘serious violence offence’

(1)   For the purposes of this Act, a serious violence offence is a serious indictable offence that is constituted by a person:

(a)   engaging in conduct that causes the death of another person or grievous bodily harm to another person, with the intention of causing, or while being reckless as to causing, the death of another person or grievous or actual bodily harm to another person …”


	
	Section 5E provides:
	


“5E   High risk violent offender

(1)   An offender can be made the subject of a high risk violent offender extended supervision order or a high risk violent offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk violent offender.

(2)   An offender is a high risk violent offender if the offender is a violent offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3)   The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious violence offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence.”


	
	Part 1A, Div 2 prescribes the persons against whom an extended supervision order or a continuing detention order may be made. An extended supervision order or a continuing detention order may only be made if the offender is “a high risk violent offender”.
	
	
	Section 5F provides for the making of extended supervision orders as follows:
	


“5F   Extended supervision orders for high risk violent offenders

(1)   The Supreme Court may, on application under this Act, make an order for the supervision of an offender if the offender is a high risk violent offender.

(2)   An order made under this section is an extended supervision order.

(3)   An extended supervision order made under this section may also be referred to as a high risk violent offender extended supervision order.”


	
	Section 5G provides for the making of a continuing detention order as follows:
	


“5G   Continuing detention orders for high risk violent offenders

(1)   The Supreme Court may, on application under this Act, make an order for the detention of an offender if the offender is a high risk violent offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.”


	
	Part 2 specifies the requirements for making an application for an extended supervision order. The State is the sole entity entitled under the Act to make such an application: s 5H. Pursuant to s 5J(2), an application may only be made in respect of a “supervised violent offender”, defined in s 5J(2) to mean a violent offender, who when the application for the order is made, is in custody serving a sentence of imprisonment for a serious violence offence or for breach of a supervision order: s 5J(2)(a); or pursuant to an existing extended supervision order or continuing detention order: s 5J(2)(b).
	
	
	Part 2, Div 2 governs the determination of an application for an order under the Act. Section 9(1) provides that the Supreme Court may determine an application for an extended supervision order by making such an order or by dismissing the application. Section 9(3) provides for a range of matters to which the Court must have regard in determining the application, in addition to any other matters that it considers relevant. The matters to which regard must be had include, relevant to the argument on the appeal:
	


“(a)   the safety of the community,

…

(d1)   any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community,

(e)   any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,

(f)   the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,

…

(h)   the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

…

(i)   any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order) or serious violence offences (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).”


	
	Section 10 provides for the term of an extended supervision order. Pursuant to s 10(1) an order commences when it is made or when the offender’s current custody or supervision expires, whichever is the latter. The maximum term of an extended supervision order is 5 years: s 10(1A)(a). An offender’s obligations under an extended supervision order are suspended for any period that the offender is in lawful custody: s 10(2). If an order is suspended, the period of the extended supervision order is extended by the period of its suspension: s 10(1A)(b).
	
	
	Part 4 deals with proceedings that have been commenced by the State pursuant to s 5H. Section 21 provides that such proceedings are civil proceedings. Pursuant to s 22(1) an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from a determination of the Supreme Court to make or refuse to make an order under the Act. An appeal may be on a question of fact, a question of law, or a mixed question of fact and law: s 22(2). The appeal is as of right if brought within 28 days, or otherwise by leave of the Court of Appeal within such further time as the Court may allow: s 22(3). The bringing of an appeal does not stay the operation of any order made under the Act: s 22(4).
	
	
	Sections 22(4A) and (4B) provide:
	


“(4A)   If the Court of Appeal remits a matter to the Supreme Court for decision after an appeal is made, the extended supervision order or continuing detention order the subject of the appeal continues in force, subject to any order made by the Court of Appeal.

(4B)   Without limiting any other jurisdiction it may have, if the Court of Appeal remits a matter to the Supreme Court for decision after an appeal is made, the Court of Appeal may make an interim order revoking or varying an extended supervision order or a continuing detention order the subject of the appeal.”

Trial judge’s reasons


	
	As the issue before the Court on the appeal is of narrow scope, it is sufficient to refer to his Honour’s reasons briefly.
	
	
	Before the primary judge, the appellant argued that there was a tension between the provisions of subs 5E(2) and (3). That tension was said to arise from:
	


“… the requirement in subs (2) of satisfaction to a high degree of probability that an offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence, on the one hand, and the provision in subs (3) that there need not be a determination that the risk be more likely than not, on the other”: at [67]


	
	The primary judge, at [68], rejected that argument, stating:
	


“Any assessment of whether a risk is unacceptable turns not only on the likelihood of the risk coming home, but also on the gravity of the consequences if it does. At issue here is the risk to the community of the commission of a serious violence offence.”


	
	His Honour, referring to the observation of R A Hulme J in State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 118, at [16], that a risk “may be less likely than not but still be an unacceptable risk”, continued, at [68]:
	


“What subs (2) requires is that I be satisfied to a high degree of probability that there is a risk of that kind.”


	
	Hidden J concluded, at [74], that he was satisfied to the requisite degree that the appellant:
	


“… [posed] an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if not kept under supervision [and that] an extended supervision order [was] necessary to ensure the safety and protection of the community, as well as to encourage [the appellant] to undertake rehabilitation: s 3 of the Act.”

Appellant’s submissions


	
	The appellant submitted that ss 5E, 5F and 5G are interrelated provisions that confer a discretion on the court to make an extended supervision order: s 5F; or a continuing detention order: s 5G. The discretion to make either order is enlivened if, and only if, the person is a “high risk violent offender”: s 5E. The appellant contended that in determining whether to make an order, the finding that a person is a high risk offender does not mandate that an order be made under ss 5F or 5G. Rather, under those provisions the court has a discretion as to whether to make such an order.
	
	
	The appellant further submitted that, in determining whether to make an order, s 9 involved the court in a further discretionary exercise. The appellant contended that, having regard to the considerations for which s 9(3) provides, s 9 appeared to be directed to the test in s 5E(2), that is, the question whether a person posed an “unacceptable risk”, rather than being directed to the discretionary power to make an order under ss 5F and 5G. This was so, it was contended, notwithstanding that the considerations required to be taken into account by s 9(3) were not exhaustive.
	
	
	The appellant contended that the non-exhaustive provisions of s 9(3) and the discretionary nature of s 5F were both relevant to the question of “unacceptable risk” for the purposes of s 5E(2). According to his argument, the requirement in s 5E(2) of “satisfaction to a high degree of probability” that the risk be “unacceptable” and the question of “adequacy of supervision” raised by s 5G(1) drew attention to the need to consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether a person was a “high risk violent offender”. Those considerations included the fact that any order made under the Act involved an imposition on the liberty of the person, in circumstances where the person had already served, or had almost fully served, the punishment imposed for the offences of which the person had been convicted.
	
	
	In short, the appellant submitted that the right of a person to his or her personal liberty was an inherent aspect of the test of “unacceptable risk” and that this consideration had to be taken into account by the court in its determination of whether a person was a “high risk violent offender” within the meaning of s 5E(2). The determination under s 5E(2) thus involved balancing the interest of the individual in his or her personal liberty with other relevant factors including the safety and protection of the community.
	
	
	The appellant accepted that his Honour’s remarks at [68], set out above, were accurate insofar as they went. However, it was submitted, they were not sufficient for the purposes of determining whether a person posed an “unacceptable risk” within the meaning of s 5E(2). As the argument went, having failed to take into account the imposition on the appellant’s liberty if an order was made, his Honour had erred in law in his determination that the appellant posed an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if not kept under supervision.
	
	
	The appellant pointed to the existence of competing authorities on the meaning of “unacceptable risk” in s 5E(2). One approach in the authorities involved the construction of the section according to the ordinary meaning of the words used: see Thomas (Preliminary); State of New South Wales v Darrego [2011] NSWSC 360 at [19]-[20]; State of New South Wales v Thomas (Final) [2011] NSWSC 307 at [57]-[58]; State of New South Wales v Reed [2011] NSWSC 625 at [16]; State of New South Wales v Darrego [2011] NSWSC 1449 at [28]; Attorney General of New South Wales v McGuire [2015] NSWSC 152 at [44]. The other approach was described as requiring a balancing exercise, which included taking into account the effect of a constraint on a person’s liberty if an order was made: State of New South Wales v Richardson (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 276 at [90]; see also Attorney General of New South Wales v McGuire [2016] NSWSC 158 at [36]. The appellant submitted that the approach in Richardson was to be preferred.
	
	
	The appellant referred to provisions of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW), which also contains the phrase “unacceptable risk”. The appellant also referred to interstate authorities that have dealt with comparable, but not identical, legislation: see Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v GTR [2008] WASCA 187; 38 WAR 307; Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams [2007] WASCA 206; 35 WAR 297; Nigro v Secretary to the Department of Justice [2013] VSCA 213; 41 VR 359, and on the balancing exercise found to be required under the provisions of different legislation: see M v M [1988] HCA 68; 166 CLR 69 at 78 as discussed in Fardon v Attorney-General (Qld) [2004] HCA 46; 223 CLR 575.
	
	
	The appellant further submitted that the objects of the legislation, stated in s 3, were of limited use in determining the proper construction of “unacceptable risk” and that in any event, those objects did not trump the interests of the individual in his or her own liberty.
	


Respondent’s submissions


	
	The respondent submitted that the correct approach to the determination of whether a person was a “high risk violent offender” within the meaning of s 5E required an evaluation of whether, having regard to the magnitude of the risk that a particular offender will commit a serious violence offence in the absence of a supervision order, and the nature and gravity of the consequences if the risk eventuates, the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that this approach reflected the ordinary meaning of the phrase “unacceptable risk” when considered in its statutory context and the general purpose and policy of the legislation: see Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue [2009] HCA 41; 239 CLR 27 at [24]. The respondent submitted that the purpose of a legislative provision was to be found, inter alia, in the objects clause of the relevant Act and may also be derived from the text of the Act and any relevant extrinsic material: Certain Lloyd's Underwriters Subscribing to Contract No IH00AAQS v Cross [2012] HCA 56; 248 CLR 378 at [70].
	
	
	The respondent also submitted that the appellant’s reliance on the Western Australian authorities was misplaced, given the different wording of the legislation in that State.
	


Determination


	
	The question raised on the appeal was whether s 5E(2) requires that a person’s right to liberty be taken into account in the assessment of whether the person “poses an unacceptable risk” within the meaning of the section. That is a different question from that which was raised before the primary judge. However, the respondent did not object to this question being argued on the appeal and it is appropriate to deal with it.
	
	
	For the reasons that follow, I am of the opinion that the right of an offender to his or her personal liberty at the expiry of the sentence of imprisonment being served is not a relevant consideration in the determination of whether a person poses an “unacceptable risk” for the purposes of s 5E(2). Nor do I consider that the appellant’s analysis of the decision making process in determining whether to make an order under the Act is correct. It is convenient to deal with this latter point before dealing with the meaning of “unacceptable risk”.
	
	
	As was explained in Cornwall v Attorney-General for New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 374, in relation to an earlier incarnation of the Act:
	


“[18]   It is a fundamental principle of criminal law that a person convicted of a crime must be given punishment appropriate to that crime and no more: Veen v. The Queen (1979) 143 CLR 458, Veen v. The Queen (No.2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. Another fundamental principle of criminal law is that, subject to the possibility of appeal, the appropriate punishment is determined once and for all when the person is sentenced for the crime: this is one aspect of a wider principle requiring finality in litigation. Of course, the sentence may, for example by leaving open the possibility for parole, allow for some variation in how it operates, depending on future circumstances. But the appropriateness of the sentence itself cannot later be challenged.

[19]   Thus if, in addition to appropriate punishment for crimes they have committed, persons are to have their liberty further restricted because of what they might do in the future, this requires justification outside the ordinary principles of criminal law, and outside the ordinary principle that interference with liberty is generally restricted to interference that is deserved by reason of actual criminal conduct. In passing the Act, the New South Wales legislature has determined that, for the protection of the public, there should in specific cases be restrictions of liberty on that basis.” (emphases added)


	
	Part 1A of the Act provides for the supervision and detention of high risk offenders. Part 1A, Div 2 deals specifically with high risk violent offenders. It does so, first by providing that an order may be made, if and only if, a person is a “high risk violent offender”. As McClellan CJ at CL observed of the Act prior to its amendment, that:
	


“… an order can only be made ‘if and only if’ the Court is relevantly satisfied emphasises the care with which the Court must approach the question of whether to make orders imposing continuing restrictions, in whatever form, on a person’s liberty”: Attorney-General for New South Wales v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340 at [34].

A “high risk violent offender” is a person in respect of whom the court is satisfied to the requisite degree would pose an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if not kept under supervision. It then provides that in respect of such a person the court may make either an extended supervision order or continuing detention order.


	
	Contrary to the appellant’s submission, ss 5F and 5G are not the provisions of the Act under which the court exercises its discretion to make an order. Rather, those sections provide for the orders that may be made under the Act. This is so notwithstanding that the terms of subs (2) and (3) of each section refer to an order made “under” the section.
	
	
	The determination of an application for an order under the Act is undertaken under Pt 1A, Div 2, s 9. In accordance with that section, the court has a discretion whether to make one or other of the orders for which ss 5F and 5G provide or to dismiss the application. In determining whether and what order to make, the Court is required to take into account the factors specified in s 9(3), as well as any other matter it considers relevant. The only orders that may be made are those for which ss 5F and 5G provide. However, before the Court embarks upon the s 9 determination, it must have been satisfied to a high degree of probability that the person is a “high risk violent offender”, as provided for in s 5E(2).
	


Meaning of unacceptable risk


	
	The meaning of the phrase “unacceptable risk” raises, in the first instance, a question of statutory construction. The principles of statutory construction are well settled. In Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue the plurality in the High Court stated, at [47]:
	


“… the task of statutory construction must begin with a consideration of the text itself. Historical considerations and extrinsic materials cannot be relied on to displace the clear meaning of the text. The language which has actually been employed in the text of legislation is the surest guide to legislative intention. The meaning of the text may require consideration of the context, which includes the general purpose and policy of a provision, in particular the mischief it is seeking to remedy.” (footnotes omitted)


	
	As the respondent pointed out in its submissions, by reference to dictionary definitions, the word “unacceptable” requires context in which, or parameters against which, the “unacceptable” risk can be measured. Thus, according to the Macquarie Dictionary, that which is unacceptable is “so far from a required standard, norm expectation, etc as not to be allowed”. The Oxford Dictionary defines the word by reference to its antonym “acceptable”. Something is “acceptable” if it is “tolerable or allowable, not a cause for concern; within prescribed parameters”.
	
	
	What the court, therefore, must find to be unacceptable is the “risk” that the offender poses “of committing a serious violence offence if … not kept under supervision”. The respondent accepted that the precise parameters or standard or norm against which that determination is to be made are not immediately evident from the text of the provision. That must be so. A determination as to whether something is unacceptable is an evaluative task, and evaluative determinations require a context in which to be made.
	
	
	As the passage cited above from Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue makes clear, the context in which words or phrases are used in a statutory provision is relevant to their proper construction. In Certain Lloyd’s Underwriters v Cross, French CJ and Hayne J stated, at [28], that it is not to be doubted that the provisions of an Act must be construed in context. Their Honours referred to CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2; 187 CLR 384, where the Court stated, at 408:
	


“It is well settled that at common law, apart from any reliance upon s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), the court may have regard to reports of law reform bodies to ascertain the mischief which a statute is intended to cure. Moreover, the modern approach to statutory interpretation (a) insists that the context be considered in the first instance, not merely at some later stage when ambiguity might be thought to arise, and (b) uses ‘context’ in its widest sense to include such things as the existing state of the law and the mischief which, by legitimate means such as those just mentioned, one may discern the statute was intended to remedy. Instances of general words in a statute being so constrained by their context are numerous. In particular, as McHugh JA pointed out in Isherwood v Butler Pollnow Pty Ltd, if the apparently plain words of a provision are read in the light of the mischief which the statute was designed to overcome and of the objects of the legislation, they may wear a very different appearance.”


	
	This principle of statutory construction that a statute is to be read as a whole was restated in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355 at [69]:
	


“The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute. The meaning of the provision must be determined ‘by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole’. In Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos, Dixon CJ pointed out that ‘the context, the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed’. Thus, the process of construction must always begin by examining the context of the provision that is being construed.”


	
	The objects of the legislation may be relevant to the meaning to be given to provisions of the Act. However, the object provisions of an Act cannot control clear statutory language: Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd (1996) 91 LGERA 31 at 78. Further, there are many statutes where the objects of the Act are directed to disparate ends and are not necessarily harmonious. Nonetheless, as Gleeson CJ observed in Russo v Aiello [2003] HCA 53; 215 CLR 643 at [5], the statement of legislative objects is “not an exercise in apologetics”, rather, it gives practical content to terms such as “reasonable”, “justification” and “satisfactory”. Likewise, the Long Title of an Act may be referred to as an aid to construction of the provisions of the Act: Pitt & Badgery Ltd v Sydney Municipal Council (1908) 24 WN (NSW) 203 at 204; Birch v Allen [1942] HCA 17; 65 CLR 621. In Wacando v Commonwealth [1981] HCA 60; 148 CLR 1, Mason J commented, in relation to the use of a statutory preamble as an aid to construction, at 15-16:
	


“It has been said that where the enacting part of a statute is clear and unambiguous it cannot be cut down by the preamble. But this does not mean that a court cannot obtain assistance from the preamble in ascertaining the meaning of an operative provision. The particular section must be seen in its context; the statute must be read as a whole and recourse to the preamble may throw light on the statutory purpose and object.”


	
	This Act provides, as stated in its Long Title, for the extended supervision or continued detention of high risk offenders. The purpose of the legislation, as the primary object of the legislation states, is to “ensure the safety and protection of the community”. The evaluation of whether an offender is a “high risk violent offender” has to be undertaken in that context. The further context in which that evaluation is undertaken is provided by s 5E(2) itself, namely, whether the offender poses an “unacceptable risk” of committing a serious violence offence, when regard is had to the safety and protection of the community, unless the person is kept under supervision, either by way of making an extended supervision order or an extended detention order. As this Court pointed out in State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWCA 280 at [24], a finding that a person poses an “unacceptable risk” within the meaning of s 5E(2):
	


“… is the gateway to the power to make an order under s 5F or s 5G … and applies to an assessment of likelihood (‘unacceptable risk’) in the absence of any supervision.” (original emphasis)


	
	Were the appellant’s argument correct, the Court would be required to engage in the contradictory process of making an assessment of the likelihood of the offender committing a serious violence offence in the absence of supervision, whilst at the same time taking into account in that assessment the fact that the person would be deprived of his or her liberty if an order was made.
	
	
	To the extent that there are differing approaches in the first instance authorities to the determination of whether a person is a “high risk violent offender” within the meaning of s 5E(2), I am of the opinion that the approach of Davies J in Richardson should not be followed insofar as that approach includes having regard to:
	


“… the serious consequences for the Defendant either because he will be detained beyond the period of his sentence although he has not committed any further offence or he will be subject to an onerous supervision order …”


	
	Rather, the proper approach is to give the words of s 5E(2):
	


“… their everyday meaning, in the context of the provision in which they appear, and having regard to the objects of the Act”

as stated by R A Hulme J in Thomas (Final) at [38], and as I have explained above.


	
	Before departing from the first instance authorities, it is appropriate to refer to a further matter. In Thomas (Preliminary) R A Hulme J made the following observation, at [20]:
	


“Whilst bearing in mind the second of those two objects, I would regard the test in s 9(2) as being satisfied if there is a risk that the person will commit a serious sex offence which is present to a sufficient degree so that the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made.” (emphasis added)


	
	In Darrego [2011] NSWSC 360 McCallum J commented, at [8], that:
	


“… a formulation in those terms puts a gloss on the precise words of the test stated in the section, which does not require, in terms, that protection of the community be ‘ensured’ (although that is an object of the Act).”


	
	For my part, I do not understand that R A Hulme J, in using the words of the objects clause, intended to mean that “unacceptable risk” is to be determined in the sense of guaranteeing the safety and protection of the community. Rather, as the respondent has submitted the word “ensure” itself has shades of meaning and, in the context of the Act, the evaluation to be made under s 5E(2) is directed to the assessment of risk in the context of making the community secure from harm as opposed to guaranteeing its safety and protection. As the respondent pointed out, were it otherwise, every risk would be unacceptable.
	


The interstate authorities


	
	As the respondent correctly noted in its written submissions, there are particular problems with any direct application of Western Australian authorities to the construction of the New South Wales legislation. Under the Dangerous Sexual Offenders Act 2006 (WA), an extended supervision order or continuing detention order may be made if an offender is found to be a “serious danger to the community”: s 17(1). By virtue of s 7, an offender can only be a “serious danger to the community” if there is an “unacceptable risk” that the offender would commit a serious sexual offence were an order not to be made.
	
	
	The Western Australian Court of Appeal has construed these provisions as providing that “if the court is satisfied that there is an ‘unacceptable risk’… then the person will necessarily and automatically be a ‘serious danger to the community’”: GTR at [21] per Steytler P and Buss JA; see also Williams at [66] per Wheeler JA (Le Miere AJA agreeing). The Court held that the mandatory considerations in establishing a “serious danger to the community” must also be relevant to the identification of “unacceptable risk”: GTR at [21]. The court has discretion as to what type of order to make, but no discretion as to whether to make an order: GTR at [40], [51]; see also Williams at [68].
	
	
	The New South Wales Act has a different structure, as explained above. A finding of “unacceptable risk” under s 5E(2) is a prerequisite to the making of an order. However, the Court retains a discretion whether to make an order, subject to differing standards of satisfaction for the respective types of orders that may be made.
	
	
	The appellant also relied upon Nigro v Secretary to the Department of Justice as indicating that the liberty of the person was a relevant consideration in determining whether a violent offender posed an “unacceptable risk”.
	
	
	The Serious Sex Offenders (Detention and Supervision) Act 2009 (Vic) provides that a court may make a supervision order in respect of an eligible offender only if satisfied that the offender poses an “unacceptable risk” of committing a relevant offence if no order is made and the offender is in the community. Section 9(4) provides that:
	


“In determining whether or not the offender poses an unacceptable risk as set out in subsection (1), the court must not consider the means of managing the risk or the likely impact of a supervision order on the offender.”


	
	Pursuant to s 9(7), the court has a discretion whether to make an order under the Act, notwithstanding that it has determined under s 9(1) that a person poses an “unacceptable risk”.
	
	
	In Nigro the Court of Appeal held, at [103], that:
	


“The legislative framework for s 9 contemplates that the nature of any order that is made and its effects upon the offender, including its impingement upon his rights, are matters to be taken into account when exercising the discretion under sub-s (7)”


	
	The appellant submitted that this construction of the Victorian Act supported the construction of s 5E(2) for which he contended, particularly in circumstances where there is no equivalent provision to s 9(4) in the New South Wales legislation. The respondent contended that the express prohibition in s 9(4) was implicit in s 5E(2).
	
	
	In my opinion, Nigro does not assist the appellant. Notwithstanding that the Victorian legislation, unlike the Western Australia Act, confers on the court a discretion whether to make an order, there are differences between the Victorian legislation and the New South Wales Act. In particular, s 9 does not specify the matters that must be taken into account in exercising the discretion whether to make an order. Further, Victorian authorities must be viewed in the context of the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic). But in any event, it is also clear that the Court in Nigro, in taking into account the offender’s right to liberty, did so in the context of determining whether to make an order, and not in the earlier determination of whether the offender posed an unacceptable risk: at [103].
	


Other legislative provisions


	
	The appellant also relied upon the use of the phrase “unacceptable risk” in the Bail Act. Pursuant to s 19(1) of that Act, bail must be refused if the relevant bail authority “is satisfied, on the basis of an assessment of bail concerns … that there is an unacceptable risk”. A “bail concern” is one or more of the matters specified in s 17(2) that a bail authority must assess before making a bail decision. Those matters are a concern that the applicant for bail will: fail to appear at any proceedings for the offence; commit a serious offence; endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community; or interfere with witnesses or evidence.
	
	
	Section 18 of the Bail Act prescribes the only matters that a bail authority is to consider in the assessment of bail concerns. The prescribed matters include: questions going to the nature of the alleged crime; the strength of the Crown case; the bail applicant’s history, including any violent history and any non-compliance with bail, and assessment of the likelihood of a custodial sentence being imposed; and, pursuant to para (m), “the need for the accused person to be free for any other lawful reason”.
	
	
	In that context, s 19(1) requires bail to be refused if there is “an unacceptable risk”. An “unacceptable risk” is defined in s 19(2) by a reference to four prescribed integers: a risk that the accused person, if released from custody, will fail to appear at any proceedings for the offence; commit a serious offence; endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community; or interfere with witnesses or evidence.
	
	
	It will be immediately apparent that the assessment of an “unacceptable risk” in the context of a bail authority’s determination as to whether to grant bail is both context specific and prescriptive. It provides no assistance to the question of the proper construction of the phrase “unacceptable risk” in s 5E(2).
	
	
	Finally, I would add that I have not found the High Court’s reference in M v M to a balancing act to be of particular assistance in determining the proper construction of the statutory phrase “unacceptable risk”. Whilst it is correct, as the High Court in Fardon v Attorney General (Qld) observed, at [225], by reference to M v M, that the “process of reaching a predictive conclusion about risk is not a novel one”, that observation does not relate to or compel the construction of the phrase for which the appellant contends.
	


Conclusion


	
	Accordingly, I would propose the following orders:
	


1.   Extend the time for filing the summons for leave to appeal until 1 September 2015;

2.   Grant leave to appeal;

3.   Dismiss the appeal.


	
	BASTEN JA: The applicant seeks to challenge a decision of Hidden J in the Common Law Division determining that he was a high risk violent offender and subjecting him to an extended supervision order under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (“High Risk Offenders Act”). [1] 
	


Current status of applicant


	
	The Court raised in the course of the hearing a concern that neither the legal representatives of the applicant nor those appearing for the State had thought it proper to place before the Court any evidence as to the present status of the applicant (being in custody) or the consequence of making the order sought (namely, setting aside the extended supervision order). There were three separate issues which appeared not to have been adequately considered. The first was the nature of the appeal to this Court which, for reasons explained below, is an appeal by way of rehearing. The second was a failure to address the powers of the Court deriving from s 22 of the High Risk Offenders Act. The third was the consequences of an order setting aside the extended supervision order.
	
	
	If the effect of setting aside the extended supervision order would be to take away the legal basis of any proceedings for its transgression which may have resulted in penal consequences for the applicant, it was important to know whether there had been such proceedings. Thus, if there had been breaches which involved criminal offences, were custodial sentences imposed for the breach of the order or for the further criminal conduct?
	
	
	The third issue involved factual matters which were not put before the Court, but which could have been significant whether or not the appeal was by way of rehearing. Because the appeal should be dismissed for other reasons, it is not necessary to address the third issue further. In other circumstances it might have been important, with the result that there would have necessarily been an adjournment of the proceedings, with consequential delay. It is appropriate, however, to deal with the first two matters, before turning to the grounds of appeal.
	


Nature of appeal


	
	It is convenient to start with the jurisdictional issue. The extended supervision order was made under the High Risk Offenders Act. With respect to offenders who have committed a “serious sex offence” or a “serious violence offence” (as defined in s 5A) the Supreme Court has power to make orders for continuing detention or extended supervision after the completion of a sentence. (The applicant was found to fall within the latter category and further reference to provisions relating to sex offenders is unnecessary.) Such orders may be made with respect to a “high risk violent offender”, as defined in s 5E. [2]  No application was made for his continuing detention, but only for supervision within the community. Nevertheless, the nature of the supervision may be both intrusive and extensive.
	
	
	Whether a particular person falls within the category of “high risk violent offender” depends on an opinion formed by a Supreme Court judge, “to a high degree of probability”, that the offender poses “an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.” [3]  The required state of satisfaction is a precondition to the exercise of the power, which requires the exercise of discretionary judgment, both as to whether such an order is made and as to the nature of the supervision.
	
	
	This brief outline of the statutory context is important in determining the nature and scope of the appeal. The High Risk Offenders Act has a specific provision for appeal to this Court.
	


22   Right of appeal

(1)   An appeal to the Court of Appeal lies from any determination of the Supreme Court to make, or to refuse to make, an extended supervision order, continuing detention order or emergency detention order.

(2)   An appeal may be on a question of law, a question of fact or a question of mixed law and fact.

(3)   An appeal against the decision of the Supreme Court may be made, as of right, within 28 days after the date on which the decision was made or, by leave, within such further time as the Court of Appeal may allow.

(4)   The making of an appeal does not stay the operation of an extended supervision order, continuing detention order or emergency detention order.

(4A)   If the Court of Appeal remits a matter to the Supreme Court for decision after an appeal is made, the extended supervision order, continuing detention order or emergency detention order the subject of the appeal continues in force, subject to any order made by the Court of Appeal.

(4B)   Without limiting any other jurisdiction it may have, if the Court of Appeal remits a matter to the Supreme Court for decision after an appeal is made, the Court of Appeal may make an interim order revoking or varying an extended supervision order, continuing detention order or emergency detention order the subject of the appeal.

(5)   This section does not limit any right of appeal that may exist apart from this Act.


	
	This provision does not identify the precise nature of the appeal. Appeals are characterised in different ways, but for present purposes the alternatives appear to be an appeal in the strict sense and an appeal by way of rehearing. The former is the more limited: it requires that the appellate court determine whether there has been error on the part of the primary judge, having regard to the law as it stood at the time of the judgment under appeal and upon the evidence before the primary judge. An appeal by way of rehearing allows for a more extended exercise: the appellate court must apply the law as it stands at the date of the appeal and may have regard to further evidence which was not before the primary judge.
	
	
	The correct characterisation is important in the present case because it will determine whether, for the purposes of the appeal, the Court may or indeed should have regard to evidence of what has occurred since the original order was made in December 2013. On the other hand, that material will in any event be relevant for a more limited exercise, namely granting an extension of time, and therefore should have been put before the Court in any event.
	
	
	The sparse wording of s 22 (like the wording of s 5 and s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)) gives little assistance in resolving the characterisation question. However, in the present case the answer is complicated by the inclusion of s 22(5). Is there a separate right of appeal available to the applicant?
	
	
	The short answer is that there would appear to be a right under s 101 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), which provides for an appeal to this Court from “any judgment or order of the Court in a Division”. [4]  Although the Supreme Court Act and the rules do not apply in relation to criminal proceedings identified in the Third Schedule to the Supreme Court Act, by virtue of s 17(1) of the Supreme Court Act, these proceedings do not fall within the categories of criminal proceedings specified in that Schedule. Accordingly, there would appear to be an alternative right of appeal under s 101. Because of the limitation imposed by s 101(2), the applicant would require leave to appeal under that provision. Section 22(5) of the High Risk Offenders Act introduces unnecessary complications by allowing for more than one right of appeal.
	
	
	That conclusion would engage the operation of s 75A of the Supreme Court Act. Although s 75A does not apply to appeals under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) or to a case stated under the Criminal Appeal Act, [5]  there is no exclusion for appeals under the High Risk Offenders Act. Accordingly, the following provisions in s 75A would be engaged:
	


75A   Appeal

…

(5)   Where the decision or other matter under appeal has been given after a hearing, the appeal shall be by way of rehearing.

(6)   The Court shall have the powers and duties of the court, body or other person from whom the appeal is brought, including powers and duties concerning:

(a)   amendment,

(b)   the drawing of inferences and the making of findings of fact, and

(c)   the assessment of damages and other money sums.

(7)   The Court may receive further evidence.

(8)   Notwithstanding subsection (7), where the appeal is from a judgment after a trial or hearing on the merits, the Court shall not receive further evidence except on special grounds.

(9)   Subsection (8) does not apply to evidence concerning matters occurring after the trial or hearing.

(10)   The Court may make any finding or assessment, give any judgment, make any order or give any direction which ought to have been given or made or which the nature of the case requires.


	
	The possibility that more than one appeal provision may apply in a particular case, or that a right of appeal may be qualified, is recognised in terms by s 75A which states that the section “has effect subject to any Act.” [6]  It is not unknown for a specific statute to say that s 75A does or does not apply, or applies with qualifications.
	
	
	As the applicant accepted that the appeal provisions which he sought to invoke were s 22(1)-(3), these issues were not fully addressed by the parties; accordingly, the approach to be adopted by the Court in this case may be open for reconsideration after more extensive argument. Nevertheless, the following propositions should be accepted.
	
	
	First, the inconsistency between the grant of an appeal as of right pursuant to s 22(3) (within 28 days) and the requirement for leave under s 101(2) should be resolved in favour of the specific provision in s 22(3). Accordingly, the applicant is not subject to a general leave requirement, but does require an extension of time.
	
	
	Secondly, there is nothing in s 22 which would expressly limit the operation of s 75A. It is not necessary for the engagement of s 75A that the appeal is brought under s 101 of the Supreme Court Act. Subject to any existing authority to the contrary, there would appear to be no reason why the appeal should not be one by way of rehearing, in accordance with the terms of s 75A set out above. That factor may not be critical in the present case as there was no attempt by either party to put before the Court evidence further to that before the primary judge, except in explanation of the delay in bringing the appeal, which was tendered for the purpose of seeking an extension of time.
	
	
	Thirdly, the relevant provisions with respect to high risk violent offenders were inserted in 2013, prior to the making of the extended supervision order and, in accordance with their transitional provisions, applied to offences which had been committed before the commencement of the amending Act. [7] 
	
	
	Fourthly, there is limited authority relevant to this issue. The nature of the appeal has been addressed most recently by this Court in State of New South Wales v Donovan. [8]  There the Court noted a submission by the State that “appellate review was to be conducted in accordance with Warren v Coombes (1979) 142 CLR 531.” [9]  The Court then noted the description of the nature of an appeal against an evaluative judgment described in a number of judgments of the Queensland Court of Appeal and the Victorian Court of Appeal. There was no rejection of the relevance of Warren v Coombes, which articulates the principles applied by this Court on an appeal by way of rehearing. Nor was there any statement that the appeal was not governed by s 75A of the Supreme Court Act. It should therefore be accepted that the appeal provided by s 22 is by way of rehearing.
	


Powers of this Court on appeal


	
	Section 22 touches on the powers of this Court on an appeal only peripherally and then confusingly. No doubt the Court has powers to dismiss the appeal, in the event that no error is established, or uphold the appeal and set aside the decision made by the primary judge. That is at least consistent with an appeal being available based on a question of law, fact or what is described as “mixed law and fact”. The question is whether, error having been established, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit, or must then remit the matter to a judge in the Division.
	
	
	Remittal is clearly envisaged by subs (4A) and (4B). The confusion arises because subs (4A) provides that upon remittal the order under appeal will continue in force, subject to any order made by this Court. However, unless the Court sets the order aside, there would be no point in remitting it to the Division. Subsection (4B) states that this Court may “make an interim order revoking” an extended supervision order. Revocation can hardly be interim and, as with subs (4A), there is no purpose in a remittal unless the order has been revoked or set aside. Although ineptly expressed, it is likely that the intention of these provisions was to empower the Court, if not able finally to dispose of the proceedings, to make an interim order itself imposing supervision or continuing detention until the matter could be dealt with by a judge in the Division.
	
	
	Given the broad bases upon which an appeal may be brought, the section should be understood to confer on this Court a power to make such order as could have been made in the Division, if thought appropriate. The significance of this conclusion is that both parties should give careful attention to any up-dating evidence which may need to be placed before this Court in the event that the appeal is successful, so that this Court may make an order in substitution for that set aside, other than dismissal of the State’s application.
	


Extension of time


	
	It is troubling that the appeal from the extended supervision order, which was to last three years, has been heard more than two years after it was made. The lapse of time is excessive. Very little of it is due to steps taken in this Court. The summons seeking leave to appeal was apparently filed on 1 September 2015, although the chronology records that it was uplifted and replaced by an amended summons filed on 12 October 2015, with submissions for the applicant. The respondent’s submissions were filed on 15 December 2015 and the matter was listed for hearing on 26 February 2016.
	
	
	The primary judge’s reasons for judgment were published on 29 May 2015, more than 17 months after the orders were apparently made. (The frontsheet of the published judgment records the orders as having been made on 29 May 2015, but that is clearly wrong.) The Court’s record of the orders shows that they were entered on 10 January 2014. It also records that they were made on that date which is also clearly wrong. In the first paragraph of the reasons, the primary judge stated that the extended supervision order was made on 17 December 2013. The parties are of the same view.
	
	
	The delay in entering the order was unfortunate but explicable, given the closeness of the Christmas and New Year holiday period to the making of the order. The incorrect recording of the date on which the order was made is not explained. Nor is the delay in providing reasons.
	
	
	Of immediate concern, because relevant to the extension of time, is the delay in seeking to commence an appeal.
	
	
	The applicant applied for legal aid on 27 February 2014, and was granted aid in April 2014. It may be accepted that the initial grant was limited to considering the merit of an appeal. The solicitor having the carriage of the matter asserted that numerous attempts were made to ascertain whether and if so when reasons would be forthcoming. However, the first such inquiry was not made until 5 February 2015.
	
	
	The difficulties faced by a litigant and his or her legal representatives in circumstances where orders are made but reasons are reserved are not to be underestimated. Generally, it will not be possible to make a realistic assessment of the merit of an appeal without reasons for the orders. To allow that assessment to be made is a primary purpose underlying the obligation to give reasons. To make orders without giving reasons involves a failure to exercise the jurisdiction of the court and is, in a generic sense, an error of law.
	
	
	The delay in giving reasons in the present case resulted in the applicant losing a right of appeal and being relegated to the status of an applicant for an extension of time. The prejudice suffered was illustrated by the position taken by senior counsel for the State in relation to the application for an extension of time, namely that a grant or otherwise should turn upon the merit of the appeal. There was a further element of prejudice: for more than two years the applicant has been the subject of strict constraints on his conditional liberty with the threat of further custody in the event that he transgressed. Although neither party troubled this Court with the details of subsequent events, it appears that there were transgressions which resulted in his return to custody early in 2016, long after any appeal should have been brought and determined.
	
	
	The delay in lodging an appeal was apparently due to his solicitor (and possibly counsel) being of the view that an appeal could not properly be lodged until reasons were obtained. If that were the belief, which can only be inferred, there was a point when it became erroneous. Once there had been a failure to provide reasons within a reasonable period after the orders were made, a period which may well have ended one or two months after the commencement of the law term in 2014, in circumstances where the liberty of the individual was at stake, the applicant had a reasonable, if not unassailable, basis for an appeal. It would have been reasonable to lodge an appeal (or rather an application for an extension time, the time for an appeal as of right having expired) by the end of March 2014. That was not done, but, the responsibility for that omission may fairly be assumed to lie with the applicant’s legal representatives and should not form a basis for the refusal of an extension of time.
	
	
	What was unexplained and remains unfathomable is how the solicitors with carriage of the matter could have spent a year seeking documents, which apparently, when collected, amounted to nine folders of material without first making a concerted effort to obtain the critical document (other than the actual orders), namely the reasons for judgment. That point aside, the solicitor’s affidavit purporting to explain the steps taken records nothing happening between mid-April and mid-November 2014.
	
	
	As to the period from 5 February 2015 (when the first inquiry was made of the Court as to the availability of reasons) until 29 May 2015 when the judgment was provided, the delay was not the responsibility of the applicant. According to information supplied to his solicitor, the judge was very ill for part of that period.
	
	
	Of greater concern is the lapse of time following the delivery of reasons on 29 May 2015. Two reasons were given for the delay of a little over three months before the summons seeking leave to appeal was filed and served (though apparently in an inappropriate form). One reason related to the workload and administrative requirements within Legal Aid NSW. Whilst the Court may properly take judicial notice of the limited resources available to Legal Aid NSW, it is likely that the principal cause was the other matter relied upon. That was the assertion by the solicitor that it was necessary to “accumulate” some “nine volumes” of material, including transcript. Although no further detail was provided as to the nature of the exercise, it is possible that the appeal from the extended supervision order was treated as in the nature of an appeal from the criminal conviction for the “serious violence crime” which engaged the power to make the order. While the nature of this material was not identified, it is clear that most of it proved irrelevant – the full volume of materials placed before this Court in relation to leave and the substantive appeal comprised less than 400 pages (in one folder). It would still have been less than 400 pages had the original application for the order been included, as it should have been from the outset, it being the document which first invoked the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to make the order under challenge.
	
	
	From these circumstances (which are only partly explained) it may be inferred that the delay was at no stage caused by the applicant. It is also proper to note that the matter proceeded with expedition once senior counsel who appeared on the appeal had been briefed. In the circumstances, there should be a grant of leave to extend time for the filing of the summons commencing the proceedings up to the date of filing and service of the amended summons on 12 October 2015.
	


Statutory scheme


	
	The power of the Court to make an extended supervision order is to be found in s 5F of the High Risk Offenders Act.
	


5F   Extended supervision orders for high risk violent offenders

(1)   The Supreme Court may, on application under this Act, make an order for the supervision of an offender if the offender is a high risk violent offender.

(2)   An order made under this section is an extended supervision order.

(3)   An extended supervision order made under this section may also be referred to as a high risk violent offender extended supervision order.


	
	The jurisdiction is invoked by an application by the State pursuant to s 5H. The application must be made at a time when the offender is in custody or under supervision: s 5J. The application must be supported by documentation including relevant medical reports assessing the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious violence offence: s 6(3).
	
	
	The Court determines the application either by making an order or dismissing the application: s 9(1). In exercising its power, a number of matters are identified as mandatory considerations.
	


9   Determination of application for extended supervision order

…

(3)   In determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant:

(a)   the safety of the community,

(b)   the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7(4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination,

(c)   the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,

(d)   the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence,

(d1)   any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community,

(e)   any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,

(f)   the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,

(g)   the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004,

(h)   the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

(h1)   the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,

(i)   any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit … serious violence offences (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).


	
	The order may impose a range of conditions, some of which are relatively intrusive. A non-exhaustive list of available conditions is found in s 11 and includes permitting any corrective services officer access to the offender’s home and to any computer in his or her home; participating in treatment and rehabilitation programs; wearing an electronic monitoring device; not contacting particular persons or classes of persons; reporting and providing information to police.
	
	
	Breach of an extended supervision order is an offence carrying a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment: s 12. An order may operate for up to five years and may be renewed: s 10. The period is suspended whilst the person is in lawful custody.
	
	
	It is not necessary for present purposes to identify the meaning of “serious violence offence” beyond the fact that it includes conduct causing the death of another person: s 5A(1)(a). The criterion which engages the power to make an extended supervision order is expressed in s 5E in the following terms:
	


5E   High risk violent offender

(1)   An offender can be made the subject of a high risk violent offender extended supervision order or a high risk violent offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk violent offender.

(2)   An offender is a high risk violent offender if the offender is a violent offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3)   The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious violence offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence.

Issues on appeal

(a)   Does “unacceptable risk” incorporate a balancing exercise?


	
	There was no dispute that the power conferred on the Court is discretionary; further, the criterion of engagement self-evidently involves an evaluative assessment of the offender and the risk posed to the community. Nor was it in dispute that part of the exercise required of the Court was to take account of the consequences for the offender of making an order, including the intrusion on his liberty and privacy. However, according to the applicant, what was required and was not done by the primary judge, was to factor the effects on him into the assessment of “unacceptable risk” in s 5E(2). His second submission was that these adverse effects were not taken into account by the primary judge at any stage.
	
	
	By way of response, the State submitted that the consequences for the applicant were properly taken into account in considering the exercise of the discretionary power.
	
	
	As far as they went the applicant’s submissions should be accepted. First, as accepted by this Court in Donovan, [10]  the principle articulated by Mason and Brennan JJ in Williams v The Queen [11]  applies:
	


“The right to personal liberty cannot be impaired or taken away without lawful authority and then only to the extent and for the time which the law prescribes. The issue in this case is the extent of the power of the police to detain in their custody for questioning a person who has been lawfully arrested.”


	
	Secondly, it was not any risk of further offending by way of a serious violence offence which could have led to him being characterised as a high risk violent offender. The statute clearly envisages a threshold of acceptable and unacceptable risk.
	
	
	Thirdly, as it is clear that the Court should impose no more intrusive constraints than appears reasonably appropriate to effect the protective purpose, it is appropriate to ask why that is so. The applicant’s answer must be that it is so, because it is necessary to balance the restrictions in contemplation against the freedom of movement and lawful conduct and his right to privacy, which he would otherwise be entitled to enjoy in full measure.
	
	
	Fourthly, there is authority which appears to support the applicant’s approach.
	


(b)   Interpretation of s 5E


	
	To address the applicant’s submissions it is necessary to understand the statutory scheme. The statutory language is not easy to apply. Although the defined phrase is “high risk violent offender” the only reference to “high” in the definition is to the “high degree of probability” that the offender poses an unacceptable risk. The high degree of probability qualifies the state of the judge’s satisfaction, not the degree of the risk. Indeed, satisfaction and risk are likely to work inversely to each other. Thus, the lower the required level of risk, the easier it will be for the judge to hold a high degree of satisfaction that it exists; the higher the test of what is unacceptable, the harder it will be to satisfy the judge to a high degree of confidence that it exists.
	
	
	Nor is clarity achieved by s 5E(3), referring to whether “the risk of a person committing a serious violence offence is more likely than not”. That language appears to concede the inappropriateness of referring in subs (2) to “a high degree of probability”, even though that phrase refers to the state of satisfaction, rather than the level of risk.
	
	
	The exercise required by the statute in considering an application for an extended supervision order can be broken down into four steps, which are not appropriately described as temporal stages, one consequent on the other; rather, they interlock. The steps are to identify (i) the nature and seriousness of the risk posed by the offender with respect to further serious violence offences, (ii) the appropriate conditions which might be imposed as part of an extended supervision order, (iii) the likely effect of such an order in removing or diminishing the risk and (iv), if an order is otherwise appropriate, whether there are factors personal to the offender which would militate against making the order.
	
	
	Addressing the first element, the applicant submitted, in effect, that there was a degree of artificiality in separating the adverse consequences for him and dealing with them only in considering whether to make the order. Put in pragmatic terms, the scales would be heavily weighted against him if his interests could only be taken into account after determining that he posed “an unacceptable risk”. In other words, once it had been determined that he posed an unacceptable risk to the community, the making of an order was all but inevitable. This, he submitted, constituted a serious diminution, if not a disregard of, his fundamental right to liberty. Accepting that a form of preventative detention or supervision was provided for by the statute, in contrast to the freedoms available under the general law, those freedoms should nevertheless be accorded appropriate weight in determining whether an order should be made.
	
	
	To evaluate this submission it is necessary to return to the exercise required of the Court. The nature of the risk he posed had to be assessed by reference to past conduct, the seriousness of the possible future conduct and the period over which the risk may come to fruition. The assessment must be based on an absence of protective measures. The criterion of unacceptability will no doubt depend upon these matters, together with a comparison, to the extent that the evidence permits, of what may be described as the background level of risk to the community from violent offenders.
	
	
	The concept of “risk” clearly involves a risk to the community; although the qualifier “unacceptable” could be read in an extended sense as meaning deemed unacceptable by the Court, it is still the composite phrase which must be understood as referring to a risk to the community. A finding of unacceptable risk provides the basis for imposing control on the offender. In its ordinary meaning, involving risk to the community, there is no rationale for taking into account consequences of the finding of unacceptable risk, being consequences flowing to the offender as a result of the imposition of controls. That conclusion is supported by the list of mandatory considerations to be taken into account in determining whether to make such an order, set out in s 9(3), all of which focus on the risk posed by the offender.
	
	
	It is true that the interests of the offender in liberty and privacy form part of a set of underlying assumptions in considering what may be “unacceptable risk”; they play a role at that stage, but a lesser role than that proposed. The underlying premise is present in every sentencing exercise: it is very rarely expressly identified. Even in relation to a sentence of imprisonment, which may not be imposed unless the court is satisfied that no lesser penalty is appropriate, [12]  that assessment will only be referred to in borderline cases. In other words, an obvious premise is usually unstated because it is well understood. The applicant was wrong to propose that a consideration of his interests formed part of a balancing exercise inherent in determining “unacceptable risk” and required express recognition at that stage in the reasoning.
	
	
	The second step, not reached until the court is comfortably satisfied that the offender presents a heightened risk of further offending, absent supervision, involves a determination of what conditions may be imposed with the purpose of diminishing the risk to an acceptable level. It is self-evident that this will involve a “balancing” exercise, in the sense that the court will seek to impose the least intrusive conditions consistent with its assessment of the risk and a further assessment as to what kind of conditions are likely to be effective. If the evidence suggested that effective supervision (described as “adequate supervision” in s 5G(1)) would not be provided by an extended supervision order, the State might consider an application for a continuing detention order: none was sought in the present case.
	
	
	The submission that this step engages a balancing exercise involving possible intrusions on the applicant’s liberty and privacy should be accepted and they will properly be treated as relevant considerations in ensuring that unjustifiable conditions are not imposed.
	
	
	Finally, consideration of the offender’s circumstances may also influence the ultimate exercise of discretion as to whether or not to make the proposed order. On the other hand, it would be incorrect to suggest that his interests are primarily considered only at the final stage of exercising the discretionary power. In practical terms, they are most likely to carry weight at the intermediate stage of considering the appropriate conditions.
	


(c)   Case law on assessing “unacceptable risk”


	
	A degree of caution is necessary in dealing with the case law. Although similar language is used in legislation in other States, it is rarely appropriate to extract a particular word such as “unacceptable” out of its immediate context. A similar degree of caution should be exercised with respect to the case law in this State, the legislation having changed over time.
	
	
	The dangers of relying on authorities dealing with other legislation are illustrated by a strong statement in favour of the applicant’s position taken by Steytler P and Buss JA in Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v GTR: [13] 
	


“The word 'unacceptable' necessarily connotes a balancing exercise, requiring the court to have regard, amongst other things, for the nature of the risk (the commission of a serious sexual offence, with serious consequences for the victim) and the likelihood of the risk coming to fruition, on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the offender, on the other, if an order is made (either detention … or being required to undergo what might be an onerous supervision order).”


	
	That was said in the context of the Dangerous Sexual Offenders Act 2006 (WA), s 17(1) of which provided that if the court found the offender to be a serious danger to the community, the court “may” order that the offender be detained or order that the offender be subject to specified conditions. Before reaching the conclusion set out above, Steytler P and Buss JA had referred to the reasoning in an earlier Court of Appeal decision, Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams. [14]  The majority in that case, being Wheeler JA (with whom Le Miere AJA agreed) concluded that, read in its statutory context, “may” meant “must”. Having reached that conclusion [15]  Wheeler JA continued: [16] 
	


“However, on the view that I take of the considerations to which the court must have regard in determining whether to find that a person is a serious danger to the community, the court has already, in arriving at that view, balanced all relevant considerations including the potential consequence of such a finding for the offender. If that is the correct view of the way in which the court should approach the making of such a finding, then there will be no further relevant considerations which the court can have regard to in deciding whether to make, or decline to make, an order.”


	
	If, under the New South Wales Act, the court retains a lively discretion as to whether or not to make an order, a conclusion which the applicant did not challenge, the logic that all relevant considerations must have been assessed in reaching a conclusion as to the criterion of engagement (in this case “unacceptable risk”) does not arise.
	
	
	The Western Australian approach was adopted by Davies J in State of New South Wales v Richardson (No 2), his Honour concluding, after a review of available authorities: [17] 
	


“Two things seem to me significant when assessing the evidence and the likelihood of re-offending. The first is the higher standard of proof imposed by the words ‘a high degree of probability’. The second is the notion that ‘unacceptable risk’ involves a balancing exercise between the commission of a serious sexual offence and the likelihood of that risk coming to fruition on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the Defendant either because he will be detained beyond the period of his sentence although he has not committed any further offence or he will be subject to an onerous supervision order, on the other hand.”


	
	That conclusion did not follow from the authority relied on, absent careful attention to the earlier point of construction to which Davies J did not advert. Significantly, as noted by Hoeben CJ at CL in Attorney General of New South Wales v McGuire, [18]  there is a line of authority in this State adopting a different approach. As he explained at [43]:
	


“In State of NSW v Graeme Allan Reed (Preliminary) [19]  McCallum J noted the two approaches and cited the submissions of the State ‘that it may be appropriate to treat the interstate authorities (and implicitly the decision of Davies J to the extent his Honour relied upon those authorities) with caution’. Her Honour observed ‘the impact of an order on the offender is not a factor in the relevant balancing exercise, which focuses rather on the assessment of factors relevant to the content of the risk itself (such as the degree of risk and likely consequences if an offence is committed)’ (at [15]).”


	
	The primary judge in the present case referred to the passage adopted by Davies J in GTR and also to the test which he, Davies J, applied. The judge then referred to State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary), [20]  in which R A Hulme J had considered the legislative history, and concluded:
	


“[19]   One matter that should be borne in mind in considering the new ""unacceptable risk"" test is the objects of the Act set out in s 3 of the Act. That section is in the following terms:

(1)   The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.

(2)   Another object of this Act is to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation.

[20]   Whilst bearing in mind the second of those two objects, I would regard the test in s 9(2) as being satisfied if there is a risk that the person will commit a serious sex offence which is present to a sufficient degree so that the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made.”


	
	In McGuire, Hoeben CJ at CL concluded at [44]:
	


“There are thus two approaches which have been taken by first instance decisions in NSW as to what factors the Court ought have regard to in considering what will constitute an “unacceptable risk”. The issue as to which of these approaches is correct remains to be resolved. I am of the opinion that the preferable approach is that adopted by R A Hulme J and I propose to apply it in this case.”


	
	In Donovan, this Court noted the varying opinions in the Division, but did not need to resolve the issue and did not purport to do so. The applicant invites the Court now to adhere to the approach preferred by Davies J. For the reasons indicated above, that invitation should be rejected. However, it is also wrong to adopt what is portrayed as the alternative approach, namely that the balancing exercise is only engaged at the last stage of the exercise. In fact, as has been explained, the applicant’s interests colour each aspect of the determination, and will probably receive expression in considering the proper scope of the conditions to be imposed.
	
	
	That consideration of the offender’s circumstances will be most directly relevant in the exercise of formulating the conditions of the order has been recognised in a series of decisions, referred to by this Court in Wilde v State of New South Wales. [21]  These included State of New South Wales v Ali, [22]  where Johnson J said that “the imposition of conditions which are considered appropriate involves the striking of a balance between relevant considerations, so as to provide an outcome which is fit and proper.” Similarly, in State of New South Wales v Green (Final), [23]  R A Hulme J accepted that conditions “ought not be imposed that are unjustifiably onerous or simply punitive.” That proposition was accepted in Wilde, [24]  while avoiding a further suggested requirement that the condition have a demonstrable link to the risk of further offending of the proscribed kind. [25] 
	


Reasoning of primary judge


	
	When the primary judge came to articulate his own approach, he did so in the context of a submission that there was a tension between the requirement of subs 5E(2) and subs 5E(3). The primary judge correctly rejected the submission, which failed to distinguish between the high degree of satisfaction required of the Court and the characterisation of the risk. He continued: [26] 
	


“In my view, the relationship between the two subsections is explained by the authorities to which Davies J referred in Richardson, particularly in the passage from the judgment of RA Hulme J in Thomas at [15]-[20] set out above. Any assessment of whether a risk is unacceptable turns not only on the likelihood of the risk coming home, but also on the gravity of the consequences if it does. At issue here is the risk to the community of the commission of a serious violence offence. As RA Hulme J put it, that risk may be less than likely but still be unacceptable. What subs (2) requires is that I be satisfied to a high degree of probability that there is a risk of that kind.”


	
	The offender’s interests will properly be treated as relevant considerations in ensuring that unjustifiable conditions are not imposed and may also influence the ultimate exercise of discretion as to whether or not to make the proposed order. Further, as noted above, his interests are likely to carry weight in considering appropriate conditions. It was in the course of considering the objections raised by the applicant’s counsel to particular conditions that the primary judge acknowledged the importance of the effect of the conditions on the offender, not merely as an abstract proposition, but having regard, appropriately, to the likely manner of their application. Thus, after a careful consideration of the conditions which were the subject of submissions [27]  the judge concluded: [28] 
	


“Undoubtedly, the conditions provide for a strict, indeed onerous, regime. However, I was satisfied that the intensive supervision for which it provides is appropriately directed to the protection of the community and to the closely related aim of the defendant’s rehabilitation. I made the order upon the assumption that the regime would be conducted with appropriate flexibility, the conditions being relaxed if the defendant’s conduct justified it, and that there would be no question of restrictions being imposed arbitrarily.”

Conclusions


	
	While the primary judge referred, without criticism, to the approach adopted by Davies J in respect of the “balancing exercise” appropriate to determining an “unacceptable risk”, he did not adopt that erroneous approach. That is not what the applicant challenged; indeed, the applicant’s case was that the balancing exercise was required and that the trial judge erred in failing to apply it. That challenge must be rejected on the basis that the premise is false.
	
	
	The secondary submission was that the primary judge at no stage had proper regard to the applicant’s interests in liberty and privacy. However, the primary judge expressly took those matters into account in dealing with the appropriateness of particular conditions, which had been challenged by the applicant as not being necessary. This aspect of the appeal must also be rejected.
	
	
	The appellant’s case was expressly confined to the issues of legal principle which have been addressed above. As those grounds have been rejected, the appeal must be dismissed. Accordingly, the Court should make the following orders:
	


(1)   Pursuant to s 22(3) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW), extend the time for filing the summons commencing the appeal to 12 October 2015.

(2)   Dismiss the appeal.


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Beazley P for the reasons given by her Honour. I would add the following observations.
	
	
	It can be readily accepted that orders for the supervision or detention of a “high risk violent offender” involve a significant restriction on the personal liberty of the subject outside the ordinary principles of the common law. The basis for that interference with liberty in specific cases is to be found in Parliament’s determination that such orders may be made for the protection of the public. The pre-condition for the making of such orders is that the offender is a “high risk violent offender”: s 5E(1), Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act). It would subvert the language of the statute if the interests of the offender in liberty and privacy were to be taken into account in the assessment of the threshold of “unacceptable risk” in s 5E(2) of the Act. There is no “balancing” exercise involved in the court’s assessment of the threshold of “unacceptable risk”.
	
	
	The interests of the offender in liberty and privacy are to be taken into account in the exercise of the court’s discretionary power under s 9 of the Act to either make an extended supervision order, or dismiss the application for such an order. Although not explicit in the Act, conceptually the exercise of the discretionary power can be viewed, as Basten JA has suggested, as involving an intermediate stage of considering the appropriate conditions which might be imposed as part of an extended supervision order, before considering whether such an order is otherwise appropriate. I agree with Basten JA that consideration of the possible intrusions on the offender’s liberty and privacy are appropriately taken into account at that intermediate and final stage of exercise of the discretionary power. Contrary to the appellant’s submissions in the present case, there is nothing inherently artificial in separating the adverse consequences for him and dealing with them only after the threshold assessment of unacceptable risk has been made.

2769058,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 31) [2016] NSWSC 195,"Judgment

BACKGROUND


	
	The Crown wishes to lead evidence of a telephone conversation between the accused McNamara and his daughter Jessica McNamara which took place on 27 October 2014, at a time when McNamara was in custody following his arrest.
	
	
	Ms Shead, who appears on behalf of McNamara, has objected to the evidence, on the basis that the conversation is privileged.
	


THE CONVERSATION


	
	The relevant part of the conversation appears at pg 215 of a transcript tendered on the application. It is common ground that the reference to “Hudson” in the conversation is a reference to Hudson Lu, McNamara’s then solicitor. The conversation is in (inter alia) the following terms (where “V.2” denotes McNamara and “V.1” denotes his daughter):
	


V.1   Yeah. Are you O.K? You sound down.

V.2   I'm just worried about why Hudson wants to see you this afternoon, you know.

V.1   He probably just has something that he wants me to sign.

V.1    Mmm.

V.2    The autopsy report says that the sample they took from the deceased

V.1   Yeah.

V.2    — wasn't suitable to, to test for amphetamines. He was never

V.1   O.K.

V.2   — tested for, never tested for it.

V.1   O.K

V.2   That’s the cops covering, thats the police covering things up.

V.1   Yeah.

V.2    And the toxicology scientist put a —

V.1   Yeah.

V.2   —   on the toxicology report saying, The sample was degraded,

and therefore the result should be treated with caution.V.1   O.K.

V.2   So, you know.

V.1   And the- --

V.2   And the other thing that I remembered, and I've, and was corroborated

by the autopsy report, is this fellow had a, was wearing a rubber glove

on his right hand, so, so   —

V.1   O.K.

V.2   — no, no gunshot residue. Talk about premeditation.

V.1   Yeah, O.K. Rubber glove---

V.2   On his right hand, and he had his —

V.1   —on his right hand.

V.2   — hand, and his wrist was covered by his hoodie, down to, down to

the rubber glove, you know.

V.1   O.K.

V.2   Who turns, who turns up with a rubber glove on themselves, you

   know?

V.1   ….

V.2   On their gun hand?

V.1   Yeah.

V.2   Unbelievable. And its, its in their, its in their report.

V.1   O.K.

V.2   All right.

V.1   All right.

V.2   Its just good for —

V.1   But---

V.2   — good for me.

V.1   Yeah. I'll make sure that he knows that.

V.2   But tell him, the sample they took for —

V.1   Sample they took was not suited for testing amphetamines.

V.2   Not suitable for testing amphetamines.

V.1   Yeah.

V.2   And, they never took one that was.

V.1   O.K. Hudson did say that there was an extra sample that could be

taken, if, if they, if you wanted to have it tested, but, but then again, if

its similar to the other sample, I doubt that its suitable.V.2   But, if its, if its, see, it’d be degraded, you know.

V.1   I'll ask about it.

V.2   Just tell him that they've put these   

in this report.

V.1   Yeah.

V.2   I understand, he probably read this, hasn't read it, like, as thoroughly

as I've read it, I've got a lot more time on my hands than he has.V.1   Yeah. Well, as I said, the good thing, I guess, that I'm going to see him

anyway, so I can ….these things.

V.2   Tell him.

V.1   I will.

V.2   Tell him, the police, you know, the police take these samples and you

rely on their honesty when they're not honest.

V.1   They're, yeah, they're not honest   

V.2   They're not honest, you know. I mean —

V.1   Yeah.

V.2   — I mean, don't say that he tested negative for amphetamines, thats

not right. They took a sample —

V.1   Yeah.

V.2   — that wasn't capable of being, being —

V.1   Of being tested for amphetamine.

V.2   — tested for amphetamine. Like, they can do scientific things to put

men on Mars and they can't take a sample? Come on.V.1   Yeah.

V.2   Really.

V.1   I mean, that sounds dodgy. They can test, they can test for things like

6 months after   deceased, like   they can —

V.2   They - - -

V.1   —get a good sample.

V.2   — they didn't, well, they didn't take any hair samples. See, if you pull

a hair sample out, you can test it.

V.1   Yeah. For 3 months, actually, I know that.

V.2   They, they didn't take a hair sample. Its been longer than 3 months,

now, and —

V.1   No, I, I just mean that it stayed there —

V.2   Was he buried or —

V.1   — he, he'd been, no, he's cremated.

V.2   Was he?

V.1   He's, he's in, he's dust now.

V.2   Well, thats it, you can't do anything more now.

V.1   Yeah.

V.2   You know. But, but, but the technician put on this, this thing, you

know, a, a condition that, don't really take too much notice of this result because the samples were degraded.

V.1   Cause it wasn't, there was no   (INDISTINCT), and all the samples

were degraded.

V.2   Samples were degraded.

V.1   Yeah.

V.2    So, don't take, don't take - - -

V.1   The toxicology   

V.2   — caution, caution should be used when reading the results, and -

V.1   Mmm Mmm.

V.2   — by the way, the sample wasn't a sample capable of being tested

for amphetamines.

V.1   O.K.

V.2   Let him know those things. And the, and the, and the —

V.1   Of course I will.

V.2   — and the guy had a, a, a, a, a glove on his right hand —

V.1   A rubber glove on his right hand, and —

V.2   — to protect him —

V.1   ….

V.2   — to protect him from gunshot residue.

V.1   O.K. On right hand.

V.2   All right.

V.1   All right. Well, I'll discuss all this. I love you.


	
	In light of one of the submissions advanced by the Crown which I have discussed further below, it is relevant to note that at the commencement of the call, a recorded voice stated the following:
	


“You are about to receive a phone call from an inmate at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre. Your conversation will be recorded and may be monitored. If you do not wish to receive this call please hang up now. Go ahead please.”


	
	Although the terms of that recording are directed to the recipient of the call (in this case, Ms McNamara) it was, as I understood it, accepted by the parties that such recording is also heard by the inmate who places the call (in this case McNamara). As a consequence, McNamara was aware of the fact that the conversation would be recorded, and could be monitored.
	


THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS


	
	Section 117 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) contains the following relevant definitions:
	


117 Definitions

In this Division: 

""client"" includes the following:

(a) a person or body who engages a lawyer to provide legal services or who employs a lawyer (including under a contract of service),

(b) an employee or agent of a client,

(c) an employer of a lawyer if the employer is:

(i) the Commonwealth or a State or Territory, or

(ii) a body established by a law of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory,

(d) if, under a law of a State or Territory relating to persons of unsound mind, a manager, committee or person (however described) is for the time being acting in respect of the person, estate or property of a client-a manager, committee or person so acting,

(e) if a client has died-a personal representative of the client,

(f) a successor to the rights and obligations of a client, being rights and obligations in respect of which a confidential communication was made.

""confidential communication"" means a communication made in such circumstances that, when it was made:

(a) the person who made it, or

(b) the person to whom it was made, was under an express or implied obligation not to disclose its contents, whether or not the obligation arises under law. 

…

(2) A reference in this Division to the commission of an act includes a reference to a failure to act.”


	
	Section 119 of the Act, upon which Ms Shead relied in support of her submissions, is in the following terms:
	


119 Litigation

Evidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by a client, the court finds that adducing the evidence would result in disclosure of:

(a) a confidential communication between the client and another person, or between a lawyer acting for the client and another person, that was made, or

(b) the contents of a confidential document (whether delivered or not) that was prepared,

for the dominant purpose of the client being provided with professional legal services relating to an Australian or overseas proceeding (including the proceeding before the court), or an anticipated or pending Australian or overseas proceeding, in which the client is or may be, or was or might have been, a party.


	
	Section 122 of the Act deals with the loss of client legal privilege and is in (inter alia) the following terms:
	


122 Loss of client legal privilege: consent and related matters

(1) This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence given with the consent of the client or party concerned.

(2) Subject to subsection (5), this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence if the client or party concerned has acted in a way that is inconsistent with the client or party objecting to the adducing of the evidence because it would result in a disclosure of a kind referred to in section 118, 119 or 120.

(3) Without limiting subsection (2), a client or party is taken to have so acted if:

(a) the client or party knowingly and voluntarily disclosed the substance of the evidence to another person, or

(b) the substance of the evidence has been disclosed with the express or implied consent of the client or party.

(4) The reference in subsection (3) (a) to a knowing and voluntary disclosure does not include a reference to a disclosure by a person who was, at the time of the disclosure, an employee or agent of the client or party, or of a lawyer of the client or party, unless the employee or agent was authorised by the client, party or lawyer to make the disclosure.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES

Submissions on behalf of McNamara


	
	Although Ms Shead initially relied upon s. 118 of the Act, she subsequently eschewed such reliance and based her submissions solely upon the provisions of s. 119.
	
	
	Ms Shead submitted that the conversation was a confidential communication made between a client (McNamara) and another person (his daughter) for the dominant purpose of McNamara being provided with professional legal services by Mr Lu in relation to the current proceedings. Ms Shead submitted that McNamara was, in effect, conveying his instructions to Mr Lu through his daughter in a way which rendered the conversation a confidential communication within the definition of that term. She submitted, in particular, that there was a clear inference that McNamara’s daughter was under an obligation not to disclose (other than to Mr Lu) the contents of what she was told.
	
	
	Ms Shead accepted that the conversation may have taken place for more than one purpose, and/or might have had some ancillary use. However, she submitted that viewed as a whole, it was evident that the dominant purpose of the conversation was for McNamara to be provided with professional legal services by Mr Lu in relation to the proceedings which had been brought against him.
	
	
	Finally, Ms Shead submitted that there was no conduct on the part of McNamara which was in any way inconsistent with the objection which was now taken. She submitted, in particular, that the mere fact that McNamara chose to have the conversation in circumstances where he knew that the conversation may be monitored and would be recorded by the authorities, did not engage the provisions of s. 122(3)(a) or (b) of the Act.
	


Submissions on behalf of Rogerson


	
	Counsel for Rogerson submitted that I would be satisfied, on the basis of evidence given by Ms McNamara before the jury, that this (and other) recorded conversations were little more than an attempt by McNamara to falsely further his allegation of duress. It was submitted that in these circumstances, the conversation was not a “confidential communication” and could not have been said to have taken place for the dominant purpose of McNamara being provided with professional legal services pertaining to the current proceedings.
	
	
	In advancing these submissions, counsel emphasised that a conclusion that the conversation was a confidential communication necessarily relied upon certain inferences being drawn in relation to it. The essence of counsel’s submission was that such inferences were not reasonably open.
	


Submissions on behalf of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the conversation was not a “confidential communication”, for the simple reason that McNamara had chosen to disclose it to the person(s) who might be monitoring it, and who would record it. The Crown submitted that in these circumstances, simply by having the conversation, McNamara had knowingly and voluntarily disclosed its substance.
	
	
	In advancing these submissions the Crown sought to draw an analogy between the present circumstances, and those in which conversation is conducted between two people in the physical presence of a third who overhears it. It was submitted that in such a case, any privilege which might otherwise attach to the conversation would be lost. In support of that proposition the Crown relied upon the decision of Howie J in R v Sharp [2003] NSWSC 1117; (2003) 143 A Crim R 344.
	


CONSIDERATION

The issues


	
	In light of the submissions of the parties, three issues arise:
	



	
	is the conversation a “confidential communication” between a client and another person?
	
	
	if so, was it made for the dominant purpose of the client being provided with professional legal services relating to an Australian or overseas proceeding?
	
	
	if so, has the privilege been lost?
	


Is the conversation a “confidential communication”?


	
	In the circumstances of the present case, whether the conversation constitutes a “confidential communication” essentially turns on the question of whether McNamara’s daughter was under an express or implied obligation not to disclose its contents (other than to Mr Lu).
	
	
	Obligations of the kind to which s. 119 is directed are varied. They can extend to those which are unspoken, ethical, moral and social. Where, as here, a lawyer is not a party to the communication, the circumstances in which the communication was made will determine whether or not the necessary obligation arises as a matter of inference: State of NSW v Jackson [2007] NSWCA 279 at [41] per Giles JA (Mason P and Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) agreeing).
	
	
	In the present case, the relevant circumstances include the fact that:
	



	
	the conversation was one between McNamara and his daughter;
	
	
	its purpose, at least in part, was obviously to have Ms McNamara convey information to Mr Lu about a particular aspect of the current proceedings;
	
	
	it occurred at a time when McNamara was in custody, as a consequence of which access to his lawyer was restricted to some degree.
	



	
	In my view, these circumstances sustain an inference that Ms McNamara was under an unspoken and/or moral obligation not to disclose the contents of the conversation, other than to Mr Lu. The evidence supports a conclusion that McNamara was effectively using his daughter as a person through whom he could communicate with Mr Lu in relation to issues pertaining to the charges laid against him. Although it has been put to Ms McNamara that some of her conversations with her father were, in effect, conducted for the purpose of attempting to falsely construct a defence of duress, I am not able to draw that inference in respect of this particular conversation. Apart from any other consideration, Ms McNamara has not been cross-examined about this conversation at all.
	
	
	As I have previously noted, the Crown relied upon the decision of Howie J in Sharp (supra) in support of the proposition that the communication was not a confidential one. In essence, the Crown submitted that this decision supported the conclusion that because the conversation was conducted in the hearing of a third party (i.e. the authority which was recording and possibly monitoring it) any privilege was lost. In considering that submission, it is necessary to make some brief reference to some authorities which preceded Sharp.
	
	
	In Re Griffin (1887) 8 LR (NSW) 132, Innes J observed:
	


“It seems to me that if a statement be made in the presence of a third party there can be no privilege properly so called. The only privileged communications are those made between solicitor and client when they are alone.”


	
	In R v Braham and Mason [1976] VR 547 Lush J considered the observations of Innes J and said (at 548):
	


“I am unable to accept, if I may say so, with respect, Innes, J.'s categorical statement that the presence of a third party will always destroy privilege … In my opinion, each case must be examined to see whether the communication was one which should be classed as confidential. The fact of the presence of a third party should be examined to see whether that presence indicates that the communication was not intended to be confidential, or whether the presence of the third party was caused by some necessity or some circumstances which did not affect the primary nature of the communication as confidential; and it is with these matters in mind that I look at the situation here.”


	
	The decisions in both Griffin (supra) and Braham and Mason (supra) were, of course, determined according to common law principles, and well before the introduction of the Act. That of Lush J was referred to by Howie J in Sharp, which was a case in which the accused had entered premises in the company of police, in the course of which the telephone rang. The accused answered the call and was heard to have a conversation with a person who was identified as her solicitor. That conversation took place in the presence of the police. It was argued that what the accused had said in that conversation had been said in the course of obtaining legal advice from her solicitor and was therefore privileged. Howie J concluded that evidence of what the accused had said in the conversation was admissible.
	
	
	Having referred to the judgment of Lush J in Braham and Mason his Honour said (commencing at [35]):
	


[35] I believe that is the situation here. The accused was merely repeating to her solicitor what the police, in her belief, already knew: they had put pressure on her (by suggesting that she was in danger from Walsh) and she had told them what had happened (that Walsh had struck the deceased in the head with a hammer). The police were unaware that she was speaking to her solicitor at the time and the accused had done nothing to request that she be able to speak in private with the person on the phone. She, apparently, spoke in a manner that permitted the police to hear what she was saying and she could not have been under any misapprehension that they would overhear the conversation.

[36] Because there was nothing said or done by the accused to indicate that she considered the conversation to be confidential, at common law she could not claim privilege in what she said notwithstanding that it was spoken to her solicitor in the course of seeking his advice. The ALRC appears to have intended that the same position would apply under the Act: the communication has to be confidential at the time it was made. Of course the accused found herself in the presence of the police involuntarily and that may be a factor in determining that the privilege was not lost even though the statement was made in the presence and hearing of the police. For example had the accused indicated she wished to speak to her solicitor in private, the claim would probably be upheld notwithstanding that it was made in the presence and hearing of police.

[37] But on the evidence before me I do not believe that the accused intended that the conversation be confidential and the police had no reason to believe that it was. They were unaware that the accused was speaking with her solicitor. Because the statement was not made, or intended to be made, in confidence, the solicitor was, therefore, under no obligation not to disclose it. It was not a “confidential communication” within the meaning of that term in s 117 and there was no privilege in it. It was thus unnecessary for me to consider whether any privilege in the statement had been waived by the voluntary disclosure of it to the police.


	
	The Crown relied upon the decision in Sharp in support of (inter alia) the proposition that the conversation in the present case was not a confidential communication. However in my view, the present case is factually distinguishable from that of Sharp. In my view, the terms of what McNamara told his daughter, and his purpose in doing so, are indicative of the fact that he intended the conversation to be confidential. Although he must have been aware of the fact that the conversation might be monitored, and would definitely be recorded, the circumstances in which he found himself were not by choice. In Sharp Howie J expressly acknowledged that if the circumstances in which the relevant communication took place were involuntary, that may be a factor which would support the conclusion that the communication was one which was properly regarded as confidential.
	
	
	Further support for the conclusion that the conversation was a confidential communication is to be found in the observations of The Hon. JD Heydon QC in Cross on Evidence (at [25260]):
	


“A communication made to a person mistakenly taken to be a legal advisor has been held privileged. Likewise, when a third party is present and within hearing by reason of circumstances outside the control of the client the privilege will be upheld on the basis that the circumstances did not affect the primary nature of the communication as confidential…Even if there is no express agreement that the communication in the presence of the third party is to be confidential, confidentiality may be inferred if all present assume it.”


	
	In the present case, any monitoring of the conversation had come about by reason of circumstances which, for all relevant purposes, were outside McNamara’s control. The presence of a monitor did not affect what I have found to be the primary nature of the conversation, namely one in which McNamara was effectively conveying instructions to Mr Lu through his daughter. For all of these reasons I am satisfied that the part of the conversation to which objection is taken was a “confidential communication” for the purposes of s. 119 of the Act.
	


Was the communication made for the necessary dominant purpose?


	
	In order for s. 119 of the Act to apply, I must be satisfied that the communication which I have found was confidential was made for the dominant purpose of McNamara being provided with professional legal services relating to an Australian or overseas proceeding to which he was a party. There is obviously no issue that what was discussed related to an Australian proceeding to which McNamara was a party. The issue is whether the communication was made for the dominant purpose of McNamara being provided with professional legal services relating to that proceeding.
	
	
	In the context of statutes dealing with taxation and revenue law it has been observed that the word “dominant”, when used to describe a purpose, is indicative of that which was the ruling, prevailing, or most influential purpose: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd  (1996) 186 CLR 404 at 146 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ; Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd v Singapore Airlines Ltd & Qantas Airways Ltd [2005] NSWCA 47 at [7] per Spigelman CJ.
	
	
	A communication may obviously have more than one purpose. In the present case, Ms Shead expressly accepted that communications between McNamara and his daughter may have been made for multiple purposes. In such a case, whether one particular purpose is dominant in the sense contemplated by s. 119 will be a question of objective fact. However, the subjective purpose for which the communication was made will remain a relevant consideration. On occasions, such a consideration may be decisive: Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Federal Commission of Taxation [1999] HCA 67; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at [172] per Callinan J; Asahi Holdings (Australia) Pty Ltd v Pacific Equity Parties Pty Ltd [2013] FCA 998. If the communication would have been made irrespective of any intention to obtain professional legal services, it is doubtful that the purpose of obtaining professional legal services could be regarded as the dominant purpose: Sparnon v Apand Pty Ltd (1996) 68 FCR 322 at [328]; Westpac Banking Corp v 789 TEN Pty Ltd[2005] NSWCA 321 at [57]; Tabcorp Holdings Limited v Victoria [2013] VSC 302 at [82].
	
	
	When viewed as a whole, the focus of the conversation in the present case was the provision of information to Mr Lu for the purposes of him providing legal services to McNamara. Given the entirety of what was discussed, I am satisfied that the communication would not have been made but for that purpose. It follows that I am satisfied that the dominant purpose of the communication was the provision of such services.
	


Has the privilege been lost?


	
	The final issue is whether, in all of the circumstances, the privilege has been lost. In the circumstances of the present case, this issue falls to be determined according to whether, in light of his knowledge of that the conversation would be recorded and might be monitored, McNamara knowingly and voluntarily disclosed its substance to another person.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that simply by having the conversation as he did, McNamara had knowingly and voluntarily disclosed its substance. Such a submission tends to proceed upon a literal interpretation of the words “knowingly and voluntarily” and, in my view, reflects a degree of oversimplification.
	
	
	In determining whether any privilege attaching the conversation was lost as a consequence of what the Crown submitted was McNamara’s knowing and voluntary disclosure of its substance, McNamara’s subjective intention is a relevant consideration. In Sovreign Motor Inns Pty Ltd v Bevillesta Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 521, in reference to the words “knowingly and voluntarily”, Austin J said (at [23]):
	


“Whatever may be the precise limits of those words, they do not apply in a case where everything indicates an intention to claim privilege … and what has gone wrong is attributable to sheer inadvertence or carelessness”.


	
	A generally similar approach was adopted by Jacobsen J in Boensch v Pascoe [2007] FCA 532 at [38].
	
	
	McNamara has not been called to give evidence on the present application. Whilst I am not able to infer that his disclosure was inadvertent or careless, I am nevertheless of the view that the nature of the conversation, its content, and what I have found to be its dominant purpose, all point to an intention on the part of McNamara that the conversation would be privileged.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that McNamara knowingly and voluntarily disclosed the substance of the conversation, or that he expressly or impliedly consented to such disclosure.
	
	
	For these reasons, the evidence of that part of the conversation to which objection was taken shall be excluded.

2769066,R v Mitchison; R v Wells; R v Whelan [2016] NSWSC 463,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Kris Mitchison and Ricky Paul Whelan pleaded not guilty to a charge alleging that on 26 March 2014 at East Maitland they murdered Steven Macleod.
	
	
	Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan are charged jointly with Mr Mitchison’s mother, Caron Anne Wells. The Crown alleges that there was a joint criminal enterprise between the three to inflict violence upon Mr Macleod with the foreseeable possibility that grievous bodily harm would result. The three are due to be tried before a jury at Newcastle on and from 30 March 2016.
	
	
	This judgment deals with two issues raised prior to the trial commencing.
	
	
	First, Mr Mitchison applies to be tried separately from his co-accused. In short, he contends that there would be irreparable prejudice to his prospect of receiving a fair trial before a jury who will hear certain evidence only admissible in the cases of the co-accused.
	
	
	Secondly, Mr Whelan objects to certain evidence the Crown proposes to adduce from a witness, Mr Guy Mallinson.
	
	
	To set the scene in relation to both applications it is necessary to say something about the overall Crown case.
	


Overview of the Crown case


	
	Steven Macleod was a 50 year old man who was in a relationship with Ms Wells. They lived together in Kenneth Street, East Maitland. It seems that the relationship was volatile; they were both heavy drinkers and they argued loudly, frequently and sometimes violently. According to the Crown case statement, arguments between the pair had been escalating in the week leading up to the incident in question.
	
	
	On Friday 14 March 2014 Mr Macleod and Ms Wells stayed overnight in Newcastle. They returned to Maitland by train. Mr Macleod then caught a taxi back to their home but he forced Ms Wells to walk. It seems that they remained at home, or mostly at home, on the Saturday night.
	
	
	Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan were friends who decided to catch up that Saturday evening. They went out to a local hotel and then to a nightclub until the early hours. On their way home they decided to drop by Mr Mitchison's mother's home, anticipating that she and Mr Macleod might be awake and that they might have a drink with them.
	
	
	Very soon after Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan arrived at the Wells/Macleod home there was an incident of physical violence which resulted in Mr Macleod sustaining a head injury (traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage) to which he succumbed about a week and a half later.
	
	
	The foregoing has been drawn from the Crown case statement. What follows is derived from the various statements and police interviews that were tendered on the application.
	


Kris Mitchison


	
	Mr Mitchison told police in an interview on 26 March 2014 that when he and Mr Whelan arrived at the front door they were met by Ms Wells. She had two black eyes and was saying that she wanted him (Mr Macleod) out: ""she kept saying, 'I want him out. I want him out.'"". He and Mr Whelan entered the home to have a look, ""cause she has said to me before that he hits her and that"".
	
	
	He said he saw Mr Macleod in the hallway and he asked, ""What are you doing mate?"" Mr Macleod grabbed at Mr Whelan's throat and Mr Whelan struck him in a defensive response. He said it might have been an open handed blow but he thought it was probably a fist. Mr Whelan grabbed hold of Mr Macleod as the latter was falling to the ground. Mr Macleod then was seated with his back against the wall.
	
	
	Mr Mitchison then kicked Mr Macleod in the chest/shoulder region. He said that he was not trying to hurt him; it was more to get his attention. Mr Mitchison said he was wearing thongs. He then put his foot on Mr Macleod's chest and said, ""What are you hitting my mum for?""
	
	
	A neighbour, Mr Guy Mallinson, had been alerted to the ruckus and came to investigate. Mr Mitchison said he became aware of Mr Whelan and Mr Mallinson exchanging blows out the front of the house. He went out and stopped them; although it was ""pretty much over by the time I got there"".
	
	
	Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan then went back inside to check on Mr Macleod and Mr Mitchison said that he saw Ms Wells ""kicking the shit out of him""; ""fucking booting him"". He said that “we [he and Mr Whelan] pulled her off him”. He said, ""Don't kick him, he's already down"". Later in the interview he explained that Mr Macleod was slouched against the wall and Ms Wells was kicking him in the head. He saw her do this at least two or three times. He found it hard to describe the force she was using, although he described it as ""like you'd kick a soccer ball"".
	
	
	Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan helped Mr Macleod to his feet. Mr Whelan put him to bed.
	
	
	The pair then went outside to see if Mr Mallinson was alright. They talked to him for five or ten minutes. Mr Whelan and Mr Mallinson shook hands. Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan then left, but before doing so he said to his mother, ""Don't fucking kick him or hit him or nothing while he's fucking sleeping"".
	
	
	Mr Mitchison said that he heard Ms Wells say about Mr Macleod, ""I don't want the cunt here"" many times during the course of the incident.
	


Caron Wells


	
	Ms Wells was interviewed by police on 26 March 2014. She gave an account of Mr Macleod being violent towards her. She spoke of the police having to attend the home twice on the night of Saturday 15 March 2014 but claimed that they declined to take any action because of her historic reticence in pressing charges.
	
	
	Ms Wells said that when her son and Mr Whelan arrived at the home, one of them asked, ""Did that cunt give you the black eye?"" She said that Mr Whelan ran in and she described him delivering forceful punches to Mr Macleod's head two or three times. She said Mr Macleod was striking back but ineffectively.
	
	
	Ms Wells told her son to tell his friend to stop. Mr Mitchison said to Mr Whelan, ""Stop, you'll kill him"". Mr Macleod fell to the ground, face down. She approached and felt for a pulse.
	
	
	Ms Wells insisted that no-one kicked Mr Macleod and she denied hitting him herself.
	
	
	She also described Mr Mallinson, the neighbour, coming and an altercation that involved him and Mr Whelan which resulted in Mr Mallinson's nose being ""busted"". Precisely when in the sequence of events was not made clear.
	


Ricky Whelan


	
	Mr Whelan was also interviewed on 26 March 2014. He described arriving at Ms Wells' home and finding her distraught and crying as she answered the door. She had black eyes. She said, ""I want him out of my house, I want him gone"".
	
	
	He and Mr Mitchison went inside to look for Mr Macleod; not to do anything to him. He said he saw him and grabbed him but Mr Macleod turned and swung a couple of punches. Mr Whelan retaliated and hit him once; ""that's all"". He said he did not know where he hit him but it was probably around the mouth/jaw area. Mr Macleod fell and ""I sort of caught him""; he ended up being between Mr Whelan's legs.
	
	
	Mr Whelan stepped back and Mr Macleod was then kicked once by Mr Mitchison and several times by Ms Wells, to the head. Mr Whelan said that he ""covered over the top of him"" and said, ""No, like, you can't do that"". Ms Wells was continually saying, ""I want him out of my house"".
	
	
	Mr Whelan was asked to describe the kicking and he said: ""I think they were sort of, lining him up a fair bit and were swinging their foot"". It was ""like it was just a couple of steps and a kick and then Caron was coming over and she kept on kicking him"".
	
	
	Mr Whelan said that he made Mr Mitchison get Mr Macleod a drink of water. Mr Macleod went to the toilet and then lay in bed.
	
	
	Mr Whelan went to the front door where he was grabbed around the throat by Mr Mallinson. There was a struggle and he ""probably hit him in the process"". However, this was because Mr Mallinson had grabbed him tightly around the throat; he could not breathe. He claimed that he was acting in self-defence, not only in this incident but also in the earlier incident with Mr Macleod.
	
	
	Mr Mitchison broke up the incident between Mr Whelan and Mr Mallinson. Mr Whelan then went back inside and ran out the back where he caught his breath. He then returned and spoke with Mr Mallinson and they apologised to each other.
	
	
	Mr Whelan returned inside with Mr Mitchison. He said Ms Wells was still kicking Mr Macleod; this was while Mr Macleod was lying in bed. They stopped her; Mr Mitchison pulled her away. She was yelling ""abuse and stuff"".
	


Brooke Palmer


	
	Brooke Palmer was in a relationship with Mr Whelan. They had been together for seven years and had two children. She said that on the morning of Sunday 16 March he told her of an incident that had occurred the night before. He gave her an account which is broadly consistent with what he told police in his interview: he touched Mr Macleod who then grabbed him by the throat so he responded with a punch. Mr Macleod was then on the ground and Mr Mitchison and his mother kicked him. Mr Whelan had to stop them. He went outside and later went back inside and saw Ms Wells ""laying into the guy again in the bedroom"".
	


Guy Mallinson


	
	Mr Mallinson made a statement to police on 21 March 2014. He said that when he went over to Ms Wells' home on 16 March he found the front door was open and he entered. He said that Mr Macleod was lying on his side on the ground in the hallway. A man (who must be Mr Whelan) was standing over him rubbing his back or checking that he was alright. Mr Mitchison was standing nearby and Ms Wells was in the kitchen. She said, ""Get out, mind your own business"" to Mr Mallinson.
	
	
	He bent down to see if Mr Macleod was alright and he copped a punch to the nose. One or two seconds later, Mr Whelan said, ""I have a good left hook, haven't I?""
	
	
	Mr Mallinson then went home because his nose was bleeding. When he returned outside he spoke to Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan. There were apologies. Mr Mitchison said, ""We had to drag Caron away because she kept kicking into him"".
	
	
	In a ""walk through"" style interview on 5 June 2014, Mr Mallinson added that when he bent down to check on Mr Macleod he touched Mr Whelan in order to move him out of the way.
	
	
	Mr Mallinson's version was put to both Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan in their police interviews. Both of them insisted that the incident concerning Mr Whelan and Mr Mallinson occurred outside, not inside.
	


Karen Morris


	
	Karen Morris, Mr Mallinson's partner, made a statement on 22 March and was interviewed on 5 June 2014. She said that she went over to the Wells/Macleod home shortly after he did. She said that Mr Mallinson was at the front door with Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan. Mr Mallinson had a bleeding nose. She entered and saw Mr Macleod on the floor. She said, ""I saw Caron kick Steve to his head with her right foot and leg. Steve did not move or make a sound. I knew he must have been out to it.""
	
	
	When she went outside she heard Mr Whelan apologise to Mr Mallinson and they shook hands. Mr Mallinson said, ""You blindsided me mate. I was just checking on Steve"". Mr Whelan said, 'I thought you were going at me mate"".
	


Lorraine Brown


	
	Ms Brown made a statement on 3 April 2014. She was a casual but long-term friend of Ms Wells. She had a conversation with Ms Wells on the night of 20 March 2014 in which they discussed Mr Macleod being in hospital. Ms Wells said that she understood that Mr Mallinson and Ms Morris were claiming that she had kicked Mr Macleod in the head and she added, ""I didn't kick him in the head mate"". She explained: ""Kris and his mate just landed. I hadn't seen Kris for seven months and they bashed him, yeah mate they smashed him until he shit himself, but I didn't kick him in the head. They're all saying I kicked him in the head but I didn't"".
	


Kathleen Cumming


	
	Kathleen Cumming made a statement on 26 March 2014. She was a friend of Ms Wells. They had a conversation on 25 March 2014 in which Ms Wells told her that “a young bloke” had come to her home and seen her black eye. She told him that Mr Macleod had caused it. She said, “Then the young bloke [assumed to be Whelan] walked in to my house and said to Steven, ‘did you hit Caron’? Then he lashed out and clocked Steven”.
	


Summary of the competing versions as to kicking the deceased


	
	I understand that it is the question of who did the kicking that is the principal issue as it is regarded as the probable cause of the fatal injury.
	
	
	Mr Mitchison says he kicked Mr Macleod once but he was wearing thongs and it was not hard. It was Ms Wells who kicked Mr Macleod in the head, ""like you'd kick a soccer ball"" a number of times a short time later. He said she was ""kicking the shit out of him"".
	
	
	In her police interview, Ms Wells blames Mr Whelan punching Mr Macleod heavily to the head. On her account, there was no kicking at all. She told Ms Brown five days after the incident that she did not kick Mr Macleod. However, she also told her that both her son and Mr Whelan had ""bashed him"".
	
	
	Mr Whelan admits to punching Mr Macleod once, but in self-defence. He blames Mr Mitchison and Ms Wells for kicking the deceased once he was on the ground: ""lining him up a fair bit and … swinging their foot""; ""a couple of steps and a kick"". He also says Ms Wells further kicked him later when he was lying in bed. An account by Mr Whelan to his partner the following morning was in consistent terms.
	
	
	Ms Morris also claimed to have seen Ms Wells kicking the deceased.
	
	
	Mr Mallinson did not see any kicking but claimed that Mr Mitchison said Ms Wells ""kept kicking into him"".
	


Summary of competing versions as to the altercation between Mr Mallinson and Mr Whelan


	
	Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan both say that this altercation occurred outside whilst Mr Mallinson says that it occurred inside.
	
	
	Mr Mitchison says that it occurred after Mr Macleod had gone to the floor in the hallway and when he and Mr Whelan had stepped outside. After the altercation occurred, he and Mr Whelan went back inside and Ms Wells was kicking the deceased.
	
	
	Mr Whelan's version seems to have himself leaving the house and having the altercation with Mr Mallinson with Mr Mitchison emerging a short time later to break it up.
	
	
	Ms Wells' account of this event is not entirely clear but it seems she saw something start inside the house and then saw Mr Whelan chasing Mr Mallinson outside.
	
	
	Ms Morris arrived after the altercation but saw Mr Mallinson standing at the front door with a bleeding nose.
	


Submissions in support of the separate trial application


	
	Mr Brady SC submitted that his client would be prejudiced by the jury hearing the evidence of Mr Whelan’s account to police of Mr Mitchison kicking the deceased and the evidence of Ms Palmer of Mr Whelan saying as much to her. Prejudice would also flow from the evidence of Ms Brown that Ms Wells had told her that both Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan had “bashed” the deceased. None of that evidence was admissible in the case against Mr Mitchison and it was described as being “significantly different” to the version the jury will hear that he gave in his police interview.
	
	
	Mr Brady submitted that the joint criminal enterprise case alleged by the Crown would be immeasurably strengthened in the eyes of the jury in relation to Mr Mitchison’s case if the jury were to hear the evidence which is inadmissible against him.
	
	
	Mr Brady helpfully set out in his written submissions the following propositions established in the case law that were, in the debate before me, uncontroversial:
	


“The Court has the power to order a separate trial if the Court is of the opinion that the matters, “ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice” (Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), ss 21 and 29).

The cases have established the following principles:

(a)   Where the Crown case is an allegation that the accused were parties to a joint enterprise the starting point is that the matter should be heard as a joint trial, which particularly applies if the co-accused place the blame on each other. (Webb & Hay (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 88-89 per Toohey J; Dominican & Thurgar (1989) 43 A Crim R 24 at 26)

(b)   The jury will act upon directions given to them by the Judge in relation to which evidence applies to an accused. (R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190 at [40]-[41])

(c)   There is a public interest in the avoidance of the risk of inconsistent verdicts. (Ross v R [2012] NSWCCA 207 at [24])

(d)   There is a public interest in avoiding the inconvenience to witnesses, ensuring finality is reached as expeditiously as possible in one trial. (Ross v R at [24])

(e)   The interests of justice are not limited to the interests of the accused.

(f)   The accused bears the onus of establishing the reasons for the making of an order granting a separate trial. (R v Bikic (2000) 112 A Crim R 300 at [21])

(g)   The applicant for a separate trial must demonstrate there is a real risk that a positive injustice would be caused to him as a consequence of the joint trial. (R v Patsalis & Spathis (No 1) (1999) 107 A Crim R 432 at [6]-[13])

(h)   A positive injustice can be demonstrated where the prejudicial and inadmissible material against an accused would be likely to turn a potential acquittal into a conviction. (R v Pham at [39] per Adams J (applied in Madubuko v R [2011] NSWCCA 135 at [32] per Hodgson JA))

(i)   Hunt J said in R v Midis (NSWSC, 27 March 1991, unreported) applied in R v Baartman (NSWCCA, Gleeson CJ, Power JA and Smart J, 6 October 1994, unreported) and Ross v R [2012] NSWCCA 207 at [25]:

(i)   where the evidence against the applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him (cf R v Pham per Adams J at [40]; Madubuko v R per Hodgson JA at [29]);

(ii)   where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and

(iii)   where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material, a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant, the applicant must show that a positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.

The term “immeasurably” has been held to mean “significant although not incommensurable” (R v Pham at [32]). There is also subsequent authority casting real doubt as to whether the proposition that the case against the applicant is significantly weaker than that against the co-accused is a relevant consideration (R v Pham per Adams J at [40]; Madubuko v R per Hodgson JA at [29]).

The crucial issue is the potential effect of the inadmissible evidence on the jury’s consideration of the applicant’s case (R v Pham at [40]).”


	
	Mr Brady submitted that despite any directions that might be given to the jury, they would be unable to put out of their minds Mr Whelan’s version when assessing whether Mr Mitchison was a participant in the alleged joint criminal enterprise. Further, it would not be possible for Mr Mitchison to challenge or test Mr Whelan’s version without running the risk of making it admissible in his case.
	
	
	The inability of the jury to put the inadmissible evidence out of their minds when considering the case against Mr Mitchison was likened to the prejudice considered in R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190. In that case there was evidence of a police interview of a co-accused that was inadmissible against the appellant but the Crown relied upon it as bolstering the credibility of two critical witnesses. It was held that it would be practically impossible for the jury to assess the credibility of those witnesses in the case against the co-accused with reference to the interview but to make a separate assessment of their credibility without reference to the interview in the case against the appellant.
	
	
	In oral submissions, Mr Brady submitted that this was not a “cut-throat” defence type of case where generally it is considered appropriate that the competing cases be heard by the one jury. Rather, he emphasised that it was the timing of events according to Mr Whelan’s version that caused irreparable prejudice to his client in that Mr Whelan has Mr Mitchison kicking the deceased at the same time as he says Ms Wells was kicking him. It would be difficult, if possible at all, for the jury to put that version aside, particularly given the otherwise similar version provided by Mr Mitchison.
	
	
	Mr Brady submitted that the version of events provided by Ms Wells to Ms Brown also could be regarded by the jury as strengthening the Crown’s assertion of Mr Mitchison being a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. That is evidence that could not be challenged or tested by Mr Mitchison.
	


Decision concerning the separate trial application


	
	There are obvious discrepancies between the various versions. It is possible that this is derived of self-preservation in one or more cases. It also seems likely that the effects of alcohol consumption have influenced one or more recollections.
	
	
	Ms Wells’ version is so different from the others that I cannot foresee the jury impermissibly taking it into account when assessing the cases of her co-accused.
	
	
	The versions of Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan are similar in that they include that Mr Mitchison kicked the deceased once; it is when and how that occurred that is the difference.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that enough has been shown to warrant separation of Mr Mitchison’s trial from that of his co-accused. Nothing is before me to suggest that the three versions will not represent the three cases that will be presented to the jury on behalf of each accused. This is not a case in which the inadmissible version of a co-accused will serve to impermissibly strengthen some other incriminating aspect of the Crown case: cf R v Pham.
	
	
	I have considered the matter with the assumption that none of the accused give evidence and that the only evidence of their respective versions will be that to which I have referred above. In those circumstances I anticipate it being possible to adequately direct the jury about the importance of separate consideration of the respective cases. Of course, if one or more accused do give evidence, then his, her or their versions will become evidence available for consideration in each case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there would be a possibility of inconsistent verdicts being given if the matter came to be considered by more than one jury. That is a very relevant consideration as well.
	
	
	The application by the accused Mitchison for a separate trial is refused.
	


Submissions in support of the objection to Mr Mallinson’s evidence


	
	Mr Cavanagh on behalf of the accused Whelan objected to the evidence of Mr Mallinson being assaulted by his client. It was submitted that it is not relevant to the Crown’s assertion that Mr Whelan murdered the deceased. It was irrelevant to the Crown’s contention that he was involved in a joint enterprise with one or both of the co-accused to inflict violence upon the deceased and irrelevant to whether Mr Whelan foresaw the possibility of grievous bodily harm being inflicted. Moreover, it was said to be unfairly prejudicial in that there would be an invitation to the jury to reason towards accepting those assertions by the Crown from the fact of Mr Whelan having assaulted Mr Mallinson. It would also necessitate Mr Whelan defending himself in respect of an uncharged allegation that he was guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	


Decision on admissibility of assault upon Mr Mallinson


	
	There is no dispute that Mr Whelan struck Mr Mallinson but there is a divergence in the evidence in terms of where and why it occurred. However, on Mr Mallinson’s version, it is inextricably tied to the narrative of what happened to the deceased. Aside from that, the Crown contends that the evidence is relevant to show that Mr Whelan was in an aggressive state of mind at the time, having entered the house with his friend, Ms Wells’ son, after seeing her with black eyes and in response to her statement that she wanted Mr Macleod out of her house.
	
	
	I have had regard to the principles discussed in cases such as O'Leary v The Queen [1946] HCA 44; 73 CLR 566 at 575-577, 582; Harriman v The Queen [1989] HCA 50; 167 CLR 590 at 627-635; Adam v R [1999] NSWCCA 189 at [25]; (1999) 106 A Crim R 510 at 515; R v Player [2000] NSWCCA 123; 217 ALR 578; and R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97; 145 A Crim R 304 at [119]-[138].
	
	
	In my view, the evidence is admissible both on the basis that it is in the category of transactional evidence and because it is relevant to the state of mind of the accused Whelan at the time of the alleged assault upon the deceased.
	
	
	It may be that Mr Cavanagh might wish me to direct the jury to avoid tendency reasoning. I am prepared to hear submissions at an appropriate time.

2769076,State of New South Wales v Bastian [2016] NSWSC 331,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By summons filed on 9 November 2015, the State of New South Wales (the plaintiff) seeks a five-year extended supervision order (ESO) in respect of Raymond Bastian (the defendant) pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act).
	
	
	On 9 December 2015, Fagan J made an interim supervision order (ISO) against the defendant pursuant to s 10A of the Act, which commenced on 28 December 2015. On 29 December 2015 the defendant was arrested and taken into custody for breaching his ISO. On 20 January 2016, following a plea of guilty, he was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment which will expire on 28 September 2016. Accordingly, the plaintiff seeks an ESO from that date.
	


The applicable law

The Act


	
	Section 3 of the Act provides:
	


“Objects of Act

(1)  The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high-risk sex offenders and high-risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.

(2)  Another object of this Act is to encourage high-risk sex offenders and high-risk violent offenders to undertake rehabilitation.”


	
	The legislative purpose of the Act is protective, not punitive. As appears from the terms of s 3, the protective purpose is fundamental.
	
	
	Section 5(1) of the Act relevantly defines “serious sex offence” as an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which is punishable by a sentence of seven years or more. Such offences include, relevantly, the following:
	



	
		
			
			Section of Crimes Act
			
			
			Offence
			
		
		
			
			66A
			
			
			Sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age.
			
		
		
			
			66B
			
			
			Attempting to have sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age.
			
		
		
			
			66C
			
			
			Sexual intercourse with a child between 10 to 16 years of age.
			
		
		
			
			66D
			
			
			Attempting to have sexual intercourse with a child between 10 to 16 years of age.
			
		
		
			
			66EB
			
			
			Procuring or grooming a child under 16 years for unlawful sexual activity.
			
		
		
			
			61O(2)
			
			
			Acts of indecency towards a person under 10 years of age.
			
		
		
			
			61O(2)
			
			
			Inciting a person under 10 years of age to commit acts of indecency on the person inciting or another person.
			
		
	



	
	Section 5B provides:
	


“High risk sex offender

(1)  An offender can be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2)  An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3)  The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence.”


	
	Section 5C confers power on this Court to make an ESO in respect of a high risk sex offender. Implicit in s 5C is that the supervision imposed by an ESO is sufficient to counter what would otherwise be an “unacceptable risk”. Supervision can only be regarded as “adequate” if it is effective to reduce the risk such that the offender no longer poses an unacceptable risk.
	
	
	Section 5H entitles the plaintiff to apply to this Court for an ESO. Section 5I(1) provides that an application for a high risk sex offender ESO may be made only in respect of a supervised sex offender. A person who is under supervision (under an ESO) is, relevantly, a supervised sex offender: s 5I(2).
	
	
	Section 7 provides for pre-trial procedures. Of present relevance, s 7(4) provides:
	


“(4) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must make orders:

(a) appointing:

(i) 2 qualified psychiatrists, or

(ii) 2 registered psychologists, or

(iii) 1 qualified psychiatrist and 1 registered psychologist, or

(iv) 2 qualified psychiatrists and 2 registered psychologists,

to conduct separate psychiatric or psychological examinations (as the case requires) of the offender and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations, and

(b) directing the offender to attend those examinations.”


	
	Section 9(3) provides that the following are to be taken into account in determining whether to make an ESO:
	


“(a)  the safety of the community,

(b)  the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7 (4) [court-appointed experts] to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination,

(c)  the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,

(d)  the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence,

. . .

(e)  any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,

(f)  the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,

. . .

(h)  the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

(h1)  the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,

(i)  any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order) or serious violence offences (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).


	
	Section 10 provides that an ESO can be made for a total of five years. Section 10A provides for an ISO to be made in certain circumstances. The decision whether to make an ISO is to be made by reference to the same considerations as apply to an ESO. Section 10A provides:
	


“Interim supervision order—high risk sex offender

The Supreme Court may make an order for the interim supervision of an offender if, in proceedings for an extended supervision order, it appears to the Court:

(a) that the offender’s current custody or supervision will expire before the proceedings are determined, and

(b) that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order.”


	
	Section 11 provides for the conditions that may be imposed on an ESO. A breach of ESO conditions is an offence under s 12 of the Act.
	
	
	Section 13 of the Act relevantly provides:
	


“Supervision order may be varied or revoked

(1) The Supreme Court may at any time vary or revoke an extended supervision order or interim supervision order on the application of the State or the offender.

. . .

(1B) Without limiting the grounds for revoking an extended supervision order or interim supervision order, the Supreme Court may revoke an extended supervision order or interim supervision order if satisfied that circumstances have changed sufficiently to render the order unnecessary.

(2) For the purpose of ascertaining whether to make such an application in relation to an extended supervision order, the Commissioner of Corrective Services must provide the Attorney General with a report on the offender at intervals of not more than 12 months.

(3) The report must indicate whether the Commissioner considers the continuation of the extended supervision order to be necessary and appropriate.”


	
	These proceedings are to be conducted as civil proceedings: s 21.
	


This Court’s jurisdiction


	
	On 29 June 2011, Hoeben J made an ESO in respect of the defendant for a period of three years and six months commencing on that date (First ESO). However, the First ESO was suspended for six months (from 16 August 2011 to 15 February 2012) during which the defendant served a sentence of imprisonment for a breach of the ESO (the First Breach). He was convicted of breaching the ESO again (the Second Breach) as a result of which he was imprisoned for another six months from 8 January 2013 to 7 July 2013, during which time the First ESO was suspended for a further period of six months. The result of these suspensions is that the First ESO expired four and a half years after it commenced, on 28 December 2015.
	
	
	Section 6(2) prohibits the making of an application for an ESO until the last six months of the offender’s current custody or supervision. As the summons was filed on 9 November 2015, and the First ESO was due to expire on 28 December 2015, it was filed within time.
	


Background facts


	
	Before addressing whether an order ought be made, I propose to set out a narrative derived from the evidence adduced by the plaintiff.
	


The plaintiff’s background, upbringing and employment


	
	The defendant was born in Broken Hill in 1946. He was a ward of the State and spent much of his childhood either in institutions or in foster care. He alleged that he was sexually assaulted between the ages of 10 and 18 by residents and staff of these institutions. When he was in his early twenties, he suffered a mental breakdown, as a result of which he was admitted to Bloomfield Psychiatric Hospital in Orange where he remained for several months.
	
	
	He worked in irregular casual jobs, including (on his own report) as a sex worker between the ages of 18 and 25. Since the late 1960’s he has been in receipt of Government benefits: first, the disability pension and, in more recent years, the aged pension. The defendant reported that he regularly consumed significant quantities of alcohol prior to his first term of imprisonment in 2003.
	


The November 1987 offence: act of indecency by person in authority


	
	As at November 1987 the defendant (then aged 41) lived with his step-brother, his step-brother’s wife and their two children. One of the children’s friends, a 10-year old boy, knew the defendant as “Uncle Ray”. The defendant took the boy to his home to help him move rocks. After becoming dirty, they showered. According to the boy’s statement, he watched the defendant having a shower and then had a shower himself. The defendant would not let the boy get dressed and instructed him to lie on the floor. The defendant lay beside the boy and sucked his penis and masturbated himself to the point of ejaculation.
	
	
	On 27 November 1987, as a result of this conduct, the defendant was charged with one count of homosexual intercourse with a male aged between 10 and 18 years; one count of sexual assault and one count of act of indecency by a person in authority. The defendant made full admissions when interviewed by police.
	
	
	He pleaded guilty to the charge of act of indecency by a person in authority and, on 9 March 1989, he was sentenced and placed on a three-year recognizance bond of $3,000 and ordered to place himself under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service.
	


The October 1996 offence: incite male under the age of 18 years to commit an act of homosexual intercourse with a male person


	
	On 25 October 1996 handwritten notes which contained sexually explicit material and which identified a twelve-year old boy (who was a ward of the State) were handed to the Moss Vale Police Station. One of the notes read:
	


“I love you and I think you have a sexy body. I would pay you $25 each pension day just to suck your cock off and your nice little arsehole. All you would have to do to me is fuck my arsehole.”


	
	When the victim, who was twelve years old, was interviewed by police he said that on one occasion between 1 January 1995 and 28 March 1996 when he was living on the streets, the defendant had offered to pay him for sex. Later, between 28 March 1996 and 12 November 1996, when the victim was in foster care, the defendant approached him outside a supermarket and offered him money for sex.
	
	
	On 12 November 1996 the defendant was arrested, interviewed and charged with two counts of incite act of gross indecency (contrary to s 78Q(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)). In a recorded interview on 12 November 1996, the defendant admitted the notes but denied that he had offered the victim money for sex. The defendant did, however, admit that he had offered to have the victim stay with him rather than sleeping in a clothes bin or out on the streets. Prior to the interview, the defendant admitted that he had spoken with the victim about having sex.
	
	
	In December 1996 the defendant was convicted of these offences and sentenced to a three-year recognizance on payment of $2,000 on condition that he accept the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service.
	


1997 complaint (which did not result in charges being laid)


	
	While the defendant was subject to the recognizance referred to above, a woman alleged that two of her children (a 6-year old boy and a 4-year old girl) were abused by the defendant and another male aged 15-16 years old (C4). Witness statements were taken but no charges were laid. According to the mother, she and her family had moved into a Housing Commission home next to where the defendant lived with C4. While the children’s grandfather was minding them, three of the children (the 4 and 6-year olds and another 7-year old boy) visited the defendant’s home where they alleged he showed them pornography. The 6-year old told his mother that C4 touched his penis and the defendant put his finger up his bottom. The 4-year old girl said that the defendant put a stick up her vagina. The 7-year old boy told police that he saw the defendant touch his siblings in the area of their crotches.
	


2001 complaint (which did not result in charges being laid)


	
	The defendant lived with a 4-year old boy for some months in 2001. The defendant reported sexualised conduct by the boy to the police, including that the boy called out “don’t touch my dick” while he was asleep. The following year the boy was interviewed by police and told them that the defendant had touched his penis and “bum” while the defendant was naked. Police determined that there was insufficient evidence to charge the defendant. The plaintiff submitted that the defendant’s report to police was, in substance, a ruse which was designed to discredit the boy in the eyes of the police in anticipation of his complaining about the defendant’s conduct.
	


November/ December 2002 offences: including four counts of aggravated sexual assault victim aged 10-14 years and two counts of incite person under 16 years to commit indecent act


	
	In November 2002 the defendant met two twelve-year old boys at a service station in Goulburn. He purchased pornographic material and invited the victims to view the magazines at his house. The defendant asked them to expose their penises to him, which they did (these acts became counts one and two on the indictment). He performed oral sex on both of them and persuaded them to perform penile anal penetration on him (counts three to six on the indictment). This conduct continued for some months (there were several offences on a Form 1). The victims said that they took part in these acts because the defendant promised to provide them with a mobile phone and money.
	
	
	In November or December 2002 the defendant befriended a woman who helped him when he fell over in front of her house. She described him as coming across “as a grandfather type figure” who was “very friendly towards me and the kids”. The defendant introduced the woman to a man whom he said was his brother. The woman and the defendant’s brother began a relationship. When the couple went out, the defendant would baby sit the woman’s children. In early 2003 two of the younger children told their mother that the defendant had sexually abused them. The defendant admitted that he had fellated the penis of the young boy, who was five.
	
	
	After the two children had revealed the abuse, handwritten notes containing sexually explicit material, including the names of the two 12-year old boys (referred to above), were found at the defendant’s home.
	
	
	On 11 April 2003 the defendant was charged with a series of offences arising from the conduct referred to above. He pleaded guilty to all six counts on the indictment and was convicted at the Goulburn District Court of four counts of aggravated sexual assault, victim aged 10-14 years; and two counts of incite person aged under 16 years to commit an act of indecency. The following additional 25 offences were included in a Form 1:
	



	
	22 counts of sexual intercourse with a person aged 10-14 years (which concerned the twelve-year old boys);
	
	
	2 counts of incite person aged under 16 years to commit an act of indecency (which concerned the twelve-year old boys); and
	
	
	one count of sexual intercourse with a person under 10 years (which concerned the five-year old boy).
	



	
	The defendant was sentenced in the District Court by Blackmore DCJ who imposed a total sentence of eight years, with a non-parole period of six years, to commence on 11 April 2003, structured as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Count
			
			
			Sentence
			
			
			Commencement
			
		
		
			
			1
			
			
			Fixed term of 12 months
			
			
			11 April 2003
			
		
		
			
			2
			
			
			Fixed term of 12 months
			
			
			11 April 2003
			
		
		
			
			3 (& Form 1)
			
			
			Seven years including non-parole period of five years
			
			
			11 April 2004
			
		
		
			
			4 & 6
			
			
			Four years with non-parole period of three years
			
			
			11 April 2003
			
		
		
			
			5
			
			
			Fixed term of four years
			
			
			11 April 2004
			
		
	



	
	The remarks on sentence included the following:
	


“The offences committed by the offender are abhorrent and deserving of a very condign sentence. . .

The most significant matter which determines where a particular offence is to be placed in the spectrum of offences of this kind is the degree to which the offender is seen to have exploited the youth of the victim. (See R v Sea (unreported) NSW CCA 13 August 1990.)

In this case the facts demonstrate predatory conduct on behalf of the offender. He lured the boys into taking part in this conduct. They were at an age when they were very vulnerable and it is likely that the offender’s behaviour will have serious repercussions with regard to their development. Moreover, on one occasion he introduced another adult into the sexual behaviour. This is a very serious aggravating factor in the offences.”

Neuropsychological testing in 2009


	
	A comprehensive neuropsychological test was undertaken by Mr Rodriguez on 20 May 2009. His findings were as follows:
	


“Applying the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (“WASI”), Mr Rodriguez found that Mr Bastian was at the Low-Average range for verbal ability and non-verbal ability. Applying the Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination (“ACER-R”), Mr Rodriguez found that Mr Bastian scored 91 out of 100 and that this indicated “no gross impairment” in the five cognitive domains of attention/orientation, memory, verbal fluency, language or visual-spatial abilities. Mr Rodriguez found that Mr Bastian fell in the non-impaired range (but at the very low end) in terms of his prefrontal function and that his recall of recent events was “relatively intact”.

The First ESO


	
	On 21 March 2011 Fullerton J made an ISO in respect of the defendant which commenced on 10 April 2011, the day he was released from custody, his sentence having expired (the First ISO). The defendant initially lived at Campbelltown Community Offender Support Program Centre (COSP) where he remained until he moved to NSW Housing accommodation.
	
	
	The First ISO was subject to conditions that included the following:
	


“3. The defendant must comply with any reasonable direction given by the Departmental Supervising Officer or any other departmental officer who may from time to time be involved in supervision of the defendant.

. . .

19. Without limiting the immediately preceding condition, the defendant must not associate with a particular person or persons if he is reasonably directed by the Departmental Supervising Officer to that effect.”


	
	The First ISO was subsequently reviewed and further ISOs were made by Johnson and Hidden JJ on relevantly the same conditions.
	


Offences committed during First ISO and First ESO

2011 offences: breaches of conditions 3 and 19


	
	On 20 April 2011 the Departmental Supervising Officer (DSO) gave the defendant a formal written direction (pursuant to condition 3 of the First ISO) that he was not to have any form of contact with any sex offender.
	
	
	On 4 May 2011 the defendant wrote to a sex offender at the Campbelltown COSP where the defendant himself was residing. The letter was discovered when it was marked return to sender.
	
	
	On 17 May 2011 the defendant wrote to another known sex offender at the Nunyara COSP at Malabar but this letter was not discovered until later.
	
	
	On 23 May 2011 the defendant’s DSO told him that he would be issued with a formal warning regarding the breach (relating to the letter of 4 May 2011). On 24 May 2011 two compliance officers visited the defendant at the Campbelltown COSP to discuss the direction he had been given on 20 April 2011. He was asked whether he had breached the direction on occasions other than with respect to the letter on 4 May 2011. He disclosed no other breach. The compliance officers reviewed the defendant’s phone which contained various texts to other sex offenders living within the community.
	
	
	On 25 May 2011, the DSO and a Senior Compliance and Monitoring Officer visited the defendant, who was given an opportunity to disclose any other contact he had made with sex offenders. He made no such disclosure, although he had sent the letter to another sex offender on 17 May 2011, as referred to above. The defendant admitted that he knew that he was breaching the First ISO at the time he breached it. His phone was reviewed; it contained numerous texts which he had sent to other sex offenders. The contents of his in-box had been deleted, with the result that their responses could not be reviewed.
	
	
	The letter which the defendant had sent on 17 May 2011 was received on 24 May 2011. Its existence came to the attention of the DSO, who identified it as another (undisclosed) breach of condition 3.
	
	
	From May 2011 the defendant has had weekly psychological counselling sessions with Forensic Psychology Services (FPS). The notes are in evidence. They are redolent with references which reveal the defendant’s sexual preoccupation with young boys and potential grooming of such boys.
	
	
	The First ESO commenced on 29 June 2011 (see above). It contained, relevantly, the same conditions set out above.
	
	
	Further breaches of a similar nature to those set out above (contact with sex offenders) were detected in August 2011, as a result of which the defendant was arrested on 16 August 2011 and charged with two counts of failing to comply with an ISO or ESO (by failing to comply with conditions 3 and 19). He pleaded guilty to the two charges, as a result of which he was convicted and sentenced by the Campbelltown Local Court to a term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing 16 August 2011 and expiring on 15 February 2012.
	


2013 offences: breach of conditions of ESO and possession of child pornography


	
	On Friday 18 January 2013 COSP employees inspected the defendant’s room and found two Secure Digital cards. They asked him whether there was any child pornography on the cards. He admitted that there was a single image of 5 naked persons, including three young boys. The defendant was cautioned and interviewed by police in the course of which he made admissions about possessing child pornography. He also made admissions about accessing websites that contain child pornography but told police that no evidence to that effect would be found.
	
	
	While the police were reviewing the image, the defendant received a further text message from a third person that clearly described a sexual act taking place between an adult male and a 13-year old boy. He was interviewed again. In the course of the interview he admitted that he was interested in the three naked boys aged 10 to 15 and the fact that if had had more time he intended to masturbate over the image. He said that he received the image from another resident at COSP as a birthday present and intended to delete the image once he could no longer be stimulated by it, so that he could avoid detection by COSP staff or police. The defendant admitted that he used internet sites to access similar images. The police facts recorded:
	


“The accused states that he would rather use these means of stimulation in his words to abuse himself rather than go out into the community and re-offend against other children. The accused when speaking to police referred to a skateboarding facility in close proximity to his residence.”


	
	As a result of these events, the defendant was again convicted of failing to comply with conditions 3 and 19 of his First ESO, as well as the offence of produce, disseminate or possess child abuse material contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for six months that commenced on 18 January 2013 (being the date on which he was taken into custody).
	


Subsequent events including 2016 offence: breaches of ESO


	
	On 4 November 2013 the defendant told FPS that he had had contact with school-aged children who catch the bus outside his Housing NSW accommodation. He met the father of the children in the course of cleaning up around the units. The father later introduced the defendant to his wife and children. The defendant began waving to the children whenever he saw them at the bus stop.
	
	
	On 25 June 2014 the defendant was found at home with a young male in his twenties, whom he said he had met in Campbelltown. Enquiries made of Community Corrections Officers revealed that the young male, Matthew Potter, had drug and alcohol problems; had been scheduled for schizophrenia; and had often been found by police sleeping in parks. The defendant has referred to Mr Potter at times as his “nephew”, “step-nephew”, and “step-grandson”.
	
	
	On 2 July 2014 the DSO directed the defendant orally not to associate with Mr Potter. On 5 July 2014 the DSO gave him a formal written direction to that effect. On 21 December 2014 the defendant was given a final written direction and warning not to associate with Mr Potter by any means.
	
	
	On 9 September 2014 the defendant told FPS, in connection with his sexual preoccupation, that he admitted to thinking (regarding sex with young boys): “if it was done to me, why can’t I do it to others?”
	
	
	The evidence is not precise about when Depo Provera was first administered to the defendant. However, a report of his general practitioner, Dr Samara-Sekera, dated 6 February 2015 recorded that an injection of Depo Provera was administered every three months. On 2 March 2015 the defendant reported that he experienced erectile dysfunction as a result of the injection and that he no longer had an interest in children.
	
	
	However, on 13 May 2015, his FPS maintenance notes recorded that the defendant admitted a continuing sexual interest in young boys, of any age, including “about 5”. He said that he would often see such a boy and “have a thought”. This history is to be contrasted with the supposed effect of the anti-libidinal drug in reducing sexual desire and suggests, according to Dr Furst, whose opinion is addressed in more detail below, an ongoing deviant sexual preoccupation which, if acted upon, would lead to the commission of the types of serious sex offences listed in the table set out above.
	
	
	On 27 July 2015 police went to the defendant’s home because of a domestic dispute between the defendant and Mr Potter which involved violence. No action was taken other than a verbal direction reiterating the prohibition on the defendant’s associating with Mr Potter. In July 2015 the defendant applied to Housing NSW to have Mr Potter added as an additional occupant of his premises. The request was declined.
	
	
	On 2 September 2015 the defendant told FPS that he was viewing pornography daily as a form of coping.
	
	
	In October 2015 the defendant was assessed by the Western Sydney Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT). On 29 October 2015 he was assessed as being eligible to receive residential respite care at a low level or the home care package level 1 and 2.
	
	
	Clare McNaughton became the defendant’s DSO on 20 December 2015. On 25 December 2015 Ms McNaughton conducted an unannounced visit to the defendant’s home (in premises managed by Housing NSW in Guilford). When the defendant answered the door, he suggested to Ms McNaughton that they sit outside as he had just sprayed “bug spray” inside. Ms McNaughton insisted on coming in. As soon as she entered she saw a young adult male sleeping on the defendant’s bed. The defendant identified the young man as his “nephew” and said his name was “Matthew”, but not “Matthew Potter”; the defendant confirmed that his name was Matthew Porter.
	
	
	Ms McNaughton woke up the young man (who appeared to be in his early twenties) who was wearing a plaster cast for a broken arm. According to the defendant, Mr Potter’s drowsiness was a result of his having taken medication the previous day. Ms McNaughton asked for his name, to which he answered “Matt”. When she asked for his full name, he answered, “Matt Potter”. The defendant became tearful and said that he would kill himself if he were not permitted to associate with Mr Potter. Ms McNaughton gave a further verbal direction that he was not to associate with Mr Potter.
	
	
	As referred to above, on 9 December 2015, Fagan J made an ISO against the defendant which commenced on 28 December 2015 (the Second ISO). It relevantly contained conditions equivalent to conditions 3 and 19 of the First ESO. Justice Fagan also ordered that Dr Furst and Dr Martin conduct psychiatric examinations of the defendant and report to the Court.
	
	
	On 29 December 2015 Detective Senior Constables Ware and Payne visited the defendant at home. When he answered the door, he told the officers that there was no one else at home. Detective Payne called out to Mr Potter and directed him to come out of the house. Mr Potter emerged from the residence. He told the officers that he had been living with the defendant off and on since August 2015. The defendant was arrested. His mobile telephone was seized and searched.
	
	
	Photographs were taken of text messages on his phone. Several of these text messages appear to be to or from a man called Daniel. I infer from their content, context and the references to FPS that Daniel is also a sex offender. The following texts indicate that the defendant has tried to enlist Daniel’s help to locate vulnerable people:
	


“Try to find someone is [sic] homeless and let him know what I said and you can give him my phone number”

“Try and fine [sic] someone it is going to be cold for the next 6 weeks ok if you fine [sic] one give him my phone number ok and get him to call ok”


	
	I accept the plaintiff’s submission that these text messages show that the defendant makes advances to others to induce them to come to him.
	
	
	Other texts found on the defendant’s phone contain sexually explicit messages. There were also 204 videos and 332 images found, all of which were pornographic. The males depicted are young. The plaintiff does not suggest that I could be satisfied that any one of them is younger than 18 years, although some may appear so. The messages and the pornographic material indicate a strong sexual preoccupation from which I infer that the Depo Provera is not having any substantial effect on reducing the defendant’s libido.
	
	
	On 6 January the defendant entered a plea to the offence of breaching his First ESO and the Second ISO. On 20 January 2016 the matter came before Brown LCM at the Local Court at Parramatta for sentence. Mr O’Brien (who appeared on behalf of the defendant) made the following submission, which I assume to have been made on instructions:
	


“Also he will inevitably have another extended supervision order put in place, probably for the rest of his life. Inevitably, it would appear, for the rest of his life given the findings of the previous judgments, given the determinations by Local Courts that he’s in breach of those orders and that he’s spent time in custody referable to those breaches. So he’s not someone who is going to be at large into the future. He is going to be supervised, he is going to be on orders for the entirety of his life.”


	
	At the conclusion of the hearing, the defendant was convicted of breaching the First ESO and sentenced to 9 months imprisonment from 29 December 2015 (the date on which he was taken into custody).
	


The defendant’s physical and mental health


	
	Dr Hill, geriatrician, examined the defendant for the purposes of these proceedings in February 2016. She noted that he has a number of co-morbidities which are generally progressive. She expected further deterioration in his mobility and progression of dementia. As his musculoligamentous structure is weak, he will increasingly become prone to falls. Although she noted that the Montreal cognitive assessment had shown a degree of cognitive impairment (22 out of 30, in circumstances where 24 or 25 would indicate some level of impairment), she said that the assessment was a screening test, not a diagnostic test.
	
	
	Dr Hill reported:
	


“Mr Bastian’s conditions would affect his ability to participate in sexual acts.

He would be less able to play a physically ‘active’ role, given his shortness of breath, weakness and fatigability.

His medical conditions, in themselves, would not likely affect his ability to play a physically ‘passive’ role.

…

Mr Bastian’s dependence on a wheeled walker or motorised scoot would likely reduce his ability to procure the commission of sexual acts. His freedom of movement and therefore, the opportunity to make contact with possible participants, would be impeded.”

The section 9(3) factors


	
	I shall address each of the matters in s 9(3) in turn, in so far as each is relevant. However, I propose to address safety of the community (s 9(3)(a)) in a compendious way at the end since many of the other factors also concern this matter.
	


Section 9(3)(b): reports received pursuant to s 7(4)

Relevant medical diagnoses and their relevance to risk


	
	Drs Furst and Martin, psychiatrists, assessed the defendant. Dr Martin diagnosed a paedophilic disorder and a personality disorder. Dr Furst considered that he met the diagnostic criteria for paedophilia, anxiety and depression and personality disorder with borderline and dependent traits. They both considered him to be at high risk of re-offending without significant intervention and supervision and that it was unlikely that the risk would change over time, notwithstanding his increased age, as his sexual deviance has been enduring. They did not consider that difficulties with mobility would significantly decrease the chances of his engaging in some form of paedophilic behaviour in the near future without supervision.
	
	
	Dr Furst noted that the defendant’s continued interest in young boys, including those aged 5, as recently as May 2015 was suggestive of ongoing deviance even when on treatment (he was on Depo Provera at the time).
	


Effects of anti-libidinal medication and its appropriateness in the present case


	
	They considered that, notwithstanding its considerable side-effects, anti-libidinal medication was appropriate and necessary for the defendant. Drs Furst and Martin opined that, if an ESO were to be made, it ought be made for the maximum duration of five years, having regard to the intransigence of the risk factors and the insufficient prospect of their being reduced in the foreseeable future. Dr Martin explained his view in oral evidence in the following terms:
	


“My understanding is that [five years] is the maximum that can be allowed under this legislation. I think any less time than that would be arbitrary in making those suggestions. I don't see the risks diminishing in the next five years, of course it is possible and no‑one can predict the future and he may become completely immobilised or physically ill in some other way, in which case it would make the conditions of the ESO redundant. But I don't think one can completely anticipate that, I think it is more likely than not that in five years’ time he will still remain relatively mobile.”

The defendant’s failure to take full responsibility for his offending conduct


	
	Both Dr Furst and Dr Martin noted that, although the defendant acknowledged his past offences (as would be expected since he pleaded guilty on most, if not all, occasions), he refused to take responsibility for them and blamed the government and the sexual abuse he had suffered as a child for his offences. Moreover, he understated the effect of his offending on his victims by relying on the circumstance that his abuse of the victims did not include penile penetration. This matter indicates his failure to appreciate, or accept, the consequences and gravity of his actions.
	
	
	When Drs Furst and Martin assessed the defendant, they were not aware of the most recent breach of his First ESO, which led to his present incarceration. Their opinions as to the risk did not change as a result of being informed of that matter since they both, as referred to above, considered him to present a high risk of re-offending without substantial external control.
	


Association with Mr Potter


	
	Both psychiatrists considered that contact with Mr Potter would be an additional destabilising factor for the defendant, particularly as the defendant has a history of drinking to excess.
	


The relevance of the defendant’s current medical condition and potential decrease in mobility


	
	Dr Furst noted the diagnosis of dementia made by Dr Hill and considered that it may have the effect of making the defendant disinhibited and prevent his obtaining any benefit from structured psychological counselling. Dr Martin accepted that any increase in his cognitive impairment may make it more difficult for him to complete schedules and that an insistence that he do so may give rise to oppositional behaviour, to which he has long been prone.
	
	
	The psychiatrists were provided with the report of Dr Hill which addressed the defendant’s current physical and mental condition and the various co-morbidities to which he is subject. Dr Martin considered that, having regard to the defendant’s usual mode of obtaining access to children for the purposes of sexual abuse, which was to offer boys inducements, reduced mobility would not materially reduce the risk of his re-offending.
	
	
	The opinions of Drs Furst and Martin are consistent with the opinions of Drs Samuel and Ellis who were appointed by Fullerton J pursuant to s 7(4) of the Act to report to the Court. Their reports were evidence in the proceedings before Hoeben J which led to the making of the First ESO.
	


The condition regarding pornography: outright prohibition or permission at discretion of DSO


	
	The principal area of disagreement between Dr Furst and Dr Martin was as to the appropriate condition relating to pornography: whether it ought be permitted with the approval of the defendant’s DSO, or whether it ought (as the plaintiff submitted) be prohibited entirely.
	
	
	Dr Furst considered that a condition permitting pornography only with the approval of the defendant’s DSO would be appropriate. He said that there was no particularly hard evidence either way that viewing adult gay pornography would either increase or decrease the risk of offending. Dr Furst accepted that the defendant had a sexual preoccupation. In answer to the proposition that viewing adult gay male pornography would tend to increase his sexual preoccupation, Dr Furst said:
	


“There's a risk that it would increase his sexual arousal and the medication that he is receiving, the Depo‑Provera injections, those injections are designed to decrease his sexual arousal and testosterone levels. I guess that you can make an argument that the viewing of pornography, such as this, goes against the clinical goals, treatment; but there is also an argument that viewing the pornography provides some kind of outlet or relief for people. It is really a bit mixed in terms of the impact that it might have on somebody.”


	
	It emerged from further questioning that Dr Furst’s reluctance to support an outright prohibition on adult pornography was its legality. He said:
	


“I am a little bit reluctant to recommend restrictions on material that's legal or sexual contact with adult males which is legal as well, to take the argument further. But the discretion for the officer ‑ I thought more as a clinical need the discretion might allow a therapeutic connection and working relationship between himself and the officer supervising him as there were, for example, a few movies that he is allowed access to that seemed appropriate.”


	
	As to the risk that access to such material would tend to increase the defendant’s arousal, Dr Furst said:
	


“I think it stands to reason viewing material like that would tend to increase someone's level of arousal or sexual arousal and in someone who has a sexual deviance that can be of concern. But I'd see it more as a possible increase of risk rather than the likelihood that his risk would then increase to a significantly higher level.”


	
	Dr Martin explained his preference for an outright prohibition in the following terms in his oral evidence:
	


“It is obviously a highly contentious issue and I don't think there is strong evidence one way or the other around whether watching pornography definitely increases the risk. But I do think it sends a mixed message to Mr Bastian. So I referred in my report to him problems with boundaries and I think he has a personality disorder. I think it is inconsistent with the general risk management process of reducing his sex drive and using medication to ‑ he is taking medication to reduce his libido. And I think to be allowed to watch pornography of any type is probably inconsistent with that. I think it can be regarded as ""a slippery slope"". So to be allowed to use one type of pornography can potentially lead to another type especially in a person who is highly sexually preoccupied. There is a compulsive element to his sexual behaviour and I do think it is ‑ I think it probably does ‑ probably would lead to increased sex drive, watching pornography in that sense and that is going to be directly related to his risk of re‑offending.”


	
	For the reasons given below, I prefer Dr Martin’s view.
	


Section 9(3)(c) and (d): assessments prepared by other psychiatrists or psychologists and statistical likelihood of re-offending

The risk assessment report of Dr Payne and Ms Matsuo dated 17 July 2015


	
	Dr Calinda Payne, senior psychologist, and Danielle Matsuo, from Corrective Services NSW, prepared a Risk Assessment Report dated 17 July 2015 (which was relied on by the plaintiff in its application for the Second ISO). Dr Payne also prepared a supplementary report and an affidavit which was read in these proceedings. Dr Payne considered the defendant to pose a high risk of sexual re-offending relative to other male sex offenders, the amelioration of which required external supervision. She explained her conclusions in her report that she did not consider that either the defendant’s age or his compromised mobility ameliorated his risk of re-offending to any significant extent. Dr Payne described the defendant’s ability to self-regulate as “very limited”.
	
	
	The STABLE-2007 is an assessment tool which assesses dynamic risk factors relating to intimacy deficits, social influences, general self-regulation, sexual self-regulation and co-operation with supervision in order to identify the prospect of a particular individual re-offending. The defendant scored 18 out of a possible 26 points on the STABLE-2007 which is considered to be a high level of stable dynamic needs.
	
	
	The defendant was assessed by reference to Static 99R (being a tool which assesses static risk by reference to a number of static factors). He scored 4 which placed him in the moderate to high risk category. I note that Dr Furst scored the defendant at 8 by reference to Static 99 (a slightly different tool). I do not regard these risk assessments as particularly probative compared with the actual evidence of the defendant’s conduct over the last decades.
	


The risk assessment report prepared by Mr Patrick Sheehan on 21 January 2011


	
	The report of Mr Sheehan dated 21 January 2011 was relied on by the plaintiff when it applied for the First ISO pending its application for the First ESO. His observations and conclusions are substantially similar to those made by Dr Payne and Ms Matsuo.
	


Section 9(3)(d1): any report from Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the defendant can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community


	
	The plaintiff relied on risk management reports from John Devoy, the Unit Leader of the ESO Team, as well as a report from Claudia Dabbagh, the previous Unit Leader. Mr Devoy outlined the risks to be monitored (based on Dr Payne’s risk assessment report referred to above) and what was done by the ESO Team to manage those risks, including weekly interviews, monitoring and unannounced visits.
	
	
	Mr Devoy deposed that the defendant has largely complied with electronic monitoring and the submission of schedules of movements, save that he tends to leave home 15 to 20 minutes earlier than scheduled, which had led to increased scrutiny.
	
	
	Mr Devoy’s opinion is that electronic monitoring of the defendant is still warranted because of his “limited strategies for managing his risk of re-offending against children”. It also allows the DSO to monitor his movements with a view to reducing the risk of his re-offending.
	


Section 9(3)(e): treatment or rehabilitation programs undertaken and the defendant’s willingness to participate in such programs


	
	The defendant has participated in several rehabilitation programs, including while in custody. Mr Sheehan said in his report dated 21 January 2011:
	


“The difficulty for Mr Bastion to make pervasive behavioural change should not be underestimated. He is 65 years of age and has survived by using a particular range of well-rehearsed problematic behaviours for many years, many of which are now a function of his personality. To extinguish these routines and introduce a new range of behaviours at this stage in life will be an arduous process.”


	
	I do not consider it to be reasonable to expect the defendant to engage in any such programs in the future since his poor insight and long-standing sexual deviance appear to be impervious to change. The defendant’s deviant sexual preoccupation, poor insight and limited ability to control himself mean that external supervision is required to ameliorate the unacceptable risk he poses to vulnerable young men and boys.
	


Section 9(3)(f): the level of the defendant’s compliance with obligations on parole while subject to an earlier ESO


	
	The defendant was twice convicted of breaching the First ESO and served two six month sentences as a result of those convictions. There have been several further breaches referred to in the narrative above which have not resulted in his being charged. The defendant has shown himself to be prepared to evade, mislead and lie to his DSO. His continued association with Mr Potter provides an example of these features of his conduct and his preparedness to flout the directions given to him, compliance with which is a condition of the Second ISO. He can neither be believed nor trusted.
	
	
	I note the submission of Mr Averre, who appeared on behalf of the defendant, that the defendant’s offending and admitted conduct since his release from custody is of a kind different from that for which he was previously incarcerated. Whereas in the past he committed serious sex offences, of more recent times he has breached the directions of his First ESO and Second ISO by associating with persons with whom he has been directed not to associate and has been found to be in possession of a pornographic image which, though an offence of a sexual nature, is not a serious sex offence. However, I consider that this pattern tends to support the proposition that, when subject to supervision under an ESO or ISO the otherwise unacceptable risk posed to the safety of the community by the defendant can be ameliorated. It does not, however, suggest that the risk would be other than unacceptable were he not subject to an ISO or ESO.
	


Section 9(3)(h): the defendant’s criminal history


	
	The defendant’s criminal history has been set out in detail in the chronological narrative above. It shows that when unsupervised (and even when on conditional liberty) the defendant takes the opportunity to commit serious sex offences by reason of his underlying sexual preference. The length of his criminal history is such as to dispel any hope of rehabilitation or improvement by reason of treatment, rehabilitation or specific deterrence.
	


Section 9(3)(h1): the remarks of the sentencing judge


	
	The remarks of Blackmore DCJ are set out above. I note his Honour’s concern about the objective seriousness of the defendant’s conduct, which he described as “predatory”. His Honour also referred to the vulnerability of the victims and the defendant’s preparedness to introduce another adult into the sexual behaviour. This latter matter is of significance when one has regard to the defendant’s tendency to form a relationship of some kind with a vulnerable male person, who might be prepared (because of the person’s dependence on the defendant) to assist the defendant to recruit victims of the age preferred by the defendant.
	


Section 9(3)(i): any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will commit offences of a sexual nature


	
	The narrative referred to above includes reference to allegations that were made to police about his conduct with children which did not result in the defendant’s being charged. The witness statements in support of those allegations can be taken into account under s 9(3)(i) of the Act. However, they do not significantly add to the criminal history, which contains numerous serious sex offences over a lengthy period.
	


Section 9(3)(a): the safety of the community


	
	In the present case, the relevant section of the wider community whose safety is compromised by the risk posed by the defendant is the section which comprises young males, including those as young as five. While male children in that group might generally be regarded as vulnerable because of their age, the defendant appears to target particularly those boys who are homeless or otherwise disadvantaged by reason of their lack of supports and poor socioeconomic situations. Such persons may be easy prey to someone such as the defendant who is in a position to offer accommodation (in his Housing NSW residence) or inducements, in the form of cash or items of property. Although the defendant himself is not in a particularly good financial position and is, and has long been, dependent on social security benefits, the victims he targets are, themselves, in such dire straits that the defendant’s resources may provide an inducement.
	
	
	The defendant has also shown a capacity to work with other sex offenders for a common purpose by texting them about potential assignations and victims.
	
	
	The defendant has an entrenched sexual deviance which inclines him to sexual contact with such males. He has neither inclination nor capacity to control his sexual urges, which remain strong and persistent notwithstanding his age and the anti-libidinal medication which he has been taking for more than a year. He has shown a capacity for deviousness when trying to conceal breaches of conditions from his DSO (such as making excuses for not allowing his DSO or police into the house when he knew that Matthew Potter was within). Although he has some difficulty with mobility such that he requires a mobile scooter on some occasions, his techniques for luring potential victims do not depend on good mobility.
	
	
	He has been consistently assessed as presenting a high risk of re-offending. Although not all offences in respect of which he presents a risk are “serious sex offences”, almost all are. His preference for young males means, effectively, that any physical contact with them of a sexual nature is prohibited by Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act and is punishable by 7 or more years’ imprisonment. The only relevant offence committed by him that was an offence of a sexual nature, rather than a serious sex offence, was the offence contrary to s 91K of possession of the pornographic image.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having considered the factors in s 9(3) of the Act addressed above, in the context of the narrative of facts, I am satisfied that the defendant, being a sex offender, poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the defendant is a high risk sex offender within the meaning of s 5B of the Act. I note that, although the extent to which a defendant’s liberty is constrained by proposed conditions is a relevant consideration in formulating such conditions (addressed below), it is irrelevant to the determination of whether he poses an unacceptable risk: Lynn v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 57 at [44], [55]-[58] (per Beazley P), [128] (per Basten JA) and [148] (per Gleeson JA).
	
	
	I am persuaded that it is appropriate, and necessary, to protect the safety of the community, to order a further ESO pursuant to s 9(1)(a) of the Act to commence when the current term of imprisonment for the defendant’s most recent offending expires.
	


The term of the ESO


	
	Mr Averre contended that it was not necessary for an ESO in respect of the defendant to be for the maximum period of five years pursuant to s 10(1A). He submitted that the objects of the Act could be met with a supervision order of two to three years with a view to determining whether the defendant continues to pose an unacceptable risk at the conclusion of that period. I reject this submission. The only matter which may ameliorate the risk is physical incapacity of a very high order. Although there is a prospect that this will occur, the prospect is presently no more than speculative. By reason of the defendant’s technique and preferences he does not require much, or indeed any, mobility to pose an unacceptable risk. To make the order for a shorter time than the maximum would be likely to result in the plaintiff’s having to go through the same process as it has undertaken in the present case, in circumstances where there is no reason to suppose that there will be any significant amelioration of risk in the next five years.
	
	
	I note the terms of s 13 of the Act, which make provision for an application for variation or revocation where there is a sufficient change in circumstances. An application under s 13 could be made if the defendant became so substantially incapacitated (by age, dementia, accident or other cause) that the risk he poses was materially reduced such that it was no longer an unacceptable risk.
	


Conditions


	
	As referred to above, the defendant has been subject to the First ISO, the First ESO and the Second ISO. Mr Averre did not object to any conditions which have been in place already. However, the plaintiff has reviewed its conditions and added or modified conditions, to which the defendant takes exception.
	
	
	Some of the defendant’s objections are substantive, such as the objection to electronic monitoring, scheduling and the prohibition on pornography, while others are more formal and can be dealt with more briefly. I propose to set out my decision on the conditions to which the defendant objects in the following table and provide further reasons below where I consider this to be necessary to explain my rulings.

	In summary the ESO which I propose to make is not subject to conditions 4, 16, 46 of the amended summons. It is subject to the other conditions save that condition 47 is amended to read:
	


“If the defendant does not have administered Depo Provera as prescribed, he is to notify his DSO within 24 hours of the due date for its administration.”

Electronic monitoring and the requirement to submit schedules


	
	I accept the plaintiff’s submission (based on Mr Devoy’s evidence) that advance scheduling of movements would tend to curtail the defendant’s capacity to take advantage of opportunistic assignations arranged instantaneously by text message and provide some safeguard against his acting impulsively to act out his sexual deviance. Although there is some force in the proposition that increased cognitive impairment would tend to compromise the defendant’s capacity to comply with the scheduling condition, he is presently able to comply with the condition. Moreover there is no firm evidence that such deterioration as is inevitable will affect his capacity to do so within the next five years. Accordingly, I am persuaded that conditions with respect to electronic monitoring and scheduling of movements are warranted.
	


Access to pornography: condition 39


	
	As referred to above, I accept that a ban on pornography is necessary and appropriate, on the basis of Dr Martin’s opinion. I am also influenced by the difficulties of enforcement that a qualified condition such as that proposed by the defendant (and, in the alternative, by the plaintiff) could pose for his DSO. If the condition were qualified as proposed, the DSO would have to view or audit any pornography to assess whether it was illegal or not. As Dr Martin said, it would tend to be a “slippery slope” and send a “mixed message” to the defendant. I do not accept that, in his case, pornography would reduce his deviant sexual desire; rather, having regard to his history, it will probably have a tendency to increase arousal and feed his sexual preoccupation.
	


Orders


	
	For the reasons set out above, I make the following orders:
	



	
	An order pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (High Risk) Offenders Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act) that the defendant be subject to an extended supervision order for a period of five years from 28 September 2016, or such later date as the defendant’s current custody expires.
	
	
	Direct the defendant, pursuant to s 11 of the Act, to comply with the conditions set out in the schedule to these reasons.
	
	
	An order permitting the reports of Dr Martin and Dr Furst provided to this Court pursuant to s 7(4) of the Act to be provided to Corrective Services New South Wales, any agency involved in the defendant’s supervision, care or assessment, and the defendant’s treating clinicians or health care providers.

		30 March 2016",2016-03-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769078,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 39) [2016] NSWSC 358,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	The Crown seeks to lead evidence of two conversations between the accused Rogerson and his wife which were recorded at a time when Rogerson was in custody.
	
	
	Objection has been taken by Mr Thomas, who appears for Rogerson, to parts of those conversations. Ms Shead, who appears for McNamara, has not sought to be heard.
	


THE FIRST CONVERSATION


	
	The first conversation took place on 24 June 2014. Mr Thomas has raised two objections. The first is to the passage at page 39 of the transcript and is as follows (where V2 designates Rogerson's wife and V1 designates Rogerson):
	


“V2: But he did say to me--

V1: --about me, okay.

V2: --he did say to me, like it will be, you know, could be 18 months or two years before this goes to court.

V1: Mmm-mmm, well if I'm on bail I don't care.

V2: Yeah, yeah.

V1: Because--

V2: Yeah.

V1: You can do things and, you know.

V2: Mmm-mmm.

V1: --things change.

V2: Yeah, I know, I know, I know.”


	
	The second is to the passage at page 41 as follows:
	


“V1: Did you read the stuff the best you could?

V2: I got halfway through and then I felt sick and I didn't read it.

V1: No, no, no, I know, yeah I know...

V2: Mmm-mmm.

V1: But I mean it's, it's, that's exactly what happened.

V2: Mmm-mmm.”


	
	The Crown submitted that the first passage was relevant and admissible. The Crown pointed, in particular, to the statement attributed to Rogerson ""You can do things and, you know"" and submitted that this was capable of being construed as a reference to what Rogerson may do if released on bail (a pending bail application being part of the subject of discussion).
	
	
	Mr Thomas submitted that this part of the conversation was irrelevant, and that if I concluded that it was relevant I should nevertheless exclude it on the basis that such probative value as it might have was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. He also submitted that any probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence could be misleading or confusing. In advancing those submissions Mr Thomas relied upon the provisions of ss. 137 and 135 respectively of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”).
	
	
	In my view, even if it is accepted that the first passage is relevant, its terms are so nebulous as to render it of little probative value. Moreover, the reference to ""you can do things and you know"" to which the Crown specifically pointed is capable of a myriad of interpretations and explanations, some of which could be highly prejudicial.
	
	
	For those reasons, such probative value that the first passage might have is outweighed, and in my view outweighed considerably, by the danger of unfair prejudice to Rogerson. It will therefore be excluded.
	
	
	As to the second passage, the position is somewhat different. Although what is meant by reference to reading ""the stuff"" is not entirely clear, it may be capable of being construed as a reference to the brief of evidence. Mr Thomas submitted that there were alternative inferences available. However, as I pointed out in the course of argument, the mere fact that competing inferences may be drawn does not render the evidence inadmissible.
	
	
	In my view, given the context in which the conversation was taking place, the passage is both relevant and probative. Its probative value is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice in terms of s. 137, nor is it substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be misleading or confusing. Accordingly, I propose to allow it.
	


THE SECOND CONVERSATION


	
	The second conversation gives rise to more complicated issues. Mr Thomas urged that in determining the admissibility of that part of it to which objection is taken I have regard to two other calls which preceded it. Mr Thomas submitted that those two calls placed the call in question in its proper context.
	
	
	Transcripts of the two additional calls are not before the Court. There is, however, a précis of each.
	
	
	On 7 August 2014 at 10:23 am Rogerson called his wife. They discussed, amongst other things, a forthcoming bail application and the evidence that might be put to the court in support of that application. They also referred to some previous proceedings in which Rogerson apparently pleaded guilty and which are unrelated to the present trial.
	
	
	At 12:49 pm on the same day Rogerson again called his wife. In the course of the ensuing conversation Rogerson referred to a recent conference with counsel which he described as ""terrific"", and discussed the procedure which would be adopted for the purposes of the bail application which was to be made on the following day.
	
	
	At 1:10pm Rogerson called his wife again. The following passage from that conversation (at pg 158 of the transcript) is that to which objection is now taken (V2 designating Rogerson and V1 his wife):
	


“V2: I mean, this bloke in Hong Kong, he had, had, had, he had the address--

V1: Mmm-mmm.

V2: Davies Road and he had Arab Road. This is the bloke in Hong Kong.

V1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

V2: The, the, the, the main bloke and---

V1: Mmm-mmm.

V2: ---then the two guys in the car with him.

V1: Mmm-mmm.

V2: They're, they're actually from Hong Kong and they are 14-Ks and they, and they say---

V1: Mmm-mmm.

V2: It's their gear and he'll---

V1: Mmm-mmm.

V2: ---be back in half an hour, I mean---

V1: Mmm-mmm.

V2: ---that is what he said to me, he said he told them he'd be back in half an hour.

V1: Mmm-mmm.

V2: As I said to this bloke, I said, 'Well, go and get---

V1: Mmm-mmm.

V2: ---those notes', I said, 'I'll read those notes up'. I said, he said, 'We can prove when they were made'. I said, 'Well, couple of months back'.

V1: Mmm-mmm.

V2: I said, and I said, 'You know, this is, you gave me this brief, I said on Sunday, it was booked-in.

V1: Mmm-mmm.

V2: Haven't seen it since before.

V1: Mmm-mmm.

V2: You know how, can't say it's recent invention.

V1: That's right, that's right.”


	
	The Crown submitted that this passage was clearly relevant, and that its probative value was high. It was submitted that the passage was capable of sustaining an inference that Rogerson was talking about the events (or at least part of the events) which had occurred at Padstow on 20 May 2014 before the deceased was killed. The Crown relied, in particular, on Rogerson’s reference to ""two guys in the car with him"". I note that there is evidence in the trial that the deceased arrived at Padstow on 20 May 2014 and met with the accused McNamara, in circumstances where two persons identified as “Asian males” were with him, and remained in the area.
	
	
	The Crown also placed particular reliance on Rogerson’s words “that is what he said to me, he said he told them he’d be back in half an hour”. The Crown submitted that the reference to “he” was a reference to the deceased and that his reference to “them” was a reference to the two Asian males. The Crown submitted that it was open to infer that the deceased had said, in Rogerson's presence, that he had told the other two persons that he would be back in half an hour. The Crown submitted that when read as a whole, that part of the conversation was capable of inferring that the deceased was alive, and in Rogerson’s presence, in the storage unit on the afternoon of 20 May 2014.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the Crown submitted that the evidence was relevant, that it had high probative value and that, in all of the circumstances, such probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	In objecting to the evidence, Mr Thomas advanced a number of submissions.
	
	
	Firstly, he submitted that the evidence did not meet the test of relevance set out in s. 55 of the Act because it was not capable of affecting, directly or indirectly, the assessment of any fact in issue in this trial.
	
	
	Secondly, in the event that I found that the evidence was relevant, Mr Thomas submitted that I should excluded it on the basis that it was subject to litigation privilege and thus caught by s. 119 of the Act.
	
	
	Thirdly, Mr Thomas submitted that the evidence should be excluded under s. 135 and/or 137 of the Act, on the basis that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be misleading or confusing, or that it was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	In support of these submissions Mr Thomas argued that the context in which the conversation had occurred was important. He pointed out that it had been preceded by two other conversations only a short time before in which Rogerson and his wife had obviously been discussing the bail application which was to be made before the Local Court on the following day. Mr Thomas submitted that when viewed in that context the proper interpretation was that Rogerson was simply making reference to matters relating to that bail application. In this regard, he pointed in particular to the reference made to “notes"". Mr Thomas also submitted, as I understood it, that Rogerson’s references to “he” were in fact references to himself (i.e. to Mr Thomas).
	
	
	Mr Thomas argued that admitting the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial to Rogerson. He also submitted that its probative value would be outweighed by the danger of it being misleading or confusing. He variously described the terms of the conversation as “ambiguous”, “speculative” and “misleading”.
	
	
	The first issue is whether or not the evidence is relevant. Relevance is to be determined according to the test laid down in s. 55 of the Act. In my view, the evidence is highly relevant. It is clearly capable of rationally affecting, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of a fact or facts in issue in this trial. Those facts in issue include the very fact of what happened in the period leading up to, and the time of, Rogerson’s attendance at the storage unit at Padstow on 20 May 2014. The reference to ""two guys in the car with him"", along with his reference to being told that “he’d be back in half an hour”, are clearly capable of being construed as a reference to the events of 20 May.
	
	
	In the event that I concluded that the evidence was relevant Mr Thomas firstly relied upon s. 119 of the Act for its exclusion. In R v Rogerson and R v McNamara (No 31) (2016) NSWSC 195, I had cause to consider, in some detail, the provisions of that section. I do not propose to set out, for the purposes of this judgment, the conclusions that I reached on that occasion. It is sufficient for present purposes to observe that even if I was satisfied that the conversation constituted a “confidential communication” as defined in s. 117, I am not satisfied, given the terms of what was discussed, that it was a communication made for the dominant purpose of Rogerson being provided with professional legal services relating to an Australian or overseas proceeding.
	
	
	In judgment No. 31 (at [30]) I made reference to a number of authorities in which the meaning of the word ""dominant"" in the context which it is used in s. 119 had been considered. I observed (at [31]) that when used in that context the word ""dominant"" was indicative of that which was the ruling, prevailing or most influential purpose of the communication. In my view it could not be said that the dominant purpose of this conversation fell within such ambit. On an objective assessment of what was said, Rogerson was discussing aspects of the case against him. There was nothing at all in the conversation, even when allowance is made for the context in which it occurred, to permit me to conclude that its dominant purpose was to allow Rogerson to obtain professional legal services in relation to the proceedings which had been brought against him.
	
	
	It follows that, in my view, evidence of the conversation should not be excluded under s. 119 of the Act.
	
	
	In terms of exclusion of the evidence under s. 135 or 137 of the Act, the Crown will submit that this conversation is capable of supporting a conclusion that Rogerson was present with the deceased, at a time when the deceased was alive, on 20 May. The Crown went so far as to say that the evidence could support a conclusion that Rogerson was within the storage unit with the deceased on 20 May when the deceased was still alive. Reaching those conclusions requires that certain inferences be drawn from the terms of what Rogerson said. Mr Thomas, as I have outlined, argued that the appropriate inferences to be drawn from the conversation were not as the Crown would have them.
	
	
	Even if the conversation is capable of sustaining more than one inference that does not lead to the conclusion that it should be excluded, be it on the basis that its probative value is outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial, or misleading or confusing (s. 135). It has been observed (albeit in a different context) that the fact that evidence may sustain competing inferences highlights the fact that ultimately, the question of what inference should be drawn is a matter for the jury: Saffron v The Director of Public Prosecutions; Allen v The Director of Public Prosecutions (1989) 16 NSWLR 397.
	
	
	There are parts of the conversation which, in my view, are clearly capable of being construed as being directly referable to the events of 20 May. That renders the evidence of significant probative value. I am not satisfied that such probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice (s. 137 of the Act). Clearly any evidence led by a Crown against an accused is prejudicial. However the section is directed to evidence which is unfairly so. The fact that evidence which is adduced by the Crown makes it more likely that the accused will be convicted does not mean that the evidence is unfairly prejudicial: Papakosmas v R (1999) 196 CLR 297; [1999] HCA 37 at [91] per McHugh J. It follows that there is no basis for the exclusion of the evidence under s. 137.
	
	
	Nor in my view is there any basis for the exclusion of the evidence under s. 135 of the Act. Its probative value is high and is not outweighed, substantially or otherwise, by the danger of unfair prejudice or by the danger of it being misleading or confusing. In my view, there is nothing misleading or confusing about the evidence at all.
	
	
	Accordingly, and for those reasons, I propose to admit the evidence. Whether the Crown wishes to consider, and discuss with Mr Thomas, the inclusion of other parts of the conversation which were not originally relied upon is a matter I will leave to the parties.

2769079,Hansen v Secretary of the Department of Transport – as head of the Transport Service and exercising the employer function of staff of Roads and Maritime Services [2016] NSWIRComm 1011,"DECISION


	
	The applicant, Paul Anthony Hansen, has made an application for relief in relation to unfair dismissal pursuant to section 84 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (‘the Act’) following the termination of his employment by Mr Gregory Evans, Director Asset Maintenance, at Roads and Maritime Services (‘RMS’) on 2 October 2015.
	
	
	The respondent, RMS, is constituted as a corporation by section 46 of the Transport Administration Act 1988 (‘the TA Act’). RMS is a NSW Government agency. Section 68C of the TA Act provides that the Government may employ persons in the Transport Service to enable RMS, and other transport entities, to exercise their functions. The applicant was such an employee. As such, the provisions of the Transport Administration (Staff) Regulation 2012 (‘the TAS Regulation’) applied to the employment of the applicant.
	


Background to the dismissal


	
	The applicant was initially employed by the Department of Main Roads in 1982 as an apprentice plant mechanic. He was continually employed from that time by RMS, or its predecessors, until he was dismissed on 2 October 2015. The applicant is a qualified plant mechanic. At the time of his dismissal the applicant held the position of Fleet Inspector, Sydney/Southern, based at the RMS depot at Bellambi, now known as Russellvale, in the Illawarra region. Prior to the matters which led to the applicant’s dismissal, he had not been the subject of any disciplinary proceeding.
	
	
	The applicant is a 52 year old married man with no dependent children.
	
	
	On 20 May 2012 the applicant was engaged in an online chat on his computer with a person whom he believed to be a 14 year old girl named Haley. Haley was, in fact, a Detective Senior Constable of Task Force Argos, Child Safety and Sexual Crimes Group, within the Crimes Operation Command of the Queensland Police Force. During that online conversation, the applicant transmitted to Hayley a video and photo of himself which would ultimately lead to him being charged with, and convicted of, a breach of section 474.27A(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) in that he did use a carriage service to send indecent material to a person under 16 years of age.
	
	
	For the next two years and three months the applicant remained unaware that, on 20 May 2012, he had been chatting with, and had sent indecent material to, a police officer rather than, as he thought, a fourteen year old girl.
	
	
	On 4 August 2014 officers of the NSW Police Force executed a search warrant on the applicant’s residence and took possession of a number of items, including four which were described in the police fact sheet as a “Cruzer 2 GB drive”, an “Imation 8 GB USB drive”, a “Hard drive-Asus” and a “HP Laptop”. The first and second items were located in the RMS vehicle which had been allocated to the applicant for work purposes. The third and fourth items were located in the applicant’s residence. All four devices contained pornographic videos and/or images of persons under the age of 16 years.
	
	
	Following the execution of the search warrant on the applicant’s residence, but on the same day, the applicant notified his direct manager, Mr Sri Dharan, that the police had searched his house looking for child abuse material and had taken his work computer and work phone. The applicant also advised Mr Dharan of the name and telephone number of the police officer who was handling the matter. According to an email sent on 5 August 2014 from Mr Dharan to other officers of RMS, Mr Dharan had been advised that the applicant “is denying the allegation”.
	
	
	On the same day, 5 August 2014, the applicant was advised by Mr Dharan that he had been suspended with pay. This was confirmed in a letter to him dated 6 August 2014 from Mr Evans.
	
	
	As a result of the information provided by the Queensland Police Force, and the seizure of the four devices containing child pornography, on 5 September 2014 the applicant was charged with four counts of breaching section 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, namely possession of child abuse material. In addition, as a result of the applicant’s interaction with Haley on 20 May 2012, the applicant was charged with one count of breaching section 61N(1) of the Crimes Act, in that he did commit an act of indecency with a person under 16 years of age. The applicant was also charged with one count of breaching section 474A.27A(1) of the Criminal Code Act.
	
	
	The applicant claimed that he understood that the police would be informing RMS of the offences with which he had been charged and that he did not understand that it was also his obligation to inform RMS directly of the charges.
	
	
	On 9 September 2014 the applicant telephoned Mr Dharan and told him that the applicant’s work computer and mobile phone had been returned by the police as nothing of an incriminating nature was found on those devices. Shortly after that Mr Dharan came to the applicant’s residence and collected those devices and some other RMS items that had been assigned to the applicant.
	
	
	On 15 September 2014 the Chief Executive of RMS, Mr Peter Duncan, determined that the applicant would be suspended without pay pending the outcome of the investigation by RMS into the allegations which underpinned the criminal charges against the applicant. The applicant did not receive the letter advising him of this decision until 13 October 2014 which became the commencement date of his suspension without pay. During this period of suspension without pay the applicant was permitted to access his accrued sick leave, annual leave and long service leave entitlements.
	
	
	The first return date in the Local Court of the criminal charges against the applicant was 7 October 2014. The applicant informed Mr Dharan of that fact on or about that date.
	
	
	It appears that, ultimately, the four counts of possession of child abuse material were condensed into one charge of breaching section 91H(2) of the Crimes Act and the section 61N(1) matter was withdrawn.
	
	
	On 16 April 2015, in the Port Kembla Local Court, the applicant entered pleas of guilty to one count of breaching section 91H(2) of the Crimes Act and to one count of breaching section 474A.27A(1) of the Criminal Code Act. The presiding magistrate, Magistrate Stoddart, described the offences as “very serious matters indeed”. The first carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment and the second a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. The jurisdictional limit on the Local Court in respect of each offence was two years imprisonment. The applicant was convicted of the two offences and sentenced to a period of nine months imprisonment with a non-parole period of six months. The applicant immediately appealed the severity of the sentence and was granted conditional bail.
	
	
	On 27 May 2015 Judge Paul Conlon of the District Court of NSW confirmed the conviction of the applicant on the possession of child abuse material charge but set aside the penalty imposed by the Local Court and in its place directed the applicant to enter into a good behaviour bond for two years and to accept Community Corrections Service supervision for as long as considered necessary and to obey all reasonable directions. In relation to the matter involving the use of a carriage service to send indecent material to a person under 16 years of age, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 12 months but suspended that sentence upon the condition that the applicant enter into a recognizance in the sum of $1,000.00, without security, to be of good behaviour for a period of two years. Supervision by the Community Corrections Service was imposed with respect to this matter as well.
	


Action following the criminal convictions


	
	RMS and Transport for NSW (‘TfNSW’) are two of a number of public transport agencies within New South Wales that form what is known as the “Transport Cluster”. TfNSW has a Workplace Conduct and Investigation Unit (‘WCIU’) which supports the Transport Cluster, including RMS, on matters such as allegations of misconduct by employees. On or about 28 May 2015 the applicant informed Ms Amanda Kotevski, Acting Senior Consultant of the WCIU, by telephone that his case had been finalised. On 29 May 2015 the applicant emailed to Ms Kotevski a copy of a letter to him from his solicitors which confirmed the outcome of his appeal to the District Court.
	
	
	There then followed an exchange of correspondence between the applicant and his solicitors, on the one hand, and officers of RMS and TfNSW, on the other hand, which culminated in a meeting between the applicant, his wife, Mr Evans and Mr Silven Simmons, Principal Manager, Human Resources and Industrial Relations at RMS, on 10 September 2015. At that meeting Mr Evans informed the applicant that he, Mr Evans, had determined that he would not proceed with further disciplinary action against the applicant and that he could return to work once he had provided a medical clearance and had re-undertaken Code of Conduct and Ethics training. On 11 September Mr Evans sent the applicant a letter advising him that it was anticipated that his return to work would occur on or around Monday 21 September 2015.
	
	
	It appears that, following the meeting on 10 September 2015, concern was expressed at the most senior levels of management within RMS, including its Chief Executive, and TfNSW about the crimes committed by the applicant and the prospect of him returning to his role at RMS. Mr Evans remained concerned that, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant’s criminal convictions were not directly related to his position at RMS, the conduct which had led to those convictions was reprehensible and did not meet the standards of behaviour expected of RMS staff.
	
	
	Regulation 31 of the TAS Regulation provides as follows:
	


31 Members of the Transport Service convicted of serious offences

If a member of the Transport Service is convicted of a serious criminal offence, the Transport Secretary may:

(a) take disciplinary action with respect to the member, or

(b) take remedial action with respect to the member.


	
	Regulation 3 contains the following definition:
	


""serious criminal offence"" means an offence committed in New South Wales that is punishable by imprisonment for 6 months or more or an offence committed elsewhere that, if it had been committed in New South Wales, would be an offence so punishable.


	
	On Friday 18 September 2015 Mr Evans telephoned the applicant and instructed him not to return to work on the following Monday. Mr Evans told the applicant that he was going to reassess his decision to not take disciplinary action against the applicant. Mr Evans confirmed his direction that the applicant not return to work in a letter to him dated 21 September 2015.
	
	
	Mr Evans came to the view that the applicant’s conduct was so inconsistent with the values required to be possessed and demonstrated by government employees that, even if it was not done while on duty and even if his work did not involve children, he, Mr Evans, had to change his decision and proceed with his initial view to terminate the applicant’s employment. Mr Evans was satisfied that the applicant’s conduct was sufficiently serious to warrant termination of his employment given:
	



	
	that the applicant was convicted of serious criminal offences;
	
	
	that the applicant was convicted of offences relating to child pornography;
	
	
	that the applicant was convicted of, not only possessing child pornography, but also of sending indecent material to someone portraying themselves as a 14 year old girl;
	
	
	an expectation that people convicted of serious child pornography offences should not be employed as NSW public servants;
	
	
	society’s attitude to child pornography and paedophilia, particularly given the recent high-profile media attention given to the Church and child institutions as a result of the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse;
	
	
	that the applicant failed to inform RMS that he had been charged with any offences (until after his matter had been finalised in the District Court); and
	
	
	that the applicant failed to inform RMS that he had pleaded guilty and been convicted of any offences in the Local Court (until after his matter had been finalised in the District Court).
	



	
	On 30 September 2015 Mr Evans sent the applicant a letter directing him to attend a formal meeting with Mr Evans on Friday 2 October 2015. On that day Mr Evans met the applicant and his wife and provided him with a letter of dismissal. The applicant was paid five weeks’ pay in lieu of notice.
	
	
	After the termination of the applicant’s employment, Mr Evans re-read the fact sheet tendered by the prosecutor in the Local Court. Mr Evans had not picked up, when he first read the fact sheet or at any time prior to the applicant’s dismissal, that two of the devices containing child pornography seized by the police were located in the applicant’s RMS work vehicle. This caused Mr Evans to become more concerned and reinforced his decision that the applicant should not be employed to work for RMS.
	


Case for the applicant


	
	In his application to this Commission, the applicant claims that his dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust for the following reasons:
	


a) The Termination Letter refers only to the conduct of which Mr Hansen was convicted. That conduct was unrelated to his employment, and did not provide a proper reason for dismissal. That conduct did not cause serious damage to the employment relationship, nor was it incompatible with Mr Hansen's duties as an employee. Mr Hansen's position as Fleet Inspector did not involve any interaction with children. None of the offences of which Mr Hansen was convicted involved the use of RMS computers or other equipment.

b) RMS was aware that Mr Hansen had been charged, and of the outcome of the Local Court hearing. Most importantly, RMS was aware of the outcome of the District Court hearing and thus the ultimate outcome of the criminal process. The alleged failure to 'properly disclose the fact that you had been charged or convicted in the Local Court' was not a proper reason for dismissal.

c) Mr Hansen was dismissed after a lengthy period of suspension, and after RMS had informed him that no disciplinary action would be taken. Dismissal in these circumstances has caused Mr Hansen additional and unnecessary distress.

d) Although RMS met with Mr Hansen twice during its investigation (on 10 September 2015 and 2 October 2015), on neither occasion was there any inquiry regarding the relevant facts or any mitigating circumstances. On both occasions the outcome was conveyed to Mr Hansen during the meeting, and Mr Evans had clearly already decided the outcome prior to the meeting.

e) After informing Mr Hansen that no disciplinary action would be taken, RMS changed its decision and issued the Termination Letter. That occurred without giving Mr Hansen any further chance to be heard.

f) Mr Hansen was a longstanding employee (33 years of service), with a good employment record.

g) Even if (contrary to the Applicant's primary position) the conduct disclosed by Mr Hansen's convictions was relevant to his employment, in all of the circumstances dismissal was not the appropriate penalty, and was harsh. The Applicant had already been penalised as a result of his lengthy period of suspension without pay. Other disciplinary action or remedial action was available to the RMS.

h) Mr Hansen's conduct has been dealt with by the criminal justice system, with criminal punishment imposed. That process has caused Mr Hansen great distress. It was harsh for RMS to impose an additional 'punishment' of dismissal from employment.

i) Mr Hansen was not provided with particulars of his alleged behaviour giving rise to the disciplinary investigation, contrary to reg 30 of the Transport Administration (Staff) Regulation 2012. There was no investigation conducted by the RMS into that alleged behaviour.

j) In addition, and relevant at least to any lost pay or compensation to be awarded, Mr Hansen was suspended without pay unnecessarily, and for an excessive period, after his criminal charges had been finalised. The unnecessary and lengthy suspension caused him financial hardship and distress.

Authorities on ‘out-of-hours’ conduct


	
	In support of the application, Mr Moorhouse, counsel for the applicant, relied upon the often cited decision of Ross VP, as his Honour then was, of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in Rose v Telstra Corporation Ltd (unreported, Print Q9292, Dec 1444/98, 4 December 1998), and, in particular, the following passage (at pages 11-12):
	


It is clear that in certain circumstances an employee's employment may be validly terminated because of out of hours conduct. But such circumstances are limited:

* the conduct must be such that, viewed objectively, it is likely to cause serious damage to the relationship between the employer and employee; or

* the conduct damages the employer's interests; or

* the conduct is incompatible with the employee's duty as an employee.

In essence the conduct complained of must be of such gravity or importance as to indicate a rejection or repudiation of the employment contract by the employee.


	
	It needs to be remembered that in the case of Rose, the reason for the dismissal of the applicant, Mr B. Rose, which Ross VP found to be harsh, was that he had got into an altercation out-of-hours with another Telstra employee during which the applicant received an injury requiring 12 stitches. The applicant had not been charged with, nor convicted of, any criminal offence whereas the other party to the altercation was charged and ultimately convicted of malicious wounding and sentenced to four months imprisonment. This suggests that, of the two participants in the altercation, Rose was the less culpable.
	
	
	I discern nothing in the decision in Rose which establishes any principle to the effect that, even where an employee has committed a serious crime out-of-hours and away from the workplace, there needs to be established a direct connection between that criminal activity and the person’s employment before the commission of that crime provides justification for the dismissal of the employee. The situation may well be different with respect to the commission of less serious offences, such as common assault. Further, as will be discussed later in these reasons for decision, this Commission has rejected the notion that the out-or-hours conduct “must be of such gravity or importance as to indicate a rejection or repudiation of the employment contract by the employee”.
	
	
	Towards the end of his decision, Ross VP stated (at page 17):
	


I do not doubt that the applicant's behaviour on 14 November 1997 was foolish and an error of judgment. He made a mistake. But employers do not have an unfettered right to sit in judgment on the out of work behaviour of their employees. An employee is entitled to a private life. The circumstances in which an employee may be validly terminated because of their conduct outside work are limited. The facts of this case do not fall within those limited circumstances.


	
	I do not accept that an employee’s entitlement to a “private life”, with respect to which an employer has no “unfettered right to sit in judgement”, extends to the commission of serious crimes such as those committed by the applicant in the present case. Clearly, the gravity of the conduct which led to a dismissal is a matter which the Commission must consider in any unfair dismissal case.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that the statements made by Ross VP in Rose, including the passage cited at paragraph 28 above, have been approved by subsequent Full Benches of the Federal Commission, including in Farquharson v Qantas Ltd [(2006) 155 IR 22 at [18]-[20]]. In that matter the appellant’s employment had been terminated because of an assault on another Qantas employee during what was referred to as “slip time”, or rest time, given to flight crews between flights. The incident occurred at a hotel in Singapore in the early hours of the morning when the appellant was quite drunk having consumed between 11 and 14 drinks. The appellant had not been charged with, nor convicted of, any criminal offence. Despite this Drake SDP dismissed the appellant’s unfair dismissal application at first instance. On appeal the Full Bench (Lawler VP, O’Callaghan SDP and Raffaelli C) was not satisfied that the appellant had demonstrated error on the part of her Honour warranting a grant of leave to appeal. Leave to appeal was refused. Clearly, the gravity or seriousness of the employee’s conduct in that matter was far less than that of the applicant in the matter presently before the Commission, and yet the dismissal of the appellant was not found to be unfair.
	
	
	Counsel also relied upon the earlier decision of a Full Bench of the Federal Commission (MacBean SDP, Duncan DP and Deegan C) in Appellant v Respondent [(1999) 89 IR 407] in support of the propositions that it is only in “exceptional circumstances” that an employer has a right to extend supervision over the private activities of employees, and that the employer would have to have a “legitimate concern” to act in relation to out-of-hours conduct.
	
	
	In that matter the out-of-hours conduct which the Commission found did not justify dismissal was consensual sexual activity between two flight attendants in the early hours of the morning in a hotel room during an international stop over. No question of criminality arose, but one of the participants subsequently complained that she had been sexually harassed by her co-worker.
	
	
	Sexual harassment of a co-worker is clearly unacceptable conduct, but it is of an entirely different class of conduct, in terms of gravity or seriousness, to the conduct of the applicant in the present case. Reliance upon the decision in Appellant v Respondent to support the applicant’s case in the present matter demonstrates the inherent difficulty in attempting to draw support from observations made in decisions which are dealing with vastly different factual circumstances to those which are presently before the Commission.
	
	
	Counsel also relied upon a number of decisions of this Commission which, it was submitted, had endorsed the principles set out in Rose.
	
	
	One of those decisions was that of the Full Bench (Wright P, Harrison DP and Boland J) in New South Wales Attorney-General’s Department v Miller [(2007) 160 IR 185]. In that matter the employee, Mr Miller, had been dismissed for sexually harassing a number of female work colleagues, generally away from the workplace. He had not been charged with, nor convicted of, any criminal offence. At first instance, Grayson DP found that the allegations of sexual harassment had not been made out on the evidence and, as a consequence, the dismissal of Mr Miller was found to be harsh and unreasonable.
	
	
	With respect to the allegations concerning out-of-hours conduct Grayson DP observed “that much of the alleged misconduct – indeed the overwhelming majority of it when viewed by degree of potential seriousness – involved social activity at various licensed establishments outside working hours and away from the workplace…” (quoted by the Full Bench at [54]).
	
	
	On appeal the Full Bench found that Grayson DP had erred with respect to a number of his findings that sexual harassment had not occurred. Nevertheless, the Full Bench found that the dismissal of Mr Miller was harsh stating:
	


122 We have decided, not without hesitation, that Mr Miller's dismissal was, in the circumstances, harsh because it was disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct and because of the consequences for the personal and economic situation of Mr Miller: see Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd, Frew v Australian Airlines Ltd [1995] HCA 24; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 465 per McHugh and Gummow JJ. Part of our hesitation stems from a concern that a finding that the dismissal was harsh might be seen as condoning Mr Miller's conduct and thereby undermining the appellant's obvious entitlement to rely on supervisors to conduct themselves properly in the workplace and to ensure others did so in accordance with the Department's policies.

123 We should make it perfectly clear in that regard that for a person in the relatively senior position of Assistant Registrar, who prided himself on his work achievements and his ability to manage people and deliver ""great results"", we have been left with the distinct impression on the evidence that Mr Miller's attitude to those women in respect of whom he held a supervisory responsibility at Manly was boorish, insensitive, inconsistent with the position he held and constituted unacceptable behaviour. It is only by the narrowest of margins that we have found the dismissal harsh. No employee who engages in harassment of any kind could take any comfort from our decision.


	
	Clearly, the misconduct of the employee in that case was far less, in terms of its gravity or seriousness, than the criminal conduct of the applicant in the present matter.
	
	
	In Lawrance v Commissioner of Police ([2010] NSWIRComm 149 (12 November 2010)) Walton VP, as his Honour then was, reviewed the decision of the Commissioner of Police to remove from the force a police sergeant who, on at least two occasions, exposed his penis at a work Christmas party in front of a number of other serving police officers and some civilian invitees. The function took place out-of-hours and away from the workplace.
	
	
	It may readily be accepted that special considerations apply to police officers, who are required to at all times enforce the law, which considerations do not apply to the applicant in the present case. It is also accepted that the “impugned conduct” in Lawrance occurred at a work related function which is not the case in the present matter. However, there were a number of countervailing features which also distinguish Lawrance from the present case on the question of the gravity or seriousness of the misconduct which led to dismissal. They included:
	



	
	The applicant had not been charged with, nor convicted of, any criminal offence.
	
	
	The persons exposed to the “impugned conduct” were all adults and were attendees at the function. No members of the general public and no children were present.
	
	
	Those who witnessed the “impugned conduct” did not take offence to it.
	
	
	The applicant was well affected by alcohol at the time.
	
	
	The applicant was supported by significant character evidence.
	



	
	Balancing all of the relevant considerations, Walton VP decided “by a fine margin” that the removal of the applicant was “too harsh a consequence for the applicant’s misconduct, having regard to the degree of seriousness of the applicant’s misconduct… and the strong mitigating and other ameliorating circumstances in favour of the applicant…” (at [322]).
	
	
	It is extremely doubtful that the same decision would have been made by his Honour if the intended victim of the applicant’s indecent exposure was a person, unknown to the applicant, but whom the applicant believed to be a fourteen year old girl. This is likely to be the case despite the presence in that matter of the “strong mitigating and other ameliorating circumstances in favour of the applicant”, none of which are present in the matter now before the Commission.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant sought to call in aid of the applicant’s case the approach adopted by the Commission in Public Employment Office Department of Attorney General and Justice (Corrective Services NSW) v Silling ([2012] NSWIRComm 118 (31 October 2012)). In that matter the dismissed employee, Mr Silling, a Correctional Officer, had, over a period of 13 years, been charged with, and pleaded guilty to, three counts of common assault, two on his wife and one on his 24 year old daughter. Common assault under section 61 of the Crimes Act is an assault not occasioning actual bodily harm. A conviction renders the offender liable to imprisonment for two years.
	
	
	At first instance Bishop C found the dismissal to have been unfair and ordered the reinstatement of Silling (Silling v Corrective Services NSW [2011] NSWIRComm 1056 (16 December 2011)). In her decision Bishop C was focussed on the need for there to be a connection between the applicant’s off-duty conduct and his employment (at [155], [174]). There can be no doubt that the existence or otherwise of such a connection may have relevance in cases of less serious criminal conduct. In cases involving the commission of very serious crimes, such as the present matter, the search for such a connection can become a distraction when the overriding consideration should be an objective assessment of the inherent seriousness of the criminal conduct itself.
	
	
	After citing a passage from Farquharson (at [20]-[22]), which included the passage from Rose cited at paragraph 28 above, Bishop C stated:
	


[158] I do not consider that by his three acts of domestic violence, reprehensible as they might be, he had any intention to, nor did he, repudiate or reject his contract of employment with CSNSW.

Although this statement is consistent with the reasoning of Ross VP in Rose, by putting the proposition in this way, the Commissioner was, with respect to her, addressing the wrong question in the context of public sector employment.


	
	On appeal the Full Bench (Haylen J, Backman J and Stanton C) held that the findings of Bishop C that the termination of Silling was harsh, unjust and unreasonable, and the Commissioner’s decision to re-instate, were reasonably open to her and that, having regard to the substance of the Commissioner’s decision, no error had been demonstrated that warranted the granting of leave to appeal (per Haylen J at [3]).
	
	
	In her reasons for decision, Backman J stated (at [45]):
	


The issue as to whether there was a connection between Mr Silling’s out-of-hours conduct (the convictions) and his dismissal was relevant to Commissioner Bishop’s consideration as a factor she was required to take into account. (emphasis added)

Nowhere does her Honour state that the presence or absence of such a connection is the decisive factor in determining whether a particular dismissal is unfair.


	
	The Full Bench did not comment on that passage of the Commissioner’s decision cited at paragraph 48 above.
	
	
	There are a number of significant factors in Silling which stand it apart from the facts of the present case. They include the following:
	



	
	In 1998 Silling pleaded guilty to a charge of common assault under section 61 of the Crimes Act following a domestic dispute with his wife. The offence was found proven and he was released upon entering into a recognisance under section 556A of the Crimes Act subject to conditions, one of which was to attend for counselling as directed or agreed. His employment was not terminated but he was issued with a letter of warning.
	
	
	In 2008 Silling assaulted his 24 year old daughter during an argument. Again he pleaded guilty to a charge of common assault, the offence was found proven and he was placed on a recognisance under section 10(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. No further conditions were imposed and no internal disciplinary action was taken “due to an administrative oversight”. This, coupled with the previous letter of warning, made it difficult for the employer to subsequently argue that the commission of the offence of common assault compromised Silling’s capacity to perform the role of a Correctional Officer.
	
	
	In 2011 Silling again assaulted his wife during an argument. He pleaded guilty to a charge of common assault, was convicted and placed on a recognisance order under section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be of good behaviour for nine months subject to conditions.
	
	
	None of the offences committed by Silling led to the imposition of a term of imprisonment, suspended or otherwise.
	
	
	Bishop C accepted that Silling “took immediate and prompt action to report the incidents himself, cooperated in police interviews, made admissions and subsequently pleaded guilty to the very serious offences he had committed… He also promptly reported each incident to his Managers at Goulburn Correctional Complex and provided detail about his court appearances and resulting convictions” (at [130]).
	
	
	The victim of two of Silling’s offences, his wife, gave evidence in support of him before Bishop C.
	



	
	In my opinion, the decisions in Silling, both at first instance and on appeal, provide very little guidance in a case such as the present where the criminal conduct which led to the dismissal was not in the nature of a common assault perpetrated on a forgiving spouse, but involved the sexual exploitation and abuse of children. Silling is very much confined to its own particular facts and does not support a finding, in the present matter, that the dismissal of the applicant was harsh, unreasonable or unjust.
	
	
	A different outcome from that in Silling occurred in Corrective Services NSW v Danwer ([2013] NSWIRComm 61 (16 July 2013)). In that matter, a Full Bench of the Commission (Boland P, Staff J and Backman J) reversed the first instance decision of Newall C to reinstate a Correctional Officer who had been dismissed following his conviction for an offence under section 61N(2) of the Crimes Act, namely, committing an act of indecency towards a person over the age of 16 years (Shonit Kumar Danwer v Corrective Services NSW [2013] NSWIRComm 1009 (27 May 2013)). A person who commits this offence is liable to a penalty of 18 months imprisonment.
	
	
	The offence occurred out-of-hours and away from the workplace. In his decision, Newall C maintained that the test was whether the applicant’s conduct was such as to indicate an objection or repudiation of the employment contract, stating:
	


[58] As I note above, in considering whether this dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, it is to be borne in mind that the conduct which led to Mr Danwer's conviction was off-duty. The circumstances in which out-of-hours conduct can be held to justify the termination of an employee's employment are limited: Rose v Telstra Corporation Limited Print Q9292, 4 December 1998, cited with approval in NSW Attorney-General's Department v Miller [2007] NSWIRComm 33 at [52]. Not only is the employer obliged to demonstrate that the conduct could relevantly be considered in the context of employment, but the conduct complained of must be of such gravity or importance as to indicate an objection or repudiation of the employment contract by the employee.


	
	The Commissioner found the conduct of the applicant did not demonstrate an intention to repudiate the contract of employment, nor was it conduct so as to, of itself, terminate the contract (at [60]-[61]). This approach appears to be consistent with that of Ross VP in Rose and Bishop C in Silling, as cited at paragraphs 28 and 48 above.
	
	
	On appeal, the Full Bench did not consider the Commissioner’s approach was correct and, to that extent, he was in error. The Full Bench stated (at [30]-[32]).
	


30 In determining an unfair dismissal application of the nature that was before Newall C, the following considerations are relevant: (i) whether the employee was a public sector employee to whom the PSEM Act applied; (ii) whether the employee was convicted of an offence to which s 48 applied; (iii) whether disciplinary action was taken in accordance with ss 48 and 42(1); and (iv) if so, whether the disciplinary action, viewed objectively, was harsh, unjust or unreasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the requirements of s 88 of the IR Act and the objects of Pt 2.7 of the PSEM Act. There is no basis for importing into the statute a provision to the effect that where a public sector employee commits an offence to which s 48 applies, the test is whether the commission of the offence evinced an intention to repudiate the contract of employment.

31 At [60] of his decision, Commissioner Newall maintained that the test was whether Mr Danwer's conduct was such as to indicate an objection or repudiation of the employment contract. At [61] the Commissioner found the conduct did not demonstrate an intention to repudiate the contract of employment; nor was it of itself conduct so as to of itself terminate the contract.

32 Having regard to Brown, we do not consider the Commissioner's approach was correct and to that extent he was in error.

It should be noted that section 48 of the Public Sector Employment and Management Act 2002 entitled the appropriate Department Head to take disciplinary or remedial action against an officer who had been convicted of an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for 12 months or more. Regulation 31 of the TAS Regulation provides the Transport Secretary with similar powers with respect to employees of RMS, such as the applicant.


	
	The reference to Brown at paragraph [32] of the Full Bench’s decision is a reference to an earlier Full Bench decision in Director of Public Employment by his agent the Director-General of The Department Of Juvenile Justice and Professional Officers' Association Amalgamated Union of NSW (On Behalf of Elvin Brian Brown) ([2008] NSWIRComm 221; (2008) 184 IR 134) which the Full Bench in Danwer discussed at length earlier in its decision. Those passages are cited later in these reasons for decision in the broader context of a discussion of the relevance of common law principles to the dismissal of public sector employees.
	
	
	Conduct amounting to a repudiation of the employment contract, as was considered in Rose and Silling, is not the yard stick against which the out-of-hours conduct of the applicant needs to be measured so as to justify the dismissal in the present matter. The starting point for such consideration is the gravity or seriousness of that conduct.
	
	
	In considering whether the dismissal in Danwer was harsh the Full Bench stated as follows:
	


63.   We have also had regard to those matters the respondent contended should be taken into account in his favour. That includes his length of unblemished service, his stable family life, his mortgage, the difficulty of finding alternative employment given his criminal conviction and the hardship that it will cause.

64.   That leads us to the question of whether the Commissioner erred in finding the dismissal of Mr Danwer from his employment was harsh. In doing so, we observe this involves a mixed question of fact and law and not one of an exercise solely of discretion by the tribunal: Burge v NSW BHP Steel Pty Ltd [2001] NSWIRComm 117; (2001) 105 IR 325 at [4] applying Hollingsworth v Commissioner of Police (No 2) (1999) 47 NSWLR 151; (1999) 88 IR 282 at 181 - 182 and Port Macquarie Golf Club Ltd v Stead (1996) 64 IR 53 at [59]

65.   As the appellant submitted, whether the dismissal of the respondent was harsh requires the Commission to consider all of the relevant factors and to weigh them in the balance. First, there are those considerations that weigh against a finding of harshness. These are as follows:

(a) the gravity of the conduct that led to the conviction. In this case it involved an act of indecency at a music school attended by children in the proximity of a person who, to all outward appearances, was a schoolgirl;

(b) the respondent's continued insistence that he did not commit the offence despite accepting the courts' decisions about his guilt and conviction. We note, in this respect, a further appeal would have been available to the respondent but he did not pursue it;

(c) by committing the offence the respondent brought discredit upon himself and on Corrective Services which had the effect of undermining the integrity and reputation of the Public Service, contrary to the objects of Pt 2.7 of the PSEM Act;

(d) the respondent's conduct in committing the offence for which he was convicted and his attitude whereby he refuses to accept he was guilty of any wrongdoing is incompatible with his duties and responsibilities as a Correctional Services Officer 1. Firstly, it betrays the employer's trust and confidence in him. Secondly, it would be intolerable in a prison environment, where the respondent is required to exemplify good conduct and to act in a ""pro-social manner"" thereby encouraging offenders under his charge to change their own behaviour, for him to carry out that role in circumstances where he himself engaged in serious antisocial behaviour for which he was convicted, but in respect of which he refuses to acknowledge his guilt; and

(e) for the reasons expressed in (d) above, it would undermine public confidence in the prison system and, therefore, it would not be in the public interest and consistent with the objects of Pt 2.7 of the PSEM Act to overturn the decision to dismiss the respondent and to reinstate him as a correctional services officer.

66.   Those matters that weigh in favour of a finding of harshness are:

(a) the loss of a position in the Public Service that the respondent has held for nearly 10 years;

(b) the fact that Mr Danwer had an unblemished work record;

(c) the fact that Mr Danwer is married and has both a son and a daughter;

(d) the fact that Mr Danwer had a mortgage of approximately $500,000 and loss of his employment, should he not be able to obtain alternative employment, will cause hardship for the family; and

(e) Mr Danwer's expression of remorse to the extent it has any value.

67.   On any objective assessment of the factors to be weighed in the balance, those factors that count against a finding that the dismissal was harsh must prevail. Accordingly, we find that Newall C erred in finding the dismissal was harsh.


	
	It will be apparent from the Full Bench’s consideration of the issue of harshness of the dismissal, that the first matter weighed in the balance was the “gravity of the conduct that led to the conviction”. Clearly, the fact that the conduct involved an act of indecency at a music school attended by children in the proximity of a person who, to all outward appearances, was a schoolgirl, weighed heavily against a finding of harshness.
	
	
	In Kevin Cooper v Australian Taxation Office ([2014] FWC 7551) Lawrence DP of the Fair Work Commission was dealing with an unfair dismissal application by a former employee of the Australian Taxation Office (‘the ATO’) who was dismissed following his conviction on two counts of indecency on a person who was under 16 years of age outside of Australia. The applicant had been sentenced to three years and two months imprisonment for his crimes.
	
	
	The ATO’s position was that the applicant had been dismissed for a breach of the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct arising from the applicant’s convictions.
	
	
	Before Lawrence DP, the applicant asserted his innocence and intention to appeal the convictions. He further submitted that the offence for which he was convicted had no link to the employment relationship (at [4]). As has occurred in the present case, the applicant in that matter relied heavily on the decision of Ross VP in Rose on the issue of the necessary connection between the misconduct and the employment relationship.
	
	
	The ATO agreed that the convictions were not work related. They occurred outside Australia. They did not relate to other employees of the ATO. They were, however, for very serious offences which were, it was agreed, highly unethical (at [42]).
	
	
	Nevertheless, the ATO alleged that the applicant’s convictions “are a breach of the APS Code of Conduct as set out in the Public Service Act 1999. The report of Mr Davey on 13 August 2013 found a breach of 2 provisions of the Code:
	


s.10(1)(d) – ‘The APS has the highest ethical standards’

s.13(11) – ‘An APS employee must at all times behave in a way which upholds APS values and the integrity and good reputation of the APS.’”

(at [26]) 


	
	After citing the passage from the decision of Ross VP in Rose quoted at paragraph 28 above, Lawrence DP stated as follows:
	


[45] His Honour analysed the facts of several cases and concluded that a valid reason for termination for conduct outside work would require “requisite connection to his employment”.

[46] In Anthony Farquharson and Qantas Airways Limited [PR971685], 10 August 2006, a Full Bench, VP Lawler, SDP O’Callaghan, Raffaelli C dealt with “the peculiar circumstances attending slip time in a foreign port that give Qantas a legitimate interest in the slip time conduct of its flight crew that is far greater than the usual interest of an employer in the off duty conduct of its employees.” In that case, Qantas had a legitimate interest in ensuring that incidents did not occur which damaged its interests and reputation.

[47] In Michael King v Catholic Education Office Diocese of Parramatta [PR544488], 20 November 2013, I decided that although the conduct for which the Applicant was dismissed occurred outside school hours and premises, it constituted a valid reason for dismissal. The “requisite connection” to the Applicant’s employment was the students of the college.

[48] This decision was upheld by a Full Bench (2014) FWCFB 2194.

[49] It seems to me that the general approach of the Commission, as summarised in Rose, needs to be applied so that the test is appropriate to the circumstances of the employment relationship. Private, for profit employment will be different to the school situation dealt with in King. In this case, public sector employment is under consideration.

[50] The relevant parts of the Code of Conduct are quoted above. Section 13(11) and s.10(1)(d) require an ATO employee to behave “at all times” in a way which maintains the integrity and reputation of the APS. I accept the ATO’s submission that this creates an overriding obligation, not just in work time or workplaces, for an employee to behave with the highest ethical standards so the APS’s reputation is maintained.

[51] The Applicant’s convictions were for a serious offence which was clearly unethical. I find that the Applicant was in breach of the Code of Conduct.

[52] I accept also that public sector employment has a special value. This is particularly so with an agency like the ATO which must maintain the confidence of the general public in dealing with their taxation and financial affairs.

……………………

[54] The decision in Rose describes the shift in the way in which ‘private’ acts are treated. It is noted that a conviction for a criminal offence is not, of itself, sufficient to warrant termination. It depends on the circumstances.

[55] Given the nature of the employment and the convictions in this case, the action taken to dismiss by the ATO, is in my view not contrary to Rose:

● convictions for such unethical actions caused serious damage to the employer/employee relationship.

● the employer’s interests and reputation, as summarised in the Code, were potentially damaged.

● the conduct was incompatible with the employee’s duty as an employee especially as his position involved supervision of other employees.

[56] Having found that the Applicant’s convictions put him in breach of the Code, I find that the ATO’s action in carrying out a formal investigation and ultimately dismissing the Applicant was a reasonable response to a difficult situation. I find that, in the circumstances of the case, there was a valid reason for the dismissal of the Applicant.


	
	Lawrence DP dismissed the application for a remedy for unfair dismissal (at [71]).
	
	
	The unsuccessful applicant sought permission to appeal the decision of Lawrence DP to a Full Bench of the Commission on which Ross P was the presiding member (together with Hatcher VP and Gostencnik DP - Kevin Cooper v Australian Taxation Office ([2015] FWCFB 868).
	
	
	After reciting at length passages from the decision of Lawrence DP the Full Bench stated:
	


[17] There is nothing in these passages ([42]-[49]) which suggests any error. Moreover the Deputy President’s summary at paragraph [49] that the general approach in Rose should be applied having regard to the circumstances of the employment relationship is plainly correct…


	
	Ultimately, the Full Bench refused permission to appeal.
	
	
	The facts in the present case are much closer to the facts in Cooper and Danwer than they are to the facts in Rose and Silling.
	


Change of mind by Mr Evans


	
	It is claimed on behalf of the applicant that, because Mr Evans had decided by 10 September 2015 not to take further disciplinary action against the applicant and to allow him to return to work, in some way Mr Evans had forfeited the right to reconsider his decision and to dismiss the applicant. It is unfortunate that the applicant was advised that he could return to work and was then given contrary advice a short time later. Ideally, that should not have happened, but that unfortunate circumstance does not render the dismissal of the applicant unfair.
	
	
	It was submitted that, at common law, an employer who, with full knowledge of an employee’s misconduct, makes a decision to continue to employ that employee, cannot later summarily dismiss the employee on the basis of that misconduct. One of the cases cited in support of that proposition was Rankin v Marine Power International Pty Ltd [(2001) 107 IR 117 at [352]]. In that matter, which was heard by Gillard J of the Supreme Court of Victoria, an employee was found to have been negligent in the course of his duties, but was permitted to remain in the employment of the defendant company for a period of three and a half months. This, it was argued, constituted condonation by the employer of the alleged breach of the employment contract by the employee, or a waiver of the employer’s rights in relation to that breach. Gillard J dealt with that issue as follows:
	


360.   As I have said, the question of election is a question of fact. In my opinion, the defendant did not elect to abandon its right to terminate the plaintiff's service without proper notice. On the contrary, it made it clear that it was terminating the plaintiff's employment for cause, that he was given three and a half months' notice to enable him to finalise the project of which he had intimate knowledge, and, as Mr Wiggill said, to give him the opportunity to obtain employment whilst holding down his job. None of that evidence leads to the conclusion that the defendant abandoned its right to summarily dismiss him without proper notice.

361.   Mr Tracey QC submitted that the mere fact that the defendant allowed the plaintiff to continue for a period of three and a half months, showed that the defendant had elected to abandon its right to terminate without proper notice. In other words, if an employer has the right to dismiss summarily, the fact that the employer decides - and in this case with the consent of the employee - to permit the employee to remain for a certain period to perform certain duties amounts to an election to abandon a right. In my opinion, it does not.

362.   My conclusion is to some extent supported by the Privy Council's decision in S.O.S. Kinderdorf International v Bittaye [1996] UKPC 11; (1996) 1 WLR 987. In that case, the employee made an unauthorised loan from the employer's funds to a friend. The employer learned from an accountant about the loan, and sent the employee on 120 days' leave at his request. When the period of leave expired, the employee did not return to his employment, nor did the latter ask him to do so. The Privy Council drew the inference that the employer dismissed the employee at the end of the 120 days' leave. There is no suggestion in the case that, by sending the plaintiff on 120 days paid leave, the employer had lost its right to dismiss the employee.

363.   It follows that if the defendant had been entitled to dismiss the plaintiff on 15 January 1999 without proper notice, in the circumstances, it did not lose its right by giving him three and a half months' notice with an option to continue for a further three months.


	
	Gillard J found that there had been no condonation or waiver of rights in that case. In any event, the facts of that case are clearly distinguishable from those of the matter presently before the Commission. In the present matter, the applicant was advised that he could return to work but that never occurred. Before he had resumed work, he was advised of the decision to terminate his services. The earlier advice that was given to the applicant did not constitute condonation as that concept is considered in the authorities. Nor did it constitute a waiver of the respondent’s right to reconsider and change its decision from that previously advised to the applicant.
	
	
	I see no significance in the fact that the change of mind by Mr Evans may have occurred in the context of discussions involving the Chief Executive of RMS, Mr Duncan, and other senior officers of RMS and TfNSW. The fact that discussion of issues, such as the suitability of the applicant remaining an employee of RMS, takes place at the most senior levels within the bureaucracy, is entirely unremarkable.
	
	
	The other case relied upon in this context was Heugh v Central Petroleum Ltd (No 5) ([2014] WASC 311 at [94]). In that matter, Le Miere J of the Supreme Court of Western Australia stated:
	


94 Under the common law a summary dismissal can be supported by any legal justification which in fact existed at the time of termination, irrespective of whether the justification was known or relied upon: Shepherd v Felt & Textiles of Australia Ltd [1931] HCA 21; (1931) 45 CLR 359; Concut Pty Ltd v Worrell; Downer EDI Ltd v Gillies [2012] NSWCA 333. However, an employer is not entitled to justify termination for misconduct not relied upon at the time of termination if the employer condoned the misconduct or waived its right to terminate on the ground of that misconduct. An employer who has full knowledge of the misconduct of an employee and who makes a decision to continue to employ the employee cannot at a later date dismiss him summarily on the basis of the employee's known misconduct: Rankin v Marine Power International Pty Ltd [2001] VSC 150. It is said that the employer has elected to continue the employee in his service or waived his right to dismiss the employee summarily and thereby condoned the misconduct. However, no such waiver, condemnation or election can take place until the employer has full knowledge of the misconduct: Rankin [354] (Gillard J).

95 Central says that Central was justified in terminating Mr Heugh's contract of employment for the following reasons. Mr Heugh retained Introspec at Central's expense yet without the knowledge of its board or any of its directors, apart from Mr Heugh himself, to carry out enquiries into the background of Mr Shortt. This conduct was to be a step in the process of destabilisation of Mr Shortt. Mr Heugh was behaving in an intransigent fashion and was not cooperating with the board and the implementation of the new system for handling farmouts. Central says that that conduct was a serious breach of the provisions of the employment contract which entitled it to terminate Mr Heugh's employment for a serious breach pursuant to cl 14.1(a)(iii) of the employment contract. Central disavowed reliance upon any common law right of summary dismissal or any right to terminate for gross misconduct under cl 14.1(a)(v).


	
	The respondent, RMS, in the present matter does not rely on any common law right to summarily dismiss the applicant. The respondent relies upon its statutory right to take disciplinary action, which includes dismissal, pursuant to Regulation 31 of the TAS Regulation on the basis that the applicant has been convicted of serious criminal offences. 
	
	
	This issue was dealt with by the Commission in Danwer where the Full Bench stated as follows:
	


[27] Director of Public Employment by his agent the Director-General of The Department Of Juvenile Justice and Professional Officers' Association Amalgamated Union of NSW (On Behalf of Elvin Brian Brown) [2008] NSWIRComm 221; (2008) 184 IR 134 was an appeal from Sams DP. The appeal concerned the dismissal of a public sector employee employed under the PSEM Act. Sams DP found that in employment under that Act:

... for an employee to be summarily dismissed for misconduct, (as is the case here), there must be demonstrated conduct of such a serious or wilful nature as to strike at the very heart of the ongoing relationship between the employer and the employee. It has often been described as conduct amounting to a repudiation or renunciation by the employee of his/her employment contract. (at [113]).

[28] The Full Bench found that in approaching the issues raised by the respondent's application on the basis of whether the misconduct established on the evidence would have warranted Mr Brown's summary dismissal at common law, his Honour fell into error. The Full Bench said that is a concept with which the PSEM Act does not concern itself. In that regard, the Full Bench stated:

[20] While public servants such as Mr Brown may undoubtedly also be employees at common law, their contracts of employment must be contracts made in accordance with the applicable statutory scheme. As Brennan J observed in Director-General of Education v Suttling (1987) 162 CLR 427, at 437:

Members of the Service are appointed pursuant to the Act and their rights must be ascertained by reference to its provisions. The relationship between a civil servant of the Crown and the Crown has often been described as contractual, though the civil servant has been appointed pursuant to statute: see, eg, Gould v Stuart [1896] AC 575, at p 577; Carey v The Commonwealth [(1921) 30 CLR 132, at p 137; Lucy v The Commonwealth (1923) 33 CLR 229, at pp 238, 249, 253. However, the contractual nature of the relationship has not been universally accepted: see, eg, Monckton v The Commonwealth (1920) 27 CLR 149, at pp 155, 156; Lucy v The Commonwealth (1923) 33 CLR, at p 244; Geddes v Magrath; Morgan v Geddes (1933) 50 CLR 520, at pp 533- 534; The Commonwealth v Welsh (1947) 74 CLR 245, at pp 262, 274; and cf Ryder v Foley (1906) 4 CLR 422, at 440. And sometimes an espousal of one view rather than the other has been avoided: see, eg, Reilly v The King [1934] AC 176, at p 180; Kodeeswaran v Attorney-General (Ceylon) [1970] AC 1111, at p 1118.

If the relationship is contractual, the contract must be consistent with any statutory provision which affects the relationship. No agent of the Crown has authority to engage a servant on terms at variance with the statute. To the extent that the statute governs the relationship, it is idle to inquire whether there is a contract which embodies its provisions.

[21] So far as dismissal is concerned, it is the provisions of the Public Sector Employment and Management Act which the Director General was obliged to observe. That Act is concerned with 'misconduct' as defined and 'disciplinary action' as also defined, which may be taken, if misconduct is established. It is left to the Department Head in question to determine what disciplinary action is appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case. One action which may be taken is to dismiss. That is what occurred in this case.

[22] Given the provisions of s 83, there is no question that the fairness of such a decision may be challenged, in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 ('the Act'). What may then arise for consideration is both whether misconduct in fact occurred and if it did, whether the disciplinary action taken, dismissal, was 'harsh, unreasonable or unjust' in all of the circumstances. Such a consideration may also involve considering whether other disciplinary action available to be taken by the Department Head, ought to have been taken in the circumstances.

[23] It follows that in approaching the issues raised by Mr Brown's application on the basis of whether the misconduct established on the evidence would have warranted Mr Brown's summary dismissal at common law, his Honour fell into error. That is a concept with which the Public Sector Employment and Management Act does not concern itself.

[29] As the Full Bench in Brown observed, concepts underpinning summary dismissal, such as conduct amounting to a repudiation of the contract, are not part of the statutory scheme governing public sector employment.


	
	This decision disposes of two of the propositions contended for by the applicant in the present matter, namely:
	



	
	To justify the applicant’s dismissal, his conduct must amount to a repudiation of his employment contract.
	
	
	Common law concepts such as condonation or waiver of the right of summary dismissal for serious breach of the employment contract are relevant to the dismissal of the applicant.
	


Unreasonable or unjust


	
	The criminal conduct engaged in by the applicant was extremely serious. It involved the sexual exploitation and abuse of children. The maximum penalties for these offences reflect their seriousness.
	
	
	Regulation 31 of the TAS Regulation provides that, if a member of the Transport Service is convicted of a serious criminal offence, the Transport Secretary may take disciplinary action with respect to the member. This disciplinary action may include dismissal.
	
	
	In addition there are various Codes of Conduct which apply to employees of RMS. These codes, which are entirely unremarkable in their content, require employees, in addition to other obligations, to:
	



	
	Be aware that the reputation of RMS can be affected by the employee’s actions at work and, in certain circumstances, by conduct outside the workplace.
	
	
	Behave in a lawful manner.
	
	
	Not bring RMS into disrepute by the employee’s actions or conduct.
	
	
	Co-operate with and obey lawful requests, directions or instructions given to the employee in the course of the employment by any person having the authority to do so.
	
	
	Disclose to the employee’s manager or supervisor any charge or conviction, that may impact on the employee’s capacity to carry out his/her duties (e.g. loss of driver licence).
	



	
	In the dismissal letter to the applicant from Mr Evans dated 2 October 2015 the following is stated:
	


It is clear from your conviction that you have not behaved in a lawful manner. The conduct of which you have been convicted is not conduct which is consistent with behaviour expected of the staff of RMS. You did not properly disclose the fact that you had been charged or convicted in the Local Court at the times when these events occurred. Having further considered these matters I have determined it is not appropriate for you to continue as an employee.


	
	With respect to the “failure to disclose” issue, it is not disputed that, on the day of the police raid on his residence the applicant informed his direct manager, Mr Dharan, that the police had searched his house looking for child abuse material and had taken possession of his work computer and work phone. The applicant also provided Mr Dharan with the name and contact details of the responsible police officer.
	
	
	When he was charged on 5 September 2014, the applicant did not inform RMS of the charges but claims that, based on advice he was given by the police, he believed that they would do so. I accept the applicant’s evidence to this effect.
	
	
	On 16 April 2015 the applicant was convicted in the Local Court of two offences. He immediately lodged an appeal to the District Court. The Appeal Listing Notice, which disclosed the two convictions, was copied to RMS via a Parramatta postal address and a fax number. The applicant again claims that he did not think that he also needed to inform RMS as well of the convictions. He also claims that he did not think he needed to inform RMS of the convictions because he had appealed and the criminal process had not concluded. I accept the applicant’s evidence as to these matters.
	
	
	The applicant’s appeal was heard and determined in the District Court on 27 May 2015. On or about 28 May 2015 the applicant informed Ms Kotevski of the outcome of the appeal.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the failure of the applicant to properly disclose the fact that he had been charged or convicted in the Local Court at the times when these events occurred constitutes such a significant breach of the Code of Conduct, of itself, such as to justify the termination of his employment. But that is far from the end of the matter.
	
	
	It is clear that the applicant breached the obligation to behave in a lawful manner. The offences committed by him are extremely serious. In addition, the applicant had devices containing child pornography in his work vehicle. The applicant’s conduct had the potential to bring RMS into disrepute.
	
	
	The serious nature of the offences committed by the applicant is, of itself, sufficient to render his dismissal neither unreasonable nor unjust.
	


Procedural issues


	
	The applicant was not given the opportunity to be heard as to why he should not be dismissed before the dismissal was effected. He should have been.
	
	
	Reliance was placed on the Full Bench decision in Antonakopoulos v State Bank of New South Wales [(1999) 91 IR 385] to support the proposition that a failure to follow appropriate procedures when effecting a dismissal, and in particular a failure to follow procedures in an industrial instrument or established by administrative action can, of itself in an appropriate case, support a finding that a dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. 
	
	
	Regulation 30(2) of the TAS Regulation provides that a staff member who is the subject of disciplinary proceedings may make representations to the person dealing with the alleged behaviour. The applicant was not provided with the opportunity to do this before the decision to dismiss him was made.
	
	
	The Discipline Guidelines applicable to RMS provide that, where there has been a finding of serious misconduct, the relevant Director will issue a Show Cause Notice to the staff member who is considered to have engaged in the serious misconduct. Strictly speaking, this requirement arises upon the finding of serious misconduct following a disciplinary investigation. The guidelines state that a disciplinary investigation may not be required in circumstances where a relevant criminal conviction has been recorded against the staff member, as did occur in the present case. Nevertheless, the normal requirements of procedural fairness would dictate that the applicant be afforded the opportunity to respond to a Show Cause Notice before any decision was made to dismiss him. Section 88(b) of the Act contemplates that the failure to provide the applicant with such an opportunity is a matter which the Commission may take into account in determining the applicant’s claim.
	
	
	However, like Antonakopoulos, this is not a case where the failure to afford the applicant procedural fairness, of itself, supports a finding that the dismissal was unfair. The fact of the applicant’s conduct, which led to his criminal convictions, is not in dispute. There is no suggestion that there was any innocent explanation available which might excuse the applicant’s conduct.
	
	
	The applicant has now had the opportunity to place before this Commission every matter in mitigation which he may have put to the respondent before he was dismissed, had he been provided with that opportunity. Nothing that has been placed before the Commission leads me to conclude that the outcome would have been any different if those matters had been put to the respondent before it decided to dismiss the applicant.
	


Harshness


	
	However, the question that still remains to be addressed is whether or not the applicant’s dismissal was, nevertheless, harsh.
	
	
	The orthodox approach to the assessment of whether or not a dismissal is harsh is set out in the following passages of the Full Bench decision (Walton VP, Haylen J and Bishop C) in Department of Health v Perihan Kaplan ([2010] NSWIRComm 65 (28 May 2010)):
	


[26] One ground relied upon for this challenge was predicated upon a legal proposition that a dismissal which was based upon conduct by an employee, which constituted a breach of a fundamental and essential term of the contract of employment, ""would necessarily not be harsh"". No authority was given in support of that proposition except for an authority which was said to demonstrate that, in the contemporary common law of employment, an implied term may be found in every employment contract that the employee owes the employer a duty not to act in a manner likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence between them: Russell v Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney (2007) 69 NSWLR 198. The appellant's contention would appear to be that a finding of harshness under s 84(1) could not be made in circumstances where an employee had been lawfully dismissed for breach of such a term. It was also suggested that that approach was mandated because the employee's conduct in that context would be a repudiation of the contract.

[27] The difficulty with this approach, as opposed to one which would have the nature of an employee's misconduct weighed against mitigating factors to determine, inter alia, whether a dismissal was harsh, is that it stands in the face of the statutory scheme which requires the Commission to consider whether the dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. There is a long established authority in this Commission and its predecessors, extending at least from the decision of Sheldon J in Re Loty & Holloway v Australian Workers' Union [1971] AR (NSW) 95 at [99] ('Loty'), that the exercise of the Commission's powers in relation to unfair dismissals (now found in Part 6 of Ch 2 of the Act) requires a determination as to whether a dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust, even though ""it was perfectly legal"" (Loty at 99). In Beahan v Bush Boake Allen Australia Pty Ltd (1999) 47 NSWLR 648 at [26], a Full Bench identified that ""as Loty makes clear, the power of the Commission to order reinstatement or the other remedies in the case of an unfair dismissal is exercised regardless of the legal right of an employer to dismiss an employee"". To similar effect, a Full Bench in Little v Commissioner of Police (No 2) (2002) 112 IR 212 at [71] ('Little') stated:

The mere conclusion that a dismissal has been effected in accordance with common law or statutory requirements, or has adequate ""justification"" in the sense of there being proper grounds given for dismissal, does not remove from account in such proceedings a consideration of the severity of punishment and mitigating circumstances where those matters properly arise for consideration upon the material before the Commission. No different approach is to be applied in review proceedings under the Police Service Act.

[28] This conclusion must also follow from the very meaning of the concept of ""harshness"" within s 84(1). The words ""harsh, unreasonable or unjust"" in s 84(1) are ""ordinary non-technical words which are intended to apply to an infinite variety of situations where employment is terminated"": Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd (1995) 185 CLR 410 at [467] (""Byrne""), per McHugh and Gummow JJ, (applying Bostik (Australia) Pty Ltd v Gorgevski (No 2) (1992) 36 FCR 439 at [28]). The appellant's acceptance that the expression 'harsh' would bear the meaning ""disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct"" (see Byrne at [465]), necessarily brings with it the conclusion that a breach of an employment contract or even a repudiation of it will not be determinative of a finding under s 84(1) of the Act as to whether the dismissal was harsh. So, too, does an acceptance (see Byrne at 465) that the personal circumstances of a dismissed employee may be also brought into account.

[29] We would add to the discussion of the meaning of the expression 'harsh' (for the purposes of s 84(1)), our agreement with the Full Bench in Little [at 70] that, in order to illuminate the meaning of the concept of ""harshness"" it is unnecessary to go beyond the statement of Watson J in Metropolitan Meat Industry Board v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union, NSW Branch [1973] AR (NSW) 231 at [233] where his Honour stated as follows:

In some cases, the issue of unfairness has been resolved because of the way in which the employer has exercised his right to dismiss or because of the absence of adequate justification for dismissal. But even if there are grounds for terminating the contract of employment, it is still open to the tribunal to examine the severity or otherwise of the step of dismissal. The Commission, commissioners and committees have so acted in the past and have intervened to order reinstatement where because of mitigating circumstances or past good conduct, termination has been shown to be too harsh a consequence.


	
	In this case the gravity of the misconduct is extreme. It involved the possession of images and videos depicting child abuse material. It involved the use of a carriage service to send indecent material to a person whom the applicant believed to be a fourteen year old girl. The penalties which attach to these offences are significant. The applicant was initially sentenced to nine months imprisonment then, on appeal, to a twelve months suspended sentence. These factors weigh heavily against a finding of harshness.
	
	
	The factors which were put forward on the applicant’s behalf as weighing in favour of a finding of harshness are:
	



	
	The applicant’s 33 years of service with RMS and its predecessors, having worked his way up from starting as an apprentice.
	
	
	The applicant saw himself as continuing to work for RMS until his retirement.
	
	
	The applicant had a good employment record.
	
	
	The applicant was 52 and had worked for RMS for effectively the whole of his working life. He now has a criminal record and will have difficulty finding other employment.
	
	
	The applicant has already been punished for his conduct by the criminal justice system. In addition, he has endured the distress, anxiety and expense associated with the criminal process. He claims that there is no need for RMS to impose an additional punishment for conduct unrelated, or alternatively only slightly and indirectly related, to his employment.
	
	
	The applicant was ashamed and regretful of his conduct. He had expressed remorse by means of his plea of guilty. There was no reason to expect or predict a repeat of his offending conduct.
	
	
	As a result of his conduct and the charges laid against him, prior to his dismissal the applicant had already endured the opprobrium of suspension from his employment for over 12 months. He was required to use up his extensive accrued sick leave, annual leave and long service leave.
	
	
	The RMS’ change of mind, and the fact that the applicant had been told two weeks earlier that he could return to work, provides a particular reason in this instance why the impact of the dismissal was harsh.
	



	
	In weighing all of these factors against the seriousness of the applicant’s conduct which led to his criminal convictions and, ultimately, to his dismissal, I do not find that his dismissal was harsh.
	


Further basis for withholding discretionary relief


	
	There is a further reason why relief should be denied in this matter. I have formed the view that the applicant gave untruthful evidence when he was in the witness box.
	
	
	During the cross-examination of the applicant by Mr Woods, solicitor for the respondent, the following exchanges occurred:
	


WOODS

Q. Mr Hansen, had you had conversations with other identities that you believed to be children prior to 20 May 2012?

A. No.

Q. Electronic conversations?

A. No.

Q. Hayley is the first such style conversation that you had?

A. Yes.

Q. And conversations after that date?

A. No.

……………………

Q. So you’re sure you hadn’t been doing this before?

A. Yes, I’m sure.

Q. And are you saying that you stopped everything that was child abuse and child pornography related from that date?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. But you didn’t do anything to remove that material, did you?

A. No, I didn’t.

Q. And you looked at it from time to time after 20 May 2012?

A. No, I didn’t, I just had the drives there, I hadn’t looked at it.

Q. So you looked at it before 20 May - the material on the drives?

A. Yep.

Q. And you could have been doing that for a couple of years?

A. Possibly, yep.

Q. But you say that you hadn’t been doing it afterwards?

A. No.

Q. You’re sure?

A. Yes, I’m sure.

Q. But you didn’t see any reason to get rid of it, did you?

A. No, I’d actually forgotten about it to be honest.

Q. So you forgot about it, but took it with you to Nyngan the week before the police arrested you?

A. Yes. I knew there was pornography on there. There were hundreds and hundreds of photos on there.

Q. So you’re saying there’s adult pornography?

A. Yes.

Q. And child pornography?

A. Yes.

Q. And child abuse?

A. Yes.

Q. And you took those USBs with you as you travelled so that you could look at them, didn’t you?

A. No.

Q. When you had a bit of quiet time on these trips you could look at those USBs, couldn’t you?

A. No, I never looked at them while I was away with work.

Q. So just be clear, are you asking the commission to believe that from 20 May 2012 you didn’t look at this material at all?

A. That’s correct.

Q. But you kept it all?

A. Yes, I did keep it.

Q. And you took it out of the house?

A. Yes.

Q. And you put it in your office, as you call it?

A. I put it in my personal bag.

Q. In your car?

A. It was--

Q. In your RMS car?

A. Yes.

Q. What you refer to as your office?

A. Yes.

Q. And you took it with you on trips?

A. Yes.

Q. And you’re hoping that the commission will believe you that you did not touch it after 20 May 2012?

A. I did not touch it after May 2012.

Q. You say in your second statement at paragraph 15,

“I packed those two USB sticks in that personal baggage as I didn’t want them in the house while I was away for the week.”

A. Yep.

Q. You weren’t worried about the laptop or the other hard drive, were you?

A. No, I had them with me.

Q. The other hard drive as well?

A. Yes.

Q. So let’s understand this then. When you came home from the Nyngan trip?

A. Yep.

Q. You took the laptop into your house?

A. Yep.

Q. You took the hard drive into the house?

A. Which was in the bag. I also took the work computer into the house.

Q. And you left these other two USB sticks in the car?

A. I left my - I left my bag in the car, yes.

Q. Containing those sticks?

A. Yes.

Q. So you take everything with you when you go on trips, all your pornography?

A. I don’t take all my pornography with me.

Q. So was it just this trip that you took the extra hard drive?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. And are you saying you looked at none of those - none of the material on the USBs or the hard drive while you were away?

A. Nothing. I looked at nothing on it.

Q. Sure it’s not just there for the purpose of you to have a bit of - if you feel like it, to have a look?

A. No.

Q. And when you go on any of these trips have you looked at your pornography collection?

A. No.

Q. So are you saying that from 20 May 2012 you’re a changed man?

A. Yes. Virtually, yes.

Q. And you carry all of this material around with you?

A. Yes. I should have destroyed it, but I didn’t.

Q. I put it to you, Mr Hansen, that that’s just a lie?

A. No, it’s not.

(T 2/3/16 pp. 44-47)


	
	In summary, under cross examination the applicant claimed that, since 20 May 2012, he had not looked at the material stored on his devices, including the Cruzer 2 GB drive and the Imation 8 GB USB drive, which occasionally accompanied him in his work vehicle on work trips. Counsel for the applicant, relying on what he called in a shorthand way the “Briginshaw standard”, submitted that the Commission was not in any position, on the evidence, to make a finding about the applicant looking at that material or the use of that material that goes beyond what was admitted for the purposes of the convictions. As I understand the submission, the approach of the High Court to the assessment of the probative value of evidence as disclosed in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [(1938) 60 CLR 336] would prevent the Commission from making a finding that, during the period between 20 May 2012 and 4 August 2014, when he was visited by the police, the applicant did not look at the child pornography which he had collected and stored on the devices which were seized by the police. I disagree.
	
	
	It is worth revisiting Briginshaw to consider just what was there being considered by the High Court. Briginshaw was an appeal from the Supreme Court of Victoria (Martin J) by the petitioner, Mr Briginshaw against the dismissal of his petition for divorce from the respondent, Mrs Briginshaw, on the grounds that she had committed an act of adultery with third party, the co-respondent. Both the respondent and the co-respondent denied that they had committed adultery. There was no direct evidence that they had.
	
	
	The “inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences”, which Dixon J was considering on the question of whether or not an act of adultery had occurred, comprised:
	



	
	Evidence from the petitioner’s sister that the co-respondent, had admitted to her that he had sexual intercourse with the respondent. The co-respondent denied making this admission.
	
	
	Evidence from an inquiry agent of a similar admission made to him by the co-respondent in the presence of the petitioner’s sister. The co-respondent refused to sign any statement and also denied making this admission, although his own evidence left the impression that his refusal to make a full admission, preferably in writing, was accompanied by no firm or explicit denial of the fact.
	
	
	Evidence that, when the respondent was interrogated about her relations with other men by the inquiry agent, in the presence of the petitioner, no “indignant remonstrance” was evoked from her.
	
	
	Evidence that, when the respondent was told by the inquiry agent of the co-respondent’s admissions, she, according to petitioner, replied that, if the co-respondent had admitted it, she would. According to the inquiry agent, her reply was that, if the co-respondent had stated it, she would make a statement. The respondent denied these versions of events.
	
	
	Evidence from the inquiry agent that he had overheard a conversation between the respondent and the co-respondent in which the latter was alleged to have said that “he had told them the truth”. The respondent’s evidence was that she told the co-respondent that she was sorry that she had got him “into the mess” and that they said he had admitted adultery, which he denied.
	
	
	Evidence by an independent witness of an admission of adultery made by the co-respondent which was denied by the co-respondent and another independent witness who had been present when the admission was said to have been made.
	


This was the character and quality of the evidence which led Dixon J to express the words of caution which he did, and which have been quoted so many times since.


	
	In the present case, the matters which tell against acceptance of the applicant’s claim that he had not looked at the child pornography stored on his devices since 20 May 2012 are:
	



	
	On 20 May 2012, the applicant thought he was communicating with, and sending indecent material to, a 14 year old girl. He did not become aware for another two years and three months that the other party was, in fact, a police officer. The applicant offered no explanation as to why, from that particular date, he suddenly stopped watching the child pornography which he had collected and stored on his devices up to that point.
	
	
	The child pornography remained stored on the applicant’s devices in his residence throughout this period when, if he really wasn’t using it for his own gratification, he could have easily disposed of it. He was not able to offer any explanation as to why he did not.
	
	
	The applicant’s claim that he occasionally took some of the drives with him in his work vehicle on work trips, but didn’t look at the child pornography stored on them, simply beggars belief.
	



	
	Further to this, the demeanour of the applicant when giving the testimony quoted at paragraph 104 above supported a conclusion that he was being evasive, untruthful and only prepared to admit to that for which there was direct and irrefutable evidence. To borrow again from Dixon J the “inherent unlikelihood” of the applicant’s story on this issue being true tells against acceptance of it by the Commission.
	
	
	I am unable to accept the applicant’s evidence that he did not, since 20 May 2012, look at the child pornography stored on his devices, some of which accompanied him on work trips in his work vehicle. The glaring improbability of this evidence being must lead to its rejection.
	
	
	Whilst the giving of untruthful evidence may not, of itself, be a sufficient basis in every case for the Commission to withhold discretionary relief, in the present matter, given the nature of the dishonesty displayed by the applicant towards the Commission, I would be disinclined to exercise my discretion in favour of the applicant even if I was persuaded that, in some way, his dismissal was unfair.
	
	
	I am not so persuaded.
	
	
	The application before the Commission for relief in relation to unfair dismissal is dismissed.
	
	
	I so order.

2769080,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 40) [2016] NSWSC 389,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	Numerous references have been made in the course of the evidence of this trial about the deceased allegedly being a member of a Triad gang. The proposition has been put by Ms Shead, who appears on behalf of McNamara to a number of witnesses. The vast majority of them have either expressly disagreed with the proposition, or disavowed any knowledge of it.
	
	
	As I understand it, the accused McNamara will give evidence that the deceased in fact told him that he was a member of a Triad gang. This evidence will be relied upon, amongst other things, as evidence going to various fears that the accused is said to have held.
	
	
	It is against that background that Ms Shead has sought to tender four separate documents which are MFIs 130, 131, 147 and 148 on the present application.
	
	
	MFIs 130 and 131 are copies of photographs found on one of the deceased's phones. Although the images are not completely clear, they depict quantities of drugs, quantities of cash, a person constrained in some type of body bag, a pistol and a box containing weapons. There is also an image of a bloodied hand.
	
	
	MFI 147 is another series of images taken from the deceased's phone. There is an image of a person wearing a T-shirt bearing the words ""Lok Boys"". There are then two photographs of a group of persons, the members of whom cannot be identified, and one of whom appears to be carrying a machine gun.
	
	
	MFI 148 is a series of screen shots downloaded from the deceased's phone onto his computer. The screen shots relate to an incident, the date of which is not specified, which is said to have occurred in Chinatown in Sydney and which was described as ""a violent clash between a group of door men and up to 20 Asian males"". The article makes reference to injuries sustained by persons in that incident. It also makes reference to Triad based crime gangs.
	
	
	Ms Shead has submitted that this evidence is relevant in order to corroborate what is expected to be McNamara's assertion that the deceased told him that he was a member of a Triad gang. She submitted that when viewed as a whole the nature of the images was such as to reflect more than a passing interest in gang activities. Ms Shead also submitted that in the event that it was put to McNamara that he had fabricated evidence of what the deceased is said to have told him about his (i.e. the deceased’s) gang involvement, the evidence would be relied upon to rebut that assertion.
	
	
	The Crown objected to the evidence, as did Mr Thomas. Both the Crown and Mr Thomas pointed to the fact that there was no evidence, to establish how or when the images made their way to the deceased's phone and computer respectively, nor was there any evidence of how long they had been there.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the evidence is relevant according to the test set out in s. 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”), although the relevant is marginal at best. In the circumstances, and for a number of reasons, I have come to the view that the evidence should be excluded under s. 135.
	
	
	Firstly, as both the Crown and Mr Thomas submitted, there is no evidence as to the circumstances in which any of the images found their way to the deceased’s phone and computer. As I observed in the course of argument, in this day and age of advanced technology it is not uncommon for unsolicited material to be received by one person from another. Mere receipt, and even storage, of material received in that way does not necessarily evidence even an interest, let alone an involvement, in the subject matter.
	
	
	Secondly, and as I have observed, the images themselves are of poor quality and unclear.
	
	
	Those factors, in my view, combine to give rise to a situation where whatever limited probative value the evidence might have is substantially outweighed by the danger that it could be misleading or confusing. For those reasons the evidence will be excluded at this stage.
	
	
	However, as I have noted in the course of giving these reasons, one of the bases upon which Ms Shead argued that the evidence should be admitted was that it may be relevant to rebut a particular suggestion that may be put to McNamara in the course of cross-examination. As I pointed out to Ms Shead, if that situation arises, and subject to any other relevant considerations that might also arise in the meantime, it may be open to her to seek to lead the evidence in re-examination. It would be premature to determine that issue at this stage, given that the proposition upon which it depends has not been put. Accordingly, I will leave this question open. Ms Shead may choose to re-visit it if and when circumstances render it appropriate to do so.
	
	
	For the time being the evidence is excluded.

		15 June 2016",2016-03-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769085,Safe Work NSW v Wollongong Glass P/L [2016] NSWDC 58,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Wollongong Glass Pty Ltd (the defendant) pleaded not guilty to a charge that as a person who had a health and safety duty under section 19(1) Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act), it failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Matthew Johns (the deceased), an employee of the defendant, to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.
	
	
	At about 2.30pm on 6 March 2013 at the defendant’s premises (the factory), the deceased was assisting another employee Mr Pham to lean a number of glass sheets stacked on an A-frame trolley forward to allow Mr Pham to remove one of the sheets stored behind them. The glass sheets were 2306mm high by 2100mm wide and weighed approximately 80kg each. The procedure adopted by the deceased and Mr Pham was for Mr Pham to lean the sheets towards the deceased and for the deceased to support them with his hands. It was intended that when Mr Pham could access the required sheet, that he would attach a pinch grab to it and remove it to another A-frame trolley by the use of an overhead travelling crane (the crane). The weight of the glass sheets became too much for the deceased to support and they fell causing him fatal head injuries.
	
	
	At the time the deceased was under the influence of cannabis to the extent that in the opinion of Dr Judith Perl, a consultant pharmacologist, the deceased’s perceptions, judgement, decision making processes, vigilance, appreciation of dangers, concentration and reaction times were significantly impaired.
	
	
	The issues to be determined are;
	



	
	Did the defendant fail to comply with its health and safety duty by failing to take the steps particularised in [6] of the Summons?
	
	
	Did the defendant’s breach of duty expose the deceased to a risk of death or serious injury?
	


Preliminary point


	
	At the conclusion of final submissions, the prosecutor asked me to refer a number of questions of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to section 5AE Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	After hearing further argument on this point, the parties agreed:
	



	
	on the elements of the offence;
	
	
	that the proper formulation of some of the proposed questions of law depended on the factual findings that I would be required to make; and
	
	
	that it was appropriate for me to state the law in my judgment and to make the necessary findings of fact, on the basis that I would hand down judgment but not enter final orders until I had given the prosecutor the opportunity to renew its application, if it chose to do so.
	


The elements of the offence


	
	The prosecution bears the onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the offence.
	
	
	Section 32 of the Act provides:
	


A person commits a Category 2 offence if:


	
	the person has a health and safety duty, and
	
	
	the person fails to comply with that duty, and
	
	
	the failure exposes an individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness.
	



	
	It was agreed that the elements of the offence are:
	
	
	Element 1   The defendant was conducting a business or undertaking;
	
	
	Element 2   The defendant owed a health and safety duty to ensure, so far as was reasonably practicable, the health and safety of;
	



	
	workers engaged by it;
	
	
	(ii)    while the workers were at work in the business or undertaking;
	



	
	Element 3   The defendant failed to comply with its health and safety duty; and
	
	
	Element 4   The failure exposed an individual to a risk of death or serious injury.
	
	
	The defendant conceded that Elements 1 and 2 were established.
	


The relevant law


	
	The offence is one of strict liability: section 12A of the Act.
	
	
	The content of the duty is set out in section 19 of the Act that relevantly provides:
	



	
	A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of:
	



	
	workers engaged, or caused to be engaged by the person, and
	
	
	workers whose activities in carrying out work are influenced or directed by the person,
	


while the workers are at work in the business or undertaking.


	
	A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the health and safety of other persons is not put at risk from work carried out as part of the conduct of the business or undertaking.
	
	
	Without limiting subsections (1) and (2), a person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable:
	



	
	the provision and maintenance of a work environment without risks to health and safety, and
	
	
	the provision and maintenance of safe systems of work, and
	
	
	…
	
	
	(f)   the provision of any information, training, instruction or supervision that is necessary to protect all persons from risks to their health and safety arising from work carried out as part of the conduct of the business or undertaking, and
	
	
	(g)   that the health of workers and the conditions at the workplace are monitored for the purpose of preventing illness or injury of workers arising from the conduct of the business or undertaking.
	



	
	The inclusive list of specific obligations set out in section 19(3) of the Act have each been identified at common law.
	
	
	The prosecution bears the onus of proving as an element of the offence that at the time of the offence that it was reasonably practical to ensure the health and safety of the persons alleged to be at risk. The risk should be identified with sufficient precision to determine if it was reasonably practical to eliminate the risk, or if not, if it was reasonably practical to minimise it. In this way the application of reasonable practicability may arise more than once. [1] 
	
	
	“Reasonably practicable” is defined in section 18 of the Act. The Court must take into account and weigh up all relevant matters including;
	



	
	the likelihood of the risk concerned occurring, and
	
	
	the degree of harm that might result from the risk, and
	
	
	what the defendant knows or ought reasonably to know about;
	



	
	the risk, and
	
	
	ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, and
	



	
	the availability and suitability of ways to eliminate or minimise the risk, and
	
	
	after assessing the extent of the risk and the available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, the cost associated with either of those options is grossly disproportionate to the risk.
	



	
	The state of knowledge applied to the definition of practicable is objective. It is that possessed by persons generally who are engaged in the relevant field of activity and not by reference to the actual knowledge of a specific defendant in particular circumstances: Laing O’Rourke (BMC) Pty Ltd v Kirwin [2011] WASCA 117 at [33].
	
	
	The reasonably practicable requirement applies to matters which are within the power of the defendant to control, supervise and manage: Slivak v Lurgi (Aust) Pty Ltd (2001) 205 CLR 304 at [37] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ.
	
	
	The word “risk” is not defined in the Act. Risk should not be interpreted in a complicated fashion. Safety cannot be ensured if a risk is present. The presence of a risk to the health or safety of a worker constitutes a breach of section 19 of the Act. It is not necessary that there be a particular accident, or that a person is actually injured. What is required is the creation of the risk. The relevant risk for the commission of the section 32 offence is a risk of death or serious injury.
	
	
	An incident causing injury may be evidence of the presence of a risk and may be relevant to sentencing as a measure of the severity of the harm suffered as a result of the risk. But a distinction must be drawn between the specific risk that manifested in the incident and the general class of risk that the analysis must focus on. Paying too close attention to the specific risk resulting in an incident can lead to error: Tangerine Confectionery Ltd and Veolia ES (UK) Ltd v R [2011] EWCA Crim 2015.
	
	
	The phrase “exposed to risks” contained in section 8(2) Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 was interpreted to mean that a person was sufficiently proximate to the source of a risk for the risk to come home, irrespective of the mechanism by which that could happen: Thiess Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales (2010) 78 NSWLR 94.
	
	
	The section 19 duty requires knowledge of the risk emanating from the activities of the defendant: Slivak v Lurgi (Aust) Pty Ltd (2001) 205 CLR 304. Foreseeability of the risk to persons from the activity is an element of this question of knowledge. It would not generally be practicable to take measures to guard against a risk to safety that was not reasonably foreseeable: Genner Constructions Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales [2001] NSWIRComm 267 at [68].
	
	
	The statutory duty is not limited to simply preventing foreseeable risks of injury. The duty is to protect against all risks, if that is reasonably practicable. Reasonably practicable means something narrower than physically possible or feasible: Slivak at [53] per Gaudron J.
	
	
	The words reasonably practicable indicate that the duty does not require a defendant to take every possible step that could be taken. The steps to be taken in performance of the duty are those that are reasonably practicable for the employer to achieve the provision of and maintenance of a safe working environment. Bare demonstration that a step might have had some effect on the safety of a working environment, does not without more demonstrate a breach of the duty: Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v R (2012) 246 CLR 92 at [15] and [38] per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ.
	
	
	An employer must have a proactive approach to safety issues. The question is not did the employer envisage a particular danger, but rather should it have: WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v Kellogg (Aust) Pty Ltd [1999] NSWIRComm 453.
	
	
	A defendant must have regard not only for the ideal worker but for one who is careless, inattentive or inadvertent: Dunlop Rubber Australia Ltd v Buckley (1952) 87 CLR 313 at 320 per Dixon CJ. If there is a foreseeable risk of injury arising from the employee’s negligence in carrying out his or her duties then this is a factor which the employer must take into account: Smith v Broken Hill Pty Ltd (1957) 97 CLR 337 at 343. It may not always be possible to foresee various acts of inadvertence by workers but defendants must conduct operations on the basis that such acts will occur and they must be guarded against to the fullest extent practicable.
	
	
	The unforeseeable behaviour of a disobedient employee may well lead to the happening of an event that could not be reasonably foreseen and therefore was not reasonably practical to guard against: WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd (2004) 135 IR 166 at [129].
	
	
	In some cases, it will not be practicable to guard against a detriment to safety occasioned by an appropriately trained and instructed employee departing from a known safe procedure. There are limits to the degree of instruction which can be expected to be provided to an experienced employee: Genner Constructions at [68].
	
	
	Where an employer is found to have laid down a safe and proper practice and there is no evidence that the employer failed to use due diligence to see that the practice is observed, then a casual failure by inferior employees, even if of supervisory rank, to observe that practice on a particular occasion will not render the employer criminally liable for a failure to ensure safety: Collins v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (1986) 5 NSWLR 209 at 215E.
	
	
	The relevant question on causation is whether the act or omission of the defendant was a significant or substantial cause of the deceased being exposed to the risk of injury: Bulga Underground Operations v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37 at [127].
	
	
	The question is to be determined by the application of commonsense to the facts, bearing in mind that the purpose of the inquiry is to attribute legal responsibility in a criminal matter: Royall v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 378.
	
	
	Regard must be had to the scope and objects of the Act: Simpson Design and Associates Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2011] NSWCA 316 at [79]-[102]. The relevant question is not whether the particularised failures of the defendant was the cause of the death of the deceased, but rather whether there was a causal relationship between the act or omission and the risk to which he was exposed: Bulga Underground at [130].
	


The risk particularised


	
	The prosecution particularised the risk in [5] of the Summons as:
	


The risk was the risk of glass sheets falling and crushing persons whilst those persons were attempting to remove one or more of the glass sheets stacked in an ‘A-frame’ trolley.


	
	Inherent in the risk identified was that the glass sheets needed to be of a size and/or weight that were capable of causing a crush injury. The evidence demonstrated that not every piece of glass handled or lifted in the factory presented the risk of a crush injury. [2] 
	
	
	The storage of glass sheets on their edges in A-frames presented an obvious risk of a crush injury if a worker was physically present in front of the glass sheets when they were being lifted or handled, ie in the fall zone. It was necessary for the defendant to eliminate or, if that was not possible, minimise that risk by taking reasonably practical steps to prevent workers from being present in the fall zone while lifting or handling glass sheets, including during the loading or unloading of delivery vehicles. Simply put, the workers needed to be instructed when lifting or handling glass sheets capable of causing a crush injury, not to stand in the fall zone.
	
	
	These were the matters that had been identified by the prosecutor in the Glass and Glass Product Manufacturing Compliance Project undertaken by it in 2012 (the Glass Project). The crush injury risk was particularly relevant to the defendant’s business because the defendant purchased and received from manufacturers and importers large glass sheets, that were cut down to various sizes at the factory to create end products including, window panes, glass doors, splashbacks and shower screens.
	
	
	These risks were the subject of a visit by Inspector Stothard on 19 December 2012 as part of the Glass Project.
	
	
	The prosecution opened its case with the contention that the way glass was moved in the factory was left to the discretion of individual workers based on their experience and that one of the methods adopted was to lean sheets of glass onto a worker in the manner involved in the incident. The prosecution anticipated that the evidence of Mr Foye, Mr Heaton and Mr Spencer, former employees of the defendant would establish the use of that method.
	


The incident

Mr Pham’s evidence


	
	Mr Pham was the only witness to the incident. He was a careful and thoughtful witness who appeared to be doing his best to tell the truth. Some of his evidence was imprecise, but that was because English was not his first language and his difficulty with communication in English was apparent when he gave evidence. By reason of both the content of his evidence and his demeanour I am satisfied that Mr Pham’s evidence should be accepted. I am satisfied that the incident occurred as described by Mr Pham and his evidence can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	On 6 March 2013, Mr Pham was employed by the defendant as a laminate cutter, with approximately 6-7 years’ experience in this role. His normal hours of work were from 7am to 3.30pm, Monday to Friday.
	
	
	Mr Pham had 20 years’ experience in the glass industry; having worked for Mant Glass and Graphic Glass prior to working for the defendant. He had received on the job training as to how to safely handle glass in that period.
	
	
	Mr Pham was cutting glass sheets for an order which was required to be loaded onto a truck that day for delivery to a customer the following morning (the order). He had been asked by Mr Chamoun, the owner of the defendant, if he had started cutting the glass sheets required for the order that morning shortly after starting work. At that time he told Mr Chamoun that he would start cutting the order shortly. I infer that he had been working on cutting the glass sheets for the order, progressively throughout the day. It was suggested by the prosecution that Mr Pham was under time pressure to complete the order so that it could be loaded onto the truck. Mr Pham did not adopt that suggestion in the course of his evidence and I am not satisfied that there was any urgency required on the part of Mr Pham.
	
	
	At about 2.30pm, in order to complete the order he required access to a glass sheet which was stacked on an A-Frame trolley behind other glass sheets, because the customer had revised the original dimensions required. Mr Pham was in the process of using the crane, which was fitted with a pinch grab to move the glass sheets stacked in front of the required glass sheet onto a second A-frame trolley in order to allow him access to the required glass sheet that he needed to cut.
	
	
	There were three overhead travelling cranes in the premises; two on the cutting side of the factory, where Mr Pham worked and one on the other side. Each crane was fitted with a pinch grab. On the day of the incident one of the pinch grabs was not working with the result that only one crane was available for use on the cutting side of the factory.
	
	
	The deceased also worked on the cutting side of the factory as a float glass cutter, with his supervisor, Mr Mastroianni.
	
	
	The deceased approached Mr Pham and asked to use the crane that Mr Pham was using. Mr Pham told the deceased to wait for five minutes because he only had one more glass sheet to cut to complete his order. The deceased said to Mr Pham, “No. I need it” referring to the crane. Mr Pham’s experience of the deceased was that “he was always in a rush”. The deceased said to Mr Pham, “I will give you a hand”. To which Mr Pham replied, “No”. The deceased then said (in Mr Pham’s words), “I give you a hand to hold your glass for you”. To which Mr Pham replied, “We need more people”. The deceased then said, “No, no, no we can do it. I’m okay I can do it”. Mr Pham replied, “You need more people” and called out “Ralph”, trying to get the attention of his supervisor, Mr Mastroianni.
	
	
	The deceased placed his right leg between the bars of the A-frame trolley [3]  so that his right foot was on the factory floor and held up one or two hands at about a 45 degree angle from his shoulders. Mr Pham flipped over a glass sheet with his left hand away from the centre of the A-frame trolley leaving it to rest on the hands of the deceased. Mr Pham also held out his right hand, in which he held the crane controller, so that the controller touched the glass panels in an effort to assist the deceased in supporting the glass. From this description, I infer that Mr Pham was supporting a very small amount of the weight of the glass sheet.
	
	
	After Mr Pham flipped the first glass sheet onto the deceased, he told the deceased, “We need more people”, to which the deceased replied “I’m okay”. Mr Pham continued to call out “Ralph” on a number of occasions. Mr Pham gave evidence that he did so because he knew that they needed more men, because the glass was too heavy.
	
	
	Mr Pham then flipped the second glass sheet in the same manner and it was supported by the deceased and partially by Mr Pham with the crane controller in his right hand. After the second glass sheet was flipped, Mr Pham continued to call out “Ralph”.
	
	
	Mr Pham then flipped the third and fourth glass sheet towards the deceased in the same manner. Mr Pham continued to call out to Ralph because he thought he needed help.
	
	
	The deceased complained to Mr Pham that the glass was becoming too heavy and Mr Pham told him to run. The deceased still had his foot through the bottom of the A-frame trolley. The glass sheets that the deceased had been supporting fell onto him.
	
	
	A number of employees, including Mr Mastroianni, came and assisted in removing glass from the deceased.
	
	
	When Mr Pham was asked why he did not refuse the offer of assistance from the deceased, he said, “I’m not his supervisor, so I can’t stop him”.
	
	
	Mr Pham gave evidence that prior to the date of the incident he had never moved glass by leaning it against another person who was standing in front of the glass, and had never seen other employees adopt such a practice. If the glass was less than about 750mm high (a height Mr Pham described as “shorter than my belly”), glass could be flipped on an A-Frame trolley by two people with one person at either end of the glass panel.
	
	
	Mr Pham had not tried to move glass previously by way of the procedure adopted on day of the incident was because it was unsafe and he usually worked alone. Mr Pham gave evidence that the reasons he said “no” to the deceased on the day of the incident was because he knew the procedure being adopted was unsafe. At the time of the incident Mr Pham described the deceased as impatient and he gave evidence that he had agreed to do what the deceased suggested, so as not to upset him.
	


Other evidence relating to the presentation of the deceased on the day of the incident


	
	On the morning of the incident the deceased assisted Mr Clarke, the production planner, to load a truck. The deceased told Mr Clarke that he had a headache and that he intended to go out at lunchtime to buy some painkillers. Mr Clarke gave evidence that the deceased seemed agitated at the time when they worked together.
	
	
	On autopsy, a sample of the deceased’s femoral blood was collected and a quantitative toxicology analysis was performed. Those test results were referred to Dr Perl, who was asked to provide an opinion to the prosecutor as to their significance. On 23 September 2015 Dr Perl provided a report to the prosecutor [4]  that contained the following salient points:
	



	
	the deceased’s femoral blood contained delta-9-tetrahyrdrocannibinol (THC) which is considered to be the major psychoactive drug in cannabis;
	
	
	in 2013 there were no legal substances or medications containing THC available in Australia;
	
	
	the presence of THC indicated that the deceased had used cannabis, probably by smoking it;
	
	
	the concentration of the THC indicated that it was probable that the deceased had smoked the cannabis within one hour of his death; and
	
	
	the deceased’s cannabis use would have impaired his ability to safely undertake the task of moving glass sheets.
	



	
	Dr Perl concluded her report with the observations set out in paragraph 3 above which I will not repeat. Dr Perl was not required for cross-examination.
	


Did the defendant fail to comply with its health and safety duty by failing to take the steps particularised in [6] of the Summons? (Element 3)


	
	The prosecutor is required to demonstrate the particular measures that should have been taken to prevent the risk identified: Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v Workcover Authority (NSW) (2010) 239 CLR 531 at [37].
	
	
	In order to find the defendant guilty of the offence I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it failed to comply with its health and safety duty in that it failed to take the reasonably practicable steps set out in the particulars of breach in 6(a)-(e) of the Summons.
	
	
	The alleged failures were not pleaded in the alternative. What was alleged by the prosecution was that the defendant failed to ensure safety by not taking all of the steps referred to. On that basis if the prosecution failed to prove that any one of the alleged failures was reasonably practicable, then the defendant was entitled to an acquittal. This view of the pleading was raised after I invited the parties to make submissions on Bulga Underground. In response the prosecution sought leave to amend the summons to plead that the defendant failed to take “one or more” of the relevant steps. The defendant has not had the opportunity to make submissions on the amendment application. My preliminary view is that the case was conducted on the basis that the proof of one of the failures was sufficient to ground a conviction. However, it is inappropriate to decide the amendment application without hearing from the defendant.
	
	
	It was common ground that the defendant had in place a system of work at the date of the incident. It was not reduced to writing. It was implemented through verbal direction and on the job training and enforced by supervision. There were mechanical means available to workers for use in handling and lifting glass sheets, ie the crane.
	
	
	The prosecution case is that the defendant’s system of work was inadequate in the respects particularised in [6] of the Summons. In submissions, the prosecutor described the defendant’s system of work as “informal”, “ad hoc” and involving the exercise of a worker’s discretion, based on their experience, to determine how to move a piece of glass.
	
	
	The prosecution submits that the particulars of breach set out in 6(a)-(d) were reasonably practicable because they were adopted in writing by the defendant in the Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) on 14 March 2013. The adoption of a written SWMS seemed to be an integral part of the prosecution case, notwithstanding that such a measure was not specifically pleaded.
	
	
	I will now turn to deal with each of the particulars of breach.
	


6(a)   Ensuring the use of an overhead crane and pinch grab to lift, carry or move any glass sheets so heavy enough that they were likely to cause risk of injury.

6(d)   Informing and training workers in the relevant prescribed size and thickness of those glass sheets which necessitate the use of an overhead crane and a pinch grab in order to safely lift, carry or move them.


	
	These particulars can be conveniently dealt with together.
	
	
	The deceased was employed on 8 November 2012. He told Mr Dileo in his interview that he had worked at High Tech Aluminium (HTA) and had experience in the glass industry. HTA was a local business operated by members of the deceased’s family. It manufactured aluminium glass windows and doors. It received pieces of glass cut to size for installation in window and door frames. The deceased worked in the assembly of windows and doors. Mr Dileo could not recall how long the deceased told him that he worked for HTA, but he believed the deceased undertook his apprenticeship with HTA.
	
	
	The defendant held toolbox talks at which safety matters were discussed. These were conducted by Mr Dileo, the factory manager, between July 2011 and December 2012 about once per fortnight. Mr Dileo instructed the workers as to the approximate weights of glass sheets according to their size and thickness, that panels of up to 30kg could be lifted by one person or 60kg by two persons and that panels that were too large or heavy were not to be lifted manually.
	
	
	Mr Spencer gave evidence that from his experience, a glass sheet that could be safely manually lifted by two people was no bigger than 2.4m long by 1.2m high. His experience was consistent with his observations of the workers at the factory.
	
	
	Cranes were used in the factory to lift large and/or heavy sheets of glass. There were three cranes installed in the factory. Mr Pham usually worked alone and would often refuse to move glass manually.
	
	
	The defendant’s practice was to place new workers with more experienced workers to receive on the job training in the defendant’s system and to be shown how to perform tasks safely (the buddy system). Inspector McDonald agreed that the buddy system was an accepted method of training and that persons could be considered “competent” within the meaning of clause 5 Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 (the Regulations) as a result of receiving on the job training.
	
	
	Mr Chamoun told Inspector McDonald in an interview on the day of the incident that it was the usual practice of the defendant to use the buddy system to show new workers how to lift and manoeuvre glass.
	
	
	Mr Dileo gave evidence that Mr Smith was allocated as the deceased’s buddy. At the end of the evidence the prosecution tendered the personnel file of Mr Smith that demonstrated he was terminated on 9 November 2012, the day after the deceased was employed. The contents of the file corroborate Mr Dileo’s recollection to the extent that the deceased and Mr Smith were working together on the day Mr Smith was terminated.
	
	
	Mr Foot, the factory manager from January 2013 onwards, said that the training of new workers usually involved providing them with safety gear, a tour of the factory and then placing them with an experienced worker. Mr Foot could not recall the identity of the deceased’s buddy.
	
	
	In submissions the prosecution questioned the experience of the deceased at the time that he began working for the defendant and whether or not he had a buddy after 9 November 2012. There were gaps in the evidence on these topics. The prosecutor had the power to investigate these matters [5] , but did not do so. The prosecution could have called evidence from the operators of HTA about his experience at the end of his employment with HTA, but did not do so. I am not permitted to speculate about the evidence or draw inferences to fill in gaps in the prosecution case.
	
	
	The lacuna in the evidence was insufficient for me to conclude that the defendant departed from its usual practice when it came to training the deceased. I am satisfied that even if he was not present at the training provided by Mr Dileo that the deceased received training through the buddy system in how to determine if a glass sheet could be safely lifted or moved manually.
	
	
	In any event from about February 2013, the deceased worked closely with Mr Mastroianni. They both worked in the factory cutting float glass in a dedicated area. Mr Mastrioanni had studied occupational health and safety modules at TAFE as part of his apprenticeship. He was experienced in the glass industry and was employed as a supervisor at the time of the incident.
	
	
	I infer that Mr Mastrioanni had considerable opportunity to supervise the deceased performing his everyday work. The deceased was considered to be a safe worker based on the observations of him by the supervisors, Mr Dileo, Mr Foot and Mr Mastrioanni.
	
	
	There was no evidence that before the incident workers were required to manually lift or handle glass sheets that were of such as size or weight that constituted a risk of injury, or in fact that they did so.
	
	
	At the time of the incident, Mr Pham knew that the safe way to access the required glass sheet was to use the crane to transfer the obstructing glass sheets to another A-frame trolley. He was involved in that process when approached by the deceased. He knew that the way that the deceased approached the task was unsafe, because the glass was too heavy and the procedure involved the deceased standing in the fall zone. He said no to the deceased on a number of occasions and he sought to dissuade the deceased from the procedure. He called out to the supervisor on multiple occasions to get help and/or I infer to have the supervisor intervene.
	
	
	Mr Pham’s participation was necessary for the incident to occur. He failed to use the crane to lift and move the glass sheets that presented the risk of a crush injury, but he knew that the crane was required. He had commenced the work with that state of mind and sought to convince the deceased to allow him to continue using the crane.
	
	
	The prosecution relies on section 244(1) of the Act to argue that Mr Pham’s failure to use the crane was the conduct of the defendant, and that this conduct was thereby condoned by the defendant. [6]  Section 244(1) provides:
	


For the purposes of this Act, any conduct engaged in or on behalf of a body corporate by an employee, agent or officer of the body corporate acting within the actual or apparent scope of his or her employment, or within his or her actual or apparent authority, is conduct also engaged in by the body corporate.


	
	Section 244(1) is a deeming provision that has the effect of facilitating proof of the responsibility of a corporation and it is designed to attribute conduct to the corporation for which it would not otherwise be responsible: Walplan Pty Ltd v Wallace (1985) 8 FCR 27 at 38 per Lockhart J. In order to invoke the deeming provision the employee engaging in conduct must be acting within the actual or apparent scope of his or her employment.
	
	
	It was common ground that Mr Pham was not a supervisor and had no responsibility for training other workers. Accordingly, the prosecution cannot establish that it was within the apparent or actual scope of his employment to prohibit, warn, direct, train or supervise the defendant’s workers as contemplated by the particulars of breach in sub-paragraphs 6(b)-(e) of the Summons.
	
	
	As to sub-paragraph 6(a) of the Summons, Mr Pham was not acting within the scope of his employment when he failed to use the crane because he knew what he was doing was unsafe and thereby he exposed the deceased to a very grave risk. Mr Pham’s actions were not in accordance with his training and experience, they were inconsistent the duty imposed on him by section 28 of the Act and the express terms of his employment.
	
	
	In February 2013, the defendant had its employees, including Mr Pham sign a document entitled “Wollongong Glass Policies – February 2013”. That document provided at [14] under the heading “Occupational Health & Safety:
	


It is the responsibility of each employee to;


	
	Take reasonable care of the health and safety of others in the workplace;
	
	
	Co-operate with the employer in their efforts to comply with OHS requirements such as following procedures and participating in hazard identification and reporting.
	
	
	Use equipment properly in order to provide for the health and safety of other people in the workplace.
	


Serious breaches in the OHS procedures may result in instant dismissal.


	
	The use of the crane by Mr Pham in order to provide for the health and safety of the deceased was at the time of the incident was an express term of Mr Pham’s employment and carried with it the threat of dismissal if it was not complied with.
	
	
	For these reasons, I am satisfied that Mr Pham was not acting within the scope of his employment and accordingly the deeming provision does not operate.
	
	
	The requirement to use equipment properly also applied to the deceased.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the defendant’s system of work ensured by adequate training that was enforced by supervision, that the crane was used in the factory on pieces of glass that could not be manually lifted by two people, being panels weighing more than 60kg or bigger than 2.4m long by 1.2m high.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the defendant’s system of work provided training to its workers on the weight of a glass sheet by reference to its dimensions.
	
	
	It was not reasonably practicable for the defendant to provide the training required by sub-paragraphs 6(a) and 6(d) in a written SWMS for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, a SWMS is only required by the regulations for “high risk construction work”, which the work in the factory was not: clause 299 of the Regulations.
	
	
	Second, a person is competent within the meaning of clause 3 of the Regulations if they have acquired the knowledge and skills to carry out a task through training, qualification or experience.
	
	
	Third, whilst a SWMS may provide evidence that a defendant has in place a safe work procedure, it does not necessarily follow that its workers have been adequately trained in the content of a SWMS or that they will comply with it. Both Mr Pham and Mr Heaton were considered to be good workers. Neither of them could read the SWMS that was adopted on 14 March 2013. I have also found Mr Pham and the deceased failed to comply with the terms of the written policy contained in the February 2013 document relating to the use of the crane. The deceased failed to comply with the terms of the written policy relating to drug use set out in [13] of the February 2013 document, by being in the factory whilst under the influence of cannabis.
	
	
	Finally, for the reasons expressed the defendant trained the workers by oral instruction and on the job training in the matters required by the particulars of breach in 6(a) and 6(d) and those matters were enforced by adequate supervision.
	


6(b)   Prohibiting workers from attempting to support by hand multiple glass sheets in order to extract a sheet of glass from behind those sheets stacked in an ‘A-frame’ trolley.

6(c)   Warning and directing workers against standing in front of multiple glass sheets while those glass sheets are being removed from an ‘A-frame’ trolley


	
	It is convenient to deal with these particulars together.
	
	
	Sub-paragraph 6(b) was derived from the mechanism of the incident. Such a prohibition would only have prevented the risk of a crush injury if it also included a prohibition on standing in the fall zone. Sub-paragraph 6(c) required the workers to be trained not to access the fall zone while lifting or handling glass sheets of a sufficient size or weight to constitute a risk of crush injury.
	
	
	On 19 December 2012 Inspector Stothard made contemporaneous notes that he was told by Mr Chamoun during his Glass Project compliance visit to the factory that the workers were instructed not to stand in the fall zone when unloading timber crates and loading or unloading delivery vehicles. [7] 
	
	
	Mr Pham knew that it was unsafe for the deceased to stand in the fall zone at the time of the incident. Mr Dileo considered that standing in the fall zone of a glass panel taller than 650mm high was unsafe and he would have intervened if he saw that happen. Mr Foot observed that if two people were moving a glass panel they would stand at each end of it and not in front of it, ie in the fall zone. Mr Mastrioanni described leaning glass sheets against a worker as “too dangerous” and that he knew not to stand in the fall zone, presumably from his training and experience. Mr Spencer gave evidence that it was dangerous for workers to be present in the fall zone and that he had not seen workers at the factory do so when handling or lifting glass sheets of a size that could be lifted by two people which he described as no bigger than 2.4m long and 1.2m high.
	
	
	None of the witness called had ever seen a worker at the factory attempt to do what the deceased did at the time of the incident, ie to support multiple glass sheets by hand whilst standing in the fall zone. Each of the supervisors gave evidence that they would have intervened to stop such conduct because it was unsafe.
	
	
	The evidence of all of the witnesses, except Mr Heaton, was that workers did not stand in the fall zone when involved in the process of leaning out large and/or heavy glass sheets on an A-frame trolley to gain access to sheets behind them. In other words, only the evidence of Mr Heaton supported the prosecution’s contention made in opening the case that one of the methods adopted in the manual handling of glass in the factory was to lean large and/or heavy glass sheets onto a worker as occurred in the incident.
	
	
	Mr Heaton’s evidence was that glass sheets up to 920mm high were often leaned against the hips or shoulders of workers standing in the fall zone. He said that he would have considered it unsafe to adopt the procedure with a glass sheet that was higher than his shoulder when sitting on the base of an A-frame trolley. I do not accept Mr Heaton’s evidence for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, Mr Heaton could not provide the names of the other workers that assisted him in this task and it could not therefore be tested. Second, Mr Heaton had preconceived opinions to the effect that the procedures in place at the defendant were not safe. Mr Heaton did not provide any basis for that opinion. Third, Mr Heaton had discussed his views with many of his co-workers particularly after the incident. Mr Heaton was called as a witness at the suggestion of Mr Foye, another ex-employee of the defendant. Mr Heaton and Mr Foye discussed the case within a very short time of them both giving evidence. His evidence about the content of those discussions was so vague as to lead me to the conclusion that he was not trying to assist the Court. Fourth, Mr Heaton was terminated by the defendant for failing to attend work for an extended period. He described his termination as “the happiest day of my life”. Overall, there was a significant risk that Mr Heaton’s evidence was contaminated by his discussions with Mr Foye and/or was otherwise unreliable by reason of his unexplained attitude towards the defendant.
	
	
	I am satisfied on the evidence that workers did not stand in the fall zone when lifting or handling large and/or heavy glass sheets because they were instructed not to.
	
	
	It was not reasonably practicable to prohibit the workers from attempting to support multiple glass sheets by hand, because it was not a practice adopted in the factory, it was contrary to the instructions given to the workers by the defendant and thereby it was not reasonably foreseeable. The precise mechanism of the incident occurred by reason of the deceased acting irrationally and by both the deceased and Mr Pham acting against instructions and with a significant disregard for safety. That set of circumstances was also not reasonably foreseeable.
	
	
	It was not reasonably practicable for the defendant to provide the training required by sub-paragraphs 6(c) in a written SWMS for the reasons expressed in [92]-[94] above and by reason of the fact that the defendant trained the workers by oral instruction and on the job training in the matters required by the particulars of breach in 6(c).
	


6(e)   Providing a system of supervision in which the removal of the said glass sheets from an ‘A-frame’ trolley is under the direct control and instruction of a leading hand or supervisor.


	
	At the time of the incident, Mr Foot was in the lunch room and Mr Mastrioanni was in the office of the factory attending to paperwork. There was no evidence as to how long they had been away from the factory floor or how often that usually occurred.
	
	
	The prosecution’s ultimate submission was there was no system in place by which the removal of the glass sheets from the A-frame trolley was under the instruction of a supervisor.
	
	
	In my view, the action required of the defendant by sub-paragraph (e) is unclear. It would seem to require that a supervisor or leading hand be present or be close enough to provide “instruction” during the unloading of every A-frame trolley at the factory.
	
	
	There was very little, if any, evidence led by the prosecution on this point. There was no evidence as to how often an A-frame trolley was unloaded at the factory.
	
	
	The evidence was clear that Mr Pham did not require supervision to unload an A-frame trolley. Immediately before the incident he was completing that work safely with the use of the crane.
	
	
	Mr Mastrioanni gave evidence that the deceased could do certain tasks unsupervised. Those tasks were not identified in the evidence. There was no evidence as to what the deceased was doing immediately before the incident or whether he required supervision to complete that task.
	
	
	The evidence did not identify the facts that I would need to consider to determine if the supervision of the unloading of every A-frame trolley at the factory was reasonably practicable. It follows that I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was.
	


Conclusion as to Element 3


	
	I have decided that the prosecution have failed to prove that any of the failures pleaded were reasonably practicable. It follows that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has proved that all of the alleged failures were reasonably practicable.
	
	
	For these reasons I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant breached its health and safety duty by failing to take the steps particularised in [6] of the Summons.
	


Did the defendant’s breach of duty expose the deceased to a risk of death or serious injury? (Element 4)


	
	The deceased was exposed to a risk of crush injury when handling or moving large and or heavy glass sheets in the factory. That risk was a risk of death or serious injury.
	
	
	For the reasons I have given I am satisfied that the defendant took appropriate steps to eliminate or minimise that risk by training the deceased:
	



	
	not to try to manually handle glass sheets that were too large or heavy; and
	
	
	to remain clear of the fall zone.
	



	
	Regrettably, the deceased did not adhere to that training on the day of the incident and behaved in a way that was out of character. He did not listen to Mr Pham, a more experienced worker. The time saving that would have been achieved if he was successful in the procedure adopted would have been minimal. I find that he behaved irrationally and without any regard for his own safety because he was under the influence of cannabis.
	
	
	By reason of my finding on element 3, that there was no breach of the health and safety duty owed by the defendant, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of element 4.
	


Conclusion


	
	The prosecution has not proved all of the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I will not enter final orders until the prosecution has had an opportunity to consider the application pursuant to section 5AE Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	I will fix a date for further argument. On that date I will deal with the amendment application referred to in [60] above, the section 5AE application if pressed and any application for costs.
	


Orders


	
	Since delivering reasons on 31 March 2016 I have been advised that the prosecution does not wish to make an application to the Court of Criminal Appeal and that the parties have not asked me to resolve the amendment application.
	
	
	I find the defendant not guilty.
	
	
	The Summons is dismissed.
	
	
	The parties have agreed that the prosecution is to pay the defendant’s costs as agreed or assessed on the ordinary basis.

		28 April 2016",2016-03-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769086,Adam Geoffrey Hansell v R [2016] NSWDC 35,"Judgment


	
	Adam Geoffrey Hansell (the appellant) appeals against convictions entered by Ms Burns LCM at Downing Centre Local Court on 25 August 2015. On that day he was convicted of three counts of film person in private act without consent contrary to section 91K(1) Crimes Act 1900 and two counts of aggravated film person in private act without consent contrary to section 91K(3) Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The appellant was the owner of residential premises in Cammeray (the premises). The appellant leased the bedrooms of the premises to a number of people (the residents) on a shared accommodation basis. On a date prior to 22 April 2014 the appellant placed a USB motion activated camera device (the camera) in a toilet in the premises. The camera was detected by one of the residents secreted in a pot plant near the basin in the toilet on 22 April 2014. The existence of the camera was reported to the police.
	
	
	The camera was examined. There were 29 video files stored on it. The files contained video footage of the residents and other people using the toilet in the approximate period of 1 March 2104 to 22 April 2014.
	
	
	The police executed a search warrant at the appellant’s home and located other recording devices of a similar nature to the camera and other video footage of the residents and other people using the toilet where the camera was located and the main bathroom of the premises. The aggravated offences involved the filming of persons under the age of 16 years.
	
	
	The police also located video footage taken in a public toilet that was used by both males and females. It can be inferred from the sound recording on the footage that the toilet was in licensed premises.
	
	
	The appellant declined to be interviewed by the police.
	
	
	The only issue on the appeal is whether the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt an element of the offence that the filming was done for the purpose of obtaining or enabling another person to obtain sexual arousal or sexual gratification. The appellant had conceded in the Local Court that the other elements were established beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The counts for which the appellant was convicted included adult males, adult females and 2 children being 1 male and 1 female.
	


The Relevant Law


	
	The applicable principles to be applied in determination of the appeal are as follows.
	
	
	Section 18(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides that the appeal is a rehearing on the certified transcripts of evidence, obviously as supplemented by reference to the exhibits tendered in the Local Court and is not an appeal de novo: Gianoutsas v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137 at [24]-[31];
	
	
	The principles governing appeals from judges sitting without a jury apply in that the appellate judge is to form his or her own judgement of the facts while recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called and observing the natural limitations stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record: Charara v R [2006] NSWCCA 244 at [17]-[22];
	
	
	Whilst the magistrate’s reasons are not part of the certified transcripts referred to in section 18(1), recourse may be had to them since the appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them: Charara [23]-[24];
	
	
	The Court is obliged to give the judgement which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance: Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [23].
	


Material considered on the appeal


	
	The prosecution tendered a bundle including the witness statements tendered in the Local Court, the transcripts of the proceedings before the Local Court and the video footage, together with an aide memoire describing the various video footage relevant to each of the offences.
	
	
	No witnesses were required for cross-examination in the Local Court. The matter proceeded by way of submissions. The appellant was acquitted of a number of counts where the prosecution could not prove that the person filmed did not consent.
	


Analysis of the magistrate’s reasons


	
	The magistrate noted that the prosecution case was a circumstantial one. She correctly directed herself that before coming to a finding of guilt she had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the circumstances were consistent with the appellant having committed the offence and that she was required to exclude any other rational conclusion consistent with the appellant’s innocence, quoting from R v Hodge (1838) 2 Lewin 227 at 228, Howie v Budd [2003] TASSC 49 at [9] and Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193 and Shepherd v R (1990) 170 CLR 573.
	
	
	The magistrate relied the following facts that were established on the evidence.
	
	
	First she relied on the video footage of the appellant using the toilet and exposing his penis in what she found to be a sexualised fashion to the camera after doing so.
	
	
	Second, she relied on the appellant’s knowledge that by placing the camera in the toilet that he would be filming persons using the toilet, without their knowledge and that he intended to do so.
	
	
	Third, that there was no explanation for filming persons using the toilet.
	
	
	Fourth, there was no evidence from which any other rational conclusion could be drawn that was consistent with the appellant’s innocence.
	
	
	The magistrate concluded from those facts that the appellant filmed the persons using the toilet for the purpose of sexual arousal or sexual gratification. She correctly pointed out that the fact that he may have filmed some people who did not fulfil that purpose for him was irrelevant.
	


The appellant’s submissions


	
	The appellant submitted both in the Local Court and on appeal that there was no evidence that the filming was done for the purpose obtaining of sexual arousal or sexual gratification.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that there was no evidence of the appellant’s sexual persuasion and thereby it could not be inferred that he would obtain sexual arousal or sexual gratification by viewing the footage of particular victims.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that there were other possibilities for filming in the toilet and bathroom of the premises including that the appellant may have been concerned about drug use in the premises or that he may have wanted to extort the residents or publicly humiliate them by possessing the footage.
	


Consideration


	
	Having conducted an independent review of the evidence I am in agreement with the magistrate’s conclusion on the element of the offence that was in issue.
	
	
	It was open to the magistrate to find that on the basis of the facts established by the evidence, to conclude or infer that the prosecution had proved the element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. That is sufficient to reject the appellant’s no evidence submission.
	
	
	In my view there are additional reasons for the magistrate’s conclusion, ie other than those stated by her. Those reasons are as follows.
	
	
	A number of clips of the footage depict the appellant taking careful steps to align the camera. The footage depicts the alignment of the camera to focus on the seat of the toilet. For example, the camera is positioned in the public toilet footage and the toilet in the premises at about knee height pointed at the area of the toilet seat. In much of the footage the person using the toilet is depicted only below the waist, ie the camera is focussed on the genital area of the person using the toilet. I infer from all of the footage tendered that the alignment of the camera was deliberate. It follows that the appellant intended to film the genitals of persons using the toilet. The footage of the shower in the main bathroom of the premises is similarly deliberately aligned. There is a clear available inference that the filming of sexual organs is for the purpose of sexual arousal or sexual gratification.
	
	
	The concept of sexual gratification is much wider than sexual arousal. “Gratification” is defined in the Macquarie Dictionary as a source of pleasure and satisfaction. I agree with the magistrate that the footage of the appellant exposing himself to the camera was a sexual act. I infer that act was filmed so that it could be watched later and it was intended to be a source of pleasure or satisfaction.
	
	
	The submission relating the filming being undertaken to monitor drug use in the premises can be rejected on the basis of the possession of the film of the public toilet. It is clear from the evidence, that was admitted in the Local Court without objection, that the appellant’s filming of persons in toilets was not limited to filming the residents and visitors to his own premises.
	
	
	Whilst there may be a number of other possibilities as to why the appellant filmed the victims using the toilet, I cannot not think of any that I would consider to be a reasonable possibility or one that is consistent with innocence in this case.
	
	
	For the reasons expressed I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the filming was done for the purpose of obtaining or enabling another person to obtain sexual arousal or sexual gratification.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I make are:
	



	
	The appeal against conviction is dismissed.

		04 April 2016",2016-03-31 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769088,Grills v R [2016] NSWCCA 46,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P:      I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Davies J. I agree with his Honour's reasons and proposed orders.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   The Applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to two offences as follows:
	


(1)   Supply a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine). The maximum penalty for this offence is 15 years imprisonment.

(2)   Possess a prohibited firearm not being authorised to do so by a licence or permit. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of 3 years.


	
	Attached to the first offence on a Form 1 were two further offences as follows:
	


(3)   Possess a prohibited drug being cannabis. The maximum penalty for this offence is 2 years imprisonment.

(4)   Deal with property suspected as proceeds of crime. The maximum penalty for this offence is 2 years’ imprisonment.


	
	Attached to the second offence charged on a Form 1 were the following offences:
	


(5)   Possess a shortened firearm. The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment.

(6)   Possess an unregistered firearm (two counts). The maximum penalty for this offence is 5 years imprisonment.

(7)   Possess explosives without a licence. The maximum penalty for this offence is 12 months imprisonment.

(8)   Possess a prohibited weapon. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment.

(9)   Not keep firearm safely (two counts). The maximum penalty for this offence is 2 years imprisonment.

(10)   Possess ammunition without a licence. The maximum penalty for this offence is a fine of $5,500.


	
	The Applicant was sentenced by Judge McLoughlin SC in the District Court on 19 December 2014. He was sentenced as follows:
	


As to the first count and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, a fixed term of five years imprisonment to commence 5 November 2013 and to expire 4 November 2018. On count 2 taking into account the matters on the Form 1, a non-parole period of three years imprisonment commencing 4 November 2016 and expiring 3 November 2019 with an additional term of two years expiring 3 November 2021.


	
	The overall effective sentence was a non-parole period of six years with an additional term of two years.
	
	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1:   The principle of totality in sentencing was not correctly applied.

Ground 2:   The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.

	The firearms were examined. The shortened shotgun was found to be in working order. It was both a shortened and prohibited firearm as defined by the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW).
	
	
	The 44 Magnum calibre Uberti 6 chamber firearm was a shortened firearm, which had a pistol grip added to it. It was both a shortened and prohibited firearm as defined by the Firearms Act.
	
	
	The various types of ammunition were found to be ammunition as defined by the Firearms Act.
	
	
	The black handheld defence or anti-personnel device, described as a Taser, is designed to inflict electric shock on contact. It is in working order. It is a prohibited weapon as defined by the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW).
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge then set out the texts which were found on the Applicant’s phones. The only reference his Honour made to those messages was that they indicated that the Applicant was not a mere runner for others - others were running for him and he was not, therefore, simply a street level dealer. It may be accepted that the text messages tend to show that the Applicant was being pressed for money by those supplying to him as he was pressing those to whom he had supplied the drugs.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentence proceedings. His mother gave evidence but that was confined to evidence concerning her support for him notwithstanding that he had been already given an opportunity previously to deal with his drug problem (see [21] below).
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge was also provided with a pre-sentence report. The information in that report was supplied by the Applicant’s wife, his parents and his grandparents. It disclosed that the Applicant’s parents separated when he was aged six years. However, he remained on good terms with all family members including his stepfather whom his mother married when the Applicant was nine years of age.
	
	
	The Applicant started using cannabis and methylamphetamine when he was 14 years of age. He also experimented with LSD and ecstasy. He claimed to have ceased to use all illicit drugs after a six month period with the exception of methylamphetamine which continued until September 2008.
	
	
	On 30 May 2008 he was charged with supplying a small quantity of methylamphetamine. He had been stopped in the street by the police who found him to be carrying a bag with electronic scales and a hundred small plastic resealable bags. He was also found to have 3.46 grams of methylamphetamine on him. The police also found a piece of paper in his possession containing names and numerous amounts of money.
	
	
	He was sentenced by Newcastle Local Court to a period of six months imprisonment commencing on 28 October 2008. An appeal to the District Court was heard by Judge Nicholson SC on 10 November 2008. In the course of his Remarks on Sentence Judge Nicholson said that a court would conclude that what was contained on the piece of paper containing names and amounts of money were earlier transactions that the Applicant had conducted and that the sums of money were sums owed to him.
	
	
	By the time the Applicant appeared before Judge Nicholson he had been in gaol for 18 days. The Applicant gave evidence before Judge Nicholson that spending time in gaol “scared the hell” out of him.
	
	
	Judge Nicholson said that although there was no alternative to a sentence of imprisonment there was an opportunity to focus on the Applicant’s rehabilitation. His Honour had him assessed for home detention and said that if he was suitable he would receive an eight month sentence to be served by home detention. The Applicant ultimately served that sentence by way of home detention.
	
	
	The Applicant told the Corrections officer who prepared the pre-sentence report that he relapsed into using Ice again following the completion of his home detention in August 2009. He said that Ice remained a problem until he was arrested for the present offences.
	
	
	He and his wife married in September 2013 having been in a relationship for six years prior to that time. His wife had a son by a previous relationship but she lost custody of the son because of the Applicant’s arrest and charges.
	
	
	The Applicant left school after year 10. He completed a three year traineeship in warehouse distribution in addition to some short courses within the construction industry. He worked as a labourer in vineyards in the Cessnock area for some years before setting up a photo booth hire business in 2011.
	
	
	He said that he had an addiction to Ice at the time of the offences. He claimed he was purchasing drugs surplus to his own needs and on-selling them in part to finance his own addiction. He also claimed to have a significant gambling problem prior to his entry into custody where he would gamble between $200 and $300 per week on the tab.
	
	
	At some point the Applicant was diagnosed with depression. He was prescribed medication for that condition in custody and had been compliant with it by the time of the pre-sentence report.
	
	
	The Applicant told the Corrections officer who prepared the report that he was shamed by his actions, that he had hurt his family, his wife, his friends and himself. He said that at the time of his offences he was addicted to Ice and was not thinking of consequences or the impact of his behaviour on those closest to him. He acknowledged the seriousness of the firearms charges.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	As noted earlier, the Sentencing Judge said that the SMS messages indicated that the Applicant was not a mere runner for others but others were running for him. In that way he was not simply a street level dealer. His Honour found that the offence fell slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	In relation to the firearm offence the Sentencing Judge said that the only conclusion that could be drawn from the finding of a loaded pistol behind the Applicant’s bedhead was that it was a tool of trade ready to be used if need be. He said that the offence fell above the middle of the range for offences of its type. He noted that the Applicant was on conditional liberty at the time which was a matter of aggravation.
	
	
	His Honour made reference to the previous opportunity the Applicant had been given when he had previously been convicted of supplying drugs. His Honour drew attention to the similarity between the previous offending with the small amounts of drugs found together with what his Honour described as the tick lists of money that was owed to the Applicant. His Honour concluded that he could only come to the view that the Applicant had been dealing in drugs significantly and had resorted to the use of firearms to enforce payment and to [en]force his drug transactions.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge had regard to the offences on the Form 1 in each case, particularly the maximum sentence for those offences, and determined that after trial the appropriate sentence on each count would be six years and four months imprisonment. By reason of the guilty pleas the sentences would be reduced to five years. His Honour then went on to say:
	


In my view, because of the differences in substances, the differences of offence, and no doubt committed with the overall drug dealing in mind, such sentences should be partially accumulative and partially concurrent.

His Honour declined to find special circumstances.

Submissions


	
	The Applicant submitted that it was only when totality was considered that error was demonstrated. The Applicant submitted that as the Sentencing Judge had formed the view that the appropriate non-parole period for each of the two offences, considered separately, would be three years and nine months, the end result of a non-parole period for both offences of six years meant that totality had only absorbed 18 months of that non-parole period. Reference was made to what was said in R v Holder and Johnston [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 260 concerning adjustment to sentences by reason of the totality principle.
	
	
	The Applicant pointed to cases such as R v Najem [2008] NSWCCA 32 and R v AZ [2011] NSWCCA 43 to suggest that the firearm offence in the present case was not properly regarded by the Sentencing Judge as being sufficiently associated with the drug offence to result in a modest accumulation for that firearm offence. In Najem this Court imposed a non-parole period of four years for the offence of conspiracy to inflict grievous bodily harm on the victim and a period of three years for possessing a prohibited pistol where the accumulation was for a 12 month period only.
	
	
	In AZ a non-parole period of five years and two months was imposed for the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug and a non-parole period of one year, one month and two weeks for possessing a prohibited firearm but with an accumulation of only eight months for the second offence.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that where there are charges of drug supply as well as possession of firearms ordinarily the matters are very much intertwined which suggests that a greater period of concurrency should be ordered. In that regard attention was drawn to the connection that the Sentencing Judge made between the drug supply and the use of firearms to enforce aspects of that supply.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that questions of accumulation and concurrency were ultimately discretionary. The Crown submitted that the nature and seriousness of the offending called for a significant measure of accumulation. The two offences did not overlap in criminality because the firearm offence must be seen as serious in itself.
	


Consideration


	
	Both grounds should be considered together. The Applicant’s counsel made clear that no complaint was made that the individual sentences themselves were manifestly excessive, only that the overall effective sentence was excessive by reason of the way the individual sentences were accumulated.
	
	
	Since matters associated with totality are ultimately discretionary, it is necessary for an error of the House v The King type to be shown before this Court will interfere. The Applicant does not point to any specific error. The submission, when analysed, appeared to be that the accumulation was unreasonable or plainly unjust. That was so, the submission continued, because of the link between the drug offending and the firearm offending.
	
	
	The principles to be applied with respect to accumulation and concurrency were set out by Hall J (Tobias JA and Kirby J agreeing) in R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; (2009) 195 A Crim R 38 at [52]. Those principles make clear that when applying the principle of totality the question to be posed is whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other offence. If it can then the sentences ought to be concurrent but if it cannot the sentence should be at least partially cumulative, and that is so “regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality”.
	
	
	In JT v R [2012] NSWCCA 133 Rothman J (with whom Whealy JA and Davies J agreed) said:
	


[71]   The exercise involved in determining accumulation and concurrence and the application of the principles of totality are inconsistent with the proposition that one single correct answer will be derived in every circumstance by every judge. The application of the principle of totality is an exercise of discretion, intuitive or instinctive synthesis, and cannot be conducted arithmetically: Pearce at [46]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. The principle assumes that each individual sentence imposed will reflect the criminality of that offence and that the combination of the sentences shall reflect the total criminality of all of the crimes committed: Pearce.

…

[73]   Generally, in the application of the principle of totality, it is difficult, if not impossible, for a sentencing judge to do more than state and apply the principle on the facts as found. Greater transparency is extremely difficult. The process is at the essence of intuitive or instinctive synthesis. As a consequence, once a sentencing judge notes that the principle is being applied (or plainly, by an examination of the process involved, has applied the principle), assuming the facts are correctly stated, in order for an appeal court to intervene, the result must manifest an incorrect application of the principle. Otherwise, interference with the result is impermissible.


	
	In Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240 Johnson J (with whom Bathurst CJ and James J agreed) said:
	


The Applicant's possession of a loaded pistol required some separate and identifiable penalty for that crime. The sentence on the drug supply offences could not comprehend and reflect the criminality for the firearm offence. The offences involved discrete and independent criminal acts so that a significant measure of accumulation was appropriate for the s.7(1) offence: R v AZ at 235-236 [85].


	
	Further, the Sentencing Judge in the present case was not dealing with one isolated firearm offence. There were eight offences involving weapons and ammunition on the Form 1 including possession of another firearm, a Taser and a machete. One of those offences had the same maximum penalty as count 2 and one offence of possessing a shortened firearm carried a ten year maximum. This meant that the criminality in respect of count 2 was high and could not reasonably have been comprehended by the criminality of the drug supply offence.
	
	
	It may be accepted that there was a clear link between the two counts charged but it was both appropriate and necessary to consider the total criminality when considering matters of accumulation and concurrency. It was the second time the Applicant had been convicted of drug supply in a similar form, that is, where he was not a mere runner for others but others were running for him. Further, he was on conditional liberty at the time and his drug dealing had advanced to the point that he now had a number of weapons including firearms to assist in that business.
	
	
	In Najem RS Hulme J (with whom Beazley JA and Latham J agreed) said of offences against s 7:
	


[38]    Any judgment as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed in respect of the offence the subject of the second count has also to cope with the fact that there are, at least on first impression, two irreconcilable standards against which that offending has to be measured. As has been said, the maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years, yet the standard non-parole period is 3 years. The effect of ss 54A and 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is that, for an offence in the middle range of objective seriousness, a court is required to impose the standard non-parole period unless there are reasons for not doing so.

[39]   One would fairly have expected that the standard non-parole period for an offence in such mid-range to be of the order of half of the maximum. Nothing in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill that led to the enactment of these sections or the Ministers’ Second Reading speeches when introducing the Bill provides any assistance in answering the quandary.

[40]   It is appropriate to have regard to the rationale behind the statutory provision against which the Respondent offended. That rationale includes at least a recognition that firearms and pistols, if possessed, are liable to be used, and if used, are liable to be a source of great danger or damage. It includes also a recognition that not all persons can be relied on to avoid or minimise such danger and not misuse the weapons and that misuse, even without discharge, is liable to amount to a great infringement of others rights.


	
	The effect of the sentence is that the Applicant must serve a non-parole period of three years with respect to the firearm offence. I am satisfied that this was a sentence open to the Sentencing Judge to impose. When the matters on the Form 1 attached to that offence are regarded, when the Applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of the offending is remembered, when there is a standard non-parole period of 3 years for an offence against s 7(1) of the Firearms Act and the objective seriousness was assessed by the Sentencing Judge as being above the middle of the range, it cannot be said that there was any error in accumulating the sentences in the way his Honour did. The overall sentence is not unreasonable nor plainly unjust.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	R S HULME AJ:   I agree with the orders proposed by Davies J and with his Honour's reasons.
	
	
	I would however go further. The Applicant's firearms offence charged was of possessing a prohibited firearm, viz. a .44 Magnum which was found behind the bedhead in the master bedroom, fully loaded with 6 rounds of ammunition. Given the Applicant's drug dealing activity it takes no feat of imagination to conclude why the firearm was possessed and in the location where it was found.
	
	
	In imposing a sentence for that offence, McLoughlin SC DCJ had also to take into account the matters on a Form 1. An approach which thought no increase in punishment was appropriate in relation to some of the items on that Form 1, such as possession of ammunition and fireworks and absence of registration of the firearms that should not have been there in the first place might be understandable - though I make it clear I am not endorsing it - but no such approach could reasonably be taken to the offences of possessing a shortened shotgun and the Taser-like device the Applicant also possessed. Parliament's view of the seriousness of the Applicant's offending in respect of these weapons is provided by consideration of the maximum terms of imprisonment prescribed -
	
	
	Possess shortened firearm - 10 years - Firearms Act, 1996, s 62(i)(b)
	
	
	Possess prohibit weapon - 14 years - Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, s 7 (1)
	
	
	For all of this criminality the Applicant received an effective increase in sentence of 12 months! There was no Crown appeal but it is impossible to regard such a sentence as other than grossly inadequate.

		01 April 2016",2016-03-31 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769096,R v Parker [2016] NSWSC 363,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR:  Marianne Parker, the accused, is charged with the murder of her partner Kenneth Wayne Parker (the deceased) on 16 December 2013. The conduct arises out of a volatile relationship between the accused and the deceased, the circumstances of which relationship is to be adduced in evidence before the Court during the trial before a jury.
	
	
	On 9 March 2016, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions served a Tendency Notice and on 21 March 2016 amended the Tendency Notice. Objection is taken by the accused to the use of the evidence to prove a tendency.
	
	
	At this point in time it is worthwhile to note that the deceased has a history of self-harm, including harm with a knife, some of the injuries from which are similar to injuries on the deceased that were not fatal. The fatal wound was a knife wound to the back and it seems that no issue arises in these proceedings that the accused inflicted the fatal injury. At arraignment the accused pleaded guilty to manslaughter and not guilty to murder, which plea the Crown has not accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. Manslaughter is a statutory alternative available, in New South Wales and elsewhere, to a charge of murder.
	
	
	Thus, the fundamental issue in these proceedings is the state of mind of the accused. The state of mind to which I earlier referred encompasses a number of defences already outlined to the Court, in the absence of the jury. Those defences include the absence of an intention (in part caused by an extraordinary level of intoxication), diminished responsibility and, although not stated, excessive self-defence.
	
	
	While the principles applied in the determination of whether tendency evidence ought be admitted against an accused are well settled in this Court, there are different views expressed by another court and it is often difficult to apply the principles, albeit that the principles themselves are not in dispute and have been stated a number of times by the Court of Criminal Appeal, by which judgments I am bound.
	
	
	The commencement point for the admissibility of evidence must always be the provisions of s 55 and s 56 of the Evidence Act 1995, which render admissible all material that could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in proceedings.
	
	
	To that general statement, there exist exceptions. One of those exceptions is described in the provisions of s 97 of the Evidence Act, which provides that evidence is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind, unless two preconditions are satisfied. I will, for the time being, leave aside the issue of notice. The second and more litigated provision is that the Court must be satisfied “that the evidence will have significant probative value”.
	
	
	Further, in the present proceedings, being evidence sought to be utilised for a tendency purpose against an accused in criminal proceedings, the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused: s 101 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	With the exception of one instance, with which I will deal separately, each of the circumstances upon which the Crown seeks to rely is a circumstance in which conduct by one or other of the accused or the deceased was involved, there was the use of a knife, alleged assaults and aggression, at least, by the accused.
	
	
	Each of those relationship circumstances is sought also to be used to show the nature of the relationship between the accused and the deceased. That latter use of the material is not tendency evidence, in the strict sense, and there is no issue associated with the provisions of s 97 or s 101 of the Evidence Act relating thereto.
	
	
	The question in relation to the so-called relationship evidence is that it is also sought to be used to show a tendency on the part of the accused in the following manner:
	



	
	to resort to physical violence upon male partners with whom she is involved in a relationship, including the use of a knife to assault – when she became frustrated with them;
	
	
	tendency to be the dominant party in such a relationship; and
	
	
	to become aggressive and threaten violence when intoxicated and engaged in argument, particularly with and towards her partner.
	



	
	As earlier stated, the instances may well be admissible for other reasons other than the tendency purpose. Thus, we are not here concerned with whether evidence is admissible, only whether it can be used to serve as evidence of the tendency of which the Crown has given notice.
	
	
	The difficulty with the tendencies sought to be utilised is the purpose of such tendency.
	
	
	As already stated, there is no substantive issue that the accused utilised a knife. Thus, a tendency to use a knife is not something that is in issue in the proceedings, if its purpose is to show that it is likely that the accused would have used a knife.
	
	
	Secondly, each of the circumstances that amount to relationship evidence are themselves disputed issues. Evidence will be adduced during the course of these proceedings to show a tendency on the part of the deceased to self-harm. Evidence will also be adduced, as already stated, to describe the violent nature of the relationship between the deceased and the accused.
	
	
	Each of the circumstances is moot. Whether, in the course of the earlier occurrences, the accused was so intoxicated as to be unable to form an intent; or was the aggressor; or was seeking to avoid the deceased from engaging in self-harm with a knife; or had diminished capacity are not, without a major mini-trial in relation to each such circumstance, disclosed by the conduct on which the Crown seeks to rely for the tendency.
	
	
	In those circumstances, its probative value is lessened and the danger that the evidence could be used by the jury to prove intent or a state of mind not disclosed by the circumstances themselves is extremely high. In my view the relationship evidence, being the evidence of the violence between the accused and the deceased, while relevant in the sense of s 55 and s 56 of the Evidence Act, does not meet the tests prescribed for criminal proceedings under s 97 and s 101 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	I have described a slightly different view of the manner in which s 101 of the Evidence Act operates in previous judgments, particularly in the Court of Criminal Appeal, and, if it be necessary so to do, I also make clear that if it were to apply beyond the necessary tests in s 97 and s 101 of the Evidence Act, I would evaluate the evidence to be adduced, for the purpose described in the Tendency Notice, as being of a probative value that is outweighed (while unnecessary, I add substantially outweighed) by the danger of unfair prejudice and inadmissible pursuant to the terms of s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The separate aspect with which I must then deal is the evidence relating to a circumstance that occurred in a previous relationship. This circumstance did not involve the use of a knife, but did involve an assault by the accused when drunk. No other context is before the Court for the occurrence in question. In my view, this occurrence, which is a single instance in a previous relationship, is too remote to the issues before the Court in this murder trial and, applying the principles already applied, its probative value is limited while its prejudicial effect is significant and, in my assessment, the probative value of the evidence does not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect on the accused. This evidence does not meet the test for the use of the material as tendency evidence against the accused in these proceedings.
	
	
	I have not in this judgment ruled on whether the evidence is or would be admissible for another purpose or might otherwise be inadmissible or unable to be used for another purpose pursuant to other provisions of the Evidence Act. It is sufficient to deal with the matter in the way I have and, at this stage, inappropriate to go beyond that.
	
	
	I order that the evidence sought to be adduced for a tendency purpose and subject to the Notice and Amended Notice by the Crown not be admitted or used to prove any one of the three tendencies described.

		20 June 2016",2016-04-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769106,Further application of Henry Edgar Des Rosiers pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2016] NSWSC 365,"JUDGMENT


	
	In 2005 Henry Edgar Des Rosiers (“the applicant”) was sentenced in the District Court of New South Wales in relation to a number of drug offences. The following year he was resentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal (“CCA”) after an appeal to that Court: Des Rosiers v R [2006] NSWCCA 16; (2006) 159 A Crim R 549.
	
	
	In 2014 the applicant sought a review of the sentences imposed upon him by the CCA, submitting an application to this Court pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (“the CAR Act”) for a referral of his case to the CCA. The application was refused: Application by Henry Edgar Des Rosiers pursuant to s78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 830.
	
	
	The applicant has now made a further Part 7 application, and again asks this Court to refer his case to the CCA to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	The sentences the applicant seeks to have considered on appeal are those imposed by the CCA on 10 February 2006.
	


The Facts of the Applicant’s Crimes


	
	After receiving information that the applicant was in possession of prohibited drugs, NSW Police obtained a warrant authorising a search to be made of his home on the north coast of the State. The warrant was executed on 20 April 2004, and a substantial quantity of prohibited drugs was found. The following items were seized:
	



	
	196 grams of the prohibited drug LSD in liquid form(that being 98 times the large commercial quantity);
	
	
	101 sheets of blotting paper, printed with 1, 000 heart shaped logos on each sheet, in readiness to be impregnated with LSD;
	
	
	90.6 grams of MDMA (that being 72 times the indictable quantity) which was at a level of purity between 68% and 73%;
	
	
	724.4 grams of dried cannabis leaf (that being more than twice the traffickable quantity);
	
	
	Three cannabis plants;
	
	
	Ten pieces of blotting paper impregnated with LSD;
	
	
	Six capsules containing Nexus, a prohibited drug; and
	
	
	The sum of $2,340 in cash.
	



	
	Investigators had also lawfully intercepted a number of telephone communications between the applicant and a co-offender, Phillip Martin. During the conversations the applicant gave Mr Martin instructions in the preparation of blotting paper to be used for “tabs” of LSD, and referred to a need to send money to Thailand, a country to which an associate of the applicant had travelled briefly in March 2004.
	
	
	Blotting paper identical to that found at the applicant’s home was found at the home of Phillip Martin.
	
	
	There was also evidence that the applicant had supplied a small amount of LSD, being one paper tab, to an acquaintance on 7 February 2004.
	
	
	The street value of the drugs depended upon the purity of the product sold, and was the subject of dispute, but it was substantial on any estimation.
	


The Procedural History of the Matter


	
	The applicant was committed for sentence from the Lismore Local Court with respect to four supply offences. He was ultimately dealt with in the District Court for those offences, and for a number of other crimes, which were taken into account by the sentencing judge, pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offences were as follows,
	



	
	Supply not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (LSD), contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“DMTA”);
	
	
	Supply prohibited drug (MDMA) contrary to s 25(1) of the DMTA;
	
	
	Supply prohibited drug (LSD) contrary to s 25(1) of the DMTA; and
	
	
	Supply prohibited drug (cannabis), also contrary to s 25(1) of the DMTA.
	



	
	There were four charges taken into account when sentence was imposed for the s 25(2) DMTA offence, being offences of possess prohibited drug (LSD), cultivate cannabis plant, goods in custody, and possessing a prohibited drug (Nexus).
	
	
	In the District Court on 24 February 2005 a sentence of 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period (“NPP) of 12 years was imposed with respect to the s 25(2) offence, taking into account the offences on the Form 1 document. The sentences imposed for the remaining counts were shorter terms of imprisonment, to be served concurrently with the sentence for the first count, and wholly subsumed by it. The earliest possible date for release to parole was specified as 19 April 2016.
	
	
	The applicant subsequently sought leave in the CCA to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him. He complained of four specific errors on the part of the sentencing judge, and additionally asserted that the sentences were manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The Court found that there were patent errors in the sentencing process which were such as to require the Court to proceed to re-sentence. An error had been made as to the maximum penalty applicable to the s 25 (1) DMTA charges, and the sentencing judge had failed to abide by the requirements of Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610.
	
	
	Errors constituting the remaining grounds of appeal – that the sentencing judge should have regarded the supply of LSD as less serious than a comparable supply of a “more dangerous” drug; that there was a failure to properly consider s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; and that the sentencing judge failed to specify the discount applied to the sentences to reflect the pleas of guilty – were not established.
	
	
	As to the complaint of manifest excess, the Court concluded (at [36] per Latham J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J agreed) that the sentence, whilst a heavy one, was not manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Because of the patent errors identified in the original sentence proceedings, the CCA proceeded to re-sentence the applicant, on 10 February 2006. The sentences for counts 2 and 4, being sentences infected by error as to the maximum penalty applicable, were reduced. The reduced sentences were imposed concurrently with the sentence imposed for the s 25(2) offence, and were wholly subsumed by it. The sentences imposed for the s 25(1) supply of LSD offence and the s 25(2) offence were unchanged. Accordingly, the applicant’s earliest release date, 19 April 2016, also remained unchanged.
	
	
	It is the sentence imposed by the CCA that the applicant challenges.
	


The First s 78 Application


	
	The application before me is the second of this nature.
	
	
	On 20 June 2014 Hoeben CJ at CL determined the applicant’s first application to have his case dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	In that first application, the applicant contended that the sentence imposed upon him by the CCA was infected by what is commonly known as “Muldrock error.” Specifically, it was argued that the standard non-parole period (“SNPP”) was given undue emphasis in the sentencing process, contrary to the principles set out by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. Had the SNPP not been given determinative significance, the applicant asserted, the sentence would have been appreciably less.
	
	
	In the determination of the application, Hoeben CJ at CL concluded that, in determining the sentence to be imposed upon the applicant for the s 25(2) offence, Latham J had properly referred to the SNPP only as a benchmark, without giving it determinative significance. His Honour considered that the sentence had been fixed by reference to the objective gravity of the offence, taking into account the applicant’s subjective case, and in accordance with principle.
	
	
	Ultimately, Hoeben CJ at CL was not persuaded that “Muldrock error” had occurred in the sentencing of the applicant and thus concluded that there did not appear to be a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance warranting a review of the matter as an appeal. Accordingly, the application for referral to the CCA was refused.
	


The Current Application


	
	In this second application pursuant to s 78 of the CAR Act the applicant again asserts that the sentence was infected by error in that the SNPP was given primary or determinative significance, contrary to the principle laid down in Muldrock v The Queen. What raises the issue for further consideration, it is said, are changes in the jurisprudence as to the identification of “Muldrock error” and its assessment.
	
	
	The applicant refers to and relies upon a number of decisions from the High Court, the Court of Appeal, and the CCA including Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601; Buttrose v Attorney General of New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 221; and Davis v R [2015] NSWCCA 90, in arguing that the sentence imposed by the CCA in 2006 was contrary to law.
	
	
	Although this argument in support of “Muldrock error” was available to the applicant when making his first s 78 application, and was not then advanced, he now additionally contends that the “neatness” of the mathematics of the sentence imposed in 2006 is such as to indicate the significant role given to the SNPP, and therefore that there has been error. Reliance is placed in that regard on Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50.
	


The “Muldrock Error” Issue


	
	The applicant’s contention is that the application by the CCA of a process of determining the “objective gravity” or “objective seriousness” of the crime, as those terms and that process were understood in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, is indicative of “Muldrock error”, calling for appellate intervention.
	
	
	It is submitted that, in determining the applicant’s first s 78 application, Hoeben CJ at CL overlooked the meaning and content of “objective seriousness” as it was considered in Muldrock v The Queen, and wrongly concluded that there was no doubt or question as to the applicant’s case.
	
	
	Additionally, the applicant contends that there has been a major shift in the relevant jurisprudence in recent years, such that the sentence imposed upon any person sentenced in the period after R v Way and before Muldrock v The Queen must necessarily be erroneous.
	
	
	Finally, as noted, the applicant contends that the mathematical neatness of the sentence imposed upon him is capable of demonstrating “Muldrock error”.
	
	
	It is submitted that the question of the materiality or otherwise of the error is irrelevant. In reliance on Kentwell v The Queen it is contended that the language used by the CCA (per Latham J) is such as to demonstrate “Muldrock error”, and thus an appellate court should move to resentence the applicant, in the exercise of its independent discretion.
	


The Submissions Filed by the Attorney General


	
	The Attorney General was invited by the Court to provide written submissions in relation to the applicant’s s 78 application and, pursuant to s 79(4) of the CAR Act, did so. The Attorney’s focus in submission was on the applicant’s argument founded on the asserted mathematical “neatness” of the sentence imposed by the CCA. Helpfully setting out the context of the relevant comments in the judgment of Latham J, the Attorney acknowledged the evolution of the jurisprudence, and ultimately concluded that it would be open in determining the current application to form the requisite view that there appears to be a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance such that the matter should be referred to the CCA to be dealt with as an appeal.
	
	
	The Attorney referred in submission to the perceived role of the Crown as a contradictor, in light of decisions such as Davis v R and Aytugrul v R [2015] NSWCCA 139. In each of those decisions Simpson J (as she then was) was critical of the Crown for its “frivolous opposition” (Davis, at [34]) in appeal matters asserting “Muldrock error” which were determined pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Her Honour concluded that error in such matters was axiomatic, this being a reality the Court and the Crown had to “live with” (Aytugrul, at [21]).
	
	
	Those criticisms of the Crown appear to have led the Attorney to feel a degree of constraint in the submissions that might be provided to the Court in this matter, particularly so given the lower threshold that applies to determination of an application of this nature, that being the appearance of a question or doubt as to the sentence imposed.
	


Consideration


	
	The application has been brought pursuant to s 78 of the CAR Act. The provision is in these terms.
	


“78 Applications to Supreme Court

(1)    An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf   of the convicted person.

(2)    The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.”


	
	The applicant seeks a referral of his case to the CCA pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the CAR Act. Section s 79 relevantly provides,
	


“79 Consideration of applications

(1)    After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a)    […] or

(b)    the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2)    Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3)    The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a)    it appears that the matter:

(i)    has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii)    has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii)    has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv)    has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b)    the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A)    […]

(3B)    […]

(4)    Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

(5)    The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).”


	
	The determination of an application of this nature is an administrative, rather than judicial act: see Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 48-50; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318 at [124]; Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales [2008] NSWCA 156; (2008) 173 IR 465 at [9].
	
	
	The statutory provisions provide a mechanism for administrative review where there is a basis to conclude that a conviction or sentence may have been entered contrary to proper principles: Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; (2013) 85 NSWLR 783 at [52] - [53].
	
	
	That is the contention in the present matter.
	
	
	The applicant’s complaints can usefully be separated and categorised as complaint of “Muldrock error”, and complaint of “Kentwell error”, the latter being the asserted failure of the CCA to independently exercise the sentencing discretion when moving to re-sentence the applicant.
	
	
	Other than the issue of mathematical neatness which the applicant now complains of, but did not refer to in his first application, the question of “Muldrock error” was considered and dealt with in Application by Henry Edgar Des Rosiers pursuant to s78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Hoeben CJ at CL was not satisfied that a doubt or question as to a mitigating feature arose.
	
	
	Section 79 of the CAR Act provides that the Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the application where an application has been previously dealt with under Part 7 (ss (3)(a)(ii)), or where the Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or circumstances that justify the taking of further action (ss (3)(b)). Whilst the applicant does not have a right of appeal against the sentence imposed upon him, it is a relevant consideration that the applicant did not seek special leave from the High Court to appeal against the 2006 decision of the CCA, and he has not sought judicial review of the decision made in 2014 in Application by Henry Edgar Des Rosiers pursuant to s78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.
	
	
	The applicant asserts in his submissions in support of his second s 78 application that there are a number of asserted errors in the determination of the first Part 7 application, but it is not necessary to consider any purported errors. Although I do not regard a second such application as the proper means by which to expose error, determination of the present application does not turn on consideration of that question.
	
	
	There are aspects of the application which have not previously been argued or considered, they being the asserted mathematical neatness of the sentence imposed by the CCA for the s 25(2) offence, and the purported failure of that Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh, after having found error in the lower court proceedings.
	


The Bolt v R Argument


	
	In Bolt v R it was held that, even in the absence of specific remarks by the sentencing judge indicative of “Muldrock error”, such error can still be found where there is a correlation, or “neatness of the mathematics” between the SNPP for the particular offence and the NPP in fact imposed: at [36], per McCallum J. That principle was applied in Devaney v R [2012] NSWCCA 285, and referred to with approval in Buttrose v The Attorney General of New South Wales.
	
	
	The applicant asserts that there is such a correlation between the SNPP of 15 years specified for a s 25(2) DMTA offence, and the NPP of 12 years imposed upon him by the CCA.
	
	
	That argument has force only if Latham J’s comments about the objective gravity of the applicant’s crime are understood as meaning that the offence fell at the mid-range of objective seriousness. Having considered the whole of what her Honour said on the subject, I do not understand that to be the correct interpretation of those comments.
	
	
	At [35] of Des Rosiers v R Latham J said,
	


“As noted at par 15, there can be no doubt that the supply large commercial quantity offence lay at least at, if not above, the mid-range of objective gravity.”


	
	That comment should be considered in the context in which it was made, and in light of the whole of her Honour’s remarks.
	
	
	The context was consideration given to the apparent absence of any assessment by the primary judge of the objective gravity of the s 25(2) offence, which was found to be an error. At [14] Latham J said,
	


“[The primary judge] next referred to the standard non-parole period (15 years) prescribed for the offence by s 54 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and to this Court’s decision in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131. Apart from noting that it was “not to be regarded as either a starting post or a finishing post or anything apart from that”, there was no further discussion of the relevance of the standard non-parole period to the sentencing exercise being undertaken. The Crown’s written submissions on sentence canvassed the authorities relating to Way and sought to place the offence “well beyond the middle range of objective seriousness”, having regard to the quantity of the drug and its commercial value. In these circumstances, his Honour erred in not identifying a basis for departing from the standard non-parole period. Nowhere in the remarks on sentence does his Honour assess the objective gravity of the offence in terms of the spectrum of offences of this type, nor is there any attempt to meet the requirements of s 54B(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; R v Mills (2005) 154 A Crim R 40; [2005] NSWCCA 175.” (formatting removed)


	
	Her Honour referred to the concession made by the applicant’s counsel that the s 25(2) offence fell in the upper range of objective gravity for an offence of that nature (with the Crown submitting that the crime was well beyond the middle range of seriousness). Reference was also made by her Honour to the quantity of LSD involved in the offence, and the evidence of large scale production of the drug for profit.
	
	
	When considering the question of manifest excess, and the quantification of the discount on sentence to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, Latham J concluded that a “starting point” of 24 years imprisonment could not be considered manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Taking into account all that her Honour said about the gravity of the crime, it is my view that the Court proceeded to re-sentence on the basis that the applicant’s crime was an extremely grave one, and was above any notional middle point of the range of seriousness. If the additional offences before the Court on the Form 1 document, the discount on sentence to which the applicant was entitled for his plea of guilty, and the finding of special circumstances are also added into the mix of features relevant to the determination of sentence, together with the applicant’s subjective case, any correlation between the figure of 12 years fixed as the NPP, and the 15 year SNPP, falls away.
	


The “Kentwell Error” Issue


	
	Much of what has been advanced by the applicant relates to a broader question of the approach of the appellate courts to assertions of “Muldrock error” and, on re-sentence, the relevance or otherwise of the sentence imposed at first instance to the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	Since Muldrock v The Queen was handed down by the High Court in 2010, there have been a large number of cases considered by the CCA where error of the nature identified in Muldrock v The Queen has been asserted. Annexed to this decision, as Annexure A, is a list of relevant cases, there being (at the present time) around eighty of them.
	
	
	The first such judgment dealt with by the CCA appears to have been Madden v R [2011] NSWCCA 254. In that case, the grounds of appeal had been formulated prior to the decision in Muldrock v The Queen being handed down, and so it was the Court that raised the issue of possible error, in light of the High Court’s decision. Simpson J (as her Honour then was) noted, at [35]- [36],
	


“It remains the case, even post- Muldrock , that a sentencing judge is to be ""mindful"" of both the maximum sentence for which provision is made, and the standard non-parole period as ""legislative guideposts"": (Muldrock, at [27]). However, the standard non-parole period is not the starting point in sentencing for a mid-range offence after conviction (at [56]); even less is the standard non-parole period the starting point for sentence after a plea of guilty.

Although I have considered it necessary, in fairness to the applicant, to raise the Muldrock issue, I have concluded that no error of the kind exposed in that judgment has been disclosed. While it was not necessary (Muldrock , [25]) to fix the offence on a scale of objective seriousness that his Honour did so (in accordance with the law as it was understood at the time of sentencing) did not deflect the judge onto an erroneous course.”


	
	In Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23, the Court took an approach which was consistent with that adopted in Madden v R. At [26], Davies J, with whom, Whealey JA and Rothman J agreed, said,
	


“In my opinion no error has been shown in relation to the way the Sentencing Judge approached the standard non-parole period. Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre- Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error. What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene. Ordinarily this might occur in cases where an applicant is found guilty by a jury, with the result that the sentencing judge will have considered that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors can be found to justify a variation from it. It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guideline or yardstick.”


	
	In those cases where error was found, the Court often considered the materiality of the error, as part of the process of determining whether a lesser sentence was warranted in law pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. See Dulihanty v R [2013] NSWCCA 275; Crawford v R [2013] NSWCCA 269 and (although error was not found) Weatherall v R [2013] NSWCCA 282 for example.
	
	
	The decision in Kentwell v The Queen was handed down by the High Court on 9 October 2014.
	
	
	In Kentwell v The Queen, the High Court said at [35] per French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ,
	


“[…] In the case of specific error, the appellate court's power to intervene is enlivened and it becomes its duty to re-sentence, unless in the separate and independent exercise of its discretion it concludes that no different sentence should be passed. By contrast, absent specific error, the appellate court may only intervene if it concludes that the sentence falls outside the permissible range of sentences for the offender and the offence.”


	
	Although there appears to have been some divergence of opinion expressed in the judgments of individual justices of the CCA subsequent to Kentwell v The Queen as to the relevance of the sentence imposed at first instance to the re-sentencing exercise (see Thammavongsa v R [2015] NSWCCA 107, for example), it is clear that, whatever relevance the earlier sentence may have, where error has been established the sentencing discretion must be independently exercised by the Court.
	
	
	When moving to re-sentence in Des Rosiers v R, Latham J referred to the sentence at first instance, using the language of re-sentence that was then typical of that process. That does not, in my view, necessarily establish the failure to independently exercise the sentencing discretion, to use the phrase now familiar from Kentwell v The Queen.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the features material to the determination of sentence, including the gravity of the crimes, a matter which has long been a feature of considerable significance to the sentencing process: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. Also taken into account were the offences on the Form 1 document, the subjective case advanced by the applicant, and relevant principles of sentence, in proposing the sentences fixed by the Court.
	
	
	One of the principles of sentencing law that applied to the re-sentencing exercise in 2006 was the requirement to take “a last look” at the sentences imposed to ensure that they complied with the principle of totality and were just and appropriate: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63, per Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, adopting a statement from Thomas, Principles of Sentencing, 2nd edition, 1979, at pp. 56–57.
	
	
	The last look taken at the sentence is one which, in its nature and function, is not without similarity to the process of instinctive synthesis. It allows a sentencing judge to consider the evidence relevant to sentence, in light of sentencing principles, and to assess whether the putative sentence is a proper and just one. It allows for adjustment of the putative sentence before its imposition.
	
	
	It may be concluded that Latham J, having taken the last look at the sentence she proposed, determined it to be a just one in all of the circumstances. The balance of the Court agreed.
	
	
	Whilst her Honour may not have used the language of Kentwell v The Queen, that does not, of itself, establish that the Court failed to independently exercise the sentencing discretion, and fell into “Kentwell error”.
	
	
	A Part 7 application however is not considered through the prism of certain error. It is considered by applying the language of s 79(2) of the CAR Act, and in the light of dicta from the High Court in Kentwell v The Queen, and from the CCA in decisions such as Davis and Aytugrul.
	
	
	Applying the language of the statute, and the relevant law, I have concluded that there does appear to be a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the case. Accordingly, it is proper to grant the application, and refer the matter to the CCA pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Act.
	


orders


	
	The orders I make are:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Criminal (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 the matter is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 79(5) of the Criminal (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 the Registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court is to advise the Minister of Order 1.
	
	
	The Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal is to be advised of these orders, so that a timetable for the hearing of the matter can be fixed.

	THE COURT: 
	


Offences and sentence

On 12 June 2015 the appellant was found guilty of the murder of Amin Sthapit on 11 November 2013. This was after a jury trial presided over by Adams J which had commenced on 1 June. The verdict was a majority verdict of ten to one. The appellant had pleaded that he was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. That plea was not accepted by the Crown. The central issue in the trial was provocation. This required determination on the basis of the law as it stood before the 2014 amendments to s 23 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).


	
	On 14 September 2015 Adams J sentenced the appellant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years, commencing 11 November 2013 and expiring 10 November 2025, with a balance of term of 5 years expiring 10 November 2030.
	
	
	The appellant appeals against his conviction on the following grounds:
	


1. The appellant’s guilt was determined by a majority verdict of the jury, when the terms of s 55F(2)(b) of the Jury Act were not engaged, such that he did not have a trial according to law.

2. His Honour erred in directing the jury at about 12.40pm and/or about 4.20pm on 12 June 2015 that they may return a majority verdict if they could not reach unanimity.

3. His Honour erred in his supplementary directions to the jury regarding the objective limb of provocation: Summing Up 10 June page 19 (Appeal Book page 27).

4. His Honour erred in failing to address the requirements of section 53C of the Jury Act.

The grounds of appeal were amended to add ground 4 during the course of the appeal.


	
	The Crown has appealed against the inadequacy of the sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – The learned sentencing judge erred by finding that the relative objective seriousness of the murder offence is significantly less than the middle range when the only finding open on the evidence was that the offence was at least in the middle range.

Ground 2 – The learned sentencing judge erred by failing to properly take into account the offence on the Form 1.

Ground 3 – The learned sentencing judge erred by ameliorating the non-parole period as a consequence of a finding of “special circumstances” when no such finding was open on the evidence.

Ground 4 – The learned sentencing judge erred by imposing a sentence, the term and non-parole of which both are manifestly inadequate and “plainly unjust”.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Crown case


	
	Because of the nature of the grounds of appeal, the Crown and defence cases may be summarised with greater brevity than might otherwise be necessary.
	
	
	The deceased had for about four months before his death been having an affair with 28 year old Ms Geecy Rebucas, the long term partner of the appellant, who was about the same age. On 11 November 2013 the appellant entered the unit he shared with Ms Rebucas and saw his partner and the deceased engaged in sexual intercourse. He picked up a chef’s knife that was next to the bed and ferociously stabbed the deceased multiple times to his body (fifteen). He was pushed out of the unit by Ms Rebucas, who also told him to leave. He did so. Later he handed himself into police and made admissions. Ambulance officers arrived and attempted to treat the deceased but he died at the scene.
	
	
	Formal admissions by the appellant were tendered in the Crown case. They included an acknowledgment that the deceased died as the result of a number of knife wounds inflicted by him at around 11am on 11 November 2013, that he became aware Ms Rebucas could still be at the unit by using his mobile telephone to contact her mobile telephone and that the incident took place after the appellant had arrived at the address to find the deceased and Ms Rebucas naked together on the bed engaged in sexual intercourse.
	
	
	The appellant and Ms Rebucas had commenced an intimate relationship in 2007. They were involved in a de facto relationship in the Philippines for four years before they decided to move to Australia in 2012. Ms Rebucas had extended family here and wanted to pursue her ambition of training and working as a chef. Shortly after their arrival in Australia, they moved into a small studio apartment in Darling Point. It had a bedroom with a basic kitchenette against one wall and a bathroom. The bed occupied most of the room. The apartment was close to where Ms Rebucas had gained work as a trainee at the Golden Sheaf Hotel at Double Bay.
	
	
	It was no part of the Crown case that the appellant was a jealous or aggressive partner to Ms Rebucas. The evidence revealed him to be a decent and non-aggressive person. The relationship between Ms Rebucas and the appellant was a close and loving one and they had plans to marry. The appellant had no criminal history in Australia or in the Philippines.
	
	
	There were occasions in the month before the death of the deceased when the appellant asked Ms Rebucas if she was okay and if she was happy. In that last month he asked her whether there was anyone else but he did not ask this often. Ms Rebucas denied that there was anything wrong or anybody else, but in fact was feeling less close to him during this period. The evidence indicated that the appellant’s suspicion that something was wrong resulted in him installing software in his and Ms Rebucas’ shared computer which made it possible for him to check Ms Rebucas’ messages.
	
	
	The appellant left for work at 7.30am on the morning of 11 November. Ms Rebucas had sent an email to the Ryde TAFE the previous evening to say that she would not attend the lecture the following morning but would be there in the afternoon. She made plans with the deceased for him to come to the apartment on 11 November. There was no evidence that the appellant was aware of this email or communication.
	
	
	On 11 November the appellant used an application on his telephone to find the location of Ms Rebucas’ iPhone. It showed that her iPhone was in the vicinity of their apartment. Ms Rebucas, however, had in text messages that morning told him that she was “at school”.
	
	
	CCTV footage showed the deceased arriving at 9.42am and being let into the apartment by Ms Rebucas. It showed the appellant arriving at 10.58am and leaving at 11.08am. CCTV showed that the appellant accessed the upper floor via the stairs, rather than by the lift.
	
	
	Ms Rebucas gave evidence that she and the deceased were naked in bed and just finishing sexual intercourse when the key turned in the door. She saw the door partially open and the appellant put his hand in to release the chain. She said that with the chain on and the door partially open, a person on the outside of the door would see the bed straight away. As the appellant released the chain and entered, the deceased ran naked to the bathroom. The appellant kept saying “Why?” as he entered the unit and proceeded to attack the deceased.
	
	
	The appellant immediately obtained a chef’s knife, which had been sitting for a few months in a box on shelves next to the bed, and ran to where the deceased was. Ms Rebucas saw the appellant stab the deceased all over his body, including his trunk, when he was down on the ground on his back. Ms Rebucas pushed the appellant out of the unit. She told the appellant to go and he did.
	
	
	Ambulance officers received notification to attend at 11.14am and first arrived at 11.23am. The deceased died while ambulance officers attended him at the scene. Ms Rebucas told one of the police officers who first attended the scene “my boyfriend came home and just went crazy”. The blood stained knife remained at the scene.
	
	
	Shortly thereafter the appellant surrendered himself to police at St Marys. He was observed by police to look very sad and remorseful. He said that he had stabbed someone and when asked questions about this he said it was “My partner’s boyfriend because I caught her cheating with him”.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the appellant did not act as he did because of a loss of self-control. Some type of planning to injure whomever Ms Rebucas was with was said to be shown by virtue of his suspicions in the month before 11 November, his installation of the software on the night of 10 November and its use in the early hours of the morning of 11 November, his awareness by virtue of the text messages and the discovery of the location of Ms Rebucas’ phone that she may have been lying as to her whereabouts and his use of the stairs rather than waiting for the lift to go to the unit, use of his key to gain entry and his wearing a hood on his jacket as he entered the unit block. The nature of the attack, the absence of attack on Ms Rebucas (although she was accidently cut) to the extent of deliberately putting the knife behind his back when she was near was said to further support this contention. That he was sufficiently composed to drive to St Marys was submitted to offer further support.
	


The defence case


	
	The appellant gave evidence. His evidence does not need to be set out in any detail. He described his thoughts and actions on the morning of 11 November in a way which clearly raised the subjective limb of the partial defence of provocation. This evidence was addressed at [6] – [13] of his Honour’s remarks on sentence (R v Tabalbag [2015] NSWSC 1354). It was set out in some detail in support of his Honour’s finding (contrary to the Crown contention on sentence) that the appellant’s act causing death was done as a result of loss of self control on his part induced by the conduct of the deceased affecting him.
	


THE CONVICTION APPEAL

The course of the jury deliberations


	
	The trial was relatively short and the issues in the trial were in a narrow compass. On Monday, 1 June 2015 the appellant was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter by reason of provocation. The Crown did not accept that plea and the trial proceeded on the charge of murder. The ultimate issue for the jury was that relied upon by the defence, i.e. whether the Crown had negatived provocation. The evidence in both the Crown and defence cases was complete in four days. The Crown case was closed on Wednesday 3 June and the defence case was closed on Thursday 4 June 2015.
	
	
	Following the close of evidence on 4 June, the trial was adjourned (over a long weekend) to 9 June 2015. On 9 June both counsel made their final addresses and his Honour summed up to the jury. The Crown’s final address was very short. The defence final address was somewhat longer but still comparatively brief for a murder trial. His Honour summed up without summarising the evidence. His Honour completed the summing up by directing the jury that their verdict should be unanimous and then invited the jury to retire to consider its verdict. Up to that stage during the summing up, his Honour had not referred to the possibility of the jury returning a majority verdict.
	
	
	The jury retired to consider its verdict at 12.52pm on 9 June. Over 9 and 10 June, parts of the evidence were provided to the jury upon request. A note requesting further assistance as to the definition of “the minimum powers of self-control” of an ordinary person was answered. Late on the afternoon of 9 June, a note was received from the jury (MFI 13 – Jury Note 4) stating:
	


“Jury is at a stalemate at the moment and feeling tired and jaded. We would appreciate it if we could retire early today and re-adjourn tomorrow”.


	
	In response to MFI 13, his Honour reassured the jury by re-stating the need for them to give careful consideration to their verdict and by inviting the jury to leave for that day and to return afresh in the morning when they would “be able to move through into a unanimous decision”.
	
	
	On 10 June a number of notes were received from the jury. These were responded to and the jury continued its deliberations. The transcript records that the jury continued deliberating for the whole of 11 June, without further communication with the court. On 12 June the jury returned to continue its deliberations at 9.30am.
	
	
	On the morning of 12 June, a note was forwarded by the jury stating:
	


“The jury is finding it difficult to come to a unanimous decision. Can you please provide us with some direction as to how juries move forward in this situation?” (MFI 16 – Jury Note 6)


	
	The jury was brought into court at 11.05am to have the note addressed. The transcript indicates that his Honour had seen counsel in chambers after receipt of the note but before re-assembling the court. By that stage the jury had been deliberating for a total of 17 hours and 25 minutes.
	
	
	In the absence of the jury, his Honour referred to the note and said:
	


“…I've discussed this note with counsel in chambers and it seems to me that the appropriate course is to give what is called a Black direction exhorting them to attempt once more to reach unanimity, but bearing in mind that the time has now made it possible for me to take a majority verdict, but I do not propose, and counsel agree with this course, to advise the jury of this power without attempting to reach a unanimous decision before I advise them of that right.”

Each trial counsel agreed with the course proposed by his Honour.


	
	In the course of that direction, his Honour said:
	


“Members of the jury, I have been informed that you are not presently able to reach a unanimous verdict. I have no doubt that you have been genuinely attempting to do so. I wish, however, to make some remarks that might clarify some issues. I do have the power to discharge you from giving a verdict, but I should only do so if I am satisfied that there is no likelihood of genuine agreement being reached after further deliberation. The circumstances in which I may take a verdict which is not unanimous have not yet arisen and may not arise at all. You should understand that your verdict of guilty or not guilty must be unanimous. …”


	
	After that direction, the jury retired to further consider its verdict at 11.11am. In the absence of the jury his Honour then said to counsel:
	


“HIS HONOUR: I mentioned, as indeed the trial book suggests, that the circumstances in which I may take a verdict [scil a majority verdict] have not yet arisen and may not arise. I thought it right to suggest there may be a way out, but to point out that it's not there yet. And of course I can't take a verdict by a majority unless the requisite majority is available.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: That's so, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Although the Bench Book says, if the possibility of a majority verdict has not yet been mentioned, it's not necessary to tell them, given that we are well over the eight hours, I thought that that was a reasonable compromise.” (SU 25.11)


	
	At 12.26pm, apparently without further communication from the jury, the court was re-assembled. In the presence of the jury his Honour invited the jury foreperson into the witness box. The following then occurred:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Madam foreperson, would you just come into the witness box, I need to ask you some questions.

JUROR … SWORN (12.27PM)

EXAMINATION BY HIS HONOUR:

Q. Do you happen to have your jury number there?

A. Yes.

Q. Would you just read it out for the record? (ID handed to his Honour).

A. I can't see it on there. Is it on there?

Q. No, it's not. We'll get it later, don't worry. However, I'm just going to you some formal questions. You're the foreperson of the jury?

A. I am.

Q. Something over an hour ago I sent you out after an indication that you were finding it difficult to reach unanimity?

A. Yes.

Q. The question I want to ask you is, have you made any headway since then?

A. Possibly.

Q. The next question I have is this. Do you think, if you had some more time, you think you might reach unanimity? Now I don't want to ask you that in here. What I want to do is send you out with the members of the jury just for five minutes to discuss whether you feel that unanimity is possible if more time is given?

A. Okay.

Q. And then I'll have you come back and I'll ask you that question.

A. Okay.

Q. All right?

A. Yes, thank you.

Q. If you would just go back to the jury box.” (SU 25.36, 26.32)


	
	By that stage, the jury had been deliberating for a total of 18 hours and 40 minutes.
	
	
	The jury then returned to the court at 12.37pm after approximately eight minutes. The foreperson returned to the witness box and gave further evidence.
	


“HIS HONOUR: Madam foreperson, would you come forward please?

Q. You're still bound by your former oath.

A. Yep.

Q. After discussing it with the jury, has there been agreement of whether or not you're likely to be able to achieve unanimity?

A. We'd like to think we're likely to get there.

Q. Sorry?

A. We'll hopefully get there.

Q. So you'd like some more time?

A. Yes.

Q. I have no difficulty about giving you as much time as you want.

A. Okay.

Q. In the hope that you can reach unanimity. However, given the time that has now expired, if it becomes clear that you're unable to reach unanimity, I am able to take a verdict by 11 to 1?

A. Okay.

Q. But only by 11 to 1 that I can lawfully take such a verdict.

A. Okay.

Q. But you should attempt to reach unanimity. For obvious reasons it's better for the administration of justice if you can.

A. Okay.

Q. And I repeat what I've said before to you and the members of the jury. Listen to each other, take into account what everyone is saying, but again, you must consult your own conscience at the end of the day.

A. Okay.

Q. So I now send you out again and we'll wait to hear from you hopefully with a verdict?

A. Thank you.

Q. It's a matter for you, as I've said, if you find yourselves unable to reach unanimity, then I can take a verdict of 11 to 1.

A. Okay.

Q. Thank you.

A. Thank you.” (SU 27.1)

The foreperson then withdrew from the witness box. At 12.41pm the jury returned to the jury room.


	
	From the transcript there does not appear to have been any discussion with counsel about the fact that his Honour was going to give a majority verdict direction before his Honour gave it. After the direction had been provided and the jury sent out, his Honour did ask counsel whether there was any difficulty with what he had told the jury. Defence counsel said nothing and the Crown Prosecutor simply indicated that if a verdict were delivered, there would need to be clarification as to whether it was a unanimous or majority verdict.
	
	
	The court did not reconvene until about 4pm. By that time a further note had been sent by the jury. His Honour said:
	


“HIS HONOUR: I received a note following note from the jury:

“One of the jury members have just informed the jury members that due to his religion of Buddhism he cannot make a verdict of murder. We believe therefore there has been a biased member of the jury.”

Section 53B of the Jury Act provides for the discretion of the discharge of an individual juror. It would, I think, cover the present circumstances. I have raised this question with counsel in chambers who agree. They also agree with my proposed way of dealing with it. I propose to ask that juror to come into Court and I intend to ask him questions. The kind of questions I would ask, were he, at the beginning of the trial, to have sought to be excused from service on the jury. Do the parties agree? “ (SU 28.25)


	
	Having received the consent of counsel in court, his Honour then had the juror sworn and his Honour asked the juror a number of questions. It was clear from those questions that the juror had considerable difficulty in understanding English. Perhaps the most revealing question and answer was:
	


“Q. No, I'm just asking you about whether you have a religious problem?

A. Sorry, have to be careful, that's why. Say if - I can't say yes or no question point, but I can't say yes murder or manslaughter, but I can't make a decision. Can I say that?

HIS HONOUR: I think that's enough, gentlemen.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I take the view, and I don't think it's a matter which requires analysis that the juror, because of the potential effect of his religious views about which he appears to have difficulty in expressing, he is so affected in his ability to perform the functions as a juror that he should not continue to act as a juror.

What do you say, Mr Crown?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I agree with that.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Wilson?

WILSON: I agree with that. He was endeavouring to explain it but he wasn't –

…

HIS HONOUR: And that is he obviously has a --

Q. You have a difficulty with English?

A. Yeah, that's it.

Q. Did you find it difficult to understand it when I was explaining the case to the jury?

A. I can say yes.

HIS HONOUR: That, I think, is an additional reason; it's unfortunate we didn't know it before.

Q. You're discharged from further duty on this jury. Thank you very much.” (SU 30.36 – 31.26)


	
	By this stage, the jury had been deliberating for a total of 22 hours and 7 minutes. The 11 remaining jurors returned to court and were provided with information about the fact of the juror’s discharge. The following directions were then provided by his Honour:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Now, that means you are now a jury of eleven. I can take a verdict from a jury of eleven and what I said to you before about a majority still applies. In other words, you should attempt to be unanimous as eleven jurors, but if you are unable to be unanimous, I am able to take a majority verdict, but only a verdict of ten of you. So that is the adjustment which is made.

You asked a question about how long you can stay. The situation is, you can stay tonight as long as you feel it is useful to do so. I know sometimes you just get locked into a situation where you are making no progress, you feel that you might be able to make progress if you had further time and the Court just accepts that jurors need as much time as they need. But that you might find that you get to a stage where no further discussion is useful at that point and you want to come back. Unless of course you have decided that you are unable to be unanimous in which case you need to let me know.

If, at the same time, you cannot reach a verdict by majority - and I am not asking what the numbers are of course - then, in due course, if you are unable to reach even a majority, you will need to be discharged and this trial will need to go over for another occasion.

Now, remember what I said to you; listen to each other, consider the evidence, but you are bound by your own individual oaths to find a verdict according to the evidence so in the end it is your conscience that decides the matter.

Now, saying that, how long you take is a matter for you, we can return on Monday. It used to be that we could return on a weekend and on a Saturday, and when I was, in my early days, on the Bench, indeed, we did that where it was convenient to some jurors. But there are a whole lot of practical difficulties affecting the administration of the Court which means that a weekend is not a practical matter.

So I can bring you back on Monday if you feel that that is what you would prefer. But of course if you are able to usefully continue your discussions, it is best that you do so for as long as that is useful. So I will leave that with you.

If you go back to the jury room now and perhaps discuss tonight or Monday, what feels best for you to do, I will wait and then I will consider with counsel what is an appropriate course. But if you decide that, would you simply let me have a note about what you want to do and we will wait for that note.” (SU 33.1 – 34.10)


	
	The jury retired to further consider its verdict at 4.23pm and returned with a majority verdict of guilty of murder (10 – 1) at 4.31pm. By that stage, their deliberations had occupied 22 hours and 15 minutes. No objection was made by either counsel to the trial proceeding with an 11 member jury.
	


Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2

Submissions


	
	The relevant section of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) provides:
	


“55F Majority verdicts in criminal proceedings

(1)    This section applies in respect of a verdict in criminal proceedings where the jury consists of not less than 11 persons.

(2)    A majority verdict may be returned by a jury in criminal proceedings if:

(a)    a unanimous verdict has not been reached after the jurors have deliberated for a period of time (being not less than 8 hours) that the court considers reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the criminal proceedings, and

(b)    the court is satisfied, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation.

(3) In this section:

“majority verdict” means:

(a)    a verdict agreed to by 11 jurors where the jury consists of 12 persons at the time the verdict is returned, or

(b)    a verdict agreed to by 10 jurors where the jury consists of 11 persons at the time the verdict is returned.

“unanimous verdict” means a verdict agreed to by all members of the jury.

…”


	
	The appellant submitted that his Honour had no power at about 12.40pm on 12 June 2013 to tell the jury that a verdict “by 11 to 1” could from then on be taken if they could not reach unanimity (the “majority verdict direction”) as the terms of s 55F(2)(b) of the Jury Act were not satisfied.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the Court did not indicate, either at the time permission was given by the majority verdict direction or at any time up to the return of the majority verdict, that it was satisfied of the requisite unlikelihood in s 55F(2)(b). The appellant submitted that the Court could not have been so satisfied because the foreperson’s evidence was to the contrary – that the jury was hopeful of reaching unanimity and would like more time to achieve it. The appellant submitted that as a result, an essential prerequisite for the acceptance of a majority verdict was not met.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that there was nothing in the surrounding circumstances which could have placed the juror’s evidence in a different light. There were only two notes indicating a difficulty in reaching unanimity. The first could be largely ignored since it was sent at the end of the first day and the second, taken at its highest, indicated a difficulty in reaching unanimity in relatively mild terms. The appellant noted that the jury had been deliberating for a little more than one hour after the provision of the Black Direction when the “majority verdict direction” was given.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that s 55F(2)(b) imposed a mandatory requirement which was a prerequisite for the returning of a valid majority verdict (RJS v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 241; 173 A Crim R 100 at [18] – [26], AGW v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 81 at [27], Hunt v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 152; 81 NSWLR 181 at [28]). The appellant also drew attention to the facts in Pasoski v R [2014] NSWCCA 309 where a majority verdict was taken without any inquiry being made of a member of the jury.
	
	
	In Pasoski Meagher JA (with whom Hidden J and RS Hulme AJ agreed) said:
	


“9   On the third day of their deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial judge advising that they had reached a unanimous decision on five of the seven charges and that, because they were split on the remaining two charges, it was unlikely that a unanimous decision would be reached on the remaining charges in a timely manner, if at all. By that time the jury had been deliberating for at least ten hours. After discussion, the parties agreed in the trial judge's view that a Black direction urging the jury to continue to attempt to reach a unanimous verdict on those charges was not required (Black v The Queen [1993] HCA 71; 179 CLR 44), and that instead a majority verdict direction should be given. The trial judge then took the jury's unanimous guilty verdicts on five of the seven charges (counts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) and proceeded immediately to give a majority verdict direction. Her Honour did not, before doing so, examine any juror on oath and accordingly was not and could not have been satisfied in accordance with s 55F(2)(b).

10   The result was that one of the pre-conditions to the exercise of the power to permit the return of majority verdicts on those charges was not satisfied. It follows that the applicant did not receive a trial according to law in relation to counts 7 and 8 and that accordingly there was a miscarriage of justice requiring that the convictions in relation to them be quashed. …”


	
	There was nothing in the transcript to indicate expressly that his Honour considered whether the jury had deliberated for a period of time that was reasonable, having regard to the nature and complexity of the criminal proceedings. However, when examining the foreperson at about 12.40pm on 12 June his Honour said to her that a majority verdict was possible “given the time that has now expired”. The appellant was prepared to accept that such a statement in the context of the length of the deliberations to that point and the nature of the proceedings, implicitly indicated that the terms of s 55F(2)(a) had been considered and met.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the error in providing a majority verdict direction at about 12.40pm on 12 June was compounded by what transpired afterwards. The appellant submitted that ultimately it is the delivery of the verdict which is the subject of the ground of appeal not the terms of the direction. Because of that the appellant submitted that the whole of the circumstances up to the point of receipt of the verdict are relevant.
	
	
	On that issue, the appellant relied upon the following further provisions of the Jury Act:
	


“19    Numbers of jurors in criminal proceedings

(1)    Except as provided by section 22, in any criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or the District Court that are to be tried by jury, the jury is to consist of:

(a)    12 persons …

…

22    Continuation of trial or inquest on death or discharge of juror

Where in the course of any trial or coronial inquest any member of the jury dies or is discharged by the court or coroner under Part 7A, the jury shall be considered as remaining for all the purposes of that trial or inquest properly constituted if:

(a)    in the case of criminal proceedings, the number of its members:

(i)     is not reduced below 10,

…

and if the court or the coroner, as the case may be, orders that the trial or coronial inquest continue with a reduced number of jurors under Part 7A.

…

53B    Discretionary discharge of individual juror

The court or coroner may, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest, discharge a juror if:

…

(c)    a juror refuses to take part in the jury’s deliberations, or

(d)    it appears to the court or coroner that, for any other reason affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.

53C    Discretion to continue trial or coronial inquest or discharge whole jury

(1)    If a juror dies, or the court or coroner discharges a juror in the course of a trial or coronial inquest, the court or coroner must:

(a)    discharge the jury if the court or coroner is of the opinion that to continue the trial or coronial inquest with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, or

(b)    if of the opinion that there is no such risk and subject to section 22, order that the trial or coronial inquest continue with a reduced number of jurors. …”


	
	The appellant submitted that while he did not take issue with the decision to discharge the juror, s 53C required the Court to consider once it had discharged a juror in the course of a trial whether to continue the trial with a reduced number or discharge the whole jury. If the Court were of the opinion that to continue the trial with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, it was obliged to discharge the jury. If the court were of the opinion that there was no such risk, it was obliged to order that the trial continue with a reduced number of jurors as long as the numbers did not fall below the statutory minimum. The appellant submitted that the second distinct step of this two-stage process was not undertaken by his Honour (Wu v The Queen [1999] HCA 52; 199 CLR 99 per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J at [6], McHugh at [28] – [30], Kirby J at [67] and Callinan J at [103]).
	
	
	The appellant submitted that unlike the trial judge in Le v R [2012] NSWCCA 202 his Honour did not say anything to indicate that he had made a positive decision to continue with eleven jurors. In Le this Court found that the reasons given by the trial judge were “barely satisfactory” but sufficient. Here, the appellant submitted, there were no reasons at all and the transcript gave no indication other than that his Honour was of the view that the trial should automatically continue with the remaining jurors.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that a further difficulty arose because of the observations in BG v R [2012] NSWCCA 139. There Adamson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and McDougall J agreed) said that the determinative issue to be resolved in s 53C cases was not whether there were insufficient reasons but whether the continuation of the trial with a reduced number of jurors gave rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The appellant submitted that the problem in this case was that the court had an indication that the discharged juror was not prepared to convict him of murder. The appellant noted that in BG Adamson J had discussed the authorities concerning the importance of not continuing with a reduced number of jurors where the discharged juror was likely to have voted for an acquittal or at least not voted to convict. The appellant submitted that in this case it was apparent from the terms of the jury’s note and to some extent from the evidence of the juror himself that the juror felt unable to decide on murder or manslaughter so that it was not likely for him to convict of murder.
	
	
	By specific reference to this ground of appeal the appellant highlighted the fact that permission to deliver a majority verdict had already been given when the problem with the juror arose. This, the appellant submitted, exacerbated the miscarriage of justice brought about by the premature giving of the majority verdict direction. The appellant submitted that his Honour in accordance with s 53C should have done something along the lines of either questioning the foreperson again as to the chances of a unanimous verdict following the discharge of the juror or re-directing the jury and informing them that a verdict of eleven of them could still be accepted and that the circumstances had not arisen and may not arise where a verdict of less than eleven might be accepted. The appellant submitted that these were potential methods of dealing with the problem that arose at 4pm. The appellant submitted that if on the other hand, his Honour regarded that kind of exercise as artificial, that was an important factor to take into account in relation to the s 53C consideration and was relevant to ground 4 of the conviction appeal.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that before the juror was discharged his Honour had found that all the pre-conditions of both limbs of s 55F(2) had been met and it was therefore open to his Honour to direct the jury that they should continue to strive for unanimity but failing that, might return a majority verdict. This was because of the very substantial effluxion of time and because it was implicit in the fact that his Honour gave the majority verdict direction when he did, that his Honour was satisfied to the necessary degree in accordance with s 55F(2)(b).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the provisions of s 55F require a practical application to circumstances that arise in trials. On that issue, the Crown relied upon that which Emmett JA (with whom Hall J agreed) said in BR v R [2014] NSWCCA 46; 86 NSWLR 456 at [19]:
	


“19   … It is not to be doubted, however, that the provisions of the Jury Act should be construed in a practical way, having regard to the context in which Parliament intended them to operate (see R v Rodriguez [1998] 2 VR 167 at 186).”

The Crown submitted that Emmett JA construed the first limb of s 55F(2) relating to how to calculate the minimum of 8 hours deliberation in this practical way by referring to the realities of how a jury trial works. The Crown submitted that the same reasoning or approach should be applied to s 55F(2)(b). The Crown noted that RS Hulme AJ in the same case similarly adopted a practical approach when interpreting the legislation and referred specifically to “practical considerations” in his interpretation of Parliament’s intent.


	
	The Crown submitted that the present case was distinguishable from the cases referred to by the appellant because there was no direction by his Honour at any time for the jury to cease its deliberations. The Crown submitted that on the contrary, his Honour had exhorted the jury to reach a unanimous verdict if they could while leaving open the option of a majority verdict. The Crown noted that his Honour did not refer at any stage to a specific time at which he could then accept a majority verdict but rather continued to stress that the jury had time available to continue its deliberations and to give a unanimous verdict if possible.
	
	
	The Crown also relied upon r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) in that at no time did defence counsel object to any of the directions given by his Honour to the jury. The Crown submitted that in relation to the issue of a miscarriage of justice, there was no application by counsel for the appellant at trial to the effect that his Honour was required to (or should) proceed in the manner for which the appellant now contends, i.e. by considering afresh the second limb of s 55F(2) and giving the jury remedial directions.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there is no additional requirement in any of the provisions of the Jury Act or otherwise that the trial judge must re-determine the requirements of s 55F(2) in the event that a juror is discharged at some stage after the majority verdict direction had otherwise been properly given. The Crown submitted that the 11 member jury remained the same “jury” which consisted entirely of all the remaining jurors who had been deliberating up to that stage of the proceedings.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was no additional requirement after the discharge of the juror for his Honour to direct the remaining 11 member jury that consequent upon the discharge of the juror, their verdict once again had to be unanimous and that if appropriate, further directions as to a majority verdict would be given. The Crown submitted that there was no requirement for his Honour to consider afresh the issue of whether the 11 member jury would be unable to return a unanimous verdict before permitting that jury to return such a verdict. The Crown submitted that his Honour had appropriately directed the jury to continue to strive for unanimity and in the absence thereof that a 10-1 majority verdict could be returned.
	


Consideration


	
	As the analysis in RJS v Regina makes clear, the issue of a majority verdict, although a creature of statute, does not involve a mere technicality. It involves an abrogation of an important right, i.e. the right to a unanimous verdict of a jury in a criminal trial. It is for that reason Spigelman CJ said:
	


“16    The Crown conceded that both these errors were made and, accordingly, that a miscarriage of justice had occurred and that the Appellant had not received a trial according to law. This concession was properly made. This ground of appeal should be upheld.

17    The introduction of a majority verdict system in New South Wales was a novelty in this jurisdiction, although it has existed in other Australian jurisdictions for some time. The reasons for the change need not be entered into.

18   The requirement of unanimity on a jury in a criminal case is a long-standing principle of a fundamental character. When Parliament modified this principle it did so by inserting two significant qualifications expressly requiring the attention of the trial judge. The first was that the trial judge had to make a judgment as to whether or not a “reasonable” period had elapsed in all of the circumstances of the trial. The second was to require a formal procedure for examining at least one juror, perhaps more, to satisfy the judge that it was unlikely that a unanimous verdict would be reached.

19    These two matters are essential pre-conditions which Parliament required to be met. Each precondition involves a judgment by the trial judge of a character with which this Court is reluctant to intervene. In the present case, however, on the materials before the Court, the trial judge failed to address either matter. Either would, in my opinion, be sufficient to vitiate the trial. In my opinion, a miscarriage of justice has occurred in the sense that the Appellant had not received a trial according to law.”


	
	Similarly, the High Court emphasised the importance of a unanimous verdict in a jury trial in Cheatle v The Queen [1993] HCA 44; 177 CLR 541. The Court described the requirement of unanimity as “one of the hallmarks of the common law institution of trial by jury”. The Court said (at 552 – 553):
	


“Considerations of principle also support the conclusion that the requirement of unanimity is an essential feature of the trial by jury guaranteed by s. 80. Regardless of the origins of the requirement that the verdict of a criminal jury be unanimous, the common law's unwavering insistence upon the requirement since the fourteenth century has endowed it with the authority of settled doctrine. Indeed, the requirement constitutes one of the hallmarks of the common law institution of criminal trial by jury in that there is a significant difference in nature between a deliberative process in which a verdict can be returned only if consensus or agreement is reached by all jurors and a process in which a specified number of jurors can override any dissent and return a majority verdict. The requirement of a unanimous verdict ensures that the representative character and the collective nature of the jury are carried forward into any ultimate verdict. A majority verdict, on the other hand, is analogous to an electoral process in that jurors cast their votes relying on their individual convictions. The necessity of a consensus of all jurors, which flows from the requirement of unanimity, promotes deliberation and provides some insurance that the opinions of each of the jurors will be heard and discussed. Thereby, it reduces the danger of ""hasty and unjust verdicts"". In contrast, and though a minimum time might be required to have elapsed before a majority verdict may be returned, such a verdict dispenses with consensus and involves the overriding of the views of the dissenting minority.”


	
	In this case what has not been disputed by the Crown is that at no time did his Honour in the terms of the Jury Act say that he was satisfied that it was unlikely that the jurors would reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation. Not only does the Jury Act require that state of satisfaction in the trial judge but it needs to have been arrived at “after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors”.
	
	
	Here such an examination of a juror took place. It could not, however, be said that the response from the juror supported the proposition that it was unlikely that the jurors would reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation. On the contrary the juror responded - “We’d like to think we’re likely to get there” and “We’ll hopefully get there”. That is how his Honour clearly interpreted the responses when he asked whether the jury would like more time.
	
	
	The requirement in s 55F(2)(b) for evidence to be taken from one or more jurors is not a mere procedural step. It is clear from the context that it is only if the examination on oath produces a result that is consistent with the jury being unlikely to reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation, that the next step can be taken, i.e. of giving a majority verdict direction. In this case the preliminary step did not occur. His Honour could not have been satisfied from the responses of the juror that it was unlikely that the jury would reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation. It follows that the requirement of s 55F(2)(b) was not met.
	
	
	This is not to say that it may not be appropriate for a trial judge to take other matters into account, as well as the sworn evidence of a juror, in forming the satisfaction required by s 55F(2)(b). Such considerations could be the length of the deliberation and the nature of the communications from the jury during that time. However, the legislation clearly contemplates that it will be because of the answers pointing to the unlikelihood of unanimity given by the juror or jurors on oath that the trial judge reaches the relevant level of satisfaction not by the mere fact that there has been evidence on oath from one or more jurors on a different topic or pointing to the potential likelihood of unanimity as is the case here.
	
	
	Moreover, the form in which his Honour expressed the majority verdict direction highlights the defect in the process followed. The Jury Act requires that the necessary state of satisfaction be experienced by the trial judge. His Honour was not entitled to delegate to the jury the requirement to be so satisfied. That was a conclusion which had to be arrived at by his Honour. Yet the effect of directing the jury in terms that “if it becomes clear that you are unable to reach unanimity” conferred on the jury a decision making process which should be carried out by the trial judge.
	
	
	It follows that grounds 1 and 2 of the conviction appeal have been made out. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules does not assist the Crown. As the authorities make clear, a failure to comply with s 55F(2) involves a miscarriage of justice in that the appellant has not had a trial as required by law.
	
	
	Rule 4 states that the leave of the court is required before a direction, omission to direct or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence given by a trial judge is allowed as a ground for appeal when no objection was taken at the trial. Grounds 1 and 2 do not come within such a description. In any event, in none of the cases where s 55F(2) has been considered has there been any recourse to r 4. Alternatively, leave would be readily granted because of the risk of a miscarriage of justice (Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at [72]).
	
	
	Similarly, there is no room for the operation of the proviso because of the nature of the error. Failure by the trial judge to adhere strictly to the statutory prerequisite in s 55F(2)(b) breached the appellant’s fundamental common law right to a unanimous verdict. In Hunt v Regina the court noted:
	


“5   … In its written submissions at para 54, the Crown stated that in all the circumstances, this Court might consider that Grounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 had been established with the consequence that there had been a miscarriage of justice in that the appellant had not had a trial according to law. The Crown further conceded at para 55 of its written submissions that the proviso to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 was not available in a case such as the present where the proceedings had so far departed as to have ceased to be a trial according to law, as a finding in such circumstances that there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice was not open: AK v State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438; Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; (2008) 236 CLR 358. …”

That proposition and those authorities are equally applicable here.


	
	In BR v R RS Hulme AJ (with whom Hall J agreed; Emmett JA stating no need to decide) said in obiter remarks:
	


“51   … I take the view that compliance with the eight hour period prescribed in s 55F(2) is mandatory if a majority verdict is to stand and that non-compliance means that a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred in the sense that the Appellant has not received a trial according to law. In those circumstances s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 cannot be used to save the verdict.”

In making that observation, RS Hulme AJ cited RJS v Regina at [19]; AGW v Regina at [23] and Hunt v Regina at [35] – [36].


	
	There was no issue that should these grounds of appeal be upheld, there should be an order for a new trial.
	


Ground 3


	
	The appellant acknowledged that because no objection had been taken at trial, leave was required pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules for this ground to be relied on. There is, however, no need to analyse this ground of appeal in any detail because of the appellant’s success in making out grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal.
	
	
	Part of a jury note forwarded on the afternoon of 10 June (second day of deliberations) was:
	


“The jury is struggling with the definition of “the minimum powers of self-control” of an ordinary person. Can we please have some detailed clarification, if possible.”


	
	His Honour answered the question as follows:
	


“Let me put it in this way. It is the powers of self-control that you would expect the ordinary person to exercise in the ordinary strains and exigencies of life. An example, and it is only an example, someone cuts in front of you in the traffic. You might swear, you might use other rude language but you do not expect to get out and physically attack him.

So dealing with the ordinary exigencies of life, the ordinary problems that we all have, a person is expected to have those minimum standards of self-control. Of course, this was far from what you - a matter for you - but it is not what one would think is an ordinary exigency of life in the circumstances to find what he confronted. It might have been different, for example, had she told him about it. That would not have, you might think, all the emotional impact of actually seeing what he saw. But those are matters for you to judge. I am simply giving you ways in which you might approach that question.

So ""the minimum powers of self-control"" of an ordinary person are those powers of self-control that you would expect someone to exercise when faced with the ordinary problems of life.” (SU 19.4)


	
	The appellant submitted that although this direction was provided with the agreement of counsel (SU 17.42), it was an inadequate answer to the jury’s question and additionally carried the risk of diverting the jury’s attention to judging what he did rather than contemplating what an ordinary person could intend. The appellant submitted that the further direction provided by his Honour in response to the jury question, was potentially helpful to his case but required considerably more to be said to properly convey the relevant law. The appellant submitted that the concept of minimum standards of self-control is not really the test for the objective limb of provocation, i.e. the policy of ensuring minimum standards of self-control as a reason for having an objective limb to the test.
	
	
	The appellant referred to the observation of Brennan J in Green v The Queen [1997] HCA 50; 191 CLR 334 at 340 where his Honour said:
	


“Paragraph (b) requires the jury to take full account of the sting of the provocation actually experienced by the accused, but eliminates from the jury's consideration any extra-ordinary response by the accused to the provocation actually experienced. Thus extra-ordinary aggressiveness or extra-ordinary want of self-control on the part of an accused confer no protection against conviction for murder.”


	
	The appellant also referred to Masciatonio v The Queen [1995] HCA 67; 183 CLR 58 at 67 where Brennan CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ said:
	


“However, the gravity of the conduct said to constitute the provocation must be assessed by reference to relevant characteristics of the accused. Conduct which might not be insulting or hurtful to one person might be extremely so to another because of that person's age, sex, race, ethnicity, physical features, personal attributes, personal relationships or past history. The provocation must be put into context and it is only by having regard to the attributes or characteristics of the accused that this can be done. But having assessed the gravity of the provocation in this way, it is then necessary to ask the question whether provocation of that degree of gravity could cause an ordinary person to lose self-control and act in a manner which would encompass the accused's actions.”

Consideration


	
	The jury’s question and his Honour’s response related to the eighth proposition in the written directions provided by his Honour to the jury. The eighth proposition was in the following terms:
	


“(8) If however, the answer is ""yes"", yes, it is reasonably possible that it actually caused him to lose his self-control:

you must turn to the second question which is:

Could or might the conduct of Mr Sthapit have induced an ordinary person in the position of Mr Tabalbag to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on him? An ""ordinary person"" is simply one who has the minimum powers of self-control expected of an ordinary citizen who is sober and of the same age and consequent level of maturity as Mr Tabalbag. When one speaks of the effect of provocation on an ordinary person in his position, that phrase means an ordinary person who has been provoked to the same degree of severity and for the same reason as he has.

Putting the same question another way:

Is it reasonably possible that the conduct of Mr Sthapit could or might have induced an ordinary person in the position of Mr Tabalbag to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on him?”


	
	Considered in the context of all of the directions that were given in relation to provocation, i.e. not only the written directions but also the oral directions, his Honour’s response to the jury question could not have resulted in the jury failing to properly apply the objective test component for provocation provided in s 23(2)(b) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	Alternatively, to the extent that his Honour’s further directions were inadequate and involved a risk that the jury might be deflected from a consideration of the potential for the ordinary person to have lost self-control to the potential for the ordinary person to have acted in a particular way as a result of that loss of self-control, his Honour’s directions provided a number of very substantial advantages to the appellant which would have been removed if other directions to which the appellant invites attention, had also been given.
	
	
	The example selected by his Honour and the directions that were given were apt to lead the jury inexorably to the conclusion that the situation confronting the appellant had not been (as his Honour had directed) “an ordinary exigency of life” for which the ordinary person was expected to have ordinary powers of self-control. The contrast created by the road traffic example and the scene confronting the appellant could not have been more striking or more likely to result in the jury concluding that the appellant was confronted by an extraordinary situation.
	
	
	Further, the observation that the ordinary person would not be expected to resort to violence in the face of the traffic incident, inevitably raised and left open the possibility that violence as a result of a relevant loss of self-control might well be within the range of responses by a “ordinary person” confronted with the facts of this case. It follows that the contrast between the circumstances of this case and those of the example given by his Honour were apt to compel the jury to conclude that they could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an ordinary person might not have lost their self-control if confronted by the situation in which the appellant had found himself.
	
	
	It further follows that to the extent that the example was inapt and/or the directions focused attention upon the nature of the conduct in response to the loss of self-control, rather than upon the question of whether there could be a loss of self-control per se, those directions were very favourable to the applicant. Accordingly, even if there were error in his Honour’s directions on this point (which is by no means clear), the directions were very much to the benefit of the appellant. For those reasons, the Court is not prepared to grant leave to the appellant under rule 4 to rely upon ground 3.
	


Ground 4


	
	After some preliminary discussion at the commencement of the appeal, the appellant was granted leave to rely upon this ground. Understandably, the Crown had not directed any of its written submissions directly to the issues raised by this ground. In those circumstances, because the appellant has achieved success in relation to grounds 1 and 2, the Court is of the opinion that no useful purpose would be served by any further analysis of ground 4.
	


APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE


	
	Similarly, because of the appellant’s success in relation to grounds 1 and 2 and the strong likelihood if not inevitability of a re-trial, no useful purpose would be served by the Court hearing the issues raised by those grounds challenging the adequacy of the sentence imposed on the appellant. To do so would be to provide something akin to an advisory opinion which this Court has always eschewed. Accordingly, the Court declines to deal with the Crown appeal against sentence.
	
	
	The orders of the Court are as follows:
	



	
	In the conviction appeal, grounds 1 and 2 are upheld and the appeal is allowed.
	
	
	Leave to rely upon ground 3 in the conviction appeal is refused.
	
	
	Ground 4 in the conviction appeal is not considered.
	
	
	The Crown appeal against sentence is not considered.
	
	
	The appellant’s conviction for the murder of Amin Sthapit is quashed.
	
	
	A new trial is to be ordered.

2769124,The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Yiu Cho Fung [2016] NSWSC 379,"Judgment


	
	By summons filed today and sought to be returnable instanter, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police seeks urgent ex parte orders pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth).
	
	
	Tendered in support of the application is an affidavit of Jody Earl, affirmed 4 April 2016, which refers to and annexes a number of documents.  Ms Earl is an authorised officer for the purposes of s 338 of the Proceeds of Crime Act.
	
	
	She deposes to her suspicions that the defendant has committed an offence contrary to s 400.4(2) of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (‘the Code’), being an offence of dealing with money or other property that is the proceeds of crime.  Property the subject of Schedule One to the summons filed by the Commissioner lists property of the defendant, or which is under his control, that is believed to be such property, or property an instrument of crime.
	
	
	Property listed in Schedules Two and Three to the Summons is believed to be the proceeds of crime, in whole or in part, the relevant offences being an offence contrary to s 400.4(2) of the Code, an offence of importing or exporting a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug or plant contrary to s 307.5(1) of the Code, and offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 400.9(1). Each of these offences are indictable offences as defined by s 338 of the Proceeds of Crime Act.
	
	
	The defendant was identified during the course of an investigation into money laundering. He was the subject of surveillance, and information derived from that surveillance is before the Court as part of the evidence.
	
	
	On 1 March 2016 the defendant was stopped whilst in a motor vehicle and found in possession of the sum of $700,000 sealed in vacuum packed bags, together with a quantity of crystalline substance believed to be methamphetamine. A search warrant was subsequently executed upon his home and a number of items seized, including $10,000 in cash, a quantity of a substance believed to be a prohibited drug, and items typically associated with drug supply, such as digital scales and plastic bags.
	
	
	In an interview the defendant claimed to have been given the cash in his possession by a friend, although he declined to name his friend. The defendant is in this country on a student visa. He has no apparent means of support in this country, although he has significant funds in two bank accounts which appear to have been transferred to him from Hong Kong. The motor vehicle the defendant had possession of appears to have been purchased by him with funds that have no legitimate origins.
	
	
	The defendant was subsequently charged with a number of offences and is currently before the Local Court awaiting committal proceedings.
	
	
	The Commissioner seeks to restrain the property set out in the Schedules, before it can be disposed of by the defendant.
	
	
	I am satisfied that there are proper grounds for making the orders sought by the Commissioner and propose to make orders 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the Summons, as the Commissioner requests. Those orders may be entered forthwith.
	
	
	Additionally, the matter is to be listed for directions before the Common Law Registrar at 9am on 27 April 2016.
	
	
	I note the plaintiff has given the usual undertaking as to costs and damages.

2769137,R v Mitchison; R v Wells; R v Whelan (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 464,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Brady SC for the accused Kris Mitchison and Mr Cavanagh and Ms Reed for the accused Ricky Whelan have applied for the jury to be discharged in respect of their clients. In effect, this would leave the trial being concerned solely with the accused Caron Wells.
	
	
	The basis of the application is that prejudicial evidence has been given by Ms Taylor Jane Anderson who is a half-sister to Mr Mitchison and the daughter of Ms Wells.
	


Background


	
	In ruling on a pre-trial application by Mr Mitchison for a trial separate from his co-accused (R v Mitchison; R v Wells; R v Whelan [2016] NSWSC 463) I provided the following overview of the Crown case:
	


“[7] Steven Macleod was a 50 year old man who was in a relationship with Ms Wells. They lived together in Kenneth Street, East Maitland. It seems that the relationship was volatile; they were both heavy drinkers and they argued loudly, frequently and sometimes violently. According to the Crown case statement, arguments between the pair had been escalating in the week leading up to the incident in question.

[8] On Friday 14 March 2014 Mr Macleod and Ms Wells stayed overnight in Newcastle. They returned to Maitland by train. Mr Macleod then caught a taxi back to their home but he forced Ms Wells to walk. It seems that they remained at home, or mostly at home, on the Saturday night.

[9] Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan were friends who decided to catch up that Saturday evening. They went out to a local hotel and then to a nightclub until the early hours. On their way home they decided to drop by Mr Mitchison's mother's home, anticipating that she and Mr Macleod might be awake and that they might have another drink with them.

[10] Very soon after Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan arrived at the Wells/Macleod home there was an incident of physical violence which resulted in Mr Macleod sustaining a head injury (traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage) to which he succumbed about a week and a half later.”


	
	Karen Morris, a next-door neighbour to Ms Wells and Mr Macleod, gave evidence early in the trial. It was her evidence that she was alerted to something occurring and sent her partner, Mr Guy Mallinson, to investigate. She followed a short time later. When she entered the house she saw Mr Macleod lying in the hallway with Ms Wells kicking him. Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan were in the vicinity of the front door. She did not see them assaulting Mr Macleod. She said nothing that could be regarded as inculpatory in relation to those two men.
	
	
	According to versions provided in police interviews the following can be gleaned about the defence cases that will be urged upon the jury.
	


Mr Mitchison’s version is that after he and Mr Whelan entered the house after hearing his mother, Ms Wells, say that she wanted the deceased out of her house, there was an incident in the hallway in which the deceased came at Mr Whelan who struck back in a defensive response. Mr Mitchison then kicked the deceased in the chest/shoulder region and put a foot on him, saying “What are you hitting my Mum for?” Mr Mitchison then moved to the front door area and broke up an altercation between Mr Whelan and Mr Mallinson. He then returned to the hallway and saw Ms Wells kicking the deceased.

Mr Whelan’s version is somewhat similar to Mr Mitchison’s. He told police that after the deceased came at him he threw a punch in self-defence. The deceased fell but Mr Whelan grabbed him to prevent him hitting the ground. Mr Mitchison then kicked the deceased once and Ms Wells kicked him several times. Mr Whelan acted to protect the deceased from further such attack. Later, in a bedroom, Mr Whelan saw Ms Wells again kicking the deceased and both he and Mr Mitchison intervened to stop her.

Ms Wells provided police with quite a different version. She said that there was only one person who assaulted the deceased and that was Mr Whelan. She saw him punch the deceased, hard, two or three times to the head. She categorically denied any involvement herself and said that no-one kicked the deceased. Aside from the police interview, there is evidence of Ms Wells saying much the same thing to a number of witnesses who have given evidence.

Taylor Jane Anderson’s disclosure


	
	Ms Taylor Jane Anderson rang a police “hotline” on the evening of Thursday 31 March 2016 (the second day of the trial) and reported that Ms Karen Morris recently had told her something to the effect that she was going to give untruthful evidence. Attempts were made to obtain a statement from Ms Anderson but she did not co-operate. Ultimately, she attended court on Tuesday 5 April 2016 and gave evidence in the absence of the jury. It was resolved that on the application of Mr Fitzgerald, counsel for Ms Wells, Ms Morris would be recalled so that the substance of Ms Anderson’s account could be put to her.
	


Recall of Karen Morris


	
	Ms Morris was called to give further evidence on Wednesday 6 April 2016. In cross-examination by Mr Fitzgerald she said that she had known Ms Anderson as the daughter of her neighbour, Ms Wells, for a long time. She agreed that she had, by chance, seen Ms Anderson at the East Maitland Bowling Club on the evening of Friday 25 March 2016. They had a conversation for a few minutes. They spoke about personal matters; she described it as “just chit-chat stuff”. She said that there also was mention of the then forthcoming trial. Ms Morris said that she told Ms Anderson:
	


“Don’t worry. I’m going to court. Kris won’t go to gaol. I’m going to go and tell the truth.”


	
	She explained:
	


“What I meant by it is I won’t let them down, I’ll be there, I’ll tell what happened.”


	
	She denied that she said words to the effect:
	


“Tell Kris not to worry because I will have his back in court. I’d rather see Caron Wells in gaol than Kris.”


	
	She also denied saying that she would be “covering” for Mr Mitchison in court. She also denied that it had been her intention “to cover for Kris and, therefore, for Ricky” after discussing the events of the night of the assault upon Mr Macleod with them at her home. In effect, it is suggested that she had concocted a version of the events before she made her police statement on 22 March 2014. (The alleged assault was on 16 March; Mr Macleod was hospitalised on 19 March; the matter came to the attention of police on 21 March; and Mr Macleod passed away on 26 March 2014.)
	
	
	It might be noted that Ms Morris was quite adamant in these denials.
	
	
	Mr Brady briefly cross-examined Ms Morris and secured from her that she had told the police the truth and had given truthful evidence in the trial.
	


Taylor Jane Anderson’s evidence


	
	I granted leave pursuant to s 106 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) for Ms Anderson to give evidence of her version of the conversation at the East Maitland Bowling Club on 25 March 2016. The Crown Prosecutor was granted leave to question her as though cross-examining pursuant to s 38. There was no opposition to either course.
	
	
	Ms Anderson gave the following evidence about the conversation:
	


“Q. I’m going to ask you now to do the best you can to put in precise words if you can what she said and, if you replied or responded, what you’ve said please. What did she say?

A. She said when Kris was in the room she was trying to speak to Kris, and obviously they’re not allowed to speak, and--

Q. Sorry, say that again?

A. When Kris entered the room, as me and Kris and Amy entered the room--

Q. The poker machine--

A. Machine, yeah. She tried to speak to Kris, and Kris isn’t allowed to speak to her, so he walked off, and then she said, she asked when the trial was on, what day it started the week following, and I told her that it was the Wednesday, I think it was, I’m not sure, and she said to tell Kris that pretty much she would have his back, she’d cover for him in court.

Q. When you say “pretty much”, I’m asking you now to try and use the words that she used. What did--

A. She said to tell Kris that she would cover for him in court.

Q. Well, what else did she say, if anything?

A. She said that mum, Caron Wells, deserved to be in gaol.

Q. What else did she say?

A. I don’t remember much after that, it was pretty much the end of the conversation.

Q. What did you say in relation to what she said to you?

A. I just pretty much shrugged my shoulders, I didn’t really have much to say, because it’s my mum.

Q. Well, when she said she would cover for Kris in court, did you ask her what she meant by that?

A. No.

Q. Are they the only words that she used?

A. Yes, that’s all I remember.” (T418)


	
	In cross-examination by Mr Fitzgerald she said that Ms Morris said that “she would rather see Caron in gaol than Kris”. Ms Morris’ version of the conversation was put to her by the Crown Prosecutor but she denied the significant aspects of it.
	
	
	In Mr Brady’s cross-examination, Ms Anderson agreed that Karen Morris had not said that she was going to lie in court. However, she spoke to Mr Mitchison the following morning and told him that “She’s going to lie”. She explained, “that’s the vibe I got off her”. She agreed that Mr Mitchison responded with words to the effect, “Why in the world would she need to lie?”
	


The application to discharge the jury


	
	Mr Brady submitted that in a trial of Mr Mitchison alone there were would not be evidence of Ms Morris saying she was going to “cover for him in court”. Such evidence was only in the trial at the behest of counsel for Ms Wells because it was asserted to be relevant to the credibility of Ms Morris’ evidence inculpating Ms Wells. It was submitted that, despite any direction I might give, the jury would think that Ms Morris admitted covering up for something that she saw Mr Mitchison actually do that was worthy of him going to gaol.
	
	
	Ms Morris had given evidence that Mr Mitchison had “never been a violent person”; she had known him all his life; and “he’s a good kid”. In other words, the jury would regard Ms Morris as biased towards Mr Mitchison and thereby motivated to falsely exculpate him at cost to his largely estranged mother. Mr Brady foreshadowed that this would likely be the effect of Mr Fitzgerald’s submission to the jury. That is uncontroversial.
	
	
	It was also submitted that the expression attributed by Ms Anderson to Ms Morris, that she would “cover” for Mr Mitchison in court would lead the jury to speculate as to what it was that Ms Morris saw Mr Mitchison do that actually led to the death of the deceased that she was not prepared to reveal.
	
	
	It was also submitted that the timing of the evidence of Ms Anderson, it being given at the very end of the Crown case, exacerbated the unfair prejudice.
	
	
	In the course of submissions I raised the case of R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 9 which concerned the difficulty of a jury having regard to some evidence in assessing the credibility of other evidence that was available in the case for one accused but not another. In the way Mr Brady presented his submissions, a similar situation was said to arise here.
	
	
	Mr Cavanagh’s submissions were to the effect that his client joined in the application because his case was so closely aligned to the case for Mr Mitchison.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown submitted, in effect, that the concerns expressed in Mr Brady’s submissions overstated the problem and, if there be any, they could be dealt with by appropriate directions to the jury.
	


Consideration


	
	I reflected on the matter overnight and came to the conclusion that this is what could be regarded as a “storm in a teacup”.
	
	
	Mr Brady’s concern is that the jury might think that Ms Morris saw Mr Mitchison do something to the deceased that she was not prepared to reveal, but she had chosen instead to inculpate Ms Wells. But, aside from Ms Morris, there were four other people present and potentially in a position to say who did what to Mr Macleod. Ms Wells attributes all the violence to Mr Whelan. Mr Mallinson attributes nothing to Mr Mitchison. Mr Whelan attributes most of the violence to Ms Wells with one kick delivered by Mr Mitchison. Mr Mitchison himself acknowledges a kick to the deceased and then placing his foot on him as he was on the ground. Against this background, I cannot see any reason why the jury would speculate that Ms Morris, who was only very briefly in the house as compared to the others, saw Mr Mitchison do something over and above what those people saw.
	
	
	Moreover, there is a valid argument that Mr Brady acknowledged he would present to the jury that Ms Anderson misinterpreted what Ms Morris said. According to her, Ms Morris said in relation to Mr Mitchison that “she would have his back, she’d cover for him in court” and that “Caron Wells, deserved to be in gaol”. Ms Anderson conceded that Ms Morris did not say in explicit terms that she was going to lie; that was simply her interpretation; it was simply “the vibe I got off her”.
	
	
	It is understood that Mr Fitzgerald, on behalf of Ms Wells, will argue that a plan was concocted between Ms Morris, Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan prior to Ms Morris making her police statement on 22 March 2014 to exculpate them at the expense of Ms Wells. There is evidence of some telephone contact but nothing more to support what really amounts to speculation.
	


Conclusion


	
	I am not satisfied that there is unfair prejudice for the trials of Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan to continue jointly with Ms Wells.
	
	
	I am presently doubtful that any direction to the jury is necessary but I am prepared to hear any submission that is made that I should say something by way of direction. It may be that this is probably best left until the conclusion of all of the evidence in the case.
	


Ruling


	
	The applications for the jury to be discharged in respect of Mr Mitchison and Mr Whelan are refused.

2769142,Schneider v AMP Capital Investors Ltd; Schneider v Kent Street Pty Ltd; AMP Office & Industrial Pty Ltd v AMP Capital Investors Ltd; (“Schneider v AMP Capital Investors Ltd”) [2016] NSWSC 333,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff claims damages for injuries which she alleges were sustained on 12 August 2008 when she tripped upon exiting a lift in a building known as Stamford House at 20 Loftus Street, Sydney. The lift had failed to level accurately at the floor upon which the plaintiff was alighting. She alleges that a small step was created and she tripped over it. The defendants to this action and their respective capacities are as described in the following paragraphs.
	
	
	AMP Capital Investors Ltd (“Capital Investors”) occupied the building at relevant times, subject to individual tenancies. In particular it occupied the lifts and the area on Level 1 immediately adjacent to the lift doors where the plaintiff suffered her accident. The registered proprietor of the property is Kent Street Pty Ltd (“Kent Street”) but it is agreed between the parties that full care, control and management of the premises was delegated by that company to Capital Investors.
	
	
	ThyssenKrupp Elevator Australia Pty Ltd (“ThyssenKrupp”) has at all relevant times carried on a business which includes the servicing, maintenance and repair of lifts. Relevantly to the present case, in the period 2006 to 2008 inclusive ThyssenKrupp carried out the regular periodic inspection, testing and maintenance of the two passenger lifts installed at 20 Loftus Street. These services were carried out pursuant to a contract dated 20 March 2003 made between Capital Investors (under a former name) as Principal and ThyssenKrupp as Contractor (“the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract”). The term of this contract was initially five years. It is common ground between the parties to the proceedings that it continued in force beyond the five years and that Capital Investors and ThyssenKrupp respectively continued to perform it throughout 2008, at least.
	
	
	ISS Integrated Services Pty Ltd (“ISS”) in 2007 and continuing through 2008 carried on a business of managing and overseeing the performance of building maintenance contracts between other parties. With effect from 1 July 2007 ISS was engaged under a contract with Capital Investors, self-described as a “Soft Services Agreement”. This Agreement related to numerous properties including 20 Loftus Street. By Clause 22.8 the Soft Services Agreement required that ISS appoint in respect of each property a Facilities Manager. ISS appointed Mr Peter Ray as Facilities Manager for 20 Loftus Street and for four other properties in the same city block. In broad terms the Soft Services Agreement required that ISS through Mr Ray would exercise day-to-day supervision of the performance of various “Managed Contracts” with respect to 20 Loftus Street including the ThyssenKrupp Comprehensive Maintenance Contract.
	
	
	The plaintiff alleges that each of Capital Investors, ThyssenKrupp and ISS owed her a duty of care which was breached on 12 August 2008 as a result of Lift 1 failing to stop accurately at Level 1 of the building. The basis upon which a duty of care is sought to be attributed to each of these defendants will be considered later in these reasons.
	
	
	By a separate Amended Statement of Claim the plaintiff has sued Kent Street for the same damage arising out of the same trip accident. The action against Kent Street is based upon pleaded allegations that it was at all material times the owner of the premises and owed a duty to the plaintiff to ensure that they were safe. That action was commenced in 2010 and the proceeding against the other three defendants was commenced in the following year. Both proceedings were instituted in the District Court, transferred to this Court and then heard together.
	
	
	It appears that the plaintiff probably commenced her action against Kent Street upon the basis of a Real Property Act search and an assumption that the registered proprietor would be the occupier of common areas of the building. The common position now taken by the parties in this Court is that Kent Street is not the occupier and I consider that there is no capacity in which it owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.
	
	
	At the time of the trip accident on 12 August 2008 Ms Schneider was employed by AMP Capital Office & Industrial Pty Ltd (“Office & Industrial”). This company was party to a Property Management Contract with Capital Investors which commenced on 1 July 2008. Although the written contract was not signed until March 2009 I infer that Office & Industrial performed the services described in the contract from its agreed commencement date and that it was paid in accordance with the contract from that time.
	
	
	The Property Management Contract required Office & Industrial to provide services in respect of a large number of properties, including 20 Loftus Street. One category of service to be provided was financial management – invoicing tenants, collecting rent, paying outgoings, estimating tenants’ share of outgoings and providing information to Capital Investors about income and expenditure, to facilitate budgeting, financial reporting and the preparation of tax returns.
	
	
	A second category of Office & Industrial’s services under the Property Management Contract was tenant management. This included the documentation of leases and managing physical (as opposed to financial) aspects of tenant occupancy – authorising fitouts, approving tenant signage, ensuring that premises would be made good upon tenants vacating and the like.
	
	
	A third aspect of the Property Management Contract was building management. This was to include regular inspection of each property “to ensure that the required standard of presentation, cleaning, aesthetic repairs and operations are being maintained” (Schedule of Services, Part 1, Clause 3(c)). Office & Industrial’s work is further described in Clause 3(d) in Part 1 of the Schedule of Services:
	


“(d) Property operations, supervision and management of contractors delivering Hard Services maintenance and Soft Services.”


	
	“Hard Services” is defined in Clause 1.1 of the Property Management Contract to mean “a property’s building structure and items relating to construction and installation as well as physical plant and equipment”. “Soft Services” is defined to mean “non-trade based services such as cleaning, security, evacuation and landscaping etc”.
	
	
	Many more services are described in the Schedule of Services to the Property Management Contract and are therefore within the scope of Office & Industrial’s obligations. However what has been described above is sufficient to show that, for 20 Loftus Street amongst many other buildings, Office & Industrial had obligations both with respect to the commercial management of the property (referred to by the witnesses as “property management”) and with respect to the physical and operational management (referred to by the witnesses as “facilities management”).
	
	
	Since the plaintiff’s trip accident of 12 August 2008 Office & Industrial has made substantial workers compensation payments to her. By a Statement of Claim filed 21 October 2014 Office & Industrial has claimed against Capital Investors, ThyssenKrupp and ISS recovery of these payments. This claim is made pursuant to s 151Z(1)(d), Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW). The recovery action has been heard together with the two proceedings brought by the plaintiff.
	


The plaintiff’s employment in 2008


	
	Number 20 Loftus Street is a nine storey commercial office building. By about mid 2008 most if not all of the leases in respect of the property had expired. The subdivisible lettable areas of the building were either vacant or occupied by tenants holding over pursuant to expired leases or otherwise on short term tenures.
	
	
	In those circumstances Office & Industrial, as the entity which had contracted to Capital Investors to undertake commercial management of the property, wished to sign up tenants in respect of all lettable areas for terms which would continue to the end of 2010. The plaintiff was employed by Office & Industrial to assist with this for six months from 18 June 2008 to 19 December 2008. The letter describing her position, duties and terms of employment is dated 20 May 2008. Although it is on letterhead of “AMP Capital Investors” the opening sentence is an offer of “temporary full time employment with AMP Capital Office & Industrial Pty Ltd”. The terms of this letter were evidently accepted by the plaintiff as she did commence the employment.
	
	
	The letter describes the position offered to the plaintiff as that of “Property Manager, Level 4, in the AMP Capital Office & Industrial Business Unit”. Duties were said to be those “set out in your annual Performance Agreement which you should enter into with your Manager shortly after the commencement of employment in your new position”.
	
	
	The evidence does not establish that any such document was entered into. The letter instructed that the plaintiff should “report to Gary Quig, Divisional Asset Manager”. Mr Quig was the plaintiff’s “Manager” within the meaning of that term as used in the employment letter. He gave evidence but did not identify any schedule or list of duties that the plaintiff was required to undertake.
	
	
	By the time of accepting this employment the plaintiff had acquired some experience in real estate management. She completed her Higher School Certificate in 1990. She studied real estate management at a TAFE college at Crows Nest for two years, 1993 and 1994. In mid 1996 the plaintiff obtained a position as a receptionist in a business which involved real estate sales and investment. She continued with that until 1997 at which time she took employment with Ray White Commercial Real Estate in the central business district of Sydney. She was there concerned with sales of strata titled office space. Whilst in that employment the plaintiff undertook further study towards a Bachelor of Land Economics Degree. She ceased her employment in 2002 for the purpose of studying full time to complete the degree course. That had been achieved by the end of 2004.
	
	
	The plaintiff then obtained employment with Jones Lang Lasalle Property Management in the Sydney central business district, from May 2005 to the end of 2006. With this firm she managed a property portfolio, including liaison and negotiation with tenants. From January 2007 she worked for another city real estate business, Savills, initially full time in early 2007 and later part time through to the first half of 2008. The work was that of a leasing agent for a portfolio of properties owned by the National Australia Bank.
	
	
	Although Office & Industrial’s employment letter of 29 May 2008 does not say so, the buildings in relation to which the plaintiff was employed as a property manager included 20 Loftus Street, an adjacent building and three further properties at the back of these buildings facing onto Young Street which is parallel to Loftus Street. Office & Industrial managed this entire group of five properties, comprising most of a city block, pursuant to its Property Management Contract with Capital Investors.
	
	
	According to Mr Gary Quig the plaintiff “was responsible for the daily running of the properties”, including 20 Loftus Street. She was “responsible for tenancy matters, administration and income issues and had daily if not weekly meetings with the ISS Building Supervisor, Mr Peter Ray”. For the purpose of carrying out his duties as Facilities Manager, in discharge of ISS’s obligations under the Soft Services Agreement, Mr Ray occupied an office on the first floor of 20 Loftus Street.
	
	
	Mr Quig’s evidence did not include any clear account of what the plaintiff was actually instructed to do with respect to 20 Loftus Street in performance of the job for which she had been employed. He said that the plaintiff was designated as property manager for the building and:
	


“… would be responsible for … liaising with the …. tenants in regards to income, raising income, negotiating leases and then also the operational issues which I have discussed previously [ie. such as repairs, maintenance, cleaning, security, electricity, plumbing, lifts and air conditioning]. She would be the person on site that would deal with those issues, well, not on site but deal with those issues primarily from the facilities manager through to the asset management”.


	
	With respect to any responsibility the plaintiff may have had for what Mr Quig termed “operational issues”, this answer, particularly the last sentence, does not describe any duties in a concrete or meaningful way. Moreover it is expressed in terms of practice (what the plaintiff “would” do) but no evidence was given of any course of conduct amounting to a practice which would establish the scope of the plaintiff’s duties.
	
	
	Later Mr Quig said that with respect to any breakdown or malfunction of the systems in the building it was the task of Mr Ray as the Facilities Manager appointed by ISS to call a contractor to assess the problem. In the case of a small value repair Mr Ray had authority to instruct the serviceman to undertake the work forthwith. If more substantial work was required Mr Ray would request that a quote be submitted to Office & Industrial. He also said that:
	


“… depending on the … size of the … problem … [Mr Ray or ISS] would consult with the property manager, and if need be, the property manager may consult with the asset manager”.


	
	As Mr Quig identified the plaintiff as the property manager this answer suggests that she would have some involvement. But at its highest the answer only suggests that the plaintiff would become involved in a repair issue if the cost of repair was likely to be substantial and if Mr Ray or someone else on behalf of ISS raised it with her. There was no evidence to show that at any time during her employment up to the date of the accident the plaintiff had ever received a referral from Mr Ray about the need to attend to any maintenance item, whether minor or substantial and whether in relation to the lifts or any other aspect of the plant or machinery of the building. Further, there was no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff had ever received any instruction that she was required as part of her job to take any responsibility for seeing to the rectification of a maintenance item referred to her, if there should be such a referral.
	
	
	In cross examination Mr Quig agreed that so far as what he termed “operational matters” were concerned the plaintiff was “there to an extent as someone who passed up the line to the assets management branch a request which might require the expenditure of substantial monies”. He agreed that “Mr Ray was the man who was keeping an eye on the fact that the building was running alright”. Mr Quig expressly did not recall what discussions he had had with the plaintiff in the first month of her employment. He did not claim to have instructed her that she had any responsibility for assessing the mechanical performance of the lifts at 20 Loftus Street or reporting on any perceived deficiency in them or any possible requirement that they be replaced or mechanically upgraded.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s evidence was that from when she commenced in the job on 18 June 2008 her task was “largely to negotiate one hundred leases in respect of the four buildings owned by [Capital Investors]”. She said the role also required her “to look after the arrears of any rent outstanding, to liaise with [Mr Ray] and to prepare financial records of the income and expenditure of the four buildings”. Although she referred to “four” buildings in this part of her statement, the Property Management Contract, the Soft Services Agreement and her own evidence at T 180 show that there were five relevant buildings.
	
	
	In cross examination of the plaintiff by counsel for Capital Investors an attempt was made to establish that her duties had included some degree of oversight of the maintenance of the building, to the extent of informing herself about any deficiencies in their condition including in relation to plant and machinery such as lifts, and taking measures to have any such deficiencies rectified. The point of this questioning was to try to establish that the plaintiff was herself the person (or a person) bound by the obligations of her employment to exercise reasonable care to see that the lifts were kept in proper working order and did not fail to level and to make recommendations for replacement or upgrading if the lift equipment should not perform satisfactorily. I find that the plaintiff’s employment carried with it no such responsibility. Nor did she assume any such role.
	


Plaintiff’s description of her accident – in chief


	
	The plaintiff signed an evidentiary statement on 15 March 2015 and adopted it at the commencement of her evidence in chief. She described the tripping incident on 12 August 2008 in these paragraphs (with emphasis added):
	


“17.    On the day of the accident, 12 August 2008, I walked from my office at 50 Bridge Street to 20 Loftus Street so as to speak with Peter Ray. At about 12:30pm I entered the building at Loftus Street from the ground floor. I pressed the call button on Elevator 1. The lift arrived and the two centre opening doors opened. The lift carriage was empty. I moved inside and pressed the destination button for Level 1. Upon arrival at Level 1 the lift carriage stopped and the doors opened. I attempted to exit. As I moved over the threshold, my left foot caught on an uneven part of the exit which, on later inspection, I saw that there was a raised portion of about 4cm higher than the floor of the lift carriage. As my foot caught, I lurched forward at about 70 degrees from the vertical. I jerked back in an attempt to save myself from falling and immediately felt a burning pain across my shoulders. I yelled out to Peter “Peter, I have tripped. Come out please.”

18.   As Peter arrived I said to him “We need to lock off the lift to prevent the lift moving any further.” In response Peter used his special lift key to lock off the lift.

19.   After the event, I moved into Peter Ray’s office. We were there for about 3 minutes. During that time or shortly afterwards, Peter made a phone call to ThyssenKrupp to have them attend to fix the lift. The technician arrived at 1:00pm. I then had a cup of tea in the coffee shop next door with Peter Ray, then I returned to my office to resume work. After I returned to the office I met my boss, Gary Quigg. I informed him that I had just sustained an injury in a lift at 20 Loftus Street and mentioned to him that the lift had not levelled out properly and that the lift mechanics were called to make repairs. During the rest of the day I remained in the office. I was shocked, I was in pain and I was incapable of concentrating on any work matters. I left the office at 5:00pm.”


	
	Several features of this account are important for comparison with oral evidence given by the plaintiff and with the evidence of Mr Ray. First, the expression “on later inspection” in para 17 clearly conveys that the plaintiff did not see the relative levels of the lift car floor and of the fixed floor at the time she tripped. This may be readily accepted. The fact that the trip occurred at all is at least consistent with – and provides some circumstantial evidence of – her not having looked down and seen the difference in levels at the time when her left foot caught.
	
	
	Secondly, there is no suggestion in these paragraphs that the plaintiff turned back to see the degree of difference in levels immediately after she recovered her stance following the trip. Nor does she suggest in this statement that she turned and walked back to the lift after recovering to a stable upright position or that she then pressed the lift call button on the wall to hold Lift No 1 at the floor upon which she had just alighted. The absence of any such assertions becomes significant in light of her later evidence in cross-examination, to be referred to shortly.
	
	
	Thirdly the fact that the plaintiff says in para 17 that she “yelled out to Peter ‘Peter, I have tripped. Come out please’” indicates that when she made the evidentiary statement she recalled Mr Ray not having been in the immediate vicinity of the lift doors but inside some other area from which he was summoned to “come out”. During Mr Ray’s evidence he drew a sketch, Ex 1.4, which showed that the foyer in front of the lifts was about 2 metres wide and 3 metres long (across the face of the lift doors). Past the lift doors the foyer extended another 3 metres to the left from the viewpoint of a person exiting the lifts, to a door which led in to a large ante room. This ante room was about 6 to 7 metres across. At the far side of it was a second door leading into Mr Ray’s office in which he was seated at the time the plaintiff tripped. I accept Mr Ray’s evidence about the floor layout and dimensions and concerning his position at relevant times.
	
	
	Fourthly, para 18 of the witness statement also confirms that Mr Ray was not in the lift foyer when the plaintiff tripped and nor was he nearby, such as in or close behind the doorway which led off the lift foyer to the ante room. Paragraph 18 commences with the words “As Peter arrived…”. I infer that when the plaintiff made her statement she recalled Mr Ray coming from some other place to her location, in response to her having “yelled out to him”. I find that that other place was Mr Ray’s office.
	
	
	Fifthly, the plaintiff’s statements in para 18 that she requested Mr Ray to “lock off the lift to prevent the lift moving any further” and that he “used his special lift key to lock off the lift” amount to an assertion that the lift had remained at Level 1 up to this point and that Mr Ray locked it off there. Mr Ray has said that this did not occur, in evidence which I will recount later in these reasons.
	
	
	In evidence in chief the plaintiff described the tripping accident in answers partially extracted as follows (at T 111.41 – 114.12)

Q. Did he come out and see you at the lift?

Q. What was the time you think of your accident?

A. Just after a quarter past 12.”


	
	In this passage the plaintiff made it explicit that she had not noticed the level discrepancy at the time the lift stopped: T 112.34. She did not assert that she had seen any level discrepancy let alone the height of the step created, as she tripped. She did not say when if at all she had made an observation upon which she could have based her estimate of the height difference at “an inch and a half to two inches” (T 112.23, being 38.1mm – 50.8mm). Notably the plaintiff said “I’m not really sure” (T 112.15) what the height difference was and with respect to a differential of one and a half to two inches, which she illustrated with her hands, she said “it might be, have been, about that much” (T 112.15) and later “it was probably about that much” (T 112.20).
	
	
	The uncertain way in which the height differential was stated is to be considered together with the absence of nomination of any point in the whole sequence of events at which she made an observation upon which such an estimate could be based. In those circumstances, her estimate is for all practical purposes completely unsupported and not a basis upon which I could make a finding that the level differential was within that range or any range.
	
	
	Consistently with her evidentiary statement the plaintiff in oral evidence in chief (as quoted at [36]) did not suggest that she had turned and walked back to the lift, to stop it at Level 1 by pressing the call button, after she recovered her stance following the trip. In this passage, when stating that after Mr Ray arrived on the scene he “went and locked the lift off”, the plaintiff did not suggest that she had held it at Level 1 by depressing the call button on the wall in the meantime.
	
	
	With respect to Mr Ray’s location at the time the plaintiff tripped, her answer that she “got Peter Ray’s attention, he came out and helped with me” (T 113.39, emphasis added) is consistent with Mr Ray having been in his office or, at least, not in the lift foyer and not in or behind any doorway off it, at the time the plaintiff alighted from the lift.
	


Plaintiff’s description of accident in cross-examination


	
	Counsel for Capital Investors cross-examined the plaintiff about the circumstances of the tripping incident at T 182.26 – 191.26. Omitting some questions and answers which I consider not material and omitting objections and repetitions the evidence was as follows:
	


“[182.26] Q. You pressed level 1?

A. Yes.

Q. Then the doors opened?

A. Yes.

Q. You started walking out?

A. Yes.

Q. The next thing you know is that your left foot got caught?

A. Yes, I tripped from the lift.

Q. You didn’t fall down onto the ground.

A. No.

Q. You tripped and in the process of falling you were able to stumble and regather your balance?

A. Yes. I got, I got like a whiplash, thrown forward and then back.

Q. So you’ve gone back and it’s in the process of coming back up you’ve somehow got a whiplash, you say?

A. Yes, I, I did get a whiplash.

Q. You said that you were aware of immediate terrible pain in your neck and right across your shoulders. Is that correct?

[183.1] A. Yes.

Q. You immediately cried out for help?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that correct?

A. That is right.

Q. Do you say someone came out to help you?

A. Peter Ray came.

Q. You were asked some questions about the height differential between the floor of the lift and the outside floor. Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. You weren’t able to say with any certainty what sort of height differential there was. Do you remember that?

…

[183.25] HIS HONOUR

Q. What counsel is doing is referring you to evidence that you gave this morning--

A. Yes.

Q. --when you were asked about the height difference and he’s put to you that when you answered those questions this morning you weren’t able to state with accuracy or precision what the height difference in the floors was.

A. Yes. Yes.

POLIN

Q. Is that right? Because you’d stumbled out of the lift.

A. Yes.

Q. And you’d recovered your balance and come back up and you were immediately in pain?

A. Yeah.

Q. Your first reaction was to call out to someone?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that right?

A. Peter. Yeah, when I was – Peter Ray used to stand at the door waiting for me if he knew I was coming over, so he, he – I don’t know if he saw me

[184.1] stumble out, I have no idea. I don’t, I don’t believe he did, but he came very quickly and locked the lift off.

Q. I want to suggest to you that in fact by the time you stumbled and got yourself up and realised you were in pain, the lift had actually shut behind you.

A. No. That lift, that lift was locked off and there is a lift docket saying that of the call out time and the lift docket also says that it had – that it wasn’t immediately meeting at floor level and there was, in fact, a gap between the floor level and the lift.

Q. I want to suggest to you that the doors closed and you didn’t actually ever see the difference in height between the level of the lift and the level of the floor.

A. No.

Q. That’s right, isn’t it?

A. No. No, that’s not right. It’s not right.

…

Q. Peter Ray was in his office, wasn’t he?

A. I just said he was – he has a glass door and stands – he used to stand there and wait for me when he knew we were coming – when I knew – he was – I was coming because we’d always go downstairs and have a coffee.

Q. I want to suggest to you on this particular day you went into his office and he was not standing at the door waiting for you?

A. Well, I don’t know. I don’t believe that to be true at all. That’s not how I remember it.

Q. I want to suggest after you’ve reported the incident to him that he has to press the button to get the lift to come back up to level 1.

A. I don’t recall it being that, that way.

Q. It’s only after he did that that he was able to lock the lift off?

A. No. The, the lift remained on level 1 and I, I instructed him to take it out of

[184.38] action. I was pretty hysterical.

…

[185.34] POLIN

Q. The lift arrived at level 1, you went to get out. Your left foot got caught and you stumbled or tripped forward. You attempted and, indeed, did regain your balance by bringing yourself back up. I think you said you got a whiplash doing that. You felt immediate pain in your neck and across your shoulders and you were hysterical, that Peter Ray was standing at his door, which I take it is close to the lift. You immediately gave him an instruction to shut down the lift and he was in possession of the key to the lift and before the lift doors closed he got into the lift and shut it down. Is that the way you say it happened?

A. No.

HIS HONOUR

Q. What’s different about it, Ms Schneider? What’s counsel misunderstood in that?

[186.1] A. Well, it’s made – it’s been made to made out that there wouldn’t have been the time.

Q. Don’t worry about the impressions--

A. But that’s not right.

Q. --that might be gained from it or anything argumentative about it, but just concentrate on the--

A. It’s only how I remember it.

Q. --facts of the sequence.

A. I remember that when I tripped Peter Ray – when – and I’ve already said this, I’m repeating myself I’m sorry, but he used to wait at the glass door, his glass door, and wait for me, so he knew there was something wrong because he heard me. Now, I can keep the lift on that floor by pressing the call button,

[186.16] okay, and then it stays on the floor, so that’s what I probably did and he comes out with the lift key and locks it off. Then we called ThyssenKrupp straight away and we went down to the downstairs foyer and we waited for them for half an hour to arrive and I waited until they fixed the lift. Now, the lift docket clearly states that there was a levelling issue that day and how much it

[186.21] hadn’t levelled by.

…

[187.5] HIS HONOUR

Q. What did you say? Just explain what stop button you have spoken about in your earlier evidence.

A. I said the call button on the outside of the lift stopped the lift from moving so Peter Ray had time to get out and lock the lift off. I never said I got back into the lift and I never said I pressed the stop button. It’s not what I said.

[187.12] [POLIN]

Q. You never originally said that you got back up and went and pressed the call button to stop the lift leaving the floor?

A. It wasn’t a matter of getting back up. I was virtually knocked my face open on the, on the tenancy it was so close. So I could turn around and press the call button so the lift didn’t go anywhere. And Peter Ray’s office was from about here to that second – the bench behind where the girls are sitting.

Q. I understand you could do that, but what I’m suggesting to you is you didn’t do that.

A. Didn’t do what?

Q. Press the call button.

A. I – how do you – why are you saying I didn’t do it?

Q. Because I want to suggest to you that when you went into Peter Ray’s office and came back out with him and the lift had already gone.

[187.29] A. But that, but you’re making up a story. I don’t understand.

…

[188.49] Q. I’ll just go back a step at a time so you’re clear. It’s not in your evidentiary statement, is it, that you pressed the call button--

A. No, it’s not.

Q. --to keep the lift on the level.

A. No, it’s not.

Q. Mr Toomey asked you how the incident occurred, and you didn’t say in answer to his questions that you went back and pressed the call button to keep the lift on the level, did you?

A. No, I did not.

Q. And when I first asked you how it actually happened, you didn’t say that you went back and pressed the lift button to keep the lift on the floor, did you?

A. No, because how I interpreted what you were saying is you were, you, you were trying to put words in my mouth, that I’d done this and I’d said this and I’d done that, when I hadn’t at all. So I, that’s why I didn’t understand your,

[189.16] your line of questioning.

…

[189.40] Q. All I’m suggesting to you is only after I put the long question to you and suggested how ridiculous that series of events would have been, that you for the first time said that you went back and pressed the call button to keep the lift on the floor.

A. I don’t agree.

HIS HONOUR

Q. When have you previously referred to that, if at all, Ms Schneider?

A. I, I haven’t--

Q. The fact that you pressed the call button?

A. I, I haven’t, I haven’t, your Honour.

[190.1] Q. And why hasn’t that previously been referred to in your accounts?

A. I’m not sure. We’re going back seven years and it’s really quite different and difficult, and I know that’s – because I had to keep the floor on level till Peter Ray came to lock it off, lock the lift off, take it out of service. But I didn’t go back into the lift and press the stop button and that’s, that’s not my – that’s in, in my statement. I didn’t enter the, I didn’t re-enter that lift again to press the stop button, so--

POLIN

Q. I want to suggest to you that in terms of the circumstances of your trip, you did not ever have the opportunity to observe and accurately identify the difference in level between the lift and the floor outside.

A. That was confirmed when the lift, when the lift – ThyssenKrupp was called out to, to level – realign the lift, and it was in the lift service docket, how much it had not levelled to the floor.

Q. So--

A. I believe there is a copy of that somewhere.

Q. So when you’re giving evidence about your estimate as to--

A. Yes.

Q. --the difference in height between the lift--

A. Yes.

Q. --floor and the--

A. Yes.

Q. --level of the floor, you’re basing that upon a document that

ThyssenKrupp--

A. No.

Q.--created that identified a difference in level.

A. No, I, but I also – when, when the lift was locked off I was able to see as well.

[190.41] Q. So I want to suggest to you that the lift was only locked off after Mr Ray called for the lift to come back to the floor.

A. No, that’s not correct. The lift remained on level 1. The lift remained on level 1. I’ve maintained that the whole time. That’s what I’m trying to say. It remained on level 1.

HIS HONOUR

Q. With the doors opened?

[190.51] A. With the doors open, your Honour.

…

[191.18] Q. You have said that you have always maintained that the lift remained there.

A. Yes, yes.

Q. And with the doors open.

A. Yes.

Q. Where have you previously said that?

A. In, in here today, and I was trying to say it before when it was taken that I

[191.26] said I got back in the lift and pressed the stop button, but I didn’t do that.”


	
	This subject was returned to at T 201.5 – 201.22 and at 202.14 – .16:
	


[T 201.5] “Q. Just going back to a couple of the matters I dealt with yesterday, I want to suggest to you at no stage were you able to accurately identify the difference in level between the lift floor and the outside floor.

A. I believe it was about that much.

Q. I know you believe that.

A. Two inches.

Q. I want to suggest to you that that is nothing more than a guess that you’re making after the event?

A. No. I saw, I saw the – it was about that much, but the lift docket from the call out to fix the levelling issue will say exactly how much it was on level 5. If you refer to that it will be on that, I believe.

Q. Every time I ask you the question you refer back to that particular document and I want to suggest to you that the evidence you’re giving about he (sic) height differential in the lift is based on your seeing that document?

A. No. No.

…

[T 202.14] Q. You said yesterday you didn’t look down and see the height differential before you walked out. That’s what you told us yesterday.

A. No. I wasn’t aware until I’d tripped out of the lift.”

Mr Ray’s evidence concerning the day of the accident


	
	The statement of Mr Peter Ray made 12 June 2015 contained these paragraphs regarding the tripping incident:
	


“14. I remember that Eugenie came into my office one day and said words to the effect of, ‘The lift didn’t level. I’ve hurt myself’.

15. Eugenie was upset. I sat her down and then went and isolated the lift.”


	
	At T 369.35 and following Mr Ray gave evidence in chief that he was in his office “just after lunch” on the day of the incident, when the plaintiff entered the ante room (as described at [33]). He heard the outer door (leading off the lift foyer and into the ante room) being opened and he went out from his office to meet the plaintiff. She appeared to be “in some distress” and was about halfway across the ante room.
	
	
	Mr Ray helped the plaintiff into his office and seated her in a visitor’s chair. She said she had tripped coming out of Lift No 1. Mr Ray took his “independent lift key” and “went out and located the lift because the lift had left the floor [ie Level 1] at that stage”. He went down the fire stairs to the Ground Floor, pressed the Lift No 1 call button on the wall and when it arrived locked it off and turned out its lights. When the lift was locked off the lift doors remained open.
	
	
	Mr Ray gave evidence that Lift No 1 “appeared normal” with respect to levelling at the Ground Floor. He next contacted ThyssenKrupp to advise that there had been an incident of Lift No 1 not levelling correctly and to arrange attendance of a serviceman. He returned to his office. The plaintiff said she was alright and did not need to be assisted back to her office in another building. She left.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Ray said that early in the plaintiff’s employment, for the first “couple of times” when she came from her office to meet with him at 20 Loftus Street, she had phoned ahead to say she was coming and he waited for her at the door of his office. However he did not do so on this occasion, which was over seven weeks into her employment. During those seven weeks she had visited his office on average twice per week. Mr Ray denied that he had been waiting for the plaintiff near the door between the ante room and the lift foyer and that he went out to the plaintiff after hearing her call out in distress. He also denied that he had isolated the lift at Level 1.
	
	
	It was not put to Mr Ray that the plaintiff was holding the lift at Level 1 by depressing the call button on the lift foyer wall at any time when he could have observed this. His account of events was directly contradictory of this proposition. He recalled first seeing the plaintiff nowhere near the Level 1 lift call button but, rather, halfway across the ante room and, therefore, several metres from the call button. Mr Ray had a specific recollection that he went down to the Ground Floor where the lift indicator board was located. Upon ascertaining where Lift No 1 was, he brought it down to the Ground Floor and isolated it there.
	
	
	I accept Mr Ray’s evidence. He gave a clear account of the plaintiff coming into the ante room and of his own action in then isolating the lift at the Ground Floor. He has no interest in the outcome of the proceedings and no reason to represent events otherwise than in accordance with his honest recollection. The occasion was evidently memorable to him because of the apparent distress of a young woman with whom he had a working relationship and because of the necessity for him to assume responsibility for having the faulty lift stopped and rectified.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s counsel suggested that Mr Ray’s memory was poor and that this was evidenced by his lack of recollection of a Hazard and Risk Assessment of the lifts at 20 Loftus Street which Mr Ray had commissioned from ThyssenKrupp in October 2006 and which he had discussed with a ThyssenKrupp representative at that time (“the Assessment”). I do not consider that his lack of recollection of the Assessment demonstrates a general significant deficiency of recall. Mr Ray was no more than a conduit in relation to this Assessment, as between ThyssenKrupp and his superiors in the company which employed him in 2006, Resolve Engineering Pty Ltd trading as Resolve FM. Mr Ray was not the decision maker with respect to the findings and recommendations of ThyssenKrupp contained in the Assessment. He had no occasion to revisit it or think of it again in the nearly nine years between having received the document and the date when he gave evidence.
	
	
	Similarly, I reject the plaintiff’s criticism of Mr Ray’s powers of recall based upon his lack of recollection of an asserted second fault report logged with ThyssenKrupp the day after the plaintiff’s trip incident. For reasons stated at [62] by reference to the ThyssenKrupp service records I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Ray ever did make a second call to the lift service company on 13 August 2008. It is equally possible that the ThyssenKrupp documents merely record a second attendance pursuant to the original call on 12 August. In any event, Mr Ray had no particular reason to have retained a memory of having summoned a ThyssenKrupp serviceman a second time on the day after the plaintiff’s accident, if that did occur. His failure to recall this event is not significant in my assessment of his general reliability.
	
	
	Further, Mr Ray’s evidence regarding the plaintiff entering the ante room and concerning him descending the stairs to the Ground Floor to lock off the lift is a positive recollection which in significant respects contradicts the version of events given by the plaintiff in cross-examination. For Mr Ray’s evidence in these respects to be displaced it would require more than merely a demonstration that he has tended to forget some things and that he therefore may also have forgotten others.
	


Rejection of plaintiff’s evidence concerning the aftermath of the trip


	
	Having regard to the manner in which the plaintiff answered questions in cross-examination (see [41] – [42]) and the sequence in which aspects of her account of critical events emerged during that questioning, I do not accept her case that Peter Ray came out to her in the lift foyer so soon after she had tripped that, upon doing so, he was able to and did lock the lift off at Level 1. I reject the plaintiff’s evidence that she held the lift on Level 1 by depressing the call button until he arrived. I do not accept that she would have had the presence of mind to do so, given that she was, in her own words, “pretty hysterical” (T 184.48) and, in Mr Ray’s assessment, “in some distress” (T 370.4). In claiming to have detained the lift on Level 1 the plaintiff was at best tentative. She said that pressing the call button on the lift foyer wall was “what I probably did”: T 186.16, quoted at [41].
	
	
	The plaintiff’s claim in this respect is rendered highly unreliable by the fact that she made no mention of having held the lift until Peter Ray arrived in her evidentiary statement or in her oral evidence in chief. Such an action on her part would surely have been mentioned in one or both of those places if she had a genuine recollection of it. The plaintiff could offer no explanation for not having described her supposed action in this respect at any time earlier than her cross-examination: T 190.4 - .10.
	
	
	The plaintiff had a strong motive to embellish her recollection in this way during cross-examination because it was made clear to her that she was under challenge as to whether she had had any opportunity to observe the height of the step created by the lift having stopped out of level. Counsel put to her early in the cross-examination that the lift door had shut behind her: T 184.5. From my observation of her in the witness box and from her educational attainments I find the plaintiff to be an intelligent woman who would have well understood the difficulty for her case if she could not establish that the lift had remained at Level 1 where she could have observed the height of the step.
	
	
	The only contemporaneous record of what occurred tends to confirm Mr Ray’s evidence (that the lift was not held at Level 1 until he came out and locked it off there) and to rebut that of the plaintiff. At Ex D p 524 is an ISS Incident Report prepared by Mr Ray (T 371.50), signed by him and dated the day of the incident. The substance of the report reads as follows:
	


“It was reported by the property manager (Eugenie Schneider) to Peter Ray that she tripped on the lift sill exiting the lift on Level 1. Eugenie has indicated that the lift did not stop level with the floor causing a trip hazard. Eugenie indicated that she has injured her neck in the incident.

Peter Ray placed a service call to ThyssenKrupp Elevators for a technician to check and adjust lift N#1. Peter then removed the lift from service on the ground floor. The ThyssenKrupp technician arrived on site at 1300 and made adjustments to the lift. The lift was returned to normal operation at 1500. Service docket 352124. The lift was working ok when checked later in the afternoon.”


	
	The fact that Mr Ray recorded only what the plaintiff told him about the lift not having stopped level with the floor and did not record any observation of the degree to which Lift No 1 was out of level is a strong indication that Mr Ray did not see the lift held on Level 1 by Ms Shneider in the position in which it had caused her to trip. Further, the report notes that Mr Ray “removed the lift from service on the ground floor” – not by locking it off at Level 1 where the plaintiff claims to have held it.
	
	
	My acceptance of the evidence of Mr Ray and rejection of the plaintiff’s claim that she observed the height of the step upon Peter Ray locking the lift in the position from which it had caused her to trip means that the plaintiff has failed to establish on the balance of probabilities what it was she tripped on. This is fatal to her endeavour to prove breaches of duties of care alleged to have been owed to her by the defendants.
	


Findings of the ThyssenKrupp serviceman on 12 August 2008


	
	ThyssenKrupp’s contemporaneous reports following the investigation by its serviceman of the malfunction of Lift No 1 on 12 August 2008 do not assist the plaintiff to establish the height of the out of level step upon which she tripped. As I have found that the lift was not locked off in the position in which it had been when the plaintiff alighted, the Thyssenkrupp serviceman could not and did not make any record of how far out of level it was when the incident occurred. The serviceman’s record for 12 August 2008 (incident number 256989 at Ex D p 493) records the customer complaint in these terms:
	


“(Peter Ray) Lift 1 not levelling on any floors. See Peter on arrival. ETA required”.


	
	I find that this is an inaccurate record of Mr Ray’s telephone request for service. I accept his evidence that the only knowledge he had of the lift not levelling on 12 August 2008 was what the plaintiff had told him, which referred to the position of the lift on Level 1. I accept his evidence that he did not have any opportunity to see the lift’s accuracy of levelling at any other floor before he called it down to the Ground Floor and locked it off.
	
	
	The service report summarises the findings and actions of the technician in these terms:
	


“Replaced up levelling selector contact. Adjusted up and down levelling selectors. Checked operations and couldn’t fault. Returned to service.”


	
	A further serviceman’s call out report (No 257119) dated 13 August 2008 also appears at Exhibit D p 493. The request for service is recorded as: “(Peter) Lift 1 not levelling”. As stated at [51] Mr Ray had no recollection of making a second request for service of the lift on 13 August 2008. The author of this record was not called. The evidence does not permit me to find on the balance of probabilities that a second call in these terms was made. It is just as likely that the same ThyssenKrupp serviceman (Mr Palanisamy) decided to return to the building on 13 August 2008 because he had been unable to find a fault on the preceding day and because the matter was of some significance in that a lift passenger had been injured. If that is what occurred it would be quite consistent with the circumstances that ThyssenKrupp’s service record for the second visit should identify the call out request in the terms quoted above, intending thereby to refer to a single call out from Mr Peter Ray received the preceding day.
	
	
	On 13 August 2008 the serviceman’s finding was:
	


“Adjusted levelling cam. Checked operations & returned lift back to service”.


	
	ThyssenKrupp prepared a third party accident report on or about 12 August 2008 (Ex 2.1 p 352 – 354). This recorded the manner in which the accident occurred (evidently having been related to ThyssenKrupp by Mr Ray) in these terms:
	


“The lady tripped as she exited lift resulting in pain to the neck. It was stated that the lift was not level with the landing (exact difference from car to landing not mentioned)”.


	
	In the same report, the remedial action taken was described as follows:
	


“Checked lift levelling on all floor (sic) in both directions (no level to be found in excess of 7mm). Replaced UP levelling brush and check of selector levelling and stopping brushes with minor adjustments made”.


	
	These records of ThyssenKrupp do not remedy the gap in the plaintiff’s evidence in the fundamental respect of lack of proof of the degree of levelling inaccuracy on the day of the accident.
	


Characteristics and performance of the lifts at 20 Loftus Street


	
	Both of the lifts in the building are of the same type and were installed in approximately 1972. This case concerns only Lift 1 and I will refer to its features in the singular, although they are equally applicable to the other lift which was side by side with it. The following description applies to Lift 1 as it operated from installation in 1972 up to the date of the accident and for some time after.
	
	
	The lift mechanism was of a type known as “gearless traction”. An electric motor at the top of the lift-well powered a winch which raised and lowered the lift car on cables. A composite piece of mechanical and electrical machinery at the top of the well, known as the selector, was able to regulate the stopping of the lift. It received and was activated by electrical signals from the floor selector buttons in the lift car and from the call buttons in the lift foyers. By these means passengers were able to call the lift to a floor and, once inside it, choose where it would stop.
	
	
	Uncontested evidence given by a highly qualified and experienced lift consultant, Mr JE Thompson, has established that there are a number of features of a gearless traction type lift system such as that described above which may cause the lift car from time to time to stop in a position where the lift floor is not precisely level with the fixed floor of the building at the destination selected. First, any of a number of influences could cause the voltage of the electricity supply to the electric motor to vary. This would translate into a variation of the speed at which the hoist would raise or lower the lift and, in particular, the speed at which the lift would level in to a particular floor. Variants in the levelling-in speed could result in the lift overshooting or failing to reach its ideal position in the lift-well.
	
	
	Secondly, wear on certain components of the selector (referred to as “cams” or “pie plates”) could cause inaccuracy in the stopping position of the lift. Thirdly, weight sensors fitted under the lift-car floor could become inaccurate over time. This could cause the machinery to miscalculate the amount of power reduction required to allow the lift to slow in to a stop. The result would be, again, either overshooting or failure of the lift to reach its intended level.
	
	
	In general terms Mr Thompson described the selector as “a mechanical device with electrical relays attached to it” and as being “mostly mechanical rather than electrical”. As a result of these features Mr Thompson’s opinion is that it was inherent in this type of lift that it would “from time to time provide poor floor levelling accuracy”. The lift could at times stop 25mm to 30mm out of level and the incidence of such discrepancies could be quite “random and infrequent”. He said that failure to level accurately would be unpredictable. Mr Thompson estimated that, given the characteristics of this lift, 90% of the time it would level to within plus or minus 10mm to 12mm. In Mr Thompson’s experience a lift of this type could fail to level accurately (that is, there could be greater than 10mm to 12mm differential) even when brand new, immediately after installation. He considered that the incidence of out of tolerance levelling would increase with the age of the machinery.
	


October 2006 Hazard and Risk Assessment by ThyssenKrupp


	
	In their endeavour to attribute fault and legal liability for Lift No 1 having stopped out of level on 12 August 2008, the plaintiff and ThyssenKrupp relied heavily upon the Assessment which had been carried out by ThyssenKrupp in October 2006 with respect to the 20 Loftus Street Lifts (referred to above at [50]). These parties both asserted that Capital Investors knew of the Assessment and knew from it that Lift No 1 was at high risk of inaccurate levelling.
	
	
	The plaintiff contended that this knowledge on the part of Capital Investors should lead to a finding that it owed a duty to lift passengers such as the plaintiff to exercise reasonable care to prevent such levelling inaccuracy from causing injury. The plaintiff’s case was that the scope of this duty of care extended so far as to require Capital Investors to replace the lift machinery with more modern components capable of greater levelling accuracy. ThyssenKrupp relied on the Assessment as showing that it had discharged its duty of care to the plaintiff by providing advice to Capital Investors of the risk that the lift would not level accurately and a recommendation that the machinery be upgraded.
	
	
	The Assessment was prepared upon the basis of an inspection by one of ThyssenKrupp’s employees, Daniel Lewin, on 13 October 2006. A letter from Mr Lewin to Mr Ray dated 20 October 2006 proves that this Assessment was carried out at the request of Mr Ray. Mr Ray did not recall having made the request. I do not find that surprising given that he was asked about this subject nearly 9 years after the event and that his role in relation to the Assessment would have been minimal. I have found at [50] that he was a mere conduit in relation to it, with no responsibility to evaluate the Assessment or to make any decision about whether its findings should be addressed by the commissioning of new lift equipment or by refurbishment of the existing lift machinery or otherwise: T 379.29 – 380.14; 391.21 – 394.
	
	
	At the time of the Assessment Mr Ray was employed by Resolve FM. In 2006 and continuing up to 30 June 2007 Resolve FM fulfilled much the same role as that undertaken by ISS under the Soft Services Agreement from 1 July 2007 (see [4]). Mr Ray changed employment from Resolve FM to ISS at about 1 July 2007. He said that in relation to obtaining an assessment such as that of October 2006, although he does not recall the document specifically, he was “like, the messenger”: T 390.40 – 391.17.
	
	
	The author, Mr Lewin, is a qualified electrical lift mechanic. In 2006 he worked as a business development manager for ThyssenKrupp: T 457.5. In 2006 ThyssenKrupp had a practice of sending out an annual letter to its customers offering to carry out a Hazard and Risk Assessment of the kind that was done in October 2006 for 20 Loftus Street. Mr Lewin did “hundreds” of these reports in the course of his business development work: T 455.20. The reports were done for a small fee. Their evident purpose was to encourage building owners to make substantial capital investments in new lift equipment or significant upgrades.
	
	
	The Assessment was written up on a pro forma document prepared by the Australian Elevator Association. The several components of lift machinery to be assessed were pre-printed, each followed by a list of possible alternative assessments. Small circles next to these alternatives enabled one of them to be selected for each component assessed, by checking a circle.
	
	
	The Assessment of October 2006 has a coversheet to show that it relates to Lift No 2 at 20 Loftus Street. However the evidence is that the two lifts were identically equipped and it would have been apparent to any reader of the Assessment that it was equally applicable to Lift No 1. Mr Lewin confirmed that the report related to both lifts. The Assessment contained this entry, being No 5 of 83 entries, under the heading “Stopping/Levelling Accuracy”:
	


“Requirements to be checked: floor levels to be within +/- 10mm and levelling accuracy of +/- 20mm.

Requirement fulfilled: No [selected by checking a circle]

Level of risk: High

Corrective action(s): 1. Change to regulated drive [selected by checking a circle.]


	
	The word “High” against “Level of Risk” was pre-printed on the form. Mr Lewin explained entry No 5 at T 442.35 - .42 in these terms:
	


“A. The floor level to be within plus or minus 10 millimetre is on stopping, so either within 10 mil tolerance above floor level, or 10 mil tolerance below the floor level, that’s stopping. Now the 20 mil accuracy, of levelling accuracy, with that particular technology you can have a shift in weight through a number of people leaving a lift and the level could - the lift could potentially jump out of floor level. Now if it goes above 20 mil the lift would have to relevel back to floor level. Anything below 20 mil the lift would not relevel and then the doors would close and then the lift would take off.”


	
	At T 455.33 - .36 he gave this answer:
	


“Q. As at 13 October 2006 the lift could well have been levelling perfectly at that time?

A. That's correct, but that technology was, was - it was possible that the levelling could, could change at any, at any time, given time.”


	
	Mr Lewin could not recall whether he actually rode the lifts to all floors or to a sample of floors to spot check the levelling accuracy of Lift No 1 or Lift No 2 in the course of preparing the Assessment (T 448 – 449). He was certain that he would not have checked the re-levelling accuracy (as explained at [88]): T 448. With respect to his marking the “No” circle against the requirements for levelling and re-levelling he said at T 449.2:
	


“A. I’ve put in the “no” circle because there’s no way you can guarantee on that technology that the floors - the floor levelling will be within that tolerance.”

Receipt of the Assessment by Mr Ray


	
	The letter of 20 October 2006 from Mr Lewin to Mr Ray to which reference has been made at [74] is sufficient to show that Mr Ray received the Assessment. A further letter of 8 November 2006 from Mr Lewin records that he met with Mr Ray and discussed the Assessment with him at about that date. This second letter sets out quoted prices for some improvements to the lifts which Mr Lewin had recommended. I infer that Mr Ray had requested a quotation of prices for these selected items during his meeting with Mr Lewin.
	
	
	Mr Ray agreed that if he had seen an assessment referring to a lift levelling issue such as item No 5 quoted at [78] he would have regarded it as significant because of the potential for a lift passenger to be injured “stumbling out of the lift”: T 393. However he said that his opinion on the best way to deal with any such issue “may or may not have been asked” by his superiors: T 393.39.
	


Capital Investors’ imputed knowledge of the Assessment


	
	There is no direct evidence that Capital Investors ever received the Assessment. Nor is there definitive evidence that it did not. On the last day of the hearing Capital Investors tendered its verified list of discoverable documents as purported proof that the Assessment was not received: it was not one of the documents on the list. The admissibility of the verified list for this purpose was disputed. I have concluded that the list of documents should be received but that it is only evidence of what was and was not discovered. The list of documents does not exclude the possibility that the Assessment was received but was subsequently mislaid and that the facts of its initial reception and of its subsequently being mislaid are not known to personnel of the company amongst whom due search has been made for the purposes of discovery in these proceedings.
	
	
	I consider that it is immaterial whether any employee or officer of Capital Investors actually ever received the Assessment. I find that it was certainly received by Resolve FM, through Mr Ray, and the knowledge of Mr Ray and of Resolve FM must be imputed to Capital Investors because Resolve FM obtained the Assessment in the course of acting as the agent of Capital Investors in circumstances in which it was Resolve FM’s duty to pass on such information to Capital Investors: Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd (1974) 131 CLR 634 at 658. The facts relevant to the application of that principle are considered in the following paragraphs.
	
	
	This case is not concerned with a principal who owed a duty of investigation and disclosure to a third party and who delegated the disclosure function to an agent, as in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (in Liq) [2003] HCA 25; (2003) 214 CLR 514. It is clear that the agent’s knowledge is attributed to the principal in cases of that type. Where the principal is not under such a duty to a third party to investigate a factual question and to make disclosure in relation to it, information received by an agent during the subsistence of the agency will likewise be attributed if it has been received in the agent’s capacity as such and if the terms of the agency require that information of the kind should be provided to the principal: Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; (2007) 230 CLR 89 at [126], [127]; El-Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings Plc (No 1) [1994] 2 All ER 685 per Hoffmann LJ at 703.
	
	
	As referred to at [3], on 20 March 2003 Capital Investors as “Principal” entered into a Comprehensive Maintenance Contract with ThyssenKrupp, which continued in force in October and November of 2006 (Ex 2.1 at Tab 1). Clause 1 of this contract required ThyssenKrupp to perform the services described in Attachment B (Ex 2.1 pp 29 – 37). Clause 2 provided that Capital Investors nominated Resolve FM as “Superintendent” to “act on [Capital Investors’] behalf and exercise any of [Capital Investors’] powers and duties under this contract”. Clause 2.2 required that ThyssenKrupp “must communicate directly with [Resolve FM] as the Principal Nominated Representative [of Capital Investors] in relation to all matters under this Contract unless otherwise notified to the Contractor under Clause 2.1”. The Contractor’s obligations, set out in Clause 5, included that ThyssenKrupp would “communicate with [Capital Investors] on all matters relevant to the Contract”.
	
	
	The effect Clauses 2.2 and 5 combined is that ThyssenKrupp was required to communicate with Resolve FM, which would suffice as communication with Capital Investors, in relation to all matters relevant to the contract.
	
	
	It is apparent from the evidence of Mr Lewin regarding the circumstances in which he completed and provided the October 2006 Assessment (see [74] and [76] above) that this was not done pursuant to the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract of 20 March 2003 between Capital Investors and ThyssenKrupp. There is no clause of that contract which required the preparation of such an assessment. Nevertheless, in my opinion the provision of the Assessment was a communication with Resolve FM in relation to a matter under the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract. In particular item 5 of the Assessment, drawing Resolve FM’s attention to the “high risk” that the lifts at 20 Loftus Street would not level to within plus or minus 10mm and that replacement of the controlling mechanism with a “regulated drive” would be required to address this, clearly related to “matters under this Contract”.
	
	
	I find that by virtue of Resolve FM’s status as the “Superintendent” and “Principal Nominated Representative” under the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract, once information of this nature came into Resolve FM’s hands from ThyssenKrupp, whatever the occasion, Resolve FM was bound to communicate it to Capital Investors. Capital Investors is therefore to be treated as having acquired the knowledge by operation of the principle in the cases cited at [85] and [86].
	


Capital Investors ought to have known of the limits of levelling accuracy


	
	Even if knowledge of item 5 in the Assessment were not to be imputed to Capital Investors upon the basis outlined above, the limitation on levelling accuracy inherent in the mechanism of Lift No 1 was something of which Capital Investors, as the entity in control of the lifts and of the foyer spaces adjacent to them, ought to have known. A company occupying the position with respect to these lifts that Capital Investors did ought reasonably to have appreciated that levelling inaccuracy could be hazardous to lift passengers. It ought reasonably to have made enquiry of appropriately qualified people as to whether the lifts installed at 20 Loftus Street were adequately reliable with respect to levelling and with respect to the minimisation of hazard to passengers.
	
	
	The entity to which such enquiry would obviously have been directed would have been ThyssenKrupp. It is apparent from the evidence of Mr Lewin given in these proceedings and from the contents of the October 2006 Assessment which he authored that, if asked, he would have readily informed Capital Investors of the propensity for unpredictable and intermittent out of level performance. These lifts were installed in the early 1970s (Ex 2.1 p 379). A reasonable occupier in the position of Capital Investors would, 30 to 35 years after installation, have made periodic enquiries of its service provider regarding whether the performance of the lifts was deteriorating and how their performance compared with that of more recent installations.
	


Limited significance of Capital Investors knowledge of levelling inaccuracy


	
	Knowledge of item 5 in the Assessment, attributed to Capital Investors through the agency of Resolve FM from about October 2006, does not equate to knowledge in Capital Investors of a high risk of accident or injury. The high risk that was signified by item 5 was that of the lift stopping out of level by more than 10mm. Mr Lewin was not qualified to give any opinion as to the degree of risk to a lift passenger from any particular height of step created by the lift stopping out of level. Even an expert in biomechanics could only comment upon the degree of risk of a trip or fall by reference to each of the various possible step levels which might be created by inaccurate stopping of the lift. The Assessment did not convey and was not intended to convey that the out of level condition which might at times arise would pose a high risk of injury.
	
	
	Similarly, that which I find Capital Investors ought to have known is that Lift No 1 might stop out of level but not that this would necessarily be dangerous to passengers irrespective of the degree of the levelling inaccuracy.
	


No contractual standard of lift levelling in the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract


	
	Item B.2 of the services listed in Attachment B (at Ex 2.1, p 29) required that for the duration of the contract ThyssenKrupp would maintain the lifts and their performance “within the tolerances specified in the performance criteria endorsed ‘Standard of Performance’ in accordance with Clause B.7”.
	
	
	Clause B.7.1 (Ex 2.1 at p 32) stipulated that an initial survey “Check List” was to be prepared and endorsed “Standards to be Maintained”. The document was required to be “signed and dated on the same day by an authorised officer of” Resolve FM and of ThyssenKrupp. Clause B.7.1 continued as follows:
	


“These Check Lists shall be evidence of the condition and performance of the installation and within the tolerances specified in the Check Lists, shall be the condition and performance to be maintained throughout the Contract Period”.


	
	Clause B.7.1 further required that the endorsed Check List should be retained in duplicate, one copy by Resolve FM and one by ThyssenKrupp and included in Attachment D to the contract. There is such an initial survey check list in Attachment D (Ex 2.1 at pp 56 – 58). However this does not appear to have been signed and adopted by the parties as envisaged in Clause B.7.2, following upon the execution of the contract.
	
	
	The initial survey check list provides (in item J at p 58) that the lifts’ “Rated Levelling Accuracy” was “+ or – 12mm”, that the “Allowable Tolerance” was “+ or – 5%” and that the “Measured” value was “+ or – 10mm”.
	
	
	I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that this check list was ever adopted as required by Clause B.7.2 in order for it to have contractual effect. Items B and C of the initial survey check list at p 56 make provision for signature by the representatives of Resolve FM and of ThyssenKrupp, respectively. No signatures have been affixed. Even if it was adopted contractually, the check list does not explain what is meant by “Allowable Tolerance”. In particular, it does not explain what the value “+ or – 5%” means in relation to “Allowable Tolerance”. It begs the question: 5% of what? The check list does not explain what, if anything, is the difference between the “Rated Levelling Accuracy” and the “Measured” value.
	
	
	Further there is nothing in the initial survey check list to state whether any particular levelling accuracy is required to be achieved one hundred percent of the time, given the evidence of Mr Thompson about the limitations of this lift equipment (see [69] – [71]). This must be regarded as a significant uncertainty concerning the operation of the check list and therefore regarding the stringency of ThyssenKrupp’s obligation. Levelling to within plus or minus 10mm or 12mm one hundred percent of the time was unachievable.
	


Measures required to improve the levelling accuracy of the lifts


	
	Mr Lewin and Mr Thompson gave evidence that reliable levelling within a tolerance of plus or minus 10mm could only be achieved by completely changing the “driver” or controller of the hoist system and the selector system to more modern technology: T 490.24; Lift Technician’s Conclave Report, Ex H, para 8; T 439.30, 440.35 – .46. This technology was first introduced for new and replacement lift installations from about 1983 (T 477.26, 482.48). The newer technology uses a variable frequency drive unit which controls an electronic motor for the hoist by electronic means. This system is quite different from that which controlled the hoist for these lifts as described at [67] to [71]: T 439.33, 477 – 478, 481.1 – .17.
	
	
	Replacement of the drive units for these lifts would cost $100,000 each (T 485.15). Making this change would also require replacement of the gearless hoist of each lift, which would increase the cost “exponentially”: T 485.30 – .40. The subject lifts were replaced after 2008 at a final tender price of $475,200: Ex 2.1 p 438. Even with this complete change of machinery levelling accuracy could not have been expected to be any greater than plus or minus 6mm (Ex H, para 8).
	


Performance and maintenance of lifts immediately prior to 12 August 2008


	
	Mr Ray had occupied his office on Level 1, 20 Loftus Street for about 2 years prior to the accident. Before that he had had an office at 50 Bridge Street for a year and from there he visited the subject building every day. Thus for three years in total before the incident Mr Ray had daily opportunity to observe the performance of the two lifts and he “didn’t find any issues” (T 373.25). He never saw either of the lifts stop on a floor out of level in any degree, let alone by one and a half to two inches. When he had seen a lift stop out of level in one of the other buildings nearby, for which he was also responsible, he had taken it out of service until a technician had been called to site and had corrected the lift’s function.
	
	
	Notwithstanding this evidence there are some records of ThyssenKrupp which show instances of levelling inaccuracy of one or other of the 20 Loftus Street lifts in the three years prior to the incident. These occurrences were very few.
	
	
	On 16 August 2005 there was a report to ThyssenKrupp: “lift 1 jumping and not level on M lvl” (presumably the mezzanine level): Ex D, p 472. The serviceman checked the lift’s operation and could find no fault. He returned it to service.
	
	
	On 15 January 2008 Lift No 1 was reported by Mr Ray as “stuck on Level 9 and not levelling”: Ex D, p 477. The technician found that a “shutdown selector” had to be adjusted.
	
	
	Those are the only instances of an out of level problem being reported. From 29 September 2003 to July 2008, a period of nearly five years, there were 32 service calls for Lift No 1. That is, an average of one every seven and a half weeks. All but those on 16 August 2005 and 15 January 2008 involved faults other than levelling. Many of the other fault reportages resulted in a technician finding nothing wrong with the operation of the lift on arrival.
	
	
	Similarly with Lift No 2 there were 36 callouts over a five year period from 27 August 2003 to 22 July 2008, an average of one every seven weeks. Again with the one exception of 16 August 2005 these concerned faults other than levelling and in many instances no deficiency of operation was found upon inspection. On 16 August 2005 Lift No 2 was reported as “jumping and not level on M lvl”: Ex D, p 484.
	
	
	These records show that despite the inherent limitations of the technology of these lifts, giving rise to a propensity to level inaccurately, faults of that nature occurred extremely rarely. The lifts did not malfunction with respect to levelling at a frequency which indicated a lack of adequate maintenance to keep them working to the best standard reasonably attainable.
	
	
	The lift technical experts in this proceeding concluded that the cause of Lift No 1 stopping out of level on 12 August 2008 was “the selector required adjustment as detailed in the ThyssenKrupp service report of 12 August 2008”. That is a reference to the service technician’s report referred to at [59]. Mr Thompson explained in evidence at T 487 – 488 that although an adjustment was made to the selector (and, the next day, to a levelling cam) that “doesn’t necessarily mean that was the problem”. He noted that the technician recorded having run the lift to all floors and having found no levelling problem but that, having “taken at face value that there was a problem with the lift”, as per the customer complaint, “he’s just done some maintenance”.
	
	
	The experts agreed that the maintenance schedule under the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract of 20 March 2003 appropriately called for a reasonable frequency of maintenance inspections. Namely, 24 per annum. They also agreed that the nature and extent of the checks required to be made under that contract on each such visit was reasonable. A maintenance inspection was carried out on 30 July 2008. The experts agreed that this would only have revealed a defect or maintenance requirement which would affect levelling if the lift had exhibited levelling malfunction at the time of the inspection.
	


Meeting of ISS personnel on 14 July 2008


	
	Minutes of a meeting of 14 July 2008 (Ex 2.1, p 300) record that six persons, including Mr Ray, discussed on that day amongst other things “KDP Lift Issues”. The initials KDP (sometimes AKDP) referred to the group of buildings on Loftus and Young Streets owned by Capital Investors, including 20 Loftus Street. An entry in these minutes against the topic “KDP Lift Issues” stated:
	


“Meeting was conducted by [Peter Ray] with Eugenie Schneider, Peter Dent, [Tim Wickman] and Koni to discussion lift issues. Lift levelling issues is noted as a trip hazard. Eugenie has advised Peter Ray verbally to take any lift out of action as soon as it is found to be not levelling correctly. All AKDP lifts will be reviewed by a lift consultant shortly”.


	
	Contrary to this entry, the plaintiff gave evidence that she did not attend, either prior to or around 14 July 2008, a meeting with Peter Ray and others and a representative of “Koni”. I infer that this is a misspelling of Kone, which was the service company for lifts in a building at 9 – 13 Young Street. The plaintiff was examined (at T 116 – 119) and cross examined (at T 175 – 180) about this possible meeting but it appears to me to have been of no significance. At most it shows that the lifts in another building with which the plaintiff was concerned in her employment had levelling problems. But those were different lifts from the ones in 20 Loftus Street and they were maintained by a different lift contractor. This evidence has no bearing upon (a) whether the defendants knew of or should have known of levelling faults in the 20 Loftus Street lifts or (b) what the plaintiff knew or should have expected regarding levelling of the subject lift.
	


Plaintiff v Kent Street


	
	For the reasons given at [6] and [7], in the plaintiff’s proceedings against Kent Street (No. 2010/411126) there must be judgment for the defendant.
	


Plaintiff v Capital Investors – what the duty of care required


	
	The plaintiff’s only pleaded case against Capital Investors is in negligence for breach of a duty of care alleged to have been owed by this defendant as the occupier of the lifts and lift foyers at 20 Loftus Street and as the effective controller of the lifts. I hold that, arising from those capacities, Capital Investors owed to lift passengers as a class, including the plaintiff, a duty to exercise reasonable care for their safety: Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna [1987] HCA 7; (1987) 162 CLR 479. For the purpose of determining whether a breach of that duty occurred, the risk of harm to be considered in the present case is the risk that a lift passenger might trip and thereby be injured upon exiting the lift if instead of levelling accurately it should stop in such a manner as to create a step or sill.
	
	
	This identification of the relevant risk of harm is an essential pre-requisite to consideration of what if any action was required of the defendant to discharge its duty of care (the scope or content of the duty), leading to ascertainment of whether there was breach by reason of such action not having been taken. Gummow J said in Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer (2007) 234 CLR 330 at [59]:
	


“It is only through the correct identification of the risk that one can assess what a reasonable response to that risk would be.”


	
	In Wyong Shire Council v Shirt [1980] HCA 12; (1980) 146 CLR 40 Mason J (as his Honour then was) recognised implicitly that identification of the relevant risk is a pre-requisite to evaluating the factors (now enacted in s 5B Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW)) which bear upon what precautions a defendant may be required to take in order to discharge his or her duty of care:
	


“[13] A risk of injury which is quite unlikely to occur, such as that which happened in Bolton v. Stone [1951] UKHL 2; (1951) AC 850, may nevertheless be plainly foreseeable. Consequently, when we speak of a risk of injury as being ‘foreseeable’ we are not making any statement as to the probability or improbability of its occurrence, save that we are implicitly asserting that the risk is not one that is far-fetched or fanciful. Although it is true to say that in many cases the greater the degree of probability of the occurrence of the risk the more readily it will be perceived to be a risk, it certainly does not follow that a risk which is unlikely to occur is not foreseeable.

[14] In deciding whether there has been a breach of the duty of care the tribunal of fact must first ask itself whether a reasonable man in the defendant's position would have foreseen that his conduct involved a risk of injury to the plaintiff or to a class of persons including the plaintiff. If the answer be in the affirmative, it is then for the tribunal of fact to determine what a reasonable man would do by way of response to the risk. The perception of the reasonable man's response calls for a consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of the probability of its occurrence, along with the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action and any other conflicting responsibilities which the defendant may have. It is only when these matters are balanced out that the tribunal of fact can confidently assert what is the standard of response to be ascribed to the reasonable man placed in the defendant's position.”


	
	The considerations relevant to finding what the duty of care required Capital Investors to do with respect to the identified risk in this case (that is, the risk of a lift passenger being injured due to tripping upon leaving an inaccurately levelled lift) are primarily as follows:
	



	
	Whether Capital Investors “ought to have” foreseen the identified risk, which is equivalent to whether a reasonable person in the position of Capital Investors would have foreseen it: s 5B(1)(a) Civil Liability Act.
	
	
	The degree of likelihood of the risk coming to pass and, in particular, whether the risk was “not insignificant”: s 5B(1)(b).
	
	
	What if any precautions a reasonable person in the position of Capital Investors would have taken: s 5A(1)(c.
	
	
	The probability that a trip incident would occur and that harm would be sustained by a lift passenger if reasonable care should not be taken: s 5B(2)(a).
	
	
	The likely seriousness of the harm that might be suffered by a plaintiff: s 5B(2)(b).
	
	
	The burden – cost and degree of difficulty – of Capital Investors taking precautions to avoid the risk of an out of level incident occurring and causing a passenger to trip: s 5B(2)(c).
	
	
	The social utility of Capital Investors operating the lift.
	



	
	It is established that the considerations which I have paraphrased at [118] from both sub ss (1) and (2) of s 5B bear upon the scope, or content, or requirements for discharge, of a duty of care. Hence they bear upon whether a breach has occurred. This is so notwithstanding that the heading “Division 2 – Duty of Care” appears immediately before s 5B: Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak [2009] HCA 48 (2009); 239 CLR 420 at [13]; Grills v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2015] NSWCA 72 at [93] – [95].
	
	
	I approach the question of what precautions were reasonably required of Capital Investors in discharge of its duty on a prospective basis, looking forward from before the plaintiff’s accident occurred, not looking back with hindsight derived from the facts that an out of level event did in fact occur and that the plaintiff did trip on 12 August 2008: Vairy v Wyong Shire Council [2005] HCA 62 per Gummow J at [60] and per Hayne J at [126] – [129]; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak at [40]; Neindorf v Junkovic [2005] HCA 75; (2005) 80 ALJR 341 at [93].
	
	
	On a prospective view Lift No 1 might stop out of level at any floor by less than plus or minus 7mm (as was found to be its operating condition by the serviceman who responded on 12 August 2008) or by a greater vertical distance. At some low point in the possible range the resulting step would not give rise to any danger to a lift passenger using reasonable care for his or her own safety (see Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer at [45]) because the height differential would be cleared by the raising of the passenger’s foot when walking out of the lift at a normal gait. At some higher point on the scale of levelling inaccuracy the differential between the height of the lift floor and that of the fixed floor would, again, create no danger to an alighting passenger if he or she exercised reasonable care because the difference in height would be readily apparent, as a matter of spatial perception, to a person standing upon the lift floor and looking out into the foyer (compare Neindorf v Junkovic).
	
	
	The evidence does not establish that there is a particular range of height differential within which out-of-level stopping would create a danger to passengers even if they should exercise reasonable care for their own safety. Therefore I do not find that Capital Investors’ duty of care required that it should do whatever was necessary to prevent the lift stopping out of level within any particular range of height difference.
	
	
	A levelling discrepancy of 6mm is within the best tolerance that could be achieved for a passenger lift of the most modern engineering design. That was the opinion expressed in the Conclave Report of two expert lift technicians: Ex H para 8. I therefore do not consider that Capital Investors’ duty of care required it to eliminate all levelling discrepancies of the 20 Loftus Street lifts. Such a conclusion would amount to a finding that the operators of all lift systems in all buildings in Sydney are in breach of their duties of care owed to lift passengers because, according to the evidence, levelling discrepancies simply cannot be eliminated altogether.
	
	
	A consideration affecting what if any action Capital Investors should have taken with respect to the identified risk is that it could reasonably expect a lift passenger, exercising reasonable care for his or her own safety, to take account of the fact that a lift is a dynamic moving conveyance as opposed to a physical feature having a fixed position relative to its surrounds. A passenger would reasonably be expected to pay attention to whether the machine had functioned correctly and stopped accurately – which would require no more than glancing in the direction in which a passenger would move his or her feet – before walking across the join between the lift floor and the fixed floor.
	
	
	This is the same consideration as applies to any moving conveyance. The operator of a bus may reasonably expect (for the purpose of considering what precautions it may be necessary to take in order to discharge a duty of care for the safety of alighting passengers) that each passenger will look to see how closely the bus has been brought to the kerb (for example) before descending the last step. A passenger on a train may similarly be expected to look down to see how closely the carriage is aligned with the platform before stepping off.
	
	
	Addressing the seven matters listed in [118], I find as follows:
	



	
	Capital Investors ought to have known that the identified risk existed. It is a risk inherent in operating a mechanical lift in a multi-storey building. In particular, it was an inherent risk of operating a lift with the older mechanism which this lift utilised. Capital Investors either knew this from the October 2006 Assessment or ought to have known it because enquiry should have been made by the company as to the levelling accuracy of its equipment. Such enquiry would readily have yielded an answer such as that given in the October 2006 Assessment.
	
	
	The likelihood of an out–of-level stopping of Lift No 1 at any floor causing a passenger to trip could reasonably have been regarded by Capital Investors as very low. Ordinary care of alighting passengers for their own safety would in all but a very small proportion of cases result in the out-of-level condition having no consequence whatever. I cannot presently envisage any degree of level differential or any combination of circumstances which would give rise to any significant prospect that an out of level stop would cause a trip notwithstanding reasonable care on the part of the alighting passenger.
	
	
	The question of what precautions a reasonable person should take is the question which I am presently endeavouring to answer having regard to the other factors identified in s 5B(1) and (2).
	
	
	With respect to the probability of harm occurring if care should not be taken, I have stated my conclusion at (2) above that the probability of a trip was very low and the probability of harm resulting from a trip would be even lower because not every trip would cause harm.
	
	
	The likely seriousness of harm flowing to any passenger if he or she should trip was not great. A trip at the exit from a lift into any of the lift foyers of 20 Loftus Street would not cause a passenger to plunge down a set of stairs or smash into a pane of glass, for example. Tripping on a sill created at the junction of the lift floor and the fixed floor could result in a stumble or a fall to a hard surface, with the lift passenger moving at a slow speed when this occurred.
	
	
	The precaution which the plaintiff has asserted Capital Investors should have taken was to upgrade these lifts, at a cost of $475,000. Even that would not have ensured that the lifts would never stop out of level but would give them a greater consistency of accurate levelling to a tolerance of plus or minus 6mm.
	
	
	The social utility of the operation of the lifts was considerable. This high rise building would not have been functional without them.
	



	
	I conclude that Capital Investors’ duty of care required it to select with reasonable care an appropriately qualified and experienced lift servicing company with thorough knowledge of the type of machinery installed at 20 Loftus Street. Reasonable care required that the service company selected should be engaged to carry out regular periodic inspection and maintenance at a frequency and in a degree of detail approved by the service company itself. It was also necessary that Capital Investors should institute both a system of verifying that this regular maintenance was performed and a system of monitoring the operation of the lifts and of calling out the service company in the event of any malfunction.
	
	
	For the reasons given at [126](6), Capital Investors’ duty of care did not require that the lift machinery be replaced. The lifts as installed in the 1970s “were of a standard design and layout that appears appropriate for this period of installation”: expert report of Mr Thompson, Ex D p 763. There is no evidence to suggest that the lifts did not comply with the then applicable industry standards and legislative requirements. To the contrary, I infer that they did comply. For about 25 years prior to the accident, technology capable of providing greater accuracy of levelling and with greater consistency was available. But there is no evidence that any standard for the elevator industry was promulgated or any statute passed or regulation adopted which would have required these lifts to be upgraded, as a matter of accepted industry practice, to the newer technology. The fact that the lift machinery could have been replaced to achieve more reliable levelling and less likelihood of a trip hazard did not mean that the lifts were dangerous or defective. “Safety standards imposed by legislation or regulation recognise a need to balance safety with other factors, including cost, convenience, aesthetics and practicality”: Jones v Bartlett [2000] HCA 56; (2000) 205 CLR 166 at [23].
	
	
	Further, the evidence in this case did not show that upgrading of lifts to the newer technology was the norm in Sydney high-rise buildings or that it was a practice that had been so widely adopted as to engender an expectation on the part of the general public that all lifts would operate to the standard of levelling achievable with the post-1983 technology. No deception of lift passengers in this building was created by the circumstance that it continued to be serviced by lifts with the degree of unreliability that has been referred to earlier in these reasons.
	
	
	Given the low probability of an out-of-level step being of such a nature as to go unnoticed by a reasonably careful alighting passenger, replacement of the entire lift machinery at a capital cost of $475,000 would be vastly beyond the requirements of Capital Investors’ duty to exercise reasonable care to protect a passenger such as the plaintiff against the identified risk.
	


Failure of plaintiff to prove breach of duty of care


	
	The duty as described at [127] was discharged by the making of the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract and by the arrangements which were put in place for performance of that Contract to be overseen by ISS through Mr Ray. See further [142], below.
	
	
	Even if the evidence had established that Capital Investors’ duty of care was so stringent as to require that it should ensure that the 20 Loftus Street lifts would never stop out of level by some definable height difference or range of height difference, which would be dangerous to lift passengers notwithstanding their exercise of reasonable care for their own safety, the plaintiff could not show breach of duty on her evidence in this case. That is because she has not shown what height differential occurred in the out-of-level incident on 12 August 2008. The following cases illustrate how a plaintiff’s failure to prove what he or she tripped upon may be fatal to a claim in negligence.
	
	
	In Rallis v Pang [2003] NSWCA 202 the plaintiff fell and was injured when walking on a footpath. She sued the owner of the adjoining property upon the basis that part of the footpath had been broken up in consequence of building work carried out on that owner’s property. Trucks and bobcats had crossed the footpath in connection with the building works. The plaintiff also sued the public authority responsible for the footpath upon the basis that it had consented to the work being carried out on the adjoining property owner’s land and had deferred repairing the footpath pending completion of the building work.
	
	
	When walking on this broken-up footpath the plaintiff had stepped on a patch of grass but had lost her balance and fallen, injuring herself, because her foot landed on the edge of a hard object under the grass. She was not able to say what was the nature of the hard object she stood on or what were its dimensions. There was no other evidence as to the size of the object or as to whether it was loose on the surface or buried in some way.
	
	
	Hodgson JA, with whom Beazley JA agreed said this:
	


“[3] I would not myself assert a concluded view that the first opponent had no relevant duty of care. I would express the basic reason why the claimant is not entitled to succeed as follows. In the circumstances referred to by Tobias JA, it was not unreasonable for either opponent to leave the footpath in a state falling short of that to be expected of a normal paved footpath. In this situation, in order to show that the claimant was caused to fall by a hazard which should have been attended to by one or both opponents, there was required at least a more accurate identification of what this hazard was, how big it was, and where it was. Otherwise, it could not be found either that one or both opponents were or should have been aware of the risk it constituted, or that reasonable care would have required that they deal with that risk.”


	
	Tobias JA held at [26]:
	


“[26] As to the third basis, there was no evidence that the object upon which the claimant stepped and which caused her to lose her balance was debris from the first opponent’s building work. Nor in my opinion, could it be inferred that it was. In this regard, the evidence did not identify with any precision where and how the accident occurred to enable the primary judge to determine what, if anything, could have been done to avoid it. His Honour expressed misgivings with respect to the imprecision of the evidence on these important issues and, in my opinion, he was clearly justified in so doing. In a case such as the present, in order to assert a duty of care to avoid the risk of injury that she sustained, the claimant was required to establish with a degree of precision not only the location but also the manner and cause of her fall. That precision was conspicuously absent in the present case.”

The case for the plaintiff in the present proceeding would fail upon the same basis even if Capital Investors’ duty of care were more demanding than I have judged it to be (at [127).


	
	In Brodie v Singleton Shire Council [2001] HCA 29; (2001) 206 CLR 512, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ considered the case of Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council (which was heard as a concurrent appeal). At [160] their Honours said:
	


“[160] In dealing with questions of breach of duty, while there is to be taken into account as a ‘variable factor’ the results of ‘inadvertence’ and ‘thoughtlessness’, a proper starting point may be the proposition that the persons using the road will themselves take ordinary care.”


	
	At [163] their Honours said this:
	


“[163] The formulation of the duty in terms which require that a road be safe not in all circumstances but for users exercising reasonable care for their own safety is even more important where, as in Ghantous, the plaintiff was a pedestrian. In general, such persons are more able to see and avoid imperfections in a road surface. It is the nature of walking in the outdoors that the ground may not be as even, flat or smooth as other surfaces. As Callinan J points out in his reasons in Ghantous, persons ordinarily will be expected to exercise sufficient care by looking where they are going and perceiving and avoiding obvious hazards, such as uneven paving stones, tree roots or holes. Of course, some allowance must be made for inadvertence. Certain dangers may not readily be perceived because of inadequate lighting or the nature of the danger (as in Webb v South Australia (1982) 56 ALJR 912; 43 ALR 465), or the surrounding area (as in Buckle v Bayswater Road Board (1936) 57 CLR 259 at 266, where the hole was concealed by grass). In such circumstances, there may be a foreseeable risk of harm even to persons taking reasonable care for their own safety. These hazards will include dangers in the nature of a ‘trap’ or, as Jordan CJ put it, ‘of a kind calling for some protection or warning’. In Romeo v Conservation Commission (NT) (1998) 192 CLR 431 at 455 [52], Toohey and Gummow JJ noted in a different context that the care to be expected of members of the public is related to the obviousness of the danger. Kirby J pointed out in the same case that even an occupier of premises ‘is generally entitled to assume that most entrants will take reasonable care for their own safety’. Each case will, of course, turn on its own facts.”


	
	In the absence of evidence from which I could find on the balance of probabilities what was the dimension of the level discrepancy when the plaintiff alighted from the lift, it is impossible for me to find, applying the principles in Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council, there arose a hazard or danger in relation to which the plaintiff exercised reasonable care for her own safety.
	
	
	In Neindorf v Junkovic two adjoining slabs of a concrete driveway differed in level by 10 to 12mm at their junction on an expansion joint. A pedestrian walking on the driveway to attend a garage sale rolled her foot on the height discrepancy, stumbled and sustained a fracture. Hayne J said (citations omitted):
	


“[94] In the present case, the relevant danger was presented by the uneven surface of the appellant's driveway. Neither the fact that the driveway paving was uneven nor the degree of unevenness (a difference of about 12mm between two sections of the concrete) is or was at all uncommon in the driveways of suburban housing. Would it have been reasonable for the occupier to eliminate or reduce the risk of tripping or stumbling on or over the unevenness, or to warn all entrants to watch their step?

[95] It may be that some means of reducing the danger could readily have been found. It was suggested that to paint a stripe along the lip of the concrete or to cover it over with a piece of carpet would have done so. Perhaps the danger could even have been eliminated by displaying the goods which were for sale in some different way. But would it have been reasonable for an occupier embarking upon a garage sale to take any of these measures?

[96] When that question is examined from the proper perspective, without knowing what in fact happened to the respondent, the answer is no. Any suburban house presents many features that can lead to injury. In that sense any suburban house presents many dangers. The appellant, as occupier, was not required to reduce or eliminate the danger presented by an unevenness in the driveway that was no larger than, and no different from, unevenness found in any but the most recently installed suburban concrete driveway. Nor was the occupier required to give some warning to entrants by telling them: ‘Be careful, the driveway upon which you are to walk is no different from most other driveways.’ The fact that the appellant had invited the public to attend a garage sale, and displayed the goods for sale as she did, requires no different conclusion.”


	
	Just as some unevenness may be expected to be found in “any but the most recently installed suburban concrete driveway”, some potential for unevenness in the levelling of a lift, a moving conveyance, must be expected by any passenger. It is simply inherent in the nature of such machinery that it may not level precisely with the fixed floor at which it arrives. Without evidence upon which to make a finding as to the dimension of the step over which the plaintiff tripped, I cannot find that it was beyond the range of what might reasonably be expected and negotiated by a lift passenger taking reasonable care.
	


Plaintiff v Capital Investors – particulars of negligence


	
	The particulars of negligence given by the plaintiff in her amended statement of claim (under para 9) may be grouped as follows. Items (a) and (b) allege a failure to maintain and repair Lift No 1 and to carry out “remedial and other works so as to ensure the lifts were maintained in proper working order”. These particulars are not made out. The evidence shows that the lifts were maintained in good working order, to the standard of operation of which they were capable. Capital Investors engaged a competent service entity under the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract. It provided for an appropriate maintenance regime, according to the expert evidence, and that regime was executed. The history of very few out-of-level incidents in either Lift No 1 or Lift No 2 over the five years preceding the accident shows that the lifts were kept operating to a standard which exceeded the expectations of the experts, having regard to the age and technical specifications of the machinery.
	
	
	Particulars (d), (e) and (f) are as follows:
	


“(d) exposed the plaintiff to a risk of injury of which it knew or ought to have known.

(e) failed to observe that the plaintiff was in a position of peril in the circumstances.

(f) exposed the plaintiff to a risk of injury which could have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable care.”

These are not particulars of negligence or breach of duty at all – they are unhelpful generalities. Particular (k) (“the plaintiff relies on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur”) is in the same position. The facts of this case do not of themselves bespeak a failure on the part of Capital Investors to exercise reasonable care for the safety of lift passengers with respect to the risk of harm which I have identified.


	
	Particulars (c), (g), (h), (i) and (j) all assert, in various and repetitive ways, that Capital Investors’ breach of duty lay in failing “to heed advice of the condition of the lifts” (presumably referring to the October 2006 Assessment) and failing to “upgrade the lifts”. This group of particulars constituted the case which the plaintiff principally ran at trial. I have found that Capital Investors’ duty of care for the safety of lift passengers did not require that the entire system be replaced or “upgraded”.
	
	
	The plaintiff did not plead or argue a case that reasonable care required the placement of warning signs concerning the risk of erratic levelling of Lift No 1. If it had been raised I would have regarded the possibility of the lift stopping to some degree out of level as so obvious and the ability of an ordinary passenger to detect it as such a simple matter (for reasons given at [121] – [125]), that a warning sign would have been quite superfluous and unnecessary: Vairy v Wyong Shire Council at [7] and [40].
	


No proof that the alleged breach of duty caused the trip


	
	The plaintiff’s case against Capital Investors also fails on the issue of causation of harm because of her failure to prove what was the height of the step or sill upon which she tripped. Even if Capital Investors’ duty of care required that it should have upgraded the lift machinery to the modern standard, as that would only achieve levelling to within a tolerance of plus or minus 6mm I would have to be satisfied that the sill over which the plaintiff tripped was greater than that in order to find that the failure to replace the machinery was the cause of her accident. For reasons given in [53] – [58] I do not find on the balance of probabilities that the step was any more than 6mm.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s claim against Capital Investors must be dismissed with costs.
	


Plaintiff v ThyssenKrupp


	
	The plaintiff’s claim against ThyssenKrupp was also pleaded solely in negligence. I accept that ThyssenKrupp owed the plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the performance of its work under the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract, to prevent malfunction of the lift which might cause injury to the plaintiff. The identified risk for the purpose of evaluating what was required of ThyssenKrupp to discharge this duty of care is of course the same as in the case against Capital Investors (see [115]). The scope of ThyssenKrupp’s duty is necessarily different from that of Capital Investors. As ThyssenKrupp did not own the building or have any management control over it the plaintiff could not sensibly contend that ThyssenKrupp’s duty of care required that it should upgrade the lift system.
	
	
	Further, because ThyssenKrupp’s relationship to the plaintiff (for the purposes of the law of negligence) arose only through it having assumed contractual obligations to Capital Investors under the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract, the terms of that contract established the nature of the activity upon which ThyssenKrupp entered with respect to these lifts and constitute a strong consideration in determining the content of ThyssenKrupp’s duty: Voli v Inglewood Shire Council [1963] HCA 15; (1963) 110 CLR 74 per Windeyer J at [11]; WB Jones Staircase and Handrail Pty Ltd v Richardson [2014] NSWCA 127 at [54].
	
	
	Upon this approach, ThyssenKrupp’s duty of care to the plaintiff required, with respect to the identified risk, that it exercise reasonable care to carry out the maintenance tasks which it contracted to perform and to warn Capital Investors of any noted deficiencies in the working of the lifts which might affect the likelihood of them stopping out of level and causing a trip accident. ThyssenKrupp discharged its duty of care in both of these respects. The conclave report of the lift technical experts and the report of Mr Thompson dated 19 April 2012 (Ex 2.1, pp 760 – 775) establish that ThyssenKrupp’s maintenance work was executed with reasonable care and skill. Further, it provided the October 2006 Assessment which informed Capital Investors’ agent (for the purposes of the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract) of the inability to ensure that these lifts would level within plus or minus 10mm.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s particulars of negligence alleged against ThyssenKrupp, as set out in the amended statement of claim, included at items (a) and (b) failure to inspect, maintain and repair the lifts and to keep them in proper working order. These particulars are unsubstantiated by the evidence. Particulars (d), (e) and (f) are in the same terms as Items (d), (e) and (f) alleged against Capital Investors (see [143] above). These generalities are as meaningless for the purpose of particularising breach of ThyssenKrupp’s duty of care as they are in relation to Capital Investors.
	
	
	Items (c) and (h) allege failures by ThyssenKrupp “to heed advice of the condition of the lifts, being that they needed upgrading” and failure “to properly warn (sic) the owner of the lifts of the need to upgrade them”. There was no failure to warn because the October 2006 Assessment was delivered. There was no question of ThyssenKrupp heeding advice. It was the giver of advice with respect to upgrading. Any action in response to that advice would only be within the power of Capital Investors.
	
	
	Lastly at Item (g) the plaintiff relies upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur against ThyssenKrupp. The facts most certainly do not speak for themselves in establishing negligence of this defendant.
	
	
	In final submissions the plaintiff effectively abandoned its claim against ThyssenKrupp and rightly so. The claim must be dismissed.
	


Plaintiff v ISS


	
	The plaintiff’s claim against ISS is pleaded only in negligence, relying upon an allegation that at all material times ISS “was responsible for the day-to-day management of the premises located at 20 Loftus Street Sydney” as the foundation of a common law duty of care. In breach of this duty it is alleged that ISS “failed to ensure that the lifts in the premises were properly maintained, complied with relevant standards and were free of defects”. On its face this allegation of breach fails because, whether through ISS ensuring this outcome or otherwise, the fact is that ThyssenKrupp did properly maintain the lifts. There is no evidence that the lifts did not comply with “relevant standards”. They were “free of defects” in the sense that they performed within the capabilities of equipment of the relevant type.
	
	
	Particulars (a) and (b) of the negligence alleged by the plaintiff against ISS are that the company failed to inspect, maintain and repair Lift No 1 and failed to carry out remedial and other works so as to ensure that the lifts were maintained in proper working order. The scope of ISS’s obligations, in discharge of its duty of care, is necessarily limited by the terms of the contract by which it undertook its role with respect to the lifts: see authorities cited at [149]. ISS was never required to inspect, maintain or repair the lifts or to carry out remedial or other works. It was required to monitor the performance by ThyssenKrupp of that company’s maintenance obligations under the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract. ThyssenKrupp did perform its contractual duties: see [150]. There was no default on the part of ISS in this respect.
	
	
	Paragraph (c) of the particulars alleges failure of ISS “to heed advice of the condition of the lifts, being that they needed upgrading”. Not being the owner of the building, it was not for ISS to “heed” this advice but to pass it on. The evidence does not permit me to find on the balance of probabilities that it failed to do so. As it was not within ISS’s power to “heed” the terms of the October 2006 Assessment in the sense of carrying out the upgrade which was there recommended, it could not be held against ISS that it had breached its duty of care by failing to do something which it had no lawful authority or power to do.
	
	
	Paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of the particulars alleged against ISS are mere generalities about ISS’s exposure of the plaintiff to risk of injury and failure to observe that the plaintiff was “in a position of peril”. Formulaic allegations in these general terms do not advance the particularisation of the plaintiff’s case and they cannot be usefully dealt with in the process of trying to identify whether any breach of ISS’s duty of care occurred.
	
	
	Particular (g) invokes the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which is no more applicable to the position of ISS in this case than it is to the positions, respectively, of Capital Investors and of ThyssenKrupp.
	
	
	Paragraphs (h), (i) and (j) allege failures to take out of operation lifts which were not levelling correctly and to have known faults corrected by maintenance contractors, pursuant to a system of checking the operation of the lifts on a daily basis. In fact ISS did monitor the operation of these lifts on a daily basis through the observations of Mr Ray who used the lifts to get to and from his office on the first floor. The evidence shows that there was no known fault with the lifts on 12 August 2008 prior to the plaintiff’s accident which could have or should have prompted ISS (through Mr Ray) to take Lift No 1 out of operation or to call a maintenance contractor to attend to it. These particulars are not made out.
	
	
	Particulars (k) and (l) allege that ISS failed to warn the plaintiff and Capital Investors that the lifts were not operating correctly and similarly failed to warn “the lifts owners and operators”. There was no indication of incorrect operation in Lift No 1 prior to the plaintiff’s trip accident. There was nothing of which Mr Ray or anyone else within ISS could have or should have become aware or of which such a person could have or should have warned the plaintiff or Capital Investors.
	
	
	Particulars (m) and (n) suffer from the same characteristic as referred to in relation to items (d), (e) and (f): generalities which do not particularise the plaintiff’s case at all. Particular (r) is, again, of this type.
	
	
	Particulars (o), (p) and (q) allege a failure on the part of ISS to implement an adequate risk management system in respect of the lifts at 20 Loftus Street and a failure to identify the defect or hazard which caused the plaintiff’s accident. These particulars are rebutted by the evidence. There was an adequate risk management system in the regular frequent attendance of ThyssenKrupp’s service personnel. The failure to identify any defect or hazard prior to the plaintiff tripping occurred because, so far as the evidence shows, there was no pre-existing defect or hazard.
	


First Cross-Claim: Capital Investors v ISS


	
	By its First Cross-Claim Capital Investors claims against ISS that the latter owed a duty of care to the plaintiff “to ensure that it maintained the lifts in the premises and that the plaintiff was not exposed to any risks of injury”; that ISS negligently breached this duty and that, if the plaintiff is entitled to damages, then Capital Investors is entitled to apportionment against and or a complete indemnity from ISS. I reject this claim because ISS has not breached any duty of care owed to the plaintiff.
	
	
	Secondly, Capital Investors alleges that ISS breached the Soft Services Agreement, in various respects particularised in para 13 of the First Cross-Claim, and has thereby become liable to Capital Investors in contract for damages to be measured in the amount of whatever liability Capital Investors may be found to have to the plaintiff. I am not satisfied that ISS breached the Soft Services Agreement in any of the respects particularised. Contrary to the way these particulars are formulated, the contract did not require ISS “to ensure… the safety and proper operation of the lifts” (cross-claimant’s particular 13(a)(i)). It did require that ISS ensure defects or issues with the lifts were notified to ThyssenKrupp and rectified, that the building was monitored for the purpose of addressing recurring problems and that work required to be carried out on the lifts was appropriately undertaken (particulars 13(a)(i) – (vi)). There is no evidence that ISS did not fulfil its obligations in any of these respects.
	
	
	Capital Investors asserts that ISS failed to inform it of a circumstance which adversely affected the safe working of the lifts or was likely to do so (particular 13(b)). This has not been proved. To the extent that limitations upon the levelling accuracy of the lift would affect safe working, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that ISS failed to pass on the October 2006 Assessment.
	
	
	Capital Investors asserts that ISS failed to ensure that requirements of Occupation, Health and Safety legislation would be met in relation to the lifts (particular (c)). There has been no citation to the Court of relevant provisions of legislation nor evidence tendered to show their breach. I dismiss this particular.
	
	
	By particular 13(d) Capital Investors alleges that ISS failed to ensure that ThyssenKrupp attended “to all known issues and properly rectified any faults or defects with the lifts” and by particular 13(e) that it failed to undertake regular “walk-through inspections”. These alleged breaches are contradicted by the evidence. Mr Ray of ISS “walked through” the building every day. There are ample records of ThyssenKrupp to show that “all known issues” were attended to and faults rectified.
	
	
	Capital Investors has also particularised against ISS, as breaches of the Soft Services Agreement, all the particulars of negligence which the plaintiff asserted against ISS (particular (g)). I have rejected all of those particulars as between the plaintiff and ISS (see [156] – [163]) and I reject them as between Capital Investors and ISS.
	
	
	The First Cross-Claim must be dismissed.
	


Second Cross-Claim: Capital Investors v ThyssenKrupp


	
	Capital Investors’ Second Cross-Claim against ThyssenKrupp follows the same pattern as its cross-claim against ISS. The claim for contribution or indemnity pursuant to s 5 Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW), upon the basis that ThyssenKrupp as a tortfeasor liable to the plaintiff in respect of the same damage as that for which Capital Investors is alleged to be liable, is rejected because I have found that ThyssenKrupp did not negligently breach a duty owed by it to the plaintiff as a lift passenger.
	
	
	I also reject Capital Investors’ claim in contract against ThyssenKrupp. The evidence does not substantiate that ThyssenKrupp failed to perform its obligations under the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract in any of the respects alleged in particulars given under paragraph 14 of the Second Cross-Claim.
	


Third and Seventh Cross-Claims: ISS v Capital Investors and ThyssenKrupp


	
	The first aspect of ISS’s Third Cross-Claim against Capital Investors is a claim for indemnity, pursuant to clause 41 of the Soft Services Agreement, against any liability that ISS may incur to the plaintiff. As I have found that ISS has not incurred any liability to the plaintiff the claim for indemnity does not arise.
	
	
	Secondly, ISS seeks contribution or indemnity from Capital Investors upon the basis that, if I should find ISS liable as a tortfeasor to the plaintiff, then Capital Investors is also liable as a tortfeasor in respect of the same damage. Because I have found that neither party is a tortfeasor liable in respect of any damage to the plaintiff, this contribution or indemnity claim does not arise. In the Seventh Cross-Claim ISS seeks contribution on indemnity from ThyssenKrupp as a tortfeasor liable to the plaintiff in respect of the same damage as is claimed by the plaintiff against ISS. Again, neither party to the cross-claim is a tortfeasor liable to the plaintiff and there is no occasion for ordering contribution or indemnity.
	
	
	Accordingly, I will dismiss the Third and Seventh Cross-Claims.
	


Fourth and fifth Cross-Claims: ThyssenKrupp v Capital Investors and ISS


	
	By the Fourth Cross-Claim, Thyssen Krupp claims contribution or indemnity against Capital Investors pursuant to s 4 Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. As I find that neither of these parties is a tortfeasor liable in respect of damage to the plaintiff the Fourth Cross-Claim will be dismissed.
	
	
	The Fifth Cross-Claim, filed by ThyssenKrupp, is for contribution or indemnity against ISS, on the basis that it is a joint tortfeasor together with ThyssenKrupp. The premises of this cross-claim have not arisen and it will be dismissed.
	


Sixth Cross-Claim: Capital Investors v Office & Industrial


	
	In the Sixth Cross-Claim Capital Investors alleges that if the plaintiff’s allegations are sustained then Office & Industrial breached its duty of care owed to her as her employer and is liable in negligence for the same damage as that for which Capital Investors is liable. Contribution or indemnity is sought pursuant to the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. I will dismiss this cross-claim as the premise of it – a liability in Capital Investors, for which contribution or indemnity might be ordered – has not arisen.
	
	
	Further, negligence of Office & Industrial in the particulars alleged in paragraph 11 of the Sixth Cross-Claim has not been proved. Item (a) of those particulars repeats against Office & Industrial the plaintiff’s allegations in paragraph 9 of her amended statement of claim. So far as this is intended to pick up the particulars under paragraph 9 it is unworkable because those particulars are specific to Capital Investors, ThyssenKrupp and ISS and are referable to the activities and relationships of these entities. But so far as the plaintiff’s allegations in paragraph 9 may be adapted to allegations against Office & Industrial, the findings that I have made with respect to all of those particulars (in dealing, above, with the plaintiff’s claim against each of the defendants) are applicable to dispose of the contention on this cross-claim that Office & Industrial was negligent in any of the respects mentioned.
	
	
	Items (b) and (c) of Capital Investors particulars of negligence alleged against Office & Industrial assert failure under the Property Management Contract to have the lifts at 20 Loftus Street inspected and maintained and to undertake risk assessments in respect of them. This allegation is unsustainable in the face of the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract and the evidence of its implementation.
	
	
	Items (d) and (e) of the particulars alleged by Capital Investors against Office & Industrial are that the latter failed to ensure that “appropriate requests for upgrade” were “escalated” to Capital Investors and failed “to take heed of the hazard… of which [Office & Industrial] was aware”. I have found that the recommendation of ThyssenKrupp in the October 2006 Assessment came into the hands of Resolve FM which, at the relevant time, was Capital Investors’ agent with respect to oversight of maintenance of the lifts. The evidence does not substantiate that the Assessment was ever in the hands of Office & Industrial in such a way as to make “escalation” of it a responsibility of that company. Even if there was some legal obligation, either contractual or pursuant to a duty of care, upon Office & Industrial to “escalate” the assessment, its failure to do so was not causative of any damage in circumstances where Capital Investors’ agent, Resolve FM, obtained the Assessment in any event.
	
	
	Contrary to Item (e) of the particulars, I find there is no evidence to establish that Office & Industrial was aware, at any relevant time, of a hazard to lift passengers constituted by any tendency of the lifts in 20 Loftus Street to stop out-of-level.
	
	
	Item (f) of the particulars against Office & Industrial alleges that it failed to train and instruct the plaintiff in her work. The particular does not descend to a description of what aspect of her work required more training than she in fact received or how any such deficiency of training was to any extent causative of the accident and the plaintiff’s subsequent injury. I cannot identify any evidence which substantiates a failure to train in any respect relevant to the issues in the case.
	


Office & Industrial’s claim against the three defendants – No. 2014/308507


	
	In support of its recovery action under s 151Z(1)(d) Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) (see [14] above), Office & Industrial “repeats and relies upon” the plaintiff’s allegations in her statement of claim regarding negligence of Capital Investors, ThyssenKrupp and ISS. As I find that those allegations by the plaintiff of negligence against the three defendants fail, Office & Industrial’s recovery action must be dismissed.
	


Plaintiff’s case on causation of injury by the tripping incident


	
	As I have heard evidence and argument on causation of injury I will make findings on that subject although my conclusions on breach of duty and causation of the plaintiff’s trip are sufficient to dispose of the amended statement of claim and all cross-claims.
	
	
	In broad terms the plaintiff contends that the tripping incident on 12 August 2008 aggravated and accelerated pre-existing degeneration of discs in her cervical spine leading to severe pain in her neck and radiating into her arms, with numbness and other neurological symptoms particularly in the right arm. In her evidentiary statement, the plaintiff made these claims regarding the contrast between her pre- and post-accident medical condition:
	


“[11] My employment was continuous until I took on a new position with AMP Capital Investors at 50 Bridge Street, Sydney. I had had to spend about four weeks away from work before I left Savills because of a heart condition, namely supraventricular tachycardia. This condition was treated at St Vincent’s Hospital by way of angiogram and my condition is now completely stable. I have had no further symptoms.

…

[14] Before the accident I was an active person in good health. It was my invariable routine to walk every morning for about 1 hour. Whilst I did not play regular sports I used to ski, which I ceased in about 1997. In the early part of the 1990’s I developed a condition in my neck which was controlled. I had in this respect taken some advice from Dr Garrick. I undertook no surgery. The condition was appropriately managed by taking analgesia and I was only troubled by the condition, on average, about twice a year.

[15] Apart from the heart condition which I had earlier mentioned and the occasional neck discomfort, I had no other relevant health issues.

…

[21] Apart from physical problems associated with the accident, I have developed what I imagine to be a significant anxiety condition. I have had to deal with a lot of stress which in turn has affected my relationship with my partner. I have become depressed and am taken to periods of weeping and sleeplessness.

[22] I had complained to my general practitioner, Dr Moore, about these mental health issues and Dr Moore referred me to Dr Simon Turmanis at Neutral Bay. I continue to see him. At the moment I am taking Lexipro.

[23] In respect of my physiological health, I have pain and discomfort around my neck and shoulders. Pain radiates down my right arm to my hand and fingers. I have been under the care of Dr Ian Farey, a spinal surgeon. Dr Farey performed a cervical spinal fusion on 27 March 2012 in respect of the C5 to C7 disc spaces. I have an appointment to see Dr Farey on 09 March 2015 at which time further surgery will be discussed. As I understand it, Dr Farey may recommend a further fusion to the level above at C4. It is my present intention to accept Dr Farey’s recommendation.

[24] I have had physiotherapy in the past. I undertook physiotherapy between August 2012 and October 2012. On the advice of Dr Farey I have ceased the physiotherapy because it has produced too much discomfort. The physiotherapist I saw was Dr Helen Clare at Crows Nest.”


	
	In evidence in chief the plaintiff said that since the accident she has constant pain across her shoulders which she had not previously suffered “to this level” (T 119). She identified the only prior pain she had experienced “in that area” as “some bad neck pain” in 2000, about which she had consulted Dr Garrick, neurosurgeon. The plaintiff said that after the 2000 episode “I was fine” up to the date of the accident (T 119 – 120).
	
	
	The plaintiff said that after the accident on 12 August 2008 neck and arm pain progressed until, by 2012, it was “unbearable and I couldn’t lift my right arm” (T 121.6). Consequently, she had surgery performed by Dr Farey, orthopaedic surgeon, on 28 March 2012 to fuse the C5/6 and C6/7 vertebrae.
	


Medical records of the plaintiff’s pre-accident neck and arm pain


	
	When pre-accident medical records were tendered and when the plaintiff was cross-examined on them a picture emerged regarding her pre-accident medical history which was entirely at odds with her claim that up to 12 August 2008 she was “an active person in good health” and that her neck condition was “controlled”. The dates and the substance of the principal events in this pre-accident medical history are summarised in the following paragraphs. In all cases, emphasis is added and square brackets enclose definitions and explanations obtained from elsewhere in the evidence.
	
	
	8 May 1997: Dr Sheehy, neurosurgeon, was consulted by the plaintiff on this date concerning
	


“attacks that have occurred over the last couple of years with painful restriction of movement of her neck. This pain can be associated with a pain radiating into the occipital plate region and also a pain radiating along the thoracic spine. Following this recent attack there has been some right arm pain but no forearm or hand involvement. The arm symptoms have settled”.


	
	Dr Sheehy recorded the following observations upon examination:
	


“Cervical movements were all restricted especially lateral rotation and lateral tilting. …All movements of the cervical spine caused a pain centred on the right side of the mid-cervical vertebrae. I have found no abnormality of tone, bulk or power in the limbs and the reflexes were quite normal. She attended with a plain x-ray of the cervical spine performed in March 1995 which demonstrated loss of the cervical lordosis [ie the naturally occurring concave forward curvature of the cervical spine, loss of which is consistent with disc degeneration]”.


	
	7 July 2000: report of Dr R Garrick, neurologist, following the plaintiff’s consultation with him on 5 July 2000. She gave a history of a recent
	


“relapse of intense neck pain associated with severe brachalgia [scil. brachialgia – arm pain] and lower limb sensory change. She has a history of about six years of recurrent similar episodes which have occurred without obvious significant neck trauma. She recalls a minor skiing accident in the past but there was no definite neck injury or subsequent pain. Her first attack of symptoms occurred when she was working in a bar and she thought neck discomfort may have resulted from lifting. Other episodes have occurred spontaneously and always with significant pain and movement restriction of the neck with attempted flexion producing occipital and lateralised neck pain, brachalgia mainly in the right hand but sometimes in the left, and there is frequently distal paraesthesia involving both feet. The current episode occurred without provocation and is the most severe to date. … Each episode has subsided spontaneously but she feels that she is a little worse after each episode. Between episodes she is reasonably comfortable but in the last few months there has been a tendency to waken at night with a feeling of numbness in the arms, generally on the right side but on the last night this was on the left”.


	
	The results of Dr Garrick’s examination of the plaintiff on 5 July 2000 and the results of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (“MRI”) were recorded as follows:
	


“Examination revealed significant restriction of cervical rotation and flexion with predominantly right sided posterior cervical tenderness… Her magnetic scans of 5/7/2000 show a moderate disc protrusion at C5/6 extending to the right and indenting the thecal sac. There is a minor kyphosis [reversal of the natural curvature of the cervical spine, to an outward curve as in a hunched back] due to muscle spasm at this level. There is no alteration in [spinal] cord signal. Eugenie undoubtedly has a significant disc lesion producing recurrent lesion episodes of discomfort. There is no clinical evidence of myelopathy [neurologic deficit related to the spinal cord, for example caused by arthritic changes resulting in narrowing of the spinal canal or stenosis] and the radicular signs [ie radiating from the nerve roots at the cervical spine into the arm] are of irritation rather than compression at present. There is a reasonable chance that this current relapse will settle with conservative treatment with a few days of steroid and analgesia. However, unless Eugenie achieves an adequate level of pain relief quickly the degree of compromise on MR scan and the recurrent nature of her episodes would suggest that surgical intervention by anterior approach would be appropriate”.


	
	The MRI report of 5 July 2000 to which Dr Garrick referred contained this conclusion
	


“There is a moderate disc protrusion at the C5/6 level to the right of mid line indenting the thecal sac [ie the membrane containing fluid surrounding the spinal cord] with mild flattening of the cord which is kinked over this region. This has resulted in a minor kyphosis presumably due to a spasm over this region. The intra-substance of the cord signal is normal”.


	
	31 August 2001: contrary to the plaintiff’s claim in her evidence in chief (namely, that from 2000 up to the date of her accident she was “fine” with respect to her neck), she consulted Dr Garrick on 31 August 2001 concerning “intermittent paraesthesia [abnormal tingling sensation] in the arms and legs” with “shooting pains down the left arm to the thumb” and her left arm feeling “strange and vaguely weak”. Dr Garrick found:
	


“Eugenie’s symptoms are of myalgic [ie muscle] character and probably do not represent myelopathy or specific neuromuscular disturbance. She does have significant cervical spondylosis [ie degeneration of intervertebral discs, producing narrowing of the space occupied by the discs] with persistent intermittent discomfort likely to be provoking a tension myalgic reaction.”


	
	A further scan at this time was reported upon by Dr Garrick on 24 September 2001. He said that it showed “essentially the same as previous studies with C5/6 disc more to the right but without encroachment on the spinal cord.”
	
	
	On 10 July 2003 and again on 22 April 2004 the plaintiff consulted Dr Garrick regarding sensory changes in her lower limbs, for which the doctor could find no causative structural change. The roots of the nerves of the lower limbs emerge from the lumbar spine. Therefore lower limb nerve impingement could not have been associated with the degenerative changes to the plaintiff’s cervical spine.
	
	
	17 March 2008: in response to a further referral of the plaintiff, Dr Garrick recorded her history of past and current complaints as follows:
	


“…a persistent neuropathic sensory disturbance which originally resulted from a right C5 nerve root irritation in mid-2000. At that time she had prominent brachalgia (sic) with minor focal radicular features. Scans did identify a C5/6 disc protrusion extending to encroach on the C6 nerve root. Subsequent scans showed slight resolution that persist in structural change.

Over the last eight years Eugenie has tolerated a low level fibromyalgic [ie relating to pain in the fibrous tissue components of muscles] muscle and ligamentous discomfort pattern associated with a feeling of slight numbness in the right neck and arm generally at night. She has managed this with maintenance of physical fitness, occasional Voltaren and some past physiotherapy. There have been no new injuries and general health has been satisfactory. She has some life stresses which she copes with.

There has been a recent increase in her discomfort and sensory symptoms over the last couple of months and greater discomfort in the last two weeks with sleep more disturbed than usual.

She is aware of right-sided anterior and cervical low neck pain and some movement restriction. There has been an altered sensation over the back and extending to the right side of the face and brachalgia (sic) with numbness extending down the right arm particularly to the thumb. …

I presume that there has been some recent further neural irritation. A progress magnetic scan is warranted to exclude any new structural pathology but it is highly likely that Eugenie’s symptoms will settle with conservative management. Gentle physiotherapy should be helpful… .”


	
	The parts of the above passages which I have highlighted satisfy me that from at least 1995 the plaintiff suffered recurrent episodic pain and altered sensation in her arms, particularly the right. She also suffered pain in her neck which was at times disabling. Both the neck pain and the arm symptoms became progressively worse with each episode. This contemporaneous evidence directly contradicts her assertions as quoted at [186] and [187].
	


Plaintiff’s consultations with Cremorne Medical Practice from November 2005


	
	The plaintiff’s referrals to doctors Sheehy and Garrick in the period May 1997 to April 2004 had been from Drs Hardy and Berecry in Double Bay. From 10 November 2005 the plaintiff had commenced to see Dr Tony Andrew, General Practitioner, at the Cremorne Medical Practice. She continued to see Dr Andrew and Drs Liu, Tan and Moore in this practice up until at least August 2014.
	
	
	Prior to the accident on 12 August 2008 the plaintiff consulted the doctors of this practice on average every four to six weeks with a range of health issues including intermittent fainting and dizziness from early 2006; symptoms of depression and anxiety from mid-2006 through to October 2013 (for which anti-depressant medication was prescribed); crushing chest pains and abdominal pain from August 2006 through to 2011; tachycardia in early 2007 (for which a catheter ablation was performed by a cardiologist, Dr Kuchar, on 26 April 2007); aching and painful hips from November 2007 and a pregnancy which was terminated on 21 August 2010.
	
	
	On 16 May 2007 the plaintiff informed Dr Andrew that “for years she has developed numbness on the left side of her body when she is in bed at night”. She complained of “aching all over especially the upper body and back of the neck”.
	
	
	On 1 March 2008 Dr Liu recorded this history from the plaintiff:
	


“Long term cervical neck problems. Has seen Dr Garrick over the years and meant to have repeat MRI three years ago. Longstanding numbness and tingling in lower body, arms, legs. Now some new pains around C2 C3 dermatomes on the right side.”


	
	In response to this history and the plaintiff’s then current complaints Dr Liu referred her to Dr Garrick who reported on 17 March 2008 as summarised at [198].
	
	
	The consultation records of the Cremorne Medical Practice, which appear to have been maintained meticulously and comprehensively, do not indicate any consultation of the plaintiff with a general practitioner of that practice at the time of or shortly after the accident of 12 August 2008.
	
	
	Even when the plaintiff saw Dr Andrew next after the accident, more than a year later on 11 September 2009, she made no mention of it to him. Her attendance was in relation to a cough. In more than 20 further consultations at this practice, from 11 September 2009 to 22 June 2011, the plaintiff did not inform any general practitioner of the accident or of any neck or arm pain said to have been caused by it.
	


First post-accident examinations: Avenue Road Medical and Dr Garrick


	
	From 3 June 2008 the plaintiff had commenced to consult Dr Ranasinghe-Markus at the Avenue Road Medical Practice as her general practitioner. She had consulted this doctor on eight occasions between 3 June 2008 and the date of the accident: for gynaecological symptoms, for a breast examination, to obtain a certificate of unfitness for work due to sore throat and fever and for migraine. In these consultations, at the commencement of her professional relationship with Dr Ranasinghe-Markus, the plaintiff made no reference to her then 13 year history of cervical disc degenerative disease and neck and radicular arm pain.
	
	
	On 26 August 2008 the plaintiff consulted Dr Ranasinghe-Markus about neck pain she had suffered since the accident of 12 August 2008. She gave a history in these terms:
	


“Reason for visit: Fall has had neck problems since 1999, and been under Ray Garrick at [St Vincent’s Hospital]. Has had steroid treatment in the past. Last saw Ray three months ago, and was told to get a repeat MRI, but didn’t do it.

Fell out of the lift at work, which was not level when it stopped. Had Voltaren at home, from another doctor, and took it on and off. In the last two days the pain has been severe since the Voltaren ran out”.


	
	Dr Ranasinghe-Markus diagnosed cervical disc herniation and referred the plaintiff to Dr Garrick. He reported on 25 September 2008, as follows:
	


“[The plaintiff] has a long history of neck pain and movement restrictions. She originally saw John Sheehy 11 years ago after a history of at least three years of neck pain. Her father is an eminent senior spinal specialist physiotherapist so she has had careful conservative management in the past.

There have been a number of episodes of significant neck pain with stiffness and several episodes of brachialgia with paresthesia (sic) extending to the hands.

Her serial imaging over the last 10 years has shown moderate C5/6 disc degeneration with a slight degenerative slip. The current films show changes at C6/7 more prominently than the previous studies of 200 (scil. 2000).

On her last examination most of her symptoms were of fibromyalgic character but I thought that her history warranted regular MR scan reviews.

While the current report [ie an MRI report of 19 September 2008] is accurate, it needs to be considered in comparison with her older films and really there is not much change. Hopefully, we can continue with conservative management for a long time yet”.


	
	On the same date Dr Garrick wrote directly to the plaintiff regarding the MRI scan of 19 September 2008:
	


“I think that your MR scans of 19.9.08 are not particularly different from the scans of eight years ago. The C5/6 disc is somewhat worn – ‘the mild kinking of the spinal cord’ reported is not of significance since there is plenty of spinal fluid around the cord at all levels.

The current scans show some minor changes at C6/7 disc on the right side. This may well be the source of your previous sensory symptoms – the changes are quite mild on the scan and it is import (sic) to try to directly compare the old films with the new. If you still have the old films I would be grateful for the chance to directly compare them”.


	
	Through late 2008 and continuing until October 2013 the plaintiff consulted Dr Ranasinghe-Markus and other general practitioners in the Avenue Road Medical Practice regarding continuing pain in her neck and pains and other sensations radiating down her right arm which she attributed to the accident. I will briefly summarise these consultations before turning to the findings and opinions of Dr Farey, the orthopaedic surgeon to whom the plaintiff was referred in February 2009 and who became her treating specialist.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s consultations with Dr Ranasinghe-Markus and her colleagues with respect to neck and arm pain were interspersed with numerous other consultations for a variety of medical symptoms and complaints. A number of the consultations regarding the neck and arm pain were for the purpose of obtaining certificates of unfitness for work or to discuss the advice given by Dr Farey from time to time – with no up to date history being taken on many of these occasions. Consultations concerning the neck and arm pain occurred on average once every two weeks in late 2008, approximately every six weeks in 2009 and 2010, every four weeks in 2011, every eight weeks in 2012 and once in every four weeks during 2013 (up to October).
	
	
	Dr Ranasinghe-Markus and her colleagues at the Avenue Road Medical Practice wrote certificates of unfitness for work for the plaintiff on the basis of her neck and arm pain and prescribed various anti-inflammatory and pain relief medications. Some of Dr Ranasinghe-Markus’s reports to the Workers Compensation insurer of the plaintiff’s employer provided opinions regarding the nature of the deterioration in the plaintiff’s cervical spine. However those expressions of opinion were clearly derived from the specialist reports of Dr Farey and I will confine my consideration of the detail of orthopaedic and neurological issues, below, to the evidence given directly by the plaintiff’s treating specialist and other specialists.
	
	
	In October 2013 the plaintiff ceased to consult the doctors of the Avenue Road Medical Practice altogether. Dr Moore, a general practitioner at the Cremorne Medical Practice, took over her care with respect to neck and arm pain. From the date of the accident up until October 2013 the plaintiff had consulted doctors at the Cremorne Medical Practice about many other health issues but not the neck or arm pain or anything which she attributed to the accident of 12 August 2008.
	


Referral of plaintiff to Dr Farey in February 2009


	
	The plaintiff was referred to Dr Farey in February 2009 by Dr Waks, a general practitioner of George Street Sydney whom the plaintiff’s father consulted. The plaintiff’s father took an active part in securing her first appointment with Dr Farey, on 16 February 2009.
	
	
	On that occasion, as reported by Dr Farey on 18 February 2009, the only history given by the plaintiff of pre-accident pain associated with her cervical spine was that she had “experienced intermittent neck pain for a period of 10 years”. No mention was made of the neurological symptoms in the right arm which she had described to Drs Sheehy and Garrick since 1997 (see [190] – [198]). The plaintiff told Dr Farey that since the accident she had experienced “a sudden increase in her symptoms”, with “constant pain of variable intensity” in the neck and radiating from the cervical spine “to the shoulders and inter-scapular region” and to “the right thumb and index finger”, with “numbness and paraesthesia particularly at night with lesser symptoms in the left upper limb”.
	
	
	Dr Farey conducted “provocative tests for upper limb nerve root compression”. That is, he had the patient move her head so as to provoke any potential nerve impingement at the cervical spine. These tests were negative. The doctor found global hypoaesthesia (reduced sense of touch) in the right arm. There was no sign of myelopathy.
	
	
	The MRI scan of 19 September 2008 (which Dr Garrick reviewed – see [209] and [210]) had revealed that “the C5/6 disc shows spondylotic changes with backward slip and kyphosis”. The backward slip is referred to elsewhere in the evidence as retrolisthesis, meaning that a vertebra has slipped backwards relative to the subjacent vertebra. The MRI report stated that the spondylotic changes at C5/6 were associated with narrowing of the inter-vertebral space and osteophytes (bony projections from the vertebrae). The report noted “moderate reactive bone changes… in the end plates [ie of the C5/6 disc]” and encroachment in the foramina on both sides at the C5/6 level. That is, narrowing of the openings through which nerves pass to the arms.
	
	
	From this MRI report Dr Farey noted that the plaintiff had “marked degenerative disc disease at the C5/6 level with retrolisthesis”. He considered that slight disc protrusion and indentation of the spinal cord was not significant. He noted the stenosis (narrowing) of the foramina at C5/6, and accepted that this was caused by degenerative osteoarthritis or spondylosis. Dr Farey regarded the plaintiff’s radiating right arm pain as being C6 radiculopathy – symptomatic of nerve root compression at C5/6, although the provocative tests had not demonstrated any nerve root interference. Dr Farey thought the C5/6 retrolisthesis seen on the MRI of 19 September 2008 was “the major cause of the symptoms”. He required further investigation by X-ray and CT scan.
	


Arm pain intermittent before and after the trip – Dr Farey’s reports to June 2009


	
	Dr Farey concluded in his report of 18 February 2009 that the tripping incident had led to an exacerbation of the plaintiff’s underlying condition and produced increased symptoms. However he was not provided with the reports of Drs Sheehy and Garrick summarised at [190] – [198]. He never saw those reports until they were shown to him during the trial of the action. Nor did he receive secondary information as to their contents before that time. He did not know when preparing his report of 18 February 2009 that the plaintiff had intermittently suffered radiating right arm pain since May 1997.
	
	
	The sparse history given to Dr Farey by the plaintiff omitted the detail of symptoms she had reported to her previous neurosurgeon and neurologist. It omitted the findings of previous MRI scans, notably that of 5 July 2000 (see [193], [194]). I cannot rely upon Dr Farey’s conclusion that the tripping incident exacerbated the plaintiff’s underlying condition and produced increased symptoms in circumstances where he was not informed about a 13 year history of recurrent and worsening neck and arm pain. It is apparent that Dr Farey was quite unaware the plaintiff had ever suffered any arm pain at all and regarded the neurological sensations and deficits in her arm as symptoms which had only manifested themselves since the accident. He was misled.
	
	
	Dr Farey obtained a report dated 6 March 2009 of the results of an X-ray of the plaintiff’s cervical spine and of CT and MRI examinations of the spine. This showed “minor retrolisthesis of C5 on C6 which appears secondary to underlying degenerative disc disease. This is evidenced by fairly marked disc space narrowing and adjacent end plate osteophytes”. The report identified mild reversal of the lordosis on CT examination which the radiologist considered was “probably secondary to patient positioning or possibly muscle spasm”. The radiologist’s conclusion was
	


“mild disc desiccation in the lower cervical spine with most marked degenerative changes at C5/6. There is mild disc-osteophyte at this level, causing mild canal narrowing. There are also minor disc bulges/protrusions at C4/5 and C6/7 levels. There is however no focal cord signal abnormality or evidence of cord odema. There is mild to moderate narrowing of bi-lateral C5/6 exit foramina”.


	
	In a report of 6 May 2009 following receipt of the above radiological information, Dr Farey concluded that what he understood to be an aggravation of the plaintiff’s symptoms had not ceased and that those symptoms “would not have reached this stage had it not been for the incident of 12 August 2008”. This opinion on exacerbation and causation, to the same effect as that of 18 February 2009, was given on the basis of a materially incomplete history. I therefore cannot rely upon it.
	
	
	Dr Farey reviewed the plaintiff on 30 June 2009 and reported these findings by letter to Dr Waks of 1 July 2009:
	


“[the plaintiff] complains of persistent neck pain with significant exacerbation of pain since April which usually lasts for a few days. This has been treated with rest, analgesia and anti-inflammatory medication. She does not have any symptoms of nerve root compression nor does she have symptoms of spinal cord compression. She has occasional paraesthesia related to the right upper limb particularly during the day and has subjective weakness in her thighs when walking upstairs.”


	
	After referring to the radiological report of 6 March 2009 (summarised at [222] above), Dr Farey advised as follows:
	


“Eugenie has symptoms of cervical spondylosis. I would not recommend surgery in the current circumstances as her dominant complaint is that of neck pain and there is no clinical evidence of spinal cord or nerve root compression. I have recommended that she have physiotherapy and anti-inflammatory medication. She should undertake daily range of motion exercises to prevent stiffness. I have discussed the symptoms of spinal cord compression with her and in the long term should she develop these symptoms, decompression stabilisation fusion would be indicated. Spinal fusion for predominant neck and shoulder pain rarely produces satisfactory results even in the presence of successful spinal fusion… In my opinion Eugenie is fit to undertake office duties or building inspections and could return to work in the commercial real estate field. I will review her condition in four months”.


	
	I conclude from this report that at 30 June 2009, almost 11 months after the accident, the condition of the plaintiff’s cervical spine was not different from what it had been for approximately 13 years prior to the accident. Attacks of “painful restriction of movement of her neck” had been reported to Dr Sheehy in May 1997. The periodic “significant exacerbation of pain since April [2009] which usually lasts for a few days”, as reported by the plaintiff to Dr Farey on 30 June 2009, had been a symptom of her long term cervical spondylosis noted by Dr Sheehy as early as 13 May 1997, and by Dr Garrick on 7 July 2000, 4 September 2001, 22 May 2004 and 17 March 2008 (see [190] – [198]).
	
	
	The pre-accident reports demonstrate a degree of chronic underlying pain which had persisted “generally” at a sufficient level to disturb sleep on an ongoing basis and which, by March 2008, had increased over a period of at least two months and became still more acute for a period of at least two weeks. This is not a description of intermittent short term pain in the neck and the arms with complete relief and return to normality in between short episodes. It is a description of a chronic experience of pain in the neck and from the neck to the right arm, at varying levels. Just as the neck pain had from time to time prior to the accident flared up to greater intensity and then settled to its chronic level, so it flared up soon after the accident and then reverted to its chronic condition with, again, subsequent episodes of heightened pain. The continuance of the pattern, as evidenced in Dr Farey’s report of 1 July 2009, is confirmed in the doctor’s subsequent reports reviewed below.
	


No change in radiological appearance of the cervical spine following accident


	
	The physical condition of the involved cervical vertebra, also, appears to have been unchanged in any significant respect following the accident. Dr Garrick so observed in his report addressed directly to the plaintiff dated 25 September 2008 (see [210]). Although the retrolisthesis identified in the MRI report of 19 September 2008 had not been referred to in the 5 July 2000 report, Dr Farey gave emphatic evidence, which I accept, that this feature had been present before the incident of 12 August 2008: T 625.33. He said it was the result of the degenerative condition and that it “develops over a number of years” (T 625.50). Dr Farey considered it “possible but unlikely” that the degree of retrolisthesis was affected by the accident (T 626.32 and, to similar effect, T 635.12 – .18). Dr Farey’s evidence satisfies me that the posture of the patient when the earlier MRI scan was conducted may have caused any retrolisthesis which was then present not to have been picked up in the scan or to have appeared to be of a lesser degree than was in fact the case: T 635.35 – .42.
	
	
	Three other significant aspects of the first two post-accident MRI scans showed no change from what had been found on the scan of 5 July 2000. First the MRI reports of 19 September 2008 and 6 March 2009 both refer to mild impingement on the spinal cord at C5/6, without effect on the normal cord signal. This had been present since the scan of 5 July 2000. Secondly both of the post-accident MRI reports noted that the foramina (nerve root exits) at C5/6 were encroached by osteophytes, the bony growths which were a concomitant of the plaintiff’s degenerative spondylosis. In the report of 5 July 2000 these osteophytes were referred to as “anterior spur formation”. In spite of them, it was then noted that “the foramina on either side appear to be adequate”. Thirdly, the 17 September 2008 and 6 March 2009 reports identified a bulge or protrusion of the disc at C6/7 towards the right side. At 5 July 2000 this disc protrusion was not noted as impinging the spinal cord or nerve roots. On 19 September 2008 it was said to be “probably affecting the C6 nerve root with extension to the right foramina” but on 6 March 2009 only mild impingement on the spinal cord was observed, with no abnormality of cord signal, and there was “no significant foraminal narrowing”.
	
	
	Following an examination on 30 June 2009 Dr Farey reported (on 1 July 2009), “no evidence of nerve root compression”. The plaintiff’s complaints of “occasional paraesthesia [tingling] related to the right upper limb” were not, in the doctor’s opinion, symptoms of nerve root compression. The plaintiff was advised against a spinal fusion at this time because there was no clinical evidence that altered sensation in her right arm was caused by the condition of her cervical spine. Whilst the variable pain in the neck itself might have been attributable to the clinically observable cervical spondylosis, surgery was not considered likely to relieve that area of pain.
	


Dr Farey’s reports from October 2009


	
	Dr Farey again examined the plaintiff on 26 October 2009 and reported (on 30 October) as follows:
	


“She complains of neck pain. At night she experiences bilateral arm pain and paraesthesia on the C6 distribution. On occasion she does experience some paraesthesia in relation to the ulnar fingers of her hand. …

Clinically, the cervical spine exhibited global restriction of motion. Neck pain was experienced at the limit of motion. … Provocative tests for upper limb nerve root compression produced neck pain but not upper limb symptoms. Neurological examination was normal. In particular there was no evidence of spinal cord compression.

The symptoms experienced by Ms Schneider are secondary to nerve root compression. She does not have any symptoms or signs of spinal cord compression. She could undergo anterior decompression and fusion at the C5 – 6 level which in all likelihood would relieve her upper limb symptoms and reduce some of her neck pain but not completely eliminate it”.


	
	With respect to neck pain and the absence of spinal cord compression this report shows the position unchanged from that of 1 July 2009. I cannot reconcile Dr Farey’s conclusion that the plaintiff’s symptoms were “secondary to nerve root compression” with the balance of his report. The symptoms he refers to in that regard must be those of “bilateral arm pain and paraesthesia in the C6 distribution”, as those are the only symptoms reported to which nerve root compression could be relevant. But at this date Dr Farey had no further radiological scan or report identifying such compression and the “provocative tests” (causing the patient to move her head in ways which might impinge the nerve roots of the cervical spine: T 646/27 – 36) did not produce upper limb symptoms.
	
	
	However, assuming that the plaintiff was suffering some nerve root compression at this date, it had disappeared by the next examination in early February 2010. Dr Farey’s report of 11 February 2010 concerning an examination on 5 February contains the following:
	


“She experiences paraesthesia in her hands, particularly at night. She does not have any symptoms of nerve root or spinal cord compression at this time. She is not taking analgesia. …

Clinically, the cervical spine exhibited restricted extension and rotation consistent with cervical spondylosis. … Lateral flexion precipitated neck and shoulder pain. Neurological examination was normal. In particular there was no evidence of nerve root or spinal cord compression.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging [referring to a report of an image taken on 3 February 2010] … revealed the presence of degenerative disc disease at the C5 – 6 and C6 – 7 levels with retrolisthesis at the C5 – 6 level. However there was no evidence of spinal cord compression nor was there any evidence of foraminal stenosis causing nerve root compression”.


	
	Arm pain possibly attributable to interference with nerve roots emanating from the plaintiff’s cervical spine, had been reported by the plaintiff since 1995: see [190] – [198]. C5/6 nerve root irritation had been inferred from her complaints of “numbness extending down the right arm particularly to the thumb” (report of Dr Garrick, 17 March 2008). When told of this in cross-examination Dr Farey agreed that these symptoms were “suggestive of nerve root compression”: T 644.50. The plaintiff had not complained of any symptoms which could have been attributable to C5/6 nerve root compression after March 2008 up to the date of her accident. After the accident Dr Farey again found these symptoms present in his report of 18 February 2009 (see [216] – [219]) but by the date of the examination to which his report of 1 July 2009 relates they had resolved. Accepting Dr Farey’s findings of 30 October 2009 at face value, symptoms which were “secondary to nerve root compression” resurfaced at that date, only to have faded away again by early February 2010.
	
	
	Thus, right through to February 2010 there was no appreciable change in those of the plaintiff’s reported intermittent symptoms which were possibly attributable to nerve root compression, relative to her condition prior to the accident. In both periods the symptoms which might indicate nerve root impact have come and gone. Certainly I cannot find a difference – of magnitude, frequency or type – between the plaintiff’s pre- and post-accident intermittent symptoms such as could support on the balance of probabilities an inference that the accident had caused a difference by February 2010. There is no temporal relationship between (a) any changed pattern of the coming and going of reported symptoms which could possibly be indicative of nerve root compression and (b) the occurrence of the plaintiff’s trip.
	


Dr Farey’s opinion on causation invalidated


	
	When Dr Farey was cross-examined upon this continuity of the symptom pattern before and after the accident (T 647.27 – .36) he simply asserted: “What I am saying is that she had a material exacerbation of the symptoms after that incident”. When pressed to explain why he would say that, he agreed that “the natural history of these things is that they, they tend to come and go” (T 647.45). At T 648.43 – 649.10 the following evidence was given (emphasis added):
	


“Q. …first of all you said you thought [the trip incident was a material cause of the plaintiff’s condition post 12 August 2008 because it was only after this incident that she had presented with true nerve root compression or symptoms. That’s what you initially said, didn’t you?

A. Yes.

Q. That you thought that in the past it had always been localised to just neck pain, is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Then I’ve taken you to Dr Garrick’s reports and you can see that that’s not correct in terms of the history you were given. Then you said--

HIS HONOUR

Q. Do you agree with that? You were nodding but are you agreeing?

A. I, I – well according to Dr Garrick’s history, there’s a history of arm pain, that’s not a history I obtained your Honour.


	
	It is clear from other answers given by Dr Farey (at T 644.33 – .50) that he thought the plaintiff had presented to him with “symptoms significantly different at the time [he] first saw her to those that she was presenting to Dr Garrick with back in 2000 to 2008”. That was because when he first saw her in February 2009 she had “specific C6 nerve compression symptoms” which he understood had not been presented to Dr Garrick. But he agreed at T 644.50 that Dr Garrick’s report of 17 March 2008 does record such symptoms.
	
	
	At T 628.32 Dr Farey was questioned as follows (emphasis added):
	


“Q. …how would you describe the nature of the exacerbation was it minor or major or somewhere in between? That is, from the incident of 12 August 2008.

A. It was significant in the fact that she hadn’t experienced nerve compression symptoms before and it did persist. I, I wouldn’t say its major – because it – not – it hasn’t got neurological deficit but it is a very significant episode which persisted.

Q. And…

A. And did not respond to appropriate non-operative treatment.”


	
	The fundamental premise of this opinion about exacerbation caused by the incident of 12 August 2008 is false, through no fault of Dr Farey’s, because he was not provided with Dr Garrick’s reports at the time of his first consultation with the plaintiff or at any time thereafter in the course of preparing his own sequence of reports (T 623.25; 367.26). He had not read the entirety of Dr Garrick’s reports even at the date of giving evidence. Nor was he given, orally or in any other form, the substance of the history and opinions set out in Dr Garrick’s reports. He said that the most complete statement of the history that she did give is that set out in the second paragraph of his report of 18 February 2009, to the effect “that she reported she had experienced intermittent neck pain for 10 years”: T 638.18 – .33.
	
	
	At T 637.39 – 638.7 this evidence was given (emphasis added):
	


“Q. But also she was complaining [in March 2008] of brachialgia with numbness extending down into the right arm, particularly down into the right thumb. Were you aware that she was giving a history of that sort of symptom only five months prior to this incident?

A. That’s not – I didn’t obtain that history. She reported that she’d had neck pain and shoulder pain but she did not complain of pain in the arm.

…

A. Irrespective of that, your Honour, the fact of the matter is according to the patient I have to rely on the patient in this regard, prior to the incident she had not had any arm pain and symptoms in this distribution now after that [ie the accident] she did develop them.”


	
	Dr Farey himself acknowledged that his conclusions about exacerbation of the plaintiff’s condition caused by the incident of August 2008 – increased duration of neck pain and commencement, for the first time, of C6 nerve root compression symptoms – are invalid if (as turns out to be the case) the pre-accident history which he was given by the plaintiff was materially incomplete. At T 636 – 637 he stated that symptoms of pain in the arm and particularly down into the right thumb, the C6 distribution, would be expected as a general rule within a month or two after an incident which caused them but that that would not always be the case. He gave these answers:
	


“A. Within a month or two but sometimes, as I say you get this exacerbation of the underlying symptoms, and then several months later they develop the ongoing symptoms in the arm. It’s not entirely predictable your Honour.

Q. In terms of the symptoms, you’re talking about not just neck pain but brachialgia with numbness extending down to, in this case, the right arm, particularly the right thumb I think you said?

A. Thumb and index finger. That’s… the distribution of the C6 nerve root.

Q. So that’s what you were looking for, and that’s what you based your opinion [on] in relation to causation or the answer to causation you just gave to Mr Twomey?

A. That’s part of the causation, because she developed increased neck pain. Now she had, before the incident there was a history of intermittent neck pain, and then after the incident there was a history of constant neck pain and the development of the C6 nerve compression symptoms.

Q. You’ve treated her, but in terms of causation you’re very much dependent upon the earlier history being correct I take it?

A. That’s correct.

Q. So if that’s not correct, your opinion in relation to causation may also not be correct?

A. That’s correct.”


	
	In a number of reports, particularly addressed to the Workers Compensation insurer of Office & Industrial, Dr Farey expressed the opinion that the plaintiff suffered ongoing aggravation of the symptoms of her cervical spondylosis, attributable to the accident of 12 August 2008, continuing up to mid-2015. His oral evidence extended this to an opinion upon causation lasting right up to the date of trial. For example his letter of 6 May 2009 included the following opinions:
	


“Ms Schneider has experienced an exacerbation of symptoms of cervical spondylosis as the result of a work related injury on 12 August 2008. In my opinion the aggravation has not ceased and I would expect her to continue to experience symptoms. …in my opinion Ms Schneider’s symptoms would not have reached this stage had it not been for the incident of 12 August 2008.”


	
	Another letter to the insurer dated 20 January 2010 included the following:
	


“In my opinion the symptoms experienced by Ms Schneider in relation to her cervical spine have been aggravated by her injury of 12 August 2008. Her symptoms have increased in intensity compared with those experienced prior to her injury.

In my opinion the incident of 12 August 2008 is a substantial contributing factor to her current presentation. Following the injury she reported that she developed significant pain and required pain medication for her symptoms. Prior to the injury she did not require this medication.

…in my opinion the aggravation of her pre-existing cervical spondylosis has not ceased and continues as she continues to have significant pain in relation to her cervical spine of a greater intensity than experienced prior to her injury.”


	
	I do not accept these opinions and cannot make findings in accordance with them because of the falsehood of the premises. Additionally to what I have already referred to, the letter of 20 January 2010 relied upon a premise that the plaintiff had not prior to 12 August 2008 required pain medication for her symptoms. In fact, the earlier reports show that Voltaran, sinequan, neurontin and NSAID had all been prescribed and/or used. Further, it was not possible for Dr Farey at the date of this report to compare the plaintiff’s pre-accident and post-accident pain levels for the purpose of founding a conclusion as to whether they had increased. The doctor did not have the records of the plaintiff’s reportage to the previous specialists. He was not in a position to assess what her pre-accident level of pain had been.
	
	
	In a report of 3 August 2010 concerning examination of the plaintiff the preceding day, Dr Farey recorded a recent history of development of “numbness in her right upper limb while driving and… [subsequent] increased neck pain with associated inter-scapular, right shoulder and arm pain radiating to the elbow”. The doctor found that extension of the plaintiff’s neck combined with rotation “precipitated neck and proximal right arm pain as did lateral flexion”. Although the opinion is not expressed in this report, consistently with evidence given elsewhere by Dr Farey this would suggest some degree of nerve root compression or irritation. He found that restrictions on extension and rotation of the plaintiff’s neck were “consistent with her known degenerative change”.
	
	
	Similarly in a report of 20 May 2011 Dr Farey found that on recent examination the plaintiff had restricted extension and rotation of her neck, with pain at the limit of motion. Also, certain movements of the neck increased the right arm pain indicating C6 nerve root compression. On those indications Dr Farey opined that there were good indications for surgery to fuse her cervical vertebra.
	
	
	Similar findings in a report eight months later, on 11 January 2012, resulted in the doctor recommending a C5/6 decompression and fusion. An MRI report of 13 January 2012 confirmed that at C5/6 there was “marked loss of disc height and degenerative plate changes”. The report continued, with respect to C5/6:
	


“There is an associated right uncovertebral osteophyte, the combination of which results in mild to moderate right-sided neural exit foraminal narrowing, which may be irritating the exit right C6 nerve root”.


	
	In the same MRI report the following was stated with respect to the C6/7 level:
	


“at C6/7 there is some loss of disc height and a small to moderate diffuse posterior disc osteophyte complex. There are associated bilateral uncovertebral osteophytes. This results in mild bilateral neural exit foraminal narrowing and mild central canal stenosis”.


	
	The fusion of C5/6 and C6/7 was carried out by Dr Farey on 28 March 2012. The doctor’s operation report confirms that he found narrowing of the foramina at both levels, with nerve root compression. At T 633 – 634 Dr Farey confirmed that the causes of the narrowing were threefold: loss of height in the disc due to the degenerative disease (which involves diminished hydrostatic pressure within the disc); retrolisthesis (which, as explained by the doctor elsewhere, is another aspect of progression of the cervical spondylosis) and uncovertable osteoarthrosis (being the enlargement of a joint immediately adjacent to the foramin which “thickens and … narrows the hole where the nerve comes out”).
	
	
	In further reports of 17 May 2012 and 16 August 2012 Dr Farey expressed the view that the plaintiff had obtained “complete resolution of her radicular pain”. That is, pain in her arms radiating from the nerve roots at the neck and caused by nerve root compression at the exit foramina. The plaintiff nevertheless continued to complain of neck pain and “nocturnal numbness in her hands”.
	
	
	By December 2012 magnetic resonance imaging showed disc protrusion and retrolisthesis at C4/5, which was likely due to the progression of the plaintiff’s cervical spondylosis and increased stress at this level resulting from fusion of the three subjacent vertebrae: T 629.32. No clinical evidence of further nerve root compression was found at C4/5 on subsequent examinations until September 2013.
	


Evidence of Dr Ian Sutton


	
	Dr Ian Sutton, a consultant neurologist, was engaged on behalf of Capital Investors to provide an opinion on the plaintiff’s medical condition. His report is dated 6 November 2013 and he gave extensive oral evidence. Unlike Dr Farey, Dr Sutton read and analysed numerous medical reports concerning the plaintiff dating from prior to the accident, including all of those quoted in these reasons. His own forensic report contains an extensive analysis of the reports of Dr Sheehy and Dr Garrick dating from May 1997 and of the radiological reports from 5 July 2000 onwards. Further, he considered Dr Garrick’s post-accident report of 25 September 2008 and the reports of Dr Farey, commencing with that of 18 February 2009.
	
	
	Dr Sutton examined Ms Schneider on 6 November 2013 and found that detailed neurological examination was “essentially normal”. The only abnormality, a reduced sensation to pinprick over the right arm extending to the trapezius, was considered by Dr Sutton to be a “non-dermatomal distribution”. That is, it does not correspond with compression or irritation of any particular nerve root.
	
	
	Dr Sutton expressed the following opinion:
	


“As outlined in the correspondence of Dr Garrick initial pain presentation may well have been due to a symptomatic disc protrusion, but there has clearly been a transition from chronic pain to a ‘chronic widespread pain syndrome’. This syndrome is characterised by axial pain and pain in other body regions. It is recognised that 21 – 24.5% of individuals with chronic lumbar back pain or neck pain progress to a fibromyalgia syndrome or other types of chronic widespread pain. Risk factors for this transition include other co-morbidities such as irritable bladder syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome that have been experienced by Ms Schnneider. This disorder is considered to be a dysfunctional pain syndrome due to maladaptive plasticity within the central nervous system.”


	
	At T 500 – 501 Dr Sutton further explained his diagnosis of the plaintiff’s condition, both before and after the incident of 12 August 2008, as “an idiopathic pain disorder”. That is, pain that could not be explained in terms of trauma or degeneration sustained. He considered that it is pain the distribution of which is more widespread than would be expected from a particular insult or site of degeneration. At T 513.32 the doctor explained the plaintiff’s perceptions of pain as recorded in the pre-accident reports, upon the basis that she was “perceiving pain from her cervical spondylosis in her brain and her brain is doing something that is causing referred pain elsewhere and referred sensory symptoms elsewhere. … This is a brain issue”.
	
	
	At T 515.5, with reference to Dr Garrick’s report of 17 March 2008, Dr Sutton expressed the opinion that the descriptions in that report of sensory symptoms in the face, which could not be organically explained by reference to the condition of the cervical spine, indicates that “this is an evolving problem with the brain, and not necessarily with the spinal cord”. As at March 2008 Dr Sutton was of the opinion that the plaintiff had
	


“a relapsing progressive chronic widespread pain syndrome, which [was] idiopathic in nature. It may have been triggered by disc degeneration 12 years earlier, but there has been no clinical, by which I mean clinical examination or imaging, findings to support any significant pressure on the spinal cord or the nerve roots, and that the evolution of these symptoms are consistent with a cerebral aetiology that is poorly understood or not understood”.


	
	Dr Sutton’s evidence in this respect is entirely plausible and I accept it. It is consistent with the descriptions of wide ranging pain and other sensations which the plaintiff gave to Drs Sheehy and Garrick over the years prior to the accident, which none of the specialists has been able satisfactorily to attribute to any organic cause. For example pain, discomfort and altered sensation in her legs has been intermittently complained of by the plaintiff. But in the absence of any alteration of the cord signal in the spine, these symptoms are not explicable as in any way organically or mechanically related to the progress of her cervical spondylosis. Similarly, the plaintiff has from time to time, both before and after the accident, given evidence of various distributions of pain, paraesthesia and other sensations in her arms which are non-dermatomal and/or have occurred in the absence of any evidence (either from an MRI scan, from clinical examination or from provocative testing) of nerve root irritation or compression. Dr Sutton describes a recognised condition of widespread chronic idiopathic pain which occurs in a significant proportion of patients who suffer insult or degenerative disease to the lumbar or cervical spine. I find there is ample evidence to support Dr Sutton’s analysis that the plaintiff was such a patient up to the date of her accident and I accept his opinion in this regard.
	
	
	At T 523.32 Dr Sutton expressed the opinion that it was not plausible that there had been any mechanical disruption caused by a trip of the nature described by the plaintiff which would contribute to the worsening of the symptoms which the plaintiff had described to her treating doctors up to the date of the accident. At T 524 – 525 Dr Sutton gave the opinion, in accordance with that of Dr Farey, that the retrolisthesis at C6/7 which was first noted in an MRI report post the accident would not have been caused by the accident. Dr Sutton did not identify anything in the post-accident MRI scans which indicated a physical deterioration or alteration that could be attributed to the trip. This also is consistent with Dr Farey’s evidence.
	
	
	In Dr Sutton’s view all that occurred as a result of the trip on 12 August 2008 was a short-term aggravation of the plaintiff’s chronic widespread pain syndrome:
	


“…based on reports in the provided documentation it is apparent that Ms Schneider had at least a ten year history of a relapsing – remitting pain disorder [elsewhere referred to as a chronic widespread pain syndrome]. There was an aggravation of the condition by the trip that occurred on 12 August 2008, but symptoms and neurological signs did not alter appreciably as a result of the trip and the pain continued to vary in intensity.”


	
	Further, in supporting the view that the trip incident did not cause any injury or symptoms which necessitated the spinal fusion operation carried out by Dr Farey on 28 March 2012, Dr Sutton said this:
	


“Surgery was performed based on symptoms and signs that had not altered appreciably in over ten years. There was no abnormality on clinical examination or MRI that suggested surgery was necessary and the distribution of symptoms and signs indicated a diagnosis of a chronic widespread pain disorder rather than a significant right C6 radiculopathy. Surgery has not resulted in any significant improvement in symptoms.”


	
	I do not express any opinion on the correctness of Dr Farey’s advice to carry out the cervical spinal fusion on 28 March 2012 upon the basis of the history he was given. Medical diagnoses and recommendations for treatment, like any other form of professional advice, can only be judged having regard to the information given. The history given to Dr Farey was materially deficient in respects already noted. I accept Dr Sutton’s evidence that when the entire picture of pre-accident symptoms is taken into account, the basis upon which Dr Farey formed his opinions and recommended treatment falls away.
	
	
	I accept Dr Sutton’s analysis, at T 526 – 529, that the histories taken by Dr Farey in his sequence of reports from 18 February 2009 onwards considered against the earlier reports of Drs Sheehy and Garrick show that there was no more than “a transient deterioration of symptoms in relation to the episode of 12 August 2008” and that thereafter the MRI imaging showed “minor changes… which may well be just age-related and degenerative”. I accept Dr Sutton’s conclusion that Dr Farey’s reports record no evidence of nerve root compression at C5/6 at least up to February 2010. Dr Sutton disagrees with the conclusion in Dr Farey’s report of 20 May 2011 that C6 nerve root compression was indicated by an increase in right arm pain upon extension combined with rotation and lateral flexion of the patient’s neck. I accept Dr Sutton’s evidence that, even accepting these clinical signs as sufficient evidence of nerve root compression, given the date of the finding – nearly three years after the incident – this could not be “connected back” to the trip on 12 August 2008 either “directly or indirectly” (T 530.40).
	
	
	The fact that the plaintiff has received some amelioration of her arm pain since the fusion operation does not cause me to doubt or reject Dr Sutton’s evidence that that pain, when experienced, was idiopathic. I accept Dr Sutton’s opinion that the perceived improvement may well be purely psychological: T 532. The significance of Dr Sutton’s diagnosis, based on the pre-accident reports, of a chronic widespread idiopathic pain syndrome is that this is not something which would likely be affected in a permanent way by a trip incident such as occurred. Also, this diagnosis explains the essential uniformity of the plaintiff’s condition before and after 12 August 2008. In both periods, she has had widespread, “relapsing – remitting” pain, not organically explicable. Nothing has changed.
	
	
	Dr Sutton took part in a conclave on 9 July 2015, together with Dr David Millons and Dr John Davis. Dr Millons is a surgeon who provided two expert reports for the plaintiff. Dr Davis is a specialist in occupational medicine who also provided reports for the plaintiff. In the report of that conclave Drs Millons and Davis recorded their agreement that there was a one-third contribution to the plaintiff’s present medical condition from her pre-existing condition. In other words, two-thirds is attributable to the accident.
	
	
	The report also states that “Dr Ian Sutton indicated that 10% was due to the incident and the majority was due to the pre-existing condition”. His opinion was elaborated more fully as follows:
	


“Dr Ian Sutton felt that the current condition reflected the pre-existing and other medical co-morbidities. He felt from the description of the injury that there would have been a temporary exacerbation of a pre-existing condition and did not feel that there was any mechanism that could explain why there had been a severe and progressive deterioration on the basis of minor mechanical trauma that would have been sustained at the subject incident. He noted that the fact she had got worse after surgery, when surgery should have been a curative condition, suggested that the presentation was typical of a number of patients who end up in a spiral of chronic widespread pain syndrome which cannot be directly attributed to such a minor mechanical injury.”


	
	In his oral evidence Dr Sutton was asked to reconcile the 10% attribution to the accident with the other views that he recorded in the report (at T 535). He said that he did not wish to adhere to the 10% attribution. At T 536 he said that he considered there was “a couple of weeks of aggravation” and that he did not attribute any proportion of her ongoing symptoms to the incident. At T 553 Dr Sutton explained that he thought it was his obligation in the conclave to be conciliatory towards the other experts and to try to arrive at a compromise position. I accept that Dr Sutton misapprehended his obligations in the conclave and the fact that he accepted a 10% attribution in the conclave and then withdrew it in oral evidence does not cause me to have any reservation about his evidence in that respect or generally.
	


Other expert reports in orthopaedic and neurological disciplines


	
	As mentioned, Drs Davis and Millons attributed the plaintiff’s post-accident symptoms and disabilities to the accident as to 66%. Dr Higgs, an orthopaedic consultant and biomedical and forensic engineer, provided a report under engagement by the plaintiff’s solicitors. He attributed the plaintiff’s symptoms and disabilities as to 90% to the accident. Dr Farey attributed 50% to the accident. Dr Wallace (an orthopaedic surgeon engaged by the Workers Compensation Insurer of Office & Industrial) and Dr Evans (an orthopaedic surgeon engaged by the solicitors for ISS) agreed with Dr Farey as to 50%. In view of this divergence of opinion I cannot take any of these percentages at face value. I must revert to the underlying reports of each expert to ascertain the basis of their respective views. I have already done this in relation to Dr Farey.
	
	
	Dr Davis, in a report of 14 December 2011, recorded the results of his examination of the plaintiff on the preceding day and summarised radiological reports from 6 March 2009. His only reference to the long pre-accident history of the plaintiff’s neck pain and wide-ranging complaints of pain in her limbs is as follows:
	


“She also has a long history of suffering with cervical symptoms which commenced in early to mid-1990s. She reports these symptoms as being pain and stiffness with occasional accompanying tingling and numbness affecting both hands, although greater on the right side. Her symptoms are quite variable although there was a flare up in 2000, at which time she was referred to Dr Ray Garrick, a neurologist, who treated her with Prednisone and arranged MRI scanning. This treatment resolved her symptoms to a significant degree, and although she did suffer with some variable ongoing difficulties these were intermittent in nature and did not impact significantly on her day to day activities”.


	
	This is a materially understated reference to the pre-accident history. Dr Davis’ report gives no indication that a full version of the report of Dr Sheehy of May 1997 or the numerous and detailed reports of Dr Garrick had been provided to him or reviewed and taken into account. Nor does Dr Davis’ report contain any indication that he was informed of or took into account the course of symptoms identified to Dr Farey and the sequence of neurological and clinical indications which Dr Farey found during his post-accident examinations. Dr Davis’ report of 14 December 2011 therefore does not address the important similarities between the plaintiff’s pre-accident condition and her post-accident condition, as analysed by Dr Sutton.
	
	
	In the absence of any reasoning from Dr Davis showing that he has considered and dealt with the entirety of this relevant data I cannot accept his conclusions that the plaintiff “suffered significant aggravation of her [lower cervical disc] injury when she jarred her neck when she tripped getting out of the lift on 12 August 2008”. I do not accept Dr Davis’ view that there has been “a considerable increase in intensity of her symptoms and in her degree of impairment associated with the neck where there is some instability at C5/6 with retrolisthesis and also disc injury at C6/7 with C6 nerve root impingement and clinical signs”. Dr Davis was not in a position to express this opinion with any weight or persuasiveness in the absence of (a) recognition by him of the pre-accident and post-accident detailed histories, multiple MRI scans and reports of clinical examinations and (b) any reasoning to show where the difference in “intensity” lies.
	
	
	The available detail of the course of the plaintiff’s condition before the accident, including symptoms of arm and lower limb pain not explicable by reference to clinical signs or MRI scan results, coupled with the continuing intermittent nature of her arm pain after the accident in the absence of objective evidence of nerve root compression for most of the time, makes the issue of whether the accident contributed to the plaintiff’s symptoms and disabilities and if so in what degree a complex one. It requires careful analysis of all available data with close attention to the chronology. I find Dr Davis’ brief reference to the pre-accident condition, followed by an assertion of aggravation and of increased intensity of pain, inadequate and unconvincing. I consider that his conclusions have been refuted by Dr Sutton’s more thorough methodology and analysis.
	
	
	Dr Davis prepared a second report dated 29 October 2013. At that time he re-examined the plaintiff and was provided with reports of Dr Farey from 11 January 2012 onwards, but not with those of 2009, 2010 and 2011. His second report suffers from the same weakness as the first. I cannot rely upon the conclusions in it, which substantially repeat the conclusions expressed at 14 December 2011.
	
	
	The final report from Dr Davis is dated 8 July 2015, taking into account a further examination of the plaintiff. He did not alter or retract his earlier expressed opinions. He added that it was
	


“highly likely that she has also developed a chronic pain syndrome as well as severe depressive symptoms as a result of her continuing pain and inability of her medical practitioners’ to afford her an acceptable degree of relief”.


	
	Absent a thorough consideration of the pre-accident reports Dr Davis could not appreciate that, as Dr Sutton has shown, the chronic pain syndrome was established well before the accident and the plaintiff’s history shows no material change from the pre-accident symptoms and diagnosis. As for Dr Davis’ attribution of 66% causation of the plaintiff’s ongoing condition to the accident, no reasoning whatsoever has been provided to support this figure and I place no weight upon it.
	
	
	Dr Millons’ report of 27 March 2014 is affected by the same considerations as apply to the reports of Dr Davis. He considered reports of Dr Garrick of 2000 and of 17 March 2008 and radiological studies of 5 July 2000 and 20 September 2008 and later. He has undertaken no analysis of the full course of reporting of symptoms and clinical examinations, as set out in the pre-accident reports of Drs Sheehy and Garrick. He has not compared that course of reporting with the reports of Dr Farey’s examinations post the accident. His bald conclusion that the plaintiff has “multi-level constitutionally based attritional changes in the cervical spine which appear to have been significantly aggravated by an incident at work in June 2008 (sic) with symptoms continuing thereafter” is in my view invalidated by what is in fact a continuity of the plaintiff’s condition before and after 12 August 2008.
	
	
	In light of the pre-accident history Dr Millons’ statement that the “incident appears to have been a significant aggravation and the main cause of her ongoing pain thereafter” is no more than an unreasoned and unsupported assertion. Dr Millons’ reports of 22 April 2014 and 3 May 2015 do not make up the deficiency of reasoning to support his views. As with Dr Davis, his support at the conclave for 66% attribution of symptoms to the accident is unexplained.
	
	
	Dr Higgs’ report of 23 June 2010 is expressly based upon his “objective findings” following examination of the plaintiff that day. He came to the following conclusion:
	


“My consideration of all the evidence has caused me to form the conclusion the injury incident that occurred at work on or about 12/08/08 has been cause for Ms Schneider to suffer from permanent aggravation to pre-existing, and co-existing, cervical spinal degenerative pathology. The permanent aggravation that has been suffered has caused Ms Schneider to suffer from more severe neck pain and to suffer also from a continuing right sided C6 (predominantly) radiculopathy… My consideration of all of the evidence has caused me to form the conclusion that work is the substantial contributing factor to Ms Schneider’s injury and to her present condition. However I have formed the conclusion that pre-existing, and co-existing, degenerative cervical spinal pathology is partly causal for any impairment of cervical spinal function. It is clearly evident that pre-existing, and co-existing, cervical spinal pathology has suffered aggravation and the injury incident that occurred on or about 12/08/08 can be considered as being causal for that aggravation.”


	
	In reaching this conclusion the only account taken of the plaintiff’s prior history is the following:
	


“The past history of this case is relevant. Ms Schneider has admitted that she has previously suffered from neck pain. The lady’s history of neck pain extends for a little more than 10 years. The neck pain has at times required steroid therapy (Prednisone). The lady’s neck pain has previously been associated with the suffering of upper extremity brachialgia that has been cause for her to experience sensations of numbness and tingling in the fingers of the right hand.”


	
	Dr Higgs had received copies of the reports of Dr Garrick of 7 July 2000, 4 September 2001, 17 March 2008 and 25 September 2008 (two reports of the last-mentioned date). He had also received copies of Dr Farey’s reports of 18 February 2009, 30 October 2009, and 11 February 2010. However his own report does not address these in any detail and does not acknowledge the apparent continuity of the plaintiff’s condition which the pre-accident and post-accident medical reports show. He has not provided any explanation of why he considers there to be a lack of continuity from before the accident to after it.
	
	
	Subsequent reports of Dr Higgs do not make good this gap in reasoning and explanation. In examination-in-chief at T 594.31 – 596.19 Dr Higgs was referred, in a general way, to the fact that the plaintiff had been under the care of Dr Garrick between 2000 and 2008. He was reminded that the plaintiff had worked for most of that period albeit that she had returned to her doctor with neck pain from time to time, including in March 2008. Dr Higgs expressed the view that “one could question whether there is any persuasive evidence to support an opinion that this lady, in fact, suffered from any impairment prior to the accident” (T 595.13).
	
	
	I reject that proposition. I am comfortably satisfied that the symptoms described in the reports of Drs Sheehy and Garrick from prior to the accident would have interfered with her capacity for work, given that they included painful and significant restrictions of movement of the neck, brachialgia, feelings of weakness in the legs, a tendency for the right deltoid and bicep muscles to give way and other like symptoms. Dr Garrick’s report of 22 April 2004 recorded that “her desk and computer work is an aggravating factor”. As recently before the accident as 17 March 2008 Dr Garrick recorded her symptoms as including “right sided anterior and cervical lower neck pain and some movement restriction”, with “altered sensation over the back and extending to the right side of the face and brachialgia with numbness extending down the right arm particularly to the thumb”.
	
	
	Dr Higgs’ answers at T 594 – 596 are expressed in terms of legal conclusions. He referred to “apportionment” and to the “permanent impairment guidelines” of WorkCover. At T 598.16 Dr Higgs proffered a consideration of the case “in light of that other legal doctrine that’s represented by the eggshell skull case”. Nowhere in his oral evidence did Dr Higgs descend to a careful comparison of the pre-accident reportage of symptoms with the post-accident reportage and results of clinical examinations as recorded in Dr Farey’s reports. When cross-examined as to what material Dr Higgs had seen in relation to the plaintiff’s condition prior to 12 August 2008 he replied: “I basically rely on what the client has told me at the interview” (T 598.24). This was reconfirmed at T 599.18 – .23. Regarding his understanding of an absence of impairment pre-accident I have taken into account his cross-examination at T 597.48 – 598.9; 600.10 – .15.
	
	
	Although it was made apparent, from the tender of Exhibit J, that Dr Higgs was provided with pre-accident reports of Dr Garrick, he did not recall during his cross-examination having been provided with them and evidently did not pay them significant heed. He gave this answer at T 602.4:
	


“Well all the lady advised me was that she saw Dr Sheehy in May 2009. Whether or not she saw 100 neurosurgeons in the past really is not of any great importance to me, because the matters I was presented with was the situation where a lady suffered injury in a trip and fall event coming out of a lift when the lift and the floor level were not at the same level and that she tripped and suffered a movement that was associated with an experience of neck pain”.


	
	This dismissal of the prior history appears to me unjustifiably cavalier. It flows from Dr Higgs effectively having simply assumed that an injury was sustained in the trip and that it caused subsequent symptoms, rather than looking to the mass of detailed evidence which was available to throw light upon whether the symptoms which followed the accident may have been no more than a continuation of what had been suffered for years before, without causative influence of the trip itself. Dr Higgs continued in the same vein at T 602.27:
	


“It wouldn’t have mattered whether she’d – how many people she’d seen. The point I’m making is that when she stepped out of that lift and tripped and fell and… suffered a sudden movement, the lady thereafter became symptomatic. Now, as far as I’m concerned or unless I’m living on another planet, … but for that incident this lady would not have suffered pain” (emphasis added).


	
	The word “thereafter” in this answer introduces a false premise. With respect I find Dr Higgs’ approach as reflected in these answers superficial and unhelpful.
	
	
	Dr Higgs’ report made no reference to the alternative analysis of the plaintiff’s pre-accident symptoms by Dr Sutton, namely that it showed idiopathic widespread chronic pain disorder: T 600.10 – .15. When this conclusion was put to Dr Higgs for his comment, he was dismissive, referring to it as a “spurious sort of descriptive”: T 600.23.

2769156,R v Price [2016] NSWCCA 50,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with Button J.
	
	
	BUTTON J: This is a Crown appeal brought pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). It is against an aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour Judge McClintock SC upon Jeremy Paul Price (the respondent) in the District Court of New South Wales on 5 June 2015.
	


Background


	
	The respondent pleaded guilty to a number of offences, all of which he committed on 24 April 2014 at Coolangatta.
	
	
	There were three offences that were committed to the District Court for sentence after pleas of guilty entered by the respondent in the Local Court.
	
	
	The first was dangerous driving occasioning the death of Mr Bernard Hayden. The count was brought pursuant to s 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and the Crown alleged that the offence was made out by the respondent driving in a manner dangerous to another person or persons. That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years, and has no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The second offence committed for sentence was dangerous driving occasioning the death of Mrs Eileen Hayden. That count was brought pursuant to the same subsection of the Crimes Act, and founded upon the same allegation.
	
	
	The third offence committed for sentence was dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm to the two year old son of the respondent (in an effort to protect his anonymity, I shall not name him). That offence was brought pursuant to s 52A(3)(c) of the same Act. Again, the Crown alleged that the respondent had driven in a manner dangerous to another person or persons. The offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years, and has no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Separately, three further offences were placed before his Honour pursuant to Ch 3 Pt 3 Div 7 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) as “related offences”. Each of them had also been committed by the respondent on 24 April 2014.
	
	
	The first was an offence of possessing a prohibited drug, namely 1.010 g of methylamphetamine (the charge sheet speaks of 2.25 g, but the agreed facts speak of 1.010 g; I proceed on the lesser amount). Pursuant to s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), that wholly summary offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for two years.
	
	
	The second was an offence of having in his custody $1,110 in cash that may reasonably have been suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained. Pursuant to s 527C(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty of that wholly summary offence is imprisonment for six months.
	
	
	The third and final offence on the certificate prepared pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act (the s 166 certificate) was an offence of supplying a prohibited drug; namely, methylamphetamine. That offence was brought pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. When dealt with in the Local Court, that indictable offence is subject to a jurisdictional limit of imprisonment for two years, pursuant to s 267(2) and Table 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act (in light of the fact that the amount of the prohibited drug was just over the “small” quantity in Sch 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act).
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge decided to impose an aggregate sentence for all offences, including the related offences, pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Ultimately, after having provided indicative sentences that I shall detail later, his Honour imposed an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of four years.
	
	
	Two grounds of the Crown appeal were notified and pressed. The first was that the aggregate sentence is manifestly inadequate. The second can be summarised as being that s 168(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act has the effect that offences that are placed before the District Court or the Supreme Court pursuant to a s 166 certificate cannot be incorporated in an aggregate sentence imposed by either one of those courts.
	


Objective features of the offences


	
	The following is derived from the comprehensive discussion in the remarks on sentence. No fact found by his Honour was impugned by the Crown in its appeal.
	
	
	On about midday on Thursday 24 April 2014, the respondent was driving his Toyota Camry in an easterly direction on a main road of Coolangatta. The only passenger was his two-year-old son. Although his son was in a booster seat, it was not appropriate for children of his age. Even more dangerous was the fact that the respondent was affected by the prohibited drug methylamphetamine, which he had consumed some time before.
	
	
	There were other vehicles on the road, both behind the respondent (that is, to the west) and in front of him (that is, to the east). Travelling in a westerly direction towards the respondent on the southern side of the road were Mr and Mrs Hayden, an elderly couple.
	
	
	As the respondent drove around a left hand bend, his vehicle moved to the right. It ended up in a position whereby almost the entirety of his car was on the wrong side of the road, and travelling into the path of oncoming traffic from the east.
	
	
	Although there was evidence that, before that event occurred, the respondent had been driving in a way that suggested that he wished to overtake another vehicle travelling in an easterly direction, his Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent was driving aggressively or impulsively. In particular, his Honour was not satisfied that the car driven by the respondent was on the wrong side of the road because the respondent was seeking to overtake another vehicle.
	
	
	Tragically, the Camry collided very heavily with the vehicle of Mr and Mrs Hayden. Mr Hayden died at the scene. Mrs Hayden died later in hospital. The son of the respondent suffered very severe injuries, an overview of which I shall provide shortly. The dangerous driving of the respondent, and its disastrous consequences, founds the three counts that were committed for sentence.
	
	
	After the collision, the respondent alighted from his motor vehicle. As it happened, one of the persons who came across the scene was an acquaintance of the respondent. The respondent took the opportunity to divest himself of a small quantity of methylamphetamine by giving it to that acquaintance. The possession of that prohibited drug by the respondent, and his provision of it to another person, founded the charges of possession and supply of a prohibited drug on the s 166 certificate. The respondent also handed the acquaintance his wallet, which contained a large amount of cash. The possession of that cash by the respondent founded the third charge on the certificate.
	
	
	Clearly enough, the inference that the respondent was more concerned to protect himself from criminal inculpation with regard to those matters than anything else, including providing assistance to those who were dead, dying, or gravely injured in the aftermath of the collision, needed to be considered by the sentencing judge. After reflection, however, his Honour determined that that conduct of the respondent after the collision should not aggravate the criminality of the three major offences, and was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this conduct demonstrated callousness towards the victims of the offences.
	
	
	The motor vehicle of the respondent was free of mechanical defect. Neither the condition of the road, nor the weather, nor any other surrounding circumstance played a role in the collision. The respondent was travelling within the speed limit. As I have said, his Honour was not satisfied that the respondent was driving aggressively or impetuously. Rather, his Honour proceeded on the basis that the respondent was substantially affected by prohibited drugs; that his intoxication reduced his ability to drive safely; and that it caused him to be driving in such a way that his vehicle ended up almost entirely on the wrong side of the road before it fatally collided with another vehicle.
	
	
	As for the son of the respondent, he spent eight months in hospital after the collision. There is no doubt that he has suffered a traumatic brain injury, though the precise effects of that will take quite some time to be known. What is known is that he will suffer from paraplegia, including bowel and bladder incontinence, for the rest of his life.
	
	
	His Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the three substantive offences as part of the determination of sentence, noting “a high level of abandonment of responsibility and moral culpability” and the “terrible and tragic consequences” of the offence.
	


Subjective features

Pleas of guilty and remorse


	
	Turning from the attributes of the offences to the attributes of the offender, as I have said, pleas of guilty were entered in the Local Court with regard to the three substantive offences. His Honour sentenced on the basis that there had been early pleas of guilty to the certificate offences as well. A 25% discount was applied to the (indicative) sentences that would otherwise have been imposed, in accordance with principle: see JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [39]. That discount is not impugned by the Crown.
	
	
	As well as that, his Honour found that the respondent was very remorseful for what he had done. His Honour’s finding is encapsulated in the following extract from p 22 of the remarks on sentence: “The offender’s letter to the court, which I take to be genuine, expresses deep remorse… and he seems further down the path to taking responsibility for his actions and with greater insight into how they led to the collision”.
	


Personal circumstances


	
	The respondent was born in January 1979, and accordingly was aged 35 years at the time of the offence, and 36 years as at the date of the imposition of sentence.
	
	
	One of three siblings, he enjoyed a reasonably stable and supportive upbringing. However, he performed poorly at school, and experienced problems with learning and behaviour. He remained in school until year 10, and obtained his School Certificate. After leaving school he became a qualified printer. He also did some work as a labourer, before qualifying as a machine and plant operator in his mid-twenties.
	
	
	During his adolescence, the respondent frequently engaged in impulsive and risk-taking behaviour. As part of that, he began drinking alcohol at age 13. At age 15, he began smoking cannabis daily. He remained dependent on cannabis for well over a decade thereafter. At age 22, he began using crystal methamphetamine (also known as “ice”) occasionally on the weekend. Later, he began using that drug on a weekly basis.
	
	
	At age 24, he commenced a relationship with the woman who was to become the mother of his two children. Their relationship was a stable one. However, in its latter stages, they were both using drugs, including methylamphetamine.
	
	
	When the respondent was aged 34, the relationship with his partner ended. He did not cope well with the separation, and began using ice on almost a daily basis. Despite his heavy drug use, he maintained contact with his children, and reported a close bond with them.
	
	
	In short, the respondent is a man who has abused prohibited drugs for over 20 years. Until the collision, however, he was able to keep that abuse under control sufficiently to avoid it having disastrous consequences.
	
	
	As for prior offending, the criminal record of the respondent did not assist him on sentence, and his record of traffic offences was very adverse.
	


Criminal record


	
	Turning to his criminal record first, in 2002 the respondent was placed on a bond for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	In 2004, he was sentenced in the District Court to a head sentence of imprisonment for two years and eight months with a non-parole period of 18 months, for an offence of aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence, that being assault occasioning actual bodily harm. A successful appeal to this Court led to a reduction in sentence, with the result that the head sentence became one year and four months, and the non-parole period became nine months.
	
	
	In 2008, the respondent was placed on a bond for possessing a prohibited drug.
	
	
	In 2009, for the same offence (along with the offence of possessing equipment for the administration of a prohibited drug) he was placed on a further bond.
	
	
	In 2012, he was fined for an offence of common assault, and ordered to perform community service for a separate offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	In short, while not overly lengthy, the criminal record of the respondent showed that he had had a problem with prohibited drugs; that he had committed acts of violence; and that one of his acts of violence has been sufficiently serious as to call for incarceration, albeit for a short period.
	


Traffic record


	
	Turning now to the traffic record of the respondent, whilst on a provisional licence at the age of 17 years, on two occasions in 1996 he did not display his P plates.
	
	
	In 1997, he exceeded the speed limit by more than 15 km/h but less than 30 km/h.
	
	
	In 1998 he drove negligently, by driving through a stop sign.
	
	
	Thereafter his licence was cancelled for loss of demerit points.
	
	
	Later in 1998, he exceeded the speed limit by more than 15 km/h, but less than 30 km/h.
	
	
	Early in 1999, he was fined for not wearing his seat belt.
	
	
	Less than two months later, the respondent exceeded the speed limit by more than 30 km/h but less than 45 km/h.
	
	
	In 2000, he was fined $1400 and disqualified for 18 months for using an unregistered and uninsured motor vehicle, and for driving that vehicle recklessly or furiously, or in a dangerous speed or manner.
	
	
	In the same year, his licence was suspended for a second time for loss of demerit points.
	
	
	In 2002, he was fined for performing a “burnout”. Eight days later, he was fined for negligent driving.
	
	
	In December 2002, he exceeded the speed limit by more than 15 km/h.
	
	
	In May 2004, he exceeded the speed limit by more than 45 km/h.
	
	
	In August 2004, he exceeded the speed limit by more than 15 km/h but less than 30 km/h. Shortly thereafter, in September 2004, his licence was suspended for a third time due to loss of demerit points.
	
	
	In 2006, he exceeded the speed limit by less than 15 km/h.
	
	
	That same year, the respondent was convicted of driving with the middle range prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood. He was fined $1000, and disqualified from driving for nine months.
	
	
	In July 2008, he was fined for exceeding the speed limit by more than 15 km/h but less than 30 km/h.
	
	
	In 2010, he was fined for driving whilst using a mobile phone.
	
	
	In June 2014, the respondent was fined for exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 km/h but less than 20 km/h. That offence had occurred on 18 March 2014. It will be recalled that the offences under discussion occurred on 24 April 2014.
	
	
	In short, the record of traffic offences of the respondent extended over many years and was extremely poor. It featured a conviction in 2006 for driving whilst affected by a substance that could impair his ability to drive safely. Regrettably, it showed that, over a lengthy period, the respondent has been unable or unwilling to obey the road rules. As well as that, the last of the many driving offences committed by the respondent had been committed a little over one month before the day upon which his driving led to the death of two persons, and the occasioning of permanent and extremely grave disabilities to his two-year-old child.
	


Aspects of sentence


	
	As I have said, his Honour decided to impose an aggregate sentence. The indicative sentences provided by his Honour were as follows (it will be recalled that each of the following had been reduced from its starting point by 25%).
	
	
	For each of the offences of dangerous driving causing death, a head sentence of four years (accordingly the starting point for each was five years and four months).
	
	
	For the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, a head sentence of three years (the starting point was four years).
	
	
	For the related offence of possessing a prohibited drug, a sentence of three months (the starting point was four months).
	
	
	For the related offence of supplying a prohibited drug, a sentence of six months (the starting point was eight months).
	
	
	For the related offence colloquially known as having goods in custody, a sentence of three months (the starting point was four months).
	
	
	Applying principles of totality, as I have said his Honour imposed a single aggregate sentence with a head sentence of imprisonment for six years, with a non-parole period of four years. Clearly enough, special circumstances were found that led to a reduction of the ratio between the aggregate non-parole period and the aggregate head sentence from three-quarters to two-thirds.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The following grounds of appeal by the Crown were notified and pressed at the hearing:
	


Ground One: The sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate.

Ground Two: The inclusion of the s 166 offences in the aggregate sentence was not in accordance to law [sic].

Ground two


	
	It is convenient to deal with this ground first.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the plain meaning of s 168(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act is that the sentence for a “Local Court offence” (whether that be a wholly summary offence, or an indictable offence being dealt with summarily) imposed by the District or Supreme Court, by way of the well-known mechanism of placing such matters on a certificate when substantive matters are being committed for trial or sentence, cannot be incorporated within an aggregate sentence, as a matter of statutory interpretation. It was said that, to the extent that his Honour purported to do so with regard to the three offences on the s 166 certificate, that constituted an error of law.
	
	
	We were invited by the Crown to the decision of this Court in R v Sward [2014] NSWCCA 259 at [51], but only to show that in that matter the question had not been decided, and it remains an open one.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that, properly understood, the provision does not prohibit what occurred here, and his Honour committed no error.
	
	
	The particular provision in question is as follows:
	


168 Procedures for dealing with certain offences related to indictable offences

(1) The court is to deal with a back up offence or related offence under this Part without a jury and on the basis only of evidence given during the trial of the accused person for the relevant indictable offence in the same proceedings and additional evidence given under this section.

(2) The prosecutor or accused person may, with the leave of the court, call additional evidence in relation to the back up offence or related offence.

(3) In sentencing or otherwise dealing with a person for a back up offence or related offence, the court has the same functions, and is subject to the same restrictions and procedures, as the Local Court. 

(4) Rules of court may be made with respect to back up offences or related offences dealt with under this Part.

(emphasis added)


	
	To my mind, this ground can be dealt with shortly. I do not accept that the provision has the effect for which the Crown contends. That is so for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, the provision must be read in light of other provisions enacted by Parliament with regard to sentencing.
	
	
	Section 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is as follows:
	


53A Aggregate sentences of imprisonment

(1) A court may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any 2 or more of those offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each.

(2) A court that imposes an aggregate sentence of imprisonment under this section on an offender must indicate to the offender, and make a written record of, the following:

(a) the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed,

(b) the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence (after taking into account such matters as are relevant under Part 3 or any other provision of this Act) had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence.

(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(4) The term, and any non-parole period, set under this Division in relation to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not revoked or varied by a later sentence of imprisonment that the same or some other court subsequently imposes in relation to another offence.

(5) An aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.

(emphasis added)


	
	Section 49 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is as follows:
	


49 Restriction on term of sentence

(1) The term of a sentence of imprisonment (other than an aggregate sentence of imprisonment):

(a) must not be more than the maximum term of imprisonment that may be imposed for the offence, and

(b) must not be less than the shortest term of imprisonment (if any) that must be imposed for the offence.

(2) The term of an aggregate sentence of imprisonment:

(a) must not be more than the sum of the maximum periods of imprisonment that could have been imposed if separate sentences of imprisonment had been imposed in respect of each offence to which the sentence relates, and

(b) must not be less than the shortest term of imprisonment (if any) that must be imposed for any separate offence or, if the sentence relates to more than one such offence, must not be less than the shortest term of imprisonment that must be imposed for any of the offences.

(emphasis added)


	
	Reading those three provisions as a harmonious whole, there is nothing to suggest explicitly or implicitly that a Local Court offence that is before the District Court or the Supreme Court, pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act, cannot be “picked up” by an aggregate sentence that that court imposes (pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). Nor is there anything to suggest explicitly or implicitly that there is any limitation upon that process, pursuant to s 49 of the same Act.
	
	
	Secondly, the mechanisms whereby related Local Court offences may be placed before the District Court or the Supreme Court and whereby aggregate sentences may be imposed are facilitative, in that they are designed to free the process of sentencing from unnecessary technicality and fragmentation. And yet to interpret the statutes as requiring a judge, when imposing an aggregate sentence on matters committed to his or her court, to impose at the same time separate substantive sentences for Local Court matters that are also before the very same judge, re-introduces those negative characteristics to the process.
	
	
	Thirdly, in any event, s 168(3), the central provision said before us to give rise to the prohibition, speaks of the District or Supreme Court sentencing for certificate offences in accordance with “the same functions…restrictions and procedures” as the Local Court. And yet it can be seen from s 53A that, within its jurisdictional limits, it is perfectly open to the Local Court to impose aggregate sentences; the Crown did not contend to the contrary.
	
	
	In other words, I consider that the result would be strange indeed if the Local Court were able to impose aggregate sentences for Local Court offences placed before it, but the District and Supreme Courts were prohibited from doing so with regard to the very same offences. I do not accept that that was the intention of Parliament, objectively discerned from a reading of the legislation, bearing in mind its purposes and its context.
	
	
	In short, reading the provision in the context of the entirety of Div 7 of Pt 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and the context of the salient parts of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I do not interpret s 168(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act as prohibiting the incorporation of Local Court offences within aggregate sentences imposed in the District Court or the Supreme Court. Of course, in sentencing for offences placed upon a certificate, the applicable maximum penalty (with regard to wholly summary offences) and the applicable jurisdictional limit (with regard to indictable offences being dealt with summarily) must be respected in the superior courts. As can be seen from the indicative sentences provided by his Honour for the related offences, that is precisely what happened here.
	
	
	I would reject ground two of the Crown appeal.
	


Ground one

Submissions


	
	Although in its written submissions the Crown invited us to a number of particular aspects of the remarks on sentence, a process of refinement occurred in oral submissions. The Crown simply submitted that, although neither a procedural or evidential error in the proceedings on sentence nor an error of fact or law in the remarks on sentence can be identified, nevertheless the sentence ultimately imposed is of itself erroneous. That is because, it was said, the sentence failed to reflect all of the very adverse objective and subjective features of the matter.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that the sentence does adequately give weight to those features. He emphasised that his Honour had not found that the respondent was driving aggressively or wantonly; that his Honour had accepted that the respondent was remorseful; that each of the three driving offences was the non-aggravated version of the offence (as opposed to the offences to be found in s 52A(2) and s 52A(4) of the Crimes Act); that there was an inevitable aspect of extra-curial punishment arising from the respondent knowing that he had very adversely affected the life of his own son; and that the early pleas of guilty had a significant utilitarian value.
	
	
	Separately, he accepted that the only sentence the subject of an appeal is the aggregate head sentence actually imposed. Nevertheless, he submitted that it is useful to consider the indicative sentences, and to do so in the light of the applicable guideline judgment of this Court, R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252.
	
	
	He submitted that, in the circumstances recounted in the guideline judgment, a head sentence of three years for the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death was suggested, and a head sentence of two years when the consequence is grievous bodily harm: R v Whyte at [229]. And he noted that those head sentences were said to be applicable when there was a late plea: R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [161].
	
	
	Analysing mathematically what those proposed head sentences would be if there had been (as here) a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity attracting a 25% discount, he submitted that the head sentence suggested by the guideline judgment for an offence occasioning death would be two years six months, and the suggested head sentence for an offence occasioning grievous bodily harm would be one year eight months. And yet the head sentences indicated by his Honour for the three offences (four years for the offences occasioning death, and three years for the offence occasioning grievous bodily harm) were well above those sentences implicitly suggested in the guideline judgment for early plea matters. That suggested, he submitted, that there was no error in the approach of his Honour.
	
	
	As for the implicit approach to the principle of totality of the sentencing judge (which can be derived from reflection upon all of the indicative sentences and the aggregate head sentence actually imposed), he submitted that that approach was open to the discretion of his Honour. He emphasised that, in truth, all three substantive offences were derived from the single act of driving dangerously as a result of impairment by way of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	In short, he submitted that the aggregate sentence imposed was within the discretion of the sentencing judge, and does not demonstrate error.
	


Determination


	
	Turning to my determination, it is true that the matter is to be considered on the basis that the respondent was not driving quickly or aggressively as a result of the effects of the prohibited drug. But the conclusion that the objective gravity and moral culpability of the three offences committed for sentence was nevertheless extremely high is, to my mind, unavoidable.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	The result of the intoxication of the respondent was that he was driving his motor vehicle in a flagrantly dangerous manner; namely, almost completely on the wrong side of the road. And he was doing so on a thoroughfare in a large regional centre on which there was a substantial amount of traffic, and at a speed of over 80 km/h. Before the collision, he had not only endangered members of the community in general for a considerable period, in light of the fact that he was substantially affected by a prohibited drug. He had also endangered his two-year-old son in particular, by not ensuring that he was appropriately restrained.
	
	
	As well as that, bearing in mind the very broad range of injuries that could constitute grievous bodily harm, the injuries inflicted upon the two-year-old victim were approaching the worst class of case.
	


Moral culpability


	
	Separately, I consider that the moral culpability of the respondent was also extremely high. I say that chiefly because, by the time of the commission of the offences, he had breached the road rules more or less continuously over the years; indeed, he had done so a little over one month previously. Quite apart from the fact that all members of the community surely know of the danger and unlawfulness of driving whilst affected by alcohol or prohibited drugs, the respondent was personally well aware of that. That was because in 2006 he had been punished for an offence of driving with a mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood.
	
	
	In short, the objective gravity of the offences, and the offender’s moral culpability for them, was profound. Two people were killed and one person was gravely disabled for the rest of his life by an intoxicated person who had a very poor driving record. I respectfully reject the proposition that an aggregate head sentence of six years adequately reflects the very pronounced objective gravity and moral culpability of this matter.
	


The guideline judgment


	
	Turning to analyse the guideline judgment upon which counsel for the respondent relied, to my mind it does not support the proposition that the sentence is free of error. That can be seen from the combination of two factors. The first is that subsequent authority of this Court has established that the guideline judgment sets a standard below which sentences for the offence in question should not usually fall: R v Harris [2015] NSWCCA 81; (2015) 70 MVR 412 at [54], rather than a mean or median. The second is that, with regard to almost every objective or subjective factor, this case is more serious than the putative case discussed in the guideline judgment. I proceed to demonstrate the ways in which that is so.
	
	
	The guideline judgment spoke of seven factors: see [204] of that judgment.
	
	
	The first factor is the youth of the offender. In the guideline judgment, the putative offender is “young”, a factor that very often entitles an offender to leniency. But here, the respondent was aged 35 years at the time of the offence, and was on the cusp of early middle age. This factor tells against the respondent.
	
	
	The second factor is character and previous convictions. In the guideline judgment, the putative offender is of good character with no or limited prior convictions. In contrast, the respondent had a significant history of driving offences that disentitled him to leniency based on previous good behaviour. Nor was he a person of good character. This factor tells against the respondent.
	
	
	The third factor relates to the extent of injury. In the guideline judgment, the putative outcome of the dangerous driving is death or permanent injury to a single person. In contrast, in the present case there were multiple victims, two of whom were killed, and one of whom suffered very grave life-long injuries. This factor tells against the respondent.
	
	
	The fourth factor is the status of the victim. In the guideline judgment, the victim is a stranger to the putative offender. In the present case, two of the victims were strangers to the respondent, but the third victim was the son of the applicant and under his care at the time of the incident. This factor is neutral.
	
	
	The fifth factor relates to injury to the driver. In the guideline judgment, there is no or limited injury to the driver or the driver’s intimates. In contrast, although there was no evidence of injury to the respondent, there was very substantial injury to the two-year-old son of the respondent in the present case. I regard this factor as neutral.
	
	
	The sixth factor is genuine remorse. In the guideline judgment, the putative offender demonstrates genuine remorse. Similarly, in this case the sentencing judge made a finding of genuine remorse of the respondent. This factor is neutral.
	
	
	The seventh factor is a plea of guilty. In the guideline judgment, the putative offender enters a plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. In the present case, the respondent entered an early guilty plea with significant utilitarian value, which was reflected by the 25% discount upon sentence. This factor tells in favour of the respondent, albeit it has been neutralised by the mathematical calculation undertaken by counsel for the respondent.
	
	
	Taken as a whole, those generally subjective features are adverse to the respondent, and do not speak in favour of the adequacy of the sentence actually imposed.
	
	
	Furthermore, the guideline judgment speaks of matters that can be taken into account as “aggravating factors” with regard to the conduct of an offender: at [215] and following. Because I have already discussed the objective features of the offence, I shall not analyse those factors in detail. Suffice to say, the driving of the respondent did not involve speeding, or erratic or aggressive driving; nor competitive driving or showing off; nor an ignoring of warnings; nor an escape from the police. On the other hand, the extent and nature of the injuries and deaths inflicted was extremely grave; a large number of road users were put at risk, including a two-year-old child; the degree of impairment arising from drug abuse was substantial; and the duration of the endangerment of others was not insubstantial.
	
	
	Taken as a whole, those objective factors also do not speak in favour of the adequacy of the sentence imposed.
	
	
	In short, I accept that the guideline judgment delivered fourteen years ago has a significant (but by no means determinative) role in assessing the quantum of sentence. Although not to be seen as prescriptive, it can inform one’s analysis of questions of manifest excessiveness or inadequacy. Approached in that way, it does not support the proposition that the sentences imposed were adequate. To express that conclusion another way, I respectfully consider that the circumstances of this case called for indicative sentences much longer than those suggested in the guideline judgment.
	


Other sentences imposed in broadly similar matters


	
	Neither party took us to other decisions of this Court in broadly similar matters, no doubt in light of the recent warnings against adopting a simplistic or prescriptive approach to the degree to which other sentences in general can inform the correctness of a particular sentence: R v Pham [2015] HCA 39; (2015) 90 ALJR 13 at [29]; King v R [2015] NSWCCA 99 at [80].
	
	
	The only decision of this Court to which we were taken by the parties was R v Harris.
	
	
	That was a Crown appeal in which the offender had pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing death (s 52A(1)(c)), one count of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm (s 52A(3)(c)), and two Form 1 offences: taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of owner (s 154A(1)(a) Crimes Act) and self-administering a prohibited drug (s 12(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act).
	
	
	The offender in R v Harris had prohibited and prescription drugs present in his blood (including diazepam, morphine, methadone and cannabinoids), possessed a record of driving offences, and was on parole at the time of the collision.
	
	
	Three victims in the other vehicle were killed as a result of the collision. The three-year-old child of the offender suffered a traumatic brain injury, a broken right arm and a fractured jaw.
	
	
	In upholding the Crown appeal, this Court quashed the original overall sentence of four years and seven months with a non-parole period of three years and three months. The offender was re-sentenced to an aggregate term of seven years and six months with a non-parole period of five years and six months.
	
	
	It can be seen, however, that there were two sharply differentiating features between that case and this case.
	
	
	First, in R v Harris the offender was suffering from the effects of epilepsy, which in the result led to the collision, and the dangerous character of his driving lay in the fact that it was undertaken in the face of the risk, known to him, that he may suffer a seizure whilst at the wheel.
	
	
	Secondly, the sentencing judge in that matter found that the offender was not materially affected by drug usage at the time of the collision (although this Court found that his ability to drive was impaired to some extent by the drugs he ingested).
	
	
	Because of those points of differentiation, the sentence imposed by this Court after the successful Crown appeal in R v Harris has only a very limited role in assessing whether the aggregate sentence under consideration is manifestly inadequate. It does not affirmatively support the correctness of the sentence imposed in this case.
	


Totality


	
	Two further matters require consideration. The first is that (leaving aside entirely the s 166 certificate matters) the sentencing judge provided discounted indicative head sentences of four years, four years, and three years. And yet an aggregate head sentence of only six years was imposed, by way of the application of the principles of totality.
	
	
	It is true that all of the offences were part of the same collision; having said that, each offence had its own separate, tragic, and permanent consequences.
	
	
	It is beyond controversy that questions of concurrence and cumulation are very much vouchsafed to a sentencing judge. They include questions of implicit concurrence and cumulation within the context of an aggregate sentence. Nevertheless, the degree of implicit concurrence demonstrated by reflection upon the three head sentences that were indicated and the aggregate head sentence that was actually imposed is, I respectfully consider, supportive of error.
	


Minimum period of incarceration


	
	Finally, focusing upon the practical effect on the liberty of the respondent of the sentence imposed (assuming that he is released at the end of his non-parole period) I respectfully do not accept that the minimum term of imprisonment actually to be served by the respondent of four years appropriately reflects his criminality in general, and in particular the consequences of it.
	


Conclusion


	
	In short, the objective gravity of the offences generally, including the life-long disabilities inflicted on a child who was in the care of the respondent; the subjective moral culpability of the respondent; the guideline judgment; the degree of implicit concurrence provided; and the length of the non-parole period as a reflection of the mandatory minimum period of incarceration, all strongly suggest that the sentence imposed is so lenient as to be beyond the parameters of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	To my mind, considering the combined effect of all of the matters that I have discussed, the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period are inadequate to reflect the concatenation of objective and subjective features in this matter. On reflection, I respectfully consider that that inadequacy is manifest. To express my opinion another way, I consider that the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period imposed at first instance were both unreasonable and plainly unjust. It follows that I consider that the first ground of the Crown appeal has been made out.
	


Discretion not to intervene


	
	Turning to the discretion not to intervene, the Crown notified the respondent promptly that it would be appealing against the sentence to this Court. There was no delay in the appeal being brought on. The respondent is in custody in any event, and a successful Crown appeal would not lead to a person who was at liberty being abruptly imprisoned or re-imprisoned. There is no compelling subjective factor that has arisen since sentence that would favour non-intervention. And in any event, the disjunction between the sentence imposed and the sentence that should have been imposed is so pronounced as to argue inherently for intervention.
	
	
	To my mind, the Crown has established that the discretion of this Court not to intervene should not be exercised. To express that more succinctly and comprehensibly, this Court should proceed to resentence.
	


Resentence


	
	Since R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; (2010) 77 NSWLR 7, it has been established that, in a successful Crown appeal, the respondent cannot point to general anxiety or distress in support of a reduction of the sentence to be imposed on re-sentence. A respondent remains entitled to point to specific evidence of his or her individual emotional suffering for that purpose.
	
	
	In considering the question of re-sentence, I have reflected upon the decisions of this Court to which I have referred above. I have also borne in mind, of course, the applicable maximum penalties, and the fact that the respondent is not to be sentenced for the aggravated version of the three substantive offences.
	
	
	A number of aspects of the approach of the sentencing judge were not the subject of dispute before us, and should be replicated on re-sentence.
	
	
	First, an identical backdate should be granted.
	
	
	Secondly, the utilitarian discount of 25% should be maintained.
	
	
	Thirdly, an aggregate sentence should be imposed.
	
	
	Fourthly, the ratio of two-thirds between the aggregate non-parole period and the aggregate head sentence should be maintained.
	
	
	Fifthly, the indicative sentences provided for the related offences (three months for possessing a prohibited drug, three months for unlawfully possessing property, and six months for supplying a prohibited drug) should not be altered.
	
	
	Affidavits were read by senior counsel for the respondent, against the contingency of resentence. They show that there have been the following developments since the imposition of sentence in June 2015.
	
	
	The respondent has achieved a medium security classification. A back injury that he suffered as a result of the collision has presented difficulties in custody. He has been anxious and depressed. He was “gutted” to learn of the Crown appeal. The respondent now has no contact with his son, or with his daughter who is now aged six. He hopes to be able to help his son deal with his disabilities upon his release. In light of all that has happened, the respondent has made a firm commitment to abstain from prohibited drugs. Finally, the respondent has deposed that he will “never get past the blame” for what he has done.
	
	
	I have taken that material into account in the indicative sentences and aggregate sentences that I propose.
	
	
	To my mind, the starting point of the head sentence for each offence occasioning death (before the application of the discount of 25%) should be imprisonment for seven years. I am well aware that that starting point is beginning to approach the maximum penalty of 10 years; I do not regard that as inappropriate in the objective and subjective circumstances of this case. Applying the utilitarian discount of 25%, for each of the offences of dangerous driving occasioning death to Mr Hayden and Mrs Hayden, I would indicate a head sentence of imprisonment for five years and three months.
	
	
	For the offence occasioning grievous bodily harm to the son of the respondent, I consider that a starting point before reduction of a head sentence of imprisonment for six years is appropriate. Again, I say that well aware that that starting point is close to the maximum penalty of seven years; for reasons given earlier in this judgment, I consider that to be appropriate. Applying the discount of 25% to that starting point, I would indicate for the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm to the son of the respondent a head sentence of four years and six months.
	
	
	Applying the principle of totality to the six indicative sentences, I consider that there should be an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for eight years and six months. Maintaining the ratio of two-thirds between the aggregate non-parole period and aggregate head sentence, that would lead to a non-parole period of five years and eight months. That constitutes an extension of the current aggregated non-parole period of the respondent by one year and eight months.
	
	
	Quite apart from the process of step-by-step analysis above that leads to the non-parole period that I propose, I consider that any lesser non-parole period would not properly reflect the minimum period of imprisonment that the respondent should serve as a result of his offences.
	
	
	Finally, it can be seen that his Honour imposed a disqualification period of five years upon the respondent. The remarks on sentence are unclear as to the precise commencement date of that period of disqualification. If it was the date upon which the respondent came into custody, that would have seemingly meant that the respondent would have been disqualified whilst at liberty for a period of only one year (assuming that he was to be released at the end of the aggregate non-parole period imposed at first instance).
	
	
	Section 206A of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW) (as it was at the date of sentence, and as it remains today), however, would have the effect of ensuring that the period of disqualification would not commence until the date upon which the respondent is released from custody. Certainly, no lesser effective period of disqualification should be countenanced.
	
	
	On the understanding that the disqualification period will not commence until whichever day the respondent is released to parole, or upon the expiry of the entirety of his head sentence, I am content not to interfere with the disqualification period of five years. For abundant caution, I propose that the period of disqualification imposed be quashed and clarified by a new order.
	


Proposed orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	The Crown appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence imposed on 5 June 2015 is quashed.
	
	
	The respondent, Jeremy Paul Price, is sentenced to an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment of 8 years and 6 months to date from 15 November 2014 and expire on 14 May 2023, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 8 months to expire on 14 July 2020.
	
	
	The period of disqualification imposed on 5 June 2015 is quashed.
	
	
	The respondent is subject to a period of disqualification from driving of five years. Pursuant to s 206A of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW), that period of disqualification commences upon the first date upon which the respondent is released from custody.
	
	
	The earliest possible date upon which the respondent may be released to parole is 14 July 2020.
	



	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Button J.

		08 April 2016",2016-04-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769162,R v Turnbull (No. 4) [2016] NSWSC 705,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: In advance of the trial of the Accused, the Court has been dealing with pretrial issues with respect to subpoenas.
	
	
	The Crown has submitted that there are further issues which are ripe for pretrial consideration and determination in the context of this trial.
	
	
	Section 130 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides for a court to proceed and make determinations in advance of the empanelment of a jury. Section 139 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides a foundation for a court undertaking a pretrial hearing to, amongst other things, give a ruling or making a finding under s.192A Evidence Act 1995 as if the trial had commenced (s.139(3)(e)) and to give a ruling on any question of law that might arise at the trial (s.139(3)(g)). Section 192A Evidence Act 1995 provides for the court to make an advance ruling or finding with respect to the admissibility or use of the evidence proposed to be adduced, if the court considers it appropriate to do so.
	
	
	The Accused has given notice of intention to rely upon the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind under s.23A Crimes Act 1900 and the partial defence of extreme provocation under s.23 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The Accused has given notice of intention to adduce tendency evidence for the purpose of s.97 Evidence Act 1995 (Exhibit A). Additional information with respect to that proposed course on behalf of the Accused is contained in correspondence providing particulars of the tendency notice (MFI21).
	
	
	The foreshadowed reliance upon extreme provocation, as set out in the defence response for the purpose of s.143 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, indicates that the alleged provocation arises from intimidation or harassment by the deceased, Mr Turner, of the Accused and his family amounting to a serious indictable offence under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007.
	
	
	The Crown has indicated an objection to evidence which is said to go to the partial defence of extreme provocation. It has submitted that it is sufficiently raised by the Accused’s tendency notice so as to require determination, in circumstances where s.97(1)(b) Evidence Act 1995 requires the Court to form a view as to whether the proposed evidence has significant probative value. The Crown submits that an understanding of what is involved in extreme provocation is an essential part of that process.
	
	
	It has been submitted for the Accused that the Court has jurisdiction to proceed down this path, although questions have been raised as to the appropriateness of that course, if what the Crown is seeking to do is engage in a process of consideration of a question of mixed fact and law or a question of fact alone.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the issue is sufficiently crystallised for the purpose of the use of s.139 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and s.192A Evidence Act 1995 by way of the tendency notice served for the Accused. That in itself requires the Court to make a determination about s.23 in the context of this case.
	
	
	Beyond that, however, it seems to me that there is also, for the purpose of s.139(3)(g), a question of law which is raised. Section 23(2) Crimes Act 1900 sets out the parameters of the partial defence of extreme provocation enacted by the Parliament of this State in the middle of 2014. On its face, it differs significantly from the previous law of provocation.
	
	
	In the present case, it appears to be the submission of the Accused that s.23(2)(b) is satisfied by a contention that Mr Turner conducted himself in such a way as to constitute the offence of stalking or intimidation under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. In this case, it appears that Mr Turner was acting as an investigating officer for the purpose of the Native Vegetation Act 2003. There seems to be an inevitable legal question as to how any of his conduct could constitute a serious indictable offence, if it is said to have been conduct which occurred in the course of duties under the relevant legislation.
	
	
	This is an unusual case. What the relevant legal formula is for fashioning this test in the context of this case is a matter which, in my view, is properly dealt with at this point. Apart from the tendency notice, there is also the question of any admissibility issues which may arise.
	
	
	There are other features of s.23 which arise as well. On its face, it would seem to involve a purely objective test, unlike its predecessor in the area of provocation. How the Court would formulate the appropriate legal test under s.23 is a significant matter. It is, of course, a matter of some practical significance here because a formulation of significant probative value requires a determination as to relevance, which itself involves some understanding of how it is said to be relevant and to what legal issue.
	
	
	For the purpose of this threshold ruling, I do not intend to proceed further. I am sufficiently satisfied that there are issues which are appropriate for consideration at this stage and which ought be the subject of a pretrial hearing and determination.

	The question has arisen as to what should happen to the jury panel in circumstances where this trial is scheduled to otherwise commence on Wednesday morning.
	
	
	The Accused seeks to rely upon this partial defence, which is novel and has features which are now crystallised in the way I have outlined in this judgment. This is a matter which is of importance to the parties and to the community. The Court has an obligation to give proper regard to matters that are sought to be argued. That requires an opportunity to engage with counsel and consider the matters which are advanced.
	
	
	If the jury panel is to be put back once again, doing it by increments of a day in the end serves no purpose. I am quite satisfied, at this stage, that what is involved in relation to this pretrial hearing will not be resolved in one day. I would be surprised if the hearing is resolved in one day, let alone any determination by me.
	
	
	In my view, the appropriate course is to direct that the jury panel be put back until next Monday, 18 April, and I so direct.

		09 June 2016",2016-04-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769163,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 43) [2016] NSWSC 410,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	On Friday 8 April 2016, I heard a notice of motion filed on behalf of the accused McNamara seeking orders for an adjournment of the trial, for a separation of the trial of each of the accused and for a discharge of the jury. For the reasons given on that occasion, I made an order dismissing the motion: R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 42) [2016] NSWSC 405. The effect of that order was that the trial would resume this morning with McNamara being unrepresented. I noted in my reasons (at [6]) that when I returned to court for the purposes of giving that judgment Mr Wendler of counsel announced his appearance for McNamara, but only in respect of the motion. Up to that point Mr Waterstreet had appeared for McNamara.
	
	
	When the proceedings resumed this morning, Mr Wendler again appeared. On this occasion he announced his appearance for Mr McNamara in the trial, instructed by Mr Abbas, solicitor. However, Mr Wendler's appearance this morning was, at least in a sense, conditional upon the trial being further adjourned so as to allow him to read the material and confer with McNamara. Mr Wendler explained that following his appearance before me last Friday on the motion, he had been retained to appear for McNamara in the trial. He said that he had conferred with Mr Abbas and had been provided with a copy of the transcript of the trial thus far. He explained he had commenced to read the transcript and had spent some further time on the weekend conferring with McNamara and Mr Abbas.
	
	
	Against that background, Mr Wendler made an application for an adjournment of the trial. His primary application was that the trial be adjourned until Wednesday 20 April 2016. In the alternative, he sought that the trial be adjourned until Monday 18 April.
	
	
	In short, Mr Wendler submitted that he would necessarily need time to read the transcript and associated material, and take instructions from McNamara.
	
	
	In making the application and in advancing submissions in support of it, Mr Wendler expressly recognised that there were a number of competing considerations which impacted on the exercise of my discretion to adjourn the trial for a further period. He acknowledged, in particular, the respective positions of the Crown, Rogerson and the members of the jury. As to the members of the jury, Mr Wendler specifically recognised that they had already been absent from the court for one week.
	
	
	At the same time Mr Wendler highlighted what, in his submission, was the preferable course of allowing McNamara to be legally represented. He submitted that were the trial to continue without McNamara having the benefit of representation there would be a significantly greater onus placed on a number of persons, including myself as the trial judge, to ensure that McNamara was given a fair trial. Mr Wendler also raised the possibility that McNamara might unwittingly say or do something before the jury when unrepresented which had the potential to lead to the jury being discharged.
	
	
	The Crown did not oppose an adjournment but submitted that it should be for a shorter period than that sought. The Crown acknowledged that it was preferable, if at all possible, that McNamara be represented. At the same time, the Crown pointed out that if the application was granted in terms of either of the alternatives proffered by Mr Wendler, it would mean that by the time the trial resumed, a period of at least two weeks would have elapsed since the jury had heard any evidence.
	
	
	Mr Thomas, on behalf of Rogerson, accepted that the determination of the application involved the balancing of the various competing interests to which Mr Wendler and the Crown had referred. As was the position with the Crown, Mr Thomas did not object to an adjournment for some period, although he certainly opposed any adjournment for the length of time sought by Mr Wendler.
	
	
	All parties recognised that the determination of the present application involved balancing a number of competing interests. The jury has already been absent for a period of one week without hearing any evidence at all. Whilst I do not propose to detail, yet again, the recent history of these proceedings, the fact is that one week ago I allowed McNamara a period of time in which to attempt to engage alternative counsel. The affidavit in support of the notice of motion with which I dealt last Friday established that, following that adjournment, it was not until the following day that Mr Abbas, who now acts for Mr McNamara, was contacted.
	
	
	In the context of the present case, 24 hours is a very long time. The fact that it took that amount of time for Mr Abbas to be contacted does not sit entirely comfortably with what I was previously told by McNamara, when granting the adjournment, about efforts which were supposedly being made at that time to secure alternative representation.
	
	
	In the ensuing 48 hour period which elapsed before the matter came back before me on 7 April, Mr Abbas made some attempts to contact McNamara, and also made some attempt to contact members of the Bar for the purposes of determining whether or not anybody was available to appear in the matter. In my view, the efforts made by Mr Abbas in those respects were less than diligent. Remarkably, they did not include a single attempt to visit Mr McNamara in person, face-to-face, for the purposes of obtaining his instructions.
	
	
	Moreover, even today no explanation has been advanced as to why Mr Abbas waited until 8 April (that being the day on which the previous motion was heard) to contact Mr Wendler in order to ascertain his availability. Had Mr Abbas shown greater diligence, and moved with greater alacrity, the present situation might not have arisen at all. It might well have been the case that had Mr Wendler been contacted earlier, he could have accepted the brief to appear in the matter long before now, and could have spent the greater part of last week doing what it is that he now seeks more time to do. Those aspects of the matter, in my view, are entirely unsatisfactory. They are certainly not the fault of Mr Wendler but they do not reflect well upon those others involved.
	
	
	As against that, all parties agree that it would be preferable, from a number of points of view, if McNamara were represented. Contrary to the position with which I was faced last Friday (which, as I remarked at the time, was redolent with uncertainty) there is now a firm proposal that Mr Wendler appear in the trial. There is no impediment to that course from the point of view of Legal Aid New South Wales, nor is there any impediment to Mr Abbas remaining as the solicitor in the matter, notwithstanding the fact that he is apparently not a member of the relevant Legal Aid panel. Because of the fact that these proposals are in place, and because of the fact that, for all of the reasons which have been advanced, it is preferable that McNamara be represented, I have come to the conclusion that some adjournment should be granted to allow Mr Wendler some time to prepare. The question is for how long any such adjournment should be granted.
	
	
	Relevant to that determination is the fact that there is little evidence remaining in the Crown case. There is some short further evidence to be led from the officer-in-charge, and some equally short evidence to be led from an analyst (who has already been called) in relation to telephone records and the like. Both witnesses have been cross-examined at length. Any remaining cross-examination will be limited, and thus short. I should also observe that although the evidence has been lengthy, the issues in the trial would appear to be relatively narrow.
	
	
	It follows that this is not a case where Mr Wendler will be required to read a large number of statements and associated material for the purpose of preparing lengthy cross-examinations of a large number of witnesses. That has already been done. Necessarily, the immediate focus of Mr Wendler's attention will be McNamara's case, which will commence immediately upon the Crown case being closed.
	
	
	Obviously, in order to conduct McNamara’s case, Mr Wendler will need to be appraised of the case as a whole and will need an opportunity to obtain instructions. However, as I remarked in the course of submissions this morning, and given the diligence displayed by Ms Shead of counsel who had previously appeared for McNamara, I would be very surprised indeed if there was not contained within her brief (which I am told will be passed to Mr Wendler later today) comprehensive instructions, and an equally comprehensive proof of evidence by McNamara.
	
	
	There are some discrete evidentiary issues which were discussed with counsel at the close of proceedings on Friday, 1 April and which must be resolved before the Crown case closes. Those matters do not lend themselves to lengthy arguments. In fact, I would be surprised if they could not be disposed of in their entirety within about an hour and a half of argument. At that point, the Crown case can resume and will close shortly thereafter.
	
	
	In all of those circumstances, I am prepared to grant an adjournment of the trial to 10am on Thursday of this week. That will allow counsel a further three days to prepare. I propose to list the matter before me at 10am on Wednesday of this week at which time I will hear the remaining legal arguments. Once those matters are resolved I will resume with the jury on the following morning. I expect on that day that the Crown case will be closed. I also expect the case for the accused McNamara to commence immediately upon the closure of the Crown case.
	
	
	For the purposes of facilitating Mr Wendler being able to obtain instructions, I request and recommend, in the strongest possible terms, that McNamara remain at court today for as long as is possible so that Mr Wendler and Mr Abbas can confer with him.
	
	
	When the court reconvenes on Wednesday I will make the same recommendation for such balance of the day as might remain after any arguments are concluded.
	
	
	I will have the entirety of the exhibits brought back to my chambers today. Mr Abbas can, if he wishes to do so, make arrangements with my Associate to inspect those at any time during business hours between now and Thursday of this week.
	
	
	The final issue concerns the jury. I am told one of the members of the jury is absent today due to illness although I am told it is expected that she will return tomorrow. I propose to have the twelve remaining members of the jury come in to court, at which time I will explain to them what they have obviously already realised, namely that one of their number is not here. I will hear from counsel now as to what further information it is considered appropriate that the jury be given at this point concerning Mr Wendler’s appearance for McNamara.

		15 June 2016",2016-04-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769167,R v Turnbull (No. 3) [2016] NSWSC 686,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused, Ian Robert Turnbull, is to stand trial in this Court on a charge of murder and a charge of detaining a person with the intention of obtaining an advantage.
	
	
	The Accused is charged with the murder of Glendon Turner on 29 July 2014. Mr Turner was employed as a Compliance and Regulation Officer for the Office of Environment and Heritage (“OEH”). His role involved investigating illegal land clearing and prosecuting individuals for breaches of s.12 Native Vegetation Act 2003. The background to the prosecution may be found in my judgment on venue: R v Turnbull (No 1) [2016] NSWSC 189.
	
	
	There is no issue that the Accused shot dead Mr Turner on 29 July 2014.
	
	
	In advance of the trial, the legal representatives for the Accused have caused subpoenas for production to issue directed to the OEH. This judgment relates to issues arising with respect to two subpoenas:
	



	
	a subpoena issued on 22 February 2016 (“the 22 February 2016 subpoena”); and
	
	
	a subpoena issued on 4 March 2016 (“the 4 March 2016 subpoena”).
	



	
	I have already dealt with some aspects of the 22 February 2016 subpoena.
	
	
	By Notice of Motion filed on 3 March 2016, the OEH sought to set aside various paragraphs of the 22 February 2016 subpoena. The hearing of that Notice of Motion was brought on for hearing before me, as the trial Judge, on 17 March 2016. The Court was in a position to sit for a limited time only on that day, for reasons explained in the transcript of that hearing. The Court received written submissions, and limited oral submissions were made. The Court adjourned the hearing until 2.00 pm on 18 March 2016.
	
	
	I pause at this stage to note that the Accused had indicated an intention to rely upon the partial defences of:
	



	
	substantial impairment by abnormality of mind under s.23A Crimes Act 1900; and
	
	
	extreme provocation under s.23 Crimes Act 1900.
	



	
	The argument in writing and orally on 17 March 2016 operated at a level of generality.
	
	
	Counsel for the OEH submitted that the challenged paragraphs of the subpoena constituted a fishing expedition. To the extent that the Accused indicated an intention to rely upon extreme provocation in support of the challenged paragraphs of the subpoena, counsel for the OEH submitted that the proposed defence was hopeless.
	
	
	Counsel for the Accused submitted that a legitimate forensic purpose had been demonstrated and that it appeared to be on the cards that the documents would materially assist the Accused.
	
	
	As the transcript of 17 March 2016 indicates, the Court asked a number of questions concerning the way in which it was said that extreme provocation could be raised in this case, including how it could be said that the conduct of Mr Turner could constitute an offence of stalking or intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. Those matters remain open questions, with the Court to move to these issues as a separate matter at the pretrial hearing.
	
	
	On 18 March 2016, I gave a short judgment indicating the way forward with respect to the hearing of the Notice of Motion. I was to be on leave from 21 March 2016 until 6 April 2016. A jury was expected, at that time, to be empanelled on 11 April 2016. I did not consider that the subpoena hearing could be progressed before another Judge. As the trial Judge, I considered that I was best placed to progress the matter.
	
	
	In my judgment of 18 March 2016 (R v Turnbull (No. 2) [2016] NSWSC 678), I expressed the view that, on the limited material before the Court, I was not in a position to effectively dismiss out of hand the Accused's intention to rely on extreme provocation by a conclusion that his desire to do so was hopeless. I said (at [13] of that judgment) that I was satisfied that the appropriate course was to require production to the Court of the documents falling within paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the 22 February 2016 subpoena, for the purpose of the Court inspecting the documents so as to determine whether the Accused had satisfied the requirements for being granted access to them.
	
	
	I made orders for the documents to be produced to the Court on 22 March 2016, divided into two categories:
	



	
	documents which were not otherwise to be the subject of a claim of client legal privilege or public interest immunity; and
	
	
	documents which were to be subject to a client legal privilege or public interest immunity claim.
	



	
	I made arrangements to attend Chambers on 22 March 2016 for the purpose of inspecting the documents in the first category only.
	
	
	Having examined the documents in the first category, I determined that access to those documents should be granted to the parties. In doing so, the Court considered the extreme provocation issue in the general way in which it had been raised. It may be that this approach was overly generous to the Accused. An answer to this proposition can only be expressed after full argument which lies ahead (and will involve the Crown) on other aspects of the trial.
	
	
	In taking this approach, I proceeded by reference to the way in which the matter had, to that point, been argued. I had in mind, as well, the fact that the Accused was to stand trial for murder and the need for early resolution of aspects of the subpoena argument.
	
	
	I propose to proceed upon the same basis in determining the balance of subpoena issues to which this judgment relates. This judgment will not consider the public interest immunity claim, which has for the moment been put to one side.
	
	
	On 22 March 2016, I stood over until 10.00 am on 6 April 2016 the further return of the subpoena. Between 22 March and 6 April 2016, the parties had access to the documents caught by the 22 February 2016 subpoena to which an order for access had been made.
	
	
	On 6 April 2016, the Court was informed that the outstanding subpoena issues were as follows:
	



	
	a claim of client legal privilege by the OEH relating to documents falling within the 22 February 2016 and 4 March 2016 subpoenas;
	
	
	a claim of public interest immunity by the OEH relating to documents caught by the 22 February 2016 subpoena;
	
	
	a number of claims that particular documents were outside the scope of the relevant subpoena.
	



	
	The hearing of the public interest immunity claim was deferred until 2.00 pm on 7 April 2016, with the OEH to be separately represented by the Crown Solicitor's Office on that claim.
	
	
	I proceeded on 6 April 2016 to receive a variety of documents relevant to the client legal privilege claim and the scope of subpoena argument. These included the affidavit of Mark Kelly sworn 5 April 2016. I heard submissions on those issues from Mr Jordan, counsel for the OEH, and Ms O'Neill, counsel for the Accused.
	
	
	On 6 April 2016, I commenced to make rulings on these issues (PT32ff, 6 April 2016). Those rulings related to MFI5, the volume of documents concerning the 22 February 2016 subpoena.
	
	
	At a certain point, I invited further submissions on particular topics affecting MFI5 and the hearing was stood over to 7 April 2016.
	
	
	On 7 April 2016, the Court received further written and oral submissions on these topics and an affidavit was read for the OEH on the client legal privilege claim, being an open affidavit of Gordon John Plath affirmed 7 April 2016.
	
	
	I reserved my decision on the client legal privilege and scope issues at that point until 2.00 pm on 8 April 2016. The parties were informed of the Court's substantial obligations with respect to the Arraignments List on 8 April 2016, which impacted upon the Court's ability to consider and determine the subpoena issues.
	
	
	At 2.00 pm on 7 April 2016, Mr Hill, appearing for the OEH on the public interest immunity claim, was permitted to file in Court a Notice of Motion which raised, with respect to the 22 February 2016 subpoena only, a claim for public interest immunity and a limited claim of client legal privilege. Mr Hill was unable to furnish at that time any open or confidential affidavit with respect to the Notice of Motion. The proceedings were stood over to 9.15 am on 8 April 2016.
	
	
	By that time, open and confidential affidavits had been provided to the Court, together with written submissions on the public interest immunity claim.
	
	
	In due course, the Court commenced to undertake a hearing of the public interest immunity claim at 3.00 pm on 8 April 2016, with the hearing being adjourned until this morning at the conclusion of the court day on Friday.
	
	
	This morning, after some further submissions were made on the public interest immunity claim, I determined that that part of the subpoena hearing should be deferred (PT91-92).   
	
	
	Since Friday afternoon, I have read all documents which have been received, including documents in relation to which claims relate and the written submissions relating to the claims. I have had an opportunity to undertake a level of consideration which was more difficult to undertake in the somewhat fractured course of the hearing last week.
	
	
	It is against that background that I move now to make rulings on the client legal privilege claims and the scope issues which remain outstanding. As I have observed, the public interest immunity aspect has been detached from this hearing and will not be the subject of further reference in this judgment.
	
	
	As I mentioned earlier, I made a number of rulings on 6 April 2016 with respect to areas requiring determination. By reference to the documents in MFI5 (the folder concerning the 22 February 2016 subpoena), as listed in the table at page 26ff of the affidavit of Mr Kelly, I had made a number of rulings. There are some aspects of documents in that table which remain to be considered.
	
	
	The first group are pages entitled ""Injury Management Case Notes"", which are said to be notes of Ms Edith Arns. I had reached that point on 6 April 2016 (PT37). I note that a foreshadowed objection based upon s.126B Evidence Act 1995 concerning these documents is no longer pressed. I note, as well, that parts of these documents have been disclosed to the parties. As to the balance of these pages, it is submitted for the OEH, that the material lies outside the scope of the 22 February 2016 subpoena.
	
	
	I have inspected these pages with the terms of that subpoena in mind. I am satisfied that the material in those documents lies outside the scope of the subpoena and I decline to grant access to it.
	
	
	MFI5 contains further documents which are the subject of a claim of client legal privilege by the OEH. These are the documents referred to in the table of documents at pages 15 to 17 of the affidavit of Mr Kelly of 5 April 2016. I will use that table as an aid for the purpose of these rulings.
	
	
	I have already ruled on Document 1 in that table (PT41-42).
	
	
	Documents 2 and 3 in this table concern aspects of the report of Mr Brian Gilligan. The report of Mr Gilligan constitutes a significant part of the claim of client legal privilege which falls for consideration with respect to MFI4, the folder of documents relating to the 4 March 2016 subpoena. I will return to Documents 2 to 3 in MFI5 at the time of consideration of the related client legal privilege claim concerning MFI4.
	
	
	Returning to the table of documents at pages 15 to 17 of Mr Kelly's affidavit of 5 April 2016, I note that access is not sought on behalf of the Accused to the documents referred to as Documents 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in that table.
	
	
	Moving to Documents 9, 10 and 11 in the table, these documents relate to a draft affidavit of Gary Spencer dated 5 November 2012. I have read the documents to which the claim relates. The draft affidavit of Mr Spencer was prepared in relation to proceedings in the Land and Environment Court. I was informed that a final affidavit of Mr Spencer was filed in those proceedings. Having read the documents which are the subject of the claim, I am satisfied that the draft affidavit of Mr Spencer was brought into existence and provided to Rasheed Sahu-Khan, Legal Officer, for the dominant purpose of the provision of legal advice and that legal advice was provided by Rasheed Sahu-Khan with respect to it.
	
	
	This conclusion involves determination of a question of fact which I have resolved, keeping in mind the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 concerning client legal privilege and the principles referred to in cases to which I was taken, including New Cap Reinsurance Corporation Ltd (in liq) v Renaissance Reinsurance Limited [2007] NSWSC 258.
	
	
	Further, I am not satisfied that the filing of a final form of Mr Spencer's affidavit in the Land and Environment Court proceedings gives rise to a waiver of client legal privilege with respect to a draft affidavit in relation to which legal advice was furnished. In this respect, I have had regard to the relevant provisions in the Evidence Act 1995, including ss.122 and 126, and the decision of the High Court of Australia in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66; 201 CLR 1.
	
	
	Document 12 in the table is described as an email exchange between N Allan, Legal Officer, and G Turner, P Christie and C Nadolny, regarding instructions on the Turnbull remedial directions appeal before Chief Judge Preston. It was noted that this document was not contained in MFI5, but was contained separately in MFI3.
	
	
	I have inspected these documents. Having done so, I am satisfied that they involve a process of seeking and giving legal advice with respect to proceedings. I uphold the claim of client legal privilege with respect to them.
	
	
	I turn now to the claims of client legal privilege with respect to the 4 March 2016 subpoena, being the documents contained in MFI4. For the purpose of these rulings, I shall utilise the expanded table of documents which is MFI12.
	
	
	The first item in MFI12 is described as a handwritten note re conference with clients for the purpose of confidential legal advice, the author being Steve Garrett, Executive Director, Legal Services. Having inspected the documents in question, I am satisfied that the claim of client legal privilege should be upheld.
	
	
	What follows in MFI12, and in the folder, MFI4, are a series of related categories of documents in relation to which a claim of client legal privilege is made. These are:
	



	
	the preliminary draft and final draft reports of Mr Brian Gilligan;
	
	
	Mr Gilligan's notes and documents relied upon by Mr Gilligan for the purpose of his report;
	
	
	legal advice provided after the final draft Gilligan report; and,
	
	
	other documents associated with the Gilligan review.
	


I have examined the documents to which the client legal privilege claim attaches, together with the affidavits of Mr Kelly of 5 April 2016 and Mr Plath of 7 April 2016.


	
	Some matters of chronology are pertinent. Mr Turner was shot dead on 29 July 2014. On 6 August 2014, the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales issued a notice to the OEH under s.155(2) Work Health and Safety Act 2011 seeking information in relation to a possible contravention of s.19 Work Health and Safety Act 2011.
	
	
	On 22 August 2014, Mr Gilligan, a former Director General of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, was engaged to conduct a review and furnish a report into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Turner. According to the affidavit of Mr Plath (paragraphs 9 and 10), the main purpose of this review and report was so he (Mr Plath) could provide confidential legal advice to the Chief Executive of the OEH concerning the potential exposure of the OEH in the event of WorkCover action. Mr Plath said that another purpose of the review was to identify areas for improvement in respect of policies, procedures and training that could be implemented. This was to enable the OEH to improve its systems to provide a safer working environment for its officers.
	
	
	In due course, Mr Gilligan provided a preliminary draft report (as to which comment was made) and a final draft report. Following the delivery of the final draft report, Mr Plath, on 19 January 2015, provided a written legal advice to the Chief Executive of the OEH concerning the Gilligan report and the matters contained in it.
	
	
	In considering the claim for client legal privilege concerning the Gilligan report (and associated documents) and Mr Plath's legal advice, I have kept in mind the principles as stated in a number of cases, including Sydney Airports Corp Ltd v Singapore Airlines Limited and Qantas Airways Limited [2005] NSWCA 47 (“Sydney Airports”) and Priest v State of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 1281.
	
	
	It is for the OEH to establish the claim on the balance of probabilities. Mere assertion of the claim is not enough. What is required is exposure of facts from which an informed decision can be made as to whether the claim for privilege is supportable. The test of “dominant purpose” has been expressed in terms of clear paramountcy, with the word “dominant” requiring that the purpose be the ruling, prevailing or most influential purpose: Sydney Airports at [7].
	
	
	I have examined the documents with these principles in mind. Having done so, I am satisfied that the Gilligan review and report were undertaken for the dominant purpose of the provision of legal advice, with such legal advice being by Mr Plath in January 2015.
	
	
	As Mr Plath's affidavit states, this was not the sole purpose for the provision of the Gilligan report, but the law no longer requires that onerous test to be applied. I am satisfied that the dominant purpose test, as applied to the facts of this case, supports the claim of client legal privilege made with respect to the documents gathered and notes made by Mr Gilligan during this review, together with his reports (both preliminary and final), and comments made concerning those drafts and the legal advice of Mr Plath furnished in January 2015.
	
	
	I proceed to rule on those parts of the documents in light of this finding.
	
	
	I return firstly to the outstanding issues in MFI5 which concerns the 22 February 2016. Documents 2 and 3 constitute a page of Mr Gilligan's final draft investigation report, and an email from Mr Celebrezze (the Sydney-based Regional Co-Ordinator regarding Native Vegetation in the OEH) to Mr Gilligan containing information for consideration in his investigation for the purpose of the giving of legal advice. I have examined those documents. I am satisfied that each of them is caught by the claim of client legal privilege and I uphold the claim in respect of those documents.
	
	
	I return to MFI12 which relates to the Folder MFI4. The second Tab “A” in MFI12 predates the Gilligan investigation. It is a November 2013 email to Mr Plath and Ms Patricia Lenehan, a Senior Legal Officer, from Mr Turner, updating the status of certain proceedings then on foot. I am satisfied that those documents are subject to client legal privilege and I decline to grant access to them.
	
	
	Under Category “B” in MFI12, there are a series of documents, all of which relate, in one way or another, to the Gilligan review and report and the advice of Mr Plath. I note that Document 2 is no longer sought on behalf of the Accused.
	
	
	I have considered the documents described under Category “B” in this table. They include handwritten notes of Mr Gilligan for the purpose of his investigation, copies of his draft report (or preliminary report), documents and comments provided to Mr Gilligan for the purpose of the preparation of his report, the preliminary draft report of Mr Gilligan, comments on the preliminary draft report and the legal advice of Mr Plath dated 19 January 2015 with respect to the Gilligan review and report.
	
	
	I note that the Court was informed by Mr Jordan that some of the material otherwise falling within this category has been provided to the defence. This was material relating to two persons, who are to be called by the Crown, Chris Nadolny (an expert ecologist) and Arthur Snook (the Dubbo-based Team Leader of Compliance and Regulation regarding Native Vegetation).
	
	
	The documents in relation to which the client legal privilege claim is made, involve several copies of the preliminary draft report or the final draft report of Mr Gilligan being sent to different persons within the OEH for different purposes associated with the ultimate purpose of the giving of legal advice. Some of these aspects are incidental ones, but I am satisfied that the balance of the documents referred to in MFI12, and the documents themselves contained in MFI4, are subject to client legal privilege and I decline to grant access to those documents.
	
	
	There are two further documents which were the subject of submissions which fall outside the Folders MFIs 4 and 5.
	
	
	The first of these is MFI14 (referred to at PT61). These are pages where a redacted version of a document has been provided to the legal representatives for the Accused, and the outstanding argument relates to the unredacted version of the document. The argument put on behalf of the OEH with respect to MFI14 was that the material not provided by way of access lies outside the scope of the subpoena. Having examined the material contained in MFI14, I am satisfied that the material not produced does in fact lie outside the scope of the subpoena and I decline to grant access to it.
	
	
	The other group of documents is MFI15 (referred to at PT77). Again, some pages have been furnished in redacted form to the legal representatives for the Accused. The submission put for the OEH is that the material not provided lies outside the scope of the subpoena. I have considered the documents lying within MFI15. I am satisfied that the material not provided to the defence does in fact lie outside the scope of the subpoena and I decline to grant access to the unredacted versions of the documents contained in MFI15.
	


[During the course of the trial, the Court was informed that the Accused no longer sought access to the documents which were subject to the claim of public interest immunity.]

2769184,R v Smith [2016] NSWDC 108,"Judgment

- Application by Accused for Crown not to close to Jury; see transcript p 654


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused is currently unrepresented, but ably assisted by Mr Afshar who has assisted the Court and the accused as a friend of the Court since Monday morning. I express the Court’s gratitude for his assistance. The history of the matter is complex and it must be fairly said there is now a great deal of transcript, perhaps in excess of the transcript of the evidence produced, dealing with matters arising from the accused discontinuing the retainer of his counsel and the consequences of that leading to the current situation. I do not propose to recap that history.  It is set out in the transcript.
	
	
	The issue I am concerned with at the moment is the issue as to whether I should exercise the discretion available to me to direct that the Crown does not address the jury in closing in this trial.
	
	
	The trial has reached the point where the evidence is concluded, the jury has been sent away for the day so that some outstanding legal issues can be resolved including the matter which I am concerned.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor has submitted that I should not exercise the discretion available to the Court. By reference to the principal decision in which I have been referred, R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91, he concedes that the circumstances of the accused being unrepresented cannot be perceived as involving any attempt by the accused to obtain ""tactical advantage."" The Crown submitted in relation to the matter in general terms that there are a great many aspects of the evidence required to be brought to the jury's attention in order to understand the character of the Crown case. Whilst the jury had the benefit of the detailed opening address in which it sought to outline much of the detail anticipated to arise in the evidence, the Crown Prosecutor to the jury had foreshadowed that he would be making a ""closing address."" He submitted that in the evidence there is a body of technical evidence which needs to be explained in order to fully understand the Crown case and that would best be done by the Crown.
	
	
	He also indicated to the Court that if the Crown made a closing address it would not be a ""forceful"" closing address. The Crown would obviously put arguments or matters to the jury in support of the Crown case. No doubt there would be comments about matters arising in the evidence that might be anticipated to be raised by the accused.  Although there is a danger in that course with an unrepresented accused if the accused in his address in due course did not raise those matters. The Crown submission was that I should not exercise the discretion discussed in Zorad.
	
	
	Learned counsel here as a friend of the Court has provided to the Court what I shall call, for want of a better description, a ""note"", not to denigrate it. It is very useful seeking to assist the Court as to relevant issues. It sets out passages from the decision of Zorad. He relied upon particularly passages which may be found at the citation I earlier gave at pp 94D-95D. Mr Afshar also in oral submission took me to some other passages which I shall refer to in a moment. He also very helpfully noted in the note a recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Northern Territory of A v The Queen [2012] NTCCA 9 and particular passages in that judgment. In the written notes the point is made from the decision of Zorad that the discretion exercise is to be undertaken having regard to the circumstances of the case and particularly in a way that ""serves the interest of justice,"" taking into account the parties’ respective interests.
	
	
	In the written document, learned counsel, if I may describe him as that although he is a friend of the Court, also said the Court was entitled to take into account the following matters, although not as an exhaustive list:
	



	
	Whether the closing address by the Crown would have the effect of prejudicing the accused.
	
	
	Whether there is any inference to be drawn that the accused has sought to obtain a tactical advantage by its decision to appear unrepresented.
	
	
	Whether the judge and the jury are likely to be assisted by a closing address by the Crown given the nature of the issues involved and any factual or legal complications to which they give rise.""
	



	
	In the further submissions put for the accused, other matters are raised, including, as I said, a preceding passage in Zorad to that specifically quoted in the note. They include, the difficulties for the accused in ""digesting"" the Crown's address, and being able to respond to it. The point is made, although it is partly covered in the written note, that the accused's performance in making an address to the jury would be ""compared"" to what one would expect to be the professional address of an experienced barrister. It is doubted that the jury would necessarily be further assisted in the Crown's address than it would be by the summing up. It was also submitted, on the basis of some comments that I made, that the case was not a case of ""great complexity"", although there was evidence of a technical nature. Ultimately it was put that it was ""not complex enough"" not to exercise the discretion available.
	
	
	It was submitted to the Court, amongst other matters that I have taken into account, that if the Crown made its closing address it would put great pressure on the accused to respond.
	
	
	I do not propose to read onto the record, so to speak, in the judgment the various passages which appear at pp 94 and 95 of the judgment of Zorad, which have been relied upon either orally or in writing. From what I understand of the submissions made, and I did ask the Crown to assist me to further research this matter as well, what is said to be the situation in Zorad is still the situation in New South Wales. The judgment in Zorad identifies a couple of aspects of the matter that are worth noting in the context of the submissions that have been made.
	
	
	Firstly, it was noted in the judgment that that trial was ""made extremely difficult for the judge because of the decision by the appellant to appear unrepresented"" for which no reasons were given by the Judge at trial appearing in the transcript. Although an invitation was extended by the Court of Criminal Appeal to his counsel on appeal to explain why the decision had been taken, no explanation was forthcoming. It was pointed out that Mr Zorad, unlike this accused as I would understand it, had a ""long experience of the criminal justice system"". Given the availability in 1990 of ""almost universal legal aid at the trial stage"", there was a clear inference that the accused had elected to dispense with legally aided professional representation in the trial, in the hope of obtaining “tactical advantages"".
	
	
	As I said, the Crown does not submit that the accused sought any tactical advantage. I note in relation to that matter as well that although the accused obviously was dissatisfied with his counsel he wanted to retain the solicitor who had instructed counsel. I ultimately granted her leave to withdraw, reluctantly I hasten to say.  But only on the basis that I was assured from what she told me that she could not provide the accused the service that would be necessary if someone was to represent him on the basis of her indicating to me that she did not have the confidence, the skill and/or the experience to conduct the case. I did note at the time, of course, that the solicitor on the record had not been in Court throughout the trial.  But her employed solicitor had. I understood that her employed solicitor was likewise, although present throughout the trial, not sufficiently skilled or experienced to conduct the case.
	
	
	I must confess, speaking frankly, that having heard the further cross examination by the accused of Mr Chang, whose evidence in cross examination was interrupted if I can use that expression by the withdrawal of the retainer of the barrister who formerly represented the accused's interests, I cannot understand, ultimately, why the matters raised with Mr Chang could not have been raised by the counsel whose retainer was withdrawn. Or why they could not have been raised by a solicitor with rudimentary experience of the Court and its practices. I must say, the accused conducted his cross examination in a proper and focused fashion, in my view. Whether it has any effect on the issues in the case is a matter for the jury to decide, not me. But the point I make is that there was nothing really raised in cross examination of a complex technical nature that was beyond the capacity of the lawyers previously acting in the matter to understand.  Or which, it would appear to me, they were otherwise incapable of raising on behalf of the accused. Some of the matters raised by the accused on his own behalf seemed to me, not being the judge of the facts of course, to be of almost no moment whatsoever.
	
	
	Be that as it may, I also pointed out that, whilst the case has not been made ""extremely difficult"" for me with the withdrawal of the legal representatives, it certainly has been made more difficult for me, and it has made it more difficult for the jury in a range of ways. There have been prolonged interruptions to the jury's attention on the case. These were proper interruptions I hasten to say. Frankly, I was caught unawares and I was endeavouring to find ways of keeping legal representatives in the case who had knowledge of the case to provide appropriate assistance to the accused.
	
	
	To return to Zorad, in that decision reference was made to a Victorian decision from 1972 and a decision of Dr Bray, the Chief Justice of the South Australian Supreme Court, in R v Turner (1977) 16 SASR 444 at 446, which the judgment in Zorad suggested referred to a ‘rule’ or a ‘practice’ that the Crown was not permitted to address where the accused is unrepresented and that the trial judge had no discretion to relax that absolute rule.
	
	
	New South Wales authority such as Smith [1982] 2 NSWLR 605 at 615 616 declined to follow that purported ‘rule’. It was said in Zorad that it was a practice in New South Wales whereby the Crown does not address in such circumstance, but it is not a rule of practice, still less is it a rule of law (Smith at 616, Zorad at 94).
	
	
	The Court in Zorad saw no reason to depart from the Court's decision in Smith. It noted the reason for the belief there was such a rule, or such a practice. It noted however changed circumstances since that ‘practice’ existed. I note of course relevant to this matter that the accused had a grant of Legal Aid.  Not that that matters other than to show that he had a grant of legal assistance. I am mindful of the fact that his solicitor indicated that there was no reason for Legal Aid not to continue if the accused was able to obtain counsel to appear at short notice, or if the accused wished the matter to be delayed to enable counsel to be briefed.
	
	
	I am very mindful of the fact, as is the accused, that there has been a totally unacceptable delay in dealing with this case. Its full history I do not know, although I am aware that one of the factors affecting the conduct of the current trial is that there are other proceedings relating to the accused that also are required to be prepared and be ready for presentation to Court. It appears to me, even in these times when there are concerns about delays occurring in this Court because of the weight of work and other factors, that for a person to have his trial start in March of 2016, having been arrested on 25 October 2013 is an entirely unacceptable situation. The accused himself has indicated at various points that he is very desirous of the case proceeding. He has not sought an adjournment of the trial which would inevitably require a discharge of the jury. He is very mindful of the fact that if this jury was discharged he would be required to wait some further time for his trial to proceed. I see no element in this matter of the accused seeking to delay justice being provided to him, the community and the prosecution.
	
	
	There is no suggestion in this matter, as was referred to in Zorad, of a person dispensing with legally aided professional representation for some form of advantage. The Court in Zorad noted that an accused person should not suffer an added disadvantage because of his election to appear unrepresented. This is an election, if it is exercised at any particular time, that is a fundamental right that should not be interfered with. In Zorad the Court noted as at 1990, which is still the case in 2016, that the practice in New South Wales:
	


""...permits both the judge and the jury to have the assistance of an address from the Crown Prosecutor, particularly where the factual issues are complicated"".


	
	This is, as was pointed out in Smith the 1982 decision which I earlier cited:
	


"" … a matter of fairness to the Crown and to the public on whose behalf it prosecutes, and those cases where the accused has elected to appear unrepresented whether or not in order to obtain technical advantages, such complication is more likely if only because of the way in which such a trial is inevitably conducted.""


	
	To come back to some of the matters that were raised on behalf of the accused.  Firstly, if I could deal with the issue of complication or complexity. It was said, I do not doubt it without looking at the transcript, that I had observed that it was not a case of ""great complexity"". But it is a case of complexity in two respects. The issue of ""great complexity"" in my view is a matter of degree. Having been a judge for 16 years, one develops experience of such matters in divining what is complex and what is not that may be beyond the experience of other people involved in particular cases.
	
	
	The complexity here, putting aside the use of the adjectival ""great,"" is, as I understand the Crown case, a great deal of detailed evidence relied upon by the prosecution purporting to show an interconnectedness between particular matters or information revealed in the forensic investigation of the accused's laptop which is required to detail to the jury in order to understand the purported ""facts"" or ""circumstances"" upon which the Crown relies in order to establish the inference of relevant knowledge and/or intention on the part of the accused.
	
	
	Furthermore, there is a degree of evidence, although not a great amount, of expert character which, in my view, is beyond the experience of persons who otherwise may have familiarity with the use of laptop computers and programs and software commonly found on those laptops and computers. It is to be fairly said that part of the evidence of the Federal Agent in charge of the matter and the expert to a greater degree, centres upon the investigations that have been undertaken with software or programs which are beyond the usual types that are available for the general community.
	
	
	It seems to me with respect that to invite the judge to draw together, for the purposes of what the Crown would argue to be the basis of finding a guilty verdict, all the relevant facts and circumstances in order for the jury to understand the Crown case, is asking a great deal of any judicial officer, including myself. It was argued as I earlier mentioned, on behalf of the accused that the case was ""not complex enough"" to warrant the exercise of the discretion required to prevent the Crown addressing.
	
	
	With that assessment of the matter I disagree. With regard to other matters that were raised on behalf of the accused, particularly relating to the matters that were specifically identified that were said to have the potential of ""prejudicing the accused"" my view of the matter is that there are steps that can be taken to neutralise those matters.
	
	
	Part of the background to this is that yesterday, at least, the Crown provided to myself and to Mr Smith and to the friend of the Court, a written outline of the particular matters he was proposing to refer to in his address. Thus, the usual difficulty of digesting the Prosecution's address by having to listen to an oral address without the benefit of any pre-written notes does not exist. I appreciate, of course, there may be matters in oral presentation that will be added to the written document or will refine matters referred to in the written document.  But in that regard the accused still has had and will have the benefit of that written document as a foundation.
	
	
	Also, it is to be fairly said that a great deal of the matters referred to by the Crown, I would have thought, based upon evidence available to the Court, were within the experience and expertise of the accused in any event. Now, of course, it is not for me to judge the case.  But even putting aside the issue of the so called ""hidden file"" and the accused's knowledge of their existence in the computer, the evidence seems to fairly establish a familiarity by the accused with many aspects of the working of the Dell computer at the centre of the prosecution case and a connection directly with many of the folders or files which have been identified in the evidence from the exhibits that have been produced by the Crown.
	
	
	The point was made that the accused would be unfavourably compared to the counsel for the Crown because he was a professional advocate. I believe that matter can be addressed by appropriate direction of the jury. With regard to the issue of the accused being placed under ""greater pressure"" by having to respond to the Crown's closing address, again, there are some aspects of the matter to be identified. I have already referred to the fact the Crown has provided a written outline of what he proposes to say. I have indicated that when the Crown finishes its address I would permit the accused to have time to consider matters that have arisen. I would even invite the accused to ask me, in the absence of the jury, of course, questions about matters he did not understand from the Crown's address. If the friend of the Court was still here I would invite the accused to speak to him to assist him, if needs be. It is to be fairly said that I am required to give the accused directions about the closing address, which I have not yet done, although I have provided directions in writing.
	
	
	Ultimately, having taken into account all that has been put on behalf of the accused, and taking into account those matters in conjunction with the matters put by the Crown, and my understanding of the case from having presided over the trial up until this point, I have concluded that I should not exercise any discretion to prevent the Crown from exercising its right to address. There may be some matters in the Crown's outline that may need to be reconsidered by the Crown. I have noted what the Crown has said about not ""forcefully"" putting matters, by way of argument. It seems to me, with respect, the Crown, in the circumstances, ought to point to those matters that he relies upon to establish the guilt of the accused. It is entitled, in that context, to refer to matters that it anticipates may arise from the evidence as relevant to the drawing of the inference sought to be drawn by the Crown, but favourable to the position of the accused. The Crown would have to avoid, in any form whatsoever, putting to the jury submissions that are expressed as ""anticipating"" any argument that might be put by the accused. The arguments put by the Crown would need to be put as simply references to the evidence and comments made without seeking to suggest that they are matters that there will be, or may be, or could be, advanced by the accused in his closing address.
	
	
	Thus, in the circumstances of the matter, I will permit the Crown to give a closing address.

		16 June 2016",2016-04-11 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769187,Lazarus v R [2016] NSWCCA 52,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I have read with gratitude the judgments of Adams J and Fullerton J. I particularly appreciate the detailed and comprehensive analysis of the evidence by Fullerton J. The difference between the approach followed by each of their Honours is conveniently set out by Adams J in para [11]. Adams J has approached Ground 1 on the basis that it must be considered on the assumption that the trial judge’s direction was correct. Fullerton J has approached the matter on the basis that the correct (as this Court has determined) direction was given.
	
	
	As their Honours have made clear, the outcome is the same whichever approach is followed. In my opinion, this case factually is not a good vehicle to decide the issue which has been raised. Speaking for myself, I have doubts as to whether the correct approach under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) with respect to Ground 1 is to make an assessment of the evidence on the assumption that the trial judge’s direction was correct in circumstances where this Court has decided that such was not the case. Since the result is the same, whichever approach is followed, I prefer not to express a final view on the matter.
	
	
	Accordingly, I agree with their Honours that Ground of Appeal 1 has not been made out. I agree with their Honours that Ground of Appeal 2 has been made out as discussed by Fullerton J. I agree, for the reasons set out by Adams J, that the correct application of s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act requires that there be a new trial.
	
	
	For those reasons, I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: As Fullerton J has pointed out, at the close of the hearing of the appeal, the Court stated its conclusion that Ground 2 should be upheld and reserved its position on Ground 1. The appellant contended under that ground that the verdict “is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence”, relying on s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Fullerton J has concluded, in substance, that it was open for the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt both that the complainant had not consented and, at least, that it was not reasonably possible that the appellant was not reckless as to whether she had consented or not (thus not needing to consider whether he mistakenly believed on reasonable grounds she was consenting), hence that the verdict was not unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence. It followed, therefore, that the appropriate orders are that the conviction should be quashed (Ground 2 having been upheld) and a new trial ordered. I agree with these orders but have arrived at that conclusion by a somewhat different route.
	
	
	The issue to be determined under Ground 1 is whether it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the elements of the offence had been proved. There was no dispute about whether penile/anal intercourse occurred. This left the question of consent which, essentially, comprised two questions: firstly, whether the evidence proved that there was no reasonable possibility that the complainant consented to the alleged intercourse; and, secondly, whether it was not reasonably possible that the appellant did not know the complainant was not consenting. Section 61HA(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) applied in this case to enable the Crown to establish the latter element by proving either that the appellant actually did know the complainant was not consenting or was reckless as to whether she was consenting or not or had no reasonable grounds for believing (if it were reasonably possible that he did so) that she was consenting (the Ground 2 issue). For the reasons explained by Fullerton J, the Court concluded that the direction given by the learned trial judge erred in instructing the jury – having dealt with recklessness – that, if it considered that the complainant’s actions “caused a belief in the mind of the the appellant that she was consenting to penile/anal intercourse with him and you consider that such a belief was a reasonable one”, the Crown had not proved the requisite knowledge; this significantly departed from the statutory test, which (in the event that there was a reasonable possibility that the appellant believed the complainant was consenting) required proof that there were no reasonable grounds for believing the complainant had consented. (I mention, in the interests of completeness, that s 61HA(3)(c) does not require that the reasonable grounds must be caused by a complainant’s actions but simply that they be present. However, this distinction was not material in the circumstances of this case and was not the subject of argument. I say no more about it.)
	
	
	The need to consider Ground 1 arises from the possibility that the Court’s conclusion about Ground 2 might be mistaken and ought not to have allowed the appeal on that ground. For this reason, Ground 1 must be considered on the assumption that the trial judge’s direction was correct. It is not necessary, indeed in principle it is impossible in my respectful view, to consider the propriety of the verdict upon the assumption that the correct (as the Court determined) direction was given, essentially because ex hypothesi the jury’s verdict was not and could not have been based upon it.
	
	
	In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 the Court described the task of the Court of Criminal Appeal in respect of a s 6(1) ground as follows (footnotes inserted into text) –
	


[11] It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen [(1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; [1994] HCA 63.3] by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".

[12] This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 623-624 [58]; [2002] HCA 53.4, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'”.

[13] The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses (M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ). However, the joint judgment in M went on to say (M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494):

“In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred”.

Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter.

[14] In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"" (Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; (1987) 163 CLR 454 at 473 per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ; [1987] HCA 50. In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated (M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-493 (footnotes omitted):

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""


	
	The import of the requirement that the Court must make its independent assessment of the evidence was clearly stated when dealing with the approach taken in the case under appeal when their Honours stated –
	


[20] The reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal exposes a fundamental problem with its approach to its task. The Court concerned itself with whether, as a question of law, there was evidence to support the verdicts, rather than making its own independent assessment of the evidence. … The reasons … indicate that … [the Court] considered what should have been the central question – whether on the evidence the Court was satisfied that the applicant was guilty of the offences – as rather an ancillary question to the question whether there was a sufficiency of evidence to sustain the conviction. … [Emphasis added.]


	
	Where the evidence is conflicting and depends on accepting or rejecting the whole or part of a witness’ evidence, it will almost always be the case, as it seems to me, that – except for those circumstantial cases where objective evidence is determinative – the transcript will not provide a sufficient basis for a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt, quite apart from any inherent weaknesses that the evidence might itself demonstrate. The reference to the doubt that might be experienced by an appellate court necessarily involves the independent consideration by the court of the evidence. The question whether the court of appeal is satisfied that the appellant is guilty of an offence may therefore (and most often will) resolve itself into the question whether, where the evidence before the court comprises transcript of contested evidence as the only or principal basis for determination, the ensuing doubt is allayed by the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the witnesses. Characterising the task required by Ground 1 as ascertaining whether it was open to the jury to convict is thus not quite so simple as the phrase suggests.
	
	
	In this case the Court has concluded that the verdict cannot stand because of the misdirection as to a fundamental element of the offence, namely as to whether the appellant knew that the complainant had not consented to anal intercourse. As to that issue, therefore, there has been no decision by the jury to which the Court can defer to resolve any doubt that it might have about whether this this element were proved. Given the verdict, it is clear that the jury concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant had, indeed, not consented. But this conclusion would not have required the jury to have accepted as reliable the whole of the complainant’s evidence about what actually occurred including, in particular, the extent to which she might have given the appellant to understand that she was not consenting or the extent to which what happened had or might have conveyed that message. Nor can this Court act on the basis of any such assumption. In addition, there was evidence (as set out in Fullerton J’s judgment) that justified the conclusion that the complainant was “substantially intoxicated” within the meaning of s 61HA(6)(a) and thus had not consented, whatever her conduct might have been or have suggested and it cannot be known whether this aspect of the evidence led the jury, or some of them, to conclude that the complainant had not consented and thus to avoid the necessity of deciding to what extent her account of what happened was reliable. Accordingly, the verdict provides no information about the intermediate findings of fact, even on the element of consent.
	
	
	The same is true of the issue of knowledge of consent, with the additional problem that the jury were (as we have held) misdirected as to one of the alternative bases for holding that he knew the complainant had not consented. Although it is true that there was no misdirection on the issue of recklessness, it cannot be known whether the jury found that the Crown had proved he had been reckless as distinct from concluding (in line with the impugned direction) that it was not reasonable to think that she was consenting. Of course, this was an issue, the sub-elements of which did not require unanimity. It follows that the issue of recklessness is not informed at all by the jury’s verdict. On this question, as Fullerton J has shown, there were conflicting accounts of the complainant and the appellant as to what had occurred, as well as the appellant’s evidence as to what he believed and why he believed it. In my view, the relevant issues cannot be decided by the Court – certainly beyond reasonable doubt – by considering the transcripts of evidence. Given the impenetrability of the verdict, it cannot be known whether the jury had found it necessary even to consider the issue of recklessness, let alone what conclusions they or some of them might have reached. It follows that a doubt which the Court might have (as I have explained, must have) cannot be resolved by considering the verdict and the advantage the jury had in seeing and hearing the witnesses. Thus, the Court cannot (in the language of the majority in SKA at [20]), be “satisfied that the applicant was guilty of the [offence]”; in other words, if it approaches Ground 1 on the basis that the direction as to consent was correct, it must then have a doubt about guilt and that doubt cannot be resolved by reference to the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the witnesses. Nor, in my respectful opinion, can Ground 1 be disposed of by any conclusion that it was open to the jury to find that there was no reasonable possibility that the appellant was reckless as to whether the complainant consented or not. That it was so open is only true in a general sense but not in the sense that the test is to be understood in light of the authorities and SKA in particular. The same reasoning applies to the second possibility that there were no reasonable grounds for believing the complainant was consenting to intercourse, with the additional factor that it is known that the jury did not consider this question but the different question posed by the impugned direction.
	
	
	Accordingly, in my respectful opinion, this Court should approach Ground 1 on the basis that, as its conclusion about Ground 2 might be held to be wrong, it needs also to decide Ground 1 to enable disposition of the entire appeal. With respect, as a matter of principle it is incorrect to ask (in this case) whether it would have been open to the jury to convict had the direction accorded with the Court’s view of s 61HA(3)(c), in short, to ask whether there was evidence that justified the conclusion that there were no reasonable grounds for believing, albeit mistakenly, that the complainant was consenting to intercourse, let alone whether it was open to the jury to conclude that the complainant was reckless as to whether the complainant was consenting: these are not and do not inform the issues posed by Ground 1, since the verdict cannot inform those questions. As I stated at the outset, I respectfully consider that correct question is whether, assuming the impugned direction to have been correct, the verdict was unreasonable or unsafe according to the evidence or, in the refined sense to which I have referred, whether the verdict was open to the jury or it ought to have had a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt.
	
	
	I respectfully agree with Fullerton J that the verdict was not unreasonable or unsafe, for reasons which may (her Honour having helpfully set out the evidence and dealt with the submissions) be shortly stated.
	
	
	The fundamental question is whether the complainant could be believed. For the reasons expressed by Fullerton J I agree that this should be answered in the affirmative. It is fair to say that there were some weaknesses in her evidence, possible questions about her reliability in some respects and ambiguities about her conduct. However, these do not by any means suffice to justify the conclusion that a jury could not accept her as a reliable and truthful witness in respect of the matters which the Crown needed to prove beyond reasonable doubt before the appellant can be convicted. Obversely, although the appellant was capable of belief, whether he should have been believed or his evidence raised a reasonable doubt about any of the elements of the charge was very much a matter for the jury. The criticisms which have been levelled at the complainant’s evidence, though not unreasonable of themselves and capable of being regarded as significant, are not such that it should be concluded that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt. The assessment of the concessions made by the complainant in her evidence, which have been identified by Fullerton J, depends a great deal on the manner in which they were made and apparent contradictions denied or explained. Such a judgment was well within the province of the jury to make and, taking these matters both individually and overall, I would not conclude they were such as ought to have given rise to a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt. Very much depended on the judgment made of the respective credibility of the complainant on the one hand and the appellant on the other and, to my mind, the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing them give evidence about the issues raised on the appellant’s behalf and which Fullerton J has identified resolves the doubt that I would otherwise have had about the latter’s guilt.
	
	
	It was conceded on the appellant’s behalf that, if he succeeded on Ground 2 but not on Ground 1, the appropriate order is that there should be a new trial in accordance with s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131; 224 A Crim R 22, McCellan CJ at CL usefully and uncontroversially (though his Honour dissented as to other matters) summarised the matters to be considered under s 8(1) (references omitted) -
	


[649] … The overriding consideration is whether the interests of justice require a new trial … Unless the interests of justice require the entry of a verdict of acquittal, an appellate court should ordinarily order a new trial of a charge where a conviction in respect of that charge has been set aside but there is evidence to support the charge … The court determines where the interests of justice lie by considering various factors, including [numbered for convenience]:

(i)   the public interest in the due prosecution and conviction of offenders … ;

(ii)    the seriousness of the alleged crimes … ;

(iii)     the strength of the Crown case … ;

(iv)   the desirability, if possible, of having the guilt or innocence of the accused finally determined by a jury, which, according to the constitutional arrangements applicable in New South Wales, is the appropriate body to make such a decision … ;

(v)   the length of time between the alleged offence and the new trial, and in particular whether the delay will occasion prejudice to the accused … ;

(vi)   whether the grant of a new trial would impermissibly give the prosecution an opportunity to supplement or ""patch up"" a defective case or to present a case significantly different to that presented to the jury in the previous trial … ;

(vii)   the interests of the individual accused, and in particular whether it would be unduly oppressive to put the accused to the expense and worry of a further trial … ;

(viii)   whether a significant part of the sentence imposed upon conviction has already been served … ;

(ix)   the expense and length of a further trial … ;

(x)   whether a successful appellant to the Court of Criminal Appeal has been released from custody …; and

(xi)   whether an acquittal would usurp the functions of the properly constituted prosecutorial authorities, which are entrusted with responsibilities and discretions to act in the public interest in the initiation and conduct of criminal prosecutions … .


	
	Except in respect of the contention that it was not open on the evidence to convict the appellant, none of the considerations militating against an order for a new trial were pressed on the Court. For present purposes it suffices to say, therefore, that the only controversial matter concerns the strength of the Crown case. It follows from the conclusion as to Ground 1 that the evidence is such as to justify a new trial, though I emphasise that this does not imply a final conclusion about the credibility either of the complainant or the appellant. That being so, it seems to me that the seriousness of the alleged crime, the desirability, if possible, of having the guilt or innocence of the accused finally determined by a jury and the absence of any countervailing considerations require an order for a new trial. Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J.
	
	
	FULLERTON J: The appellant appeals his conviction on one count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), following a jury trial in the District Court.
	
	
	On 27 March 2015 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. There is no appeal against sentence.
	
	
	The appellant filed three grounds of appeal, although ultimately only Grounds 1 and 2 were pressed on the hearing of the appeal.
	
	
	They are as follows:
	


Ground 1: The verdict of the jury was unreasonable and contrary to the evidence.

Ground 2: The trial judge’s directions as to the appellant having no reasonable grounds to believe that the complainant was consenting to the sexual intercourse:

(a) imposed an objective test of reasonableness of belief in consent where no such test existed;

(b) misstated the onus of proof;

(c) failed to detail or explain the evidentiary basis for the appellant’s claim to have reasonably believed that the complainant had consented to the sexual intercourse.


	
	On the hearing of the appeal the Court was satisfied that the trial judge’s directions the subject of the second ground of appeal were in error. Although no redirections were sought at trial, the Crown did not seek to invoke Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) and did not submit the proviso was applicable. The Court reserved its decision on the first ground of appeal, noting at that time that its consideration of that ground of appeal would dictate whether a verdict of acquittal would be entered or a retrial ordered under s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	The Crown case 
	
	
	It was the Crown case that the complainant had penile-anal intercourse with the accused without her consent. That she had penile-anal intercourse with the appellant was not in dispute. What was in dispute was whether the Crown could establish, to the criminal standard, that she did not consent to anal intercourse and, in accordance with the legal test for knowledge about consent in s 61HA(3) of the Crimes Act, either that the accused knew she was not consenting or was reckless as to that fact or that there were no reasonable grounds upon which he had any belief that she was consenting.
	
	
	It was also the Crown case that the circumstances in which sexual intercourse occurred, including when it occurred, where it occurred and how it occurred, what the complainant said before intercourse and during intercourse and the appellant’s treatment of her at that time, would satisfy the jury that the complainant was not consenting to anal intercourse and that the appellant knew she was not consenting, or was at least reckless as to whether or not she was consenting. It was the appellant’s case that the complainant willingly and actively participated in anal intercourse with him and that nothing she said or did caused him to have any reason to doubt that she was a consenting sexual partner.
	


Summary of the evidence at trial


	
	On the evening of 11 May 2013 the complainant, then aged 18, travelled from the Central Coast to Sydney with friends to celebrate a friend’s birthday at Kings Cross. She had arranged to stay at her sister’s apartment in Lane Cove overnight. It was the complainant’s first visit to Kings Cross.
	
	
	Prior to leaving her sister’s apartment at Lane Cove, and making her way to Kings Cross by train, the complainant and BW each prepared a medium soft drink bottle with a mixture of Coca Cola and bourbon. They took the mixed drinks with them.
	
	
	By about 11.15pm the complainant and her friend met other friends by pre-arrangement at McDonalds Restaurant on Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross. After BW and the complainant finished their pre-mixed drinks at the restaurant, they went first to The World Bar on Bayswater Road, Kings Cross, and later to Soho Nightclub (“Soho”) on Victoria Street. The complainant and BW travelled between The World Bar and Soho over the course of the next five hours or thereabouts, consuming a number of alcoholic drinks over that period, seeing their other friends from time to time at both places. The complainant gave evidence that she had sixteen standard drinks while BW said they drank ten.
	
	
	One of the issues in the trial was the complainant’s state of intoxication at the time she first met with the appellant on the dance floor of Soho within minutes of re-entering Soho with BW at approximately 4am, and her state of intoxication within minutes of that when she accompanied him from the dance floor to a laneway at the rear of Soho where they had intercourse.
	
	
	The extent of the complainant’s intoxication was an issue at the trial because of its potential to impact on the issue of consent. Section 61HA(6)(a) of the Crimes Act provides that:
	


(6) The grounds on which it may be established that a person does not consent to sexual intercourse include:

(a) if the person has sexual intercourse while substantially intoxicated by alcohol or any drug …


	
	CCTV footage of the complainant and BW whilst they were at the McDonalds Restaurant, Darlinghurst Road at 10.50pm to 11.18pm was tendered, together with a compilation of various pieces of CCTV footage at Soho, including the complainant and BW entering Soho at 3.55am and the complainant being approached by the appellant on the dance floor inside Soho minutes later at 3.59am. The compilation disk also shows the complainant and the appellant in one another’s company at the base of a set of stairs leading from the dance floor two minutes later at 4.01am and then leaving through the rear door of Soho into Hourigan Lane at 4.02am. Hourigan Lane is a dead-end lane which runs parallel to Victoria Street. The compilation disk concludes with an image of the complainant rejoining BW approximately thirty minutes later at the Kings Cross train station after having had intercourse with the appellant in Hourigan Lane.
	
	
	The jury were taken on a view of the various premises referred to in the trial, including the dance floor at Soho, the stairs descending to the rear of Soho and Hourigan Lane where they were invited to note the position of two CCTV cameras overlooking the laneway: the first located at the rear of the premises neighbouring Soho; the second located at the rear of another premises further north in the lane. Neither of these cameras were operating on the night of 12-13 May 2013. It was common ground that the part of Hourigan Lane where the appellant took the complainant, with the intention of having sexual intercourse with her, was not within range of either of the CCTV cameras.
	
	
	The complainant described the appellant’s approach to her on the dance floor. She said they had a brief conversation, in the course of which the appellant told her he was a part owner of the nightclub and asked whether she had met the DJ. The complainant replied that she had not. (The appellant’s father was a part owner of the club where the appellant was employed on a casual basis.) The complainant said she went with the appellant to the DJ booth located to the side of the dance floor out of the range of the CCTV camera. The camera did record the appellant’s initial approach to the complainant on the dance floor and what appeared to be their first verbal exchange. The complainant said in her evidence in chief that when they were at the DJ booth she held hands with the appellant.
	
	
	It was the appellant’s case at trial that he and the complainant were most intimately engaged at the DJ booth (that is, within the first two minutes of their meeting), including him touching her buttocks, and that this encouraged him to think she would have sex with him and ultimately to believe that she was consenting to the anal intercourse that occurred (also within minutes) in the laneway.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence in chief was as follows:
	


Q. You took her there [to the DJ booth from off the dancefloor]?

A. Yes, before we entered [the DJ booth] we kissed for my best guess is two minutes.

Q. What sort of kiss?

A. Tongue kissing, yeah, it was passionate kissing. I was - I had my hands on her waist, I was touching her body, she was touching mine.

Q. What parts of the body?

A. Her waist, her hips and I think she had her arms around my shoulders. Then we held hands and walked into the DJ booth.

Q. What happened there? Did you introduce her to the DJ?

A. Yes, I gave her a quick introduction.

Q. Can you now recall who the DJ was?

A. It was a very long time age, so I can't say for certain who it was.

Q. What happened?

A. A quick introduction, then we moved to the side towards the back of the DJ booth and then we remained there for five minutes kissing intimately throughout the entire time.

Q. ""Kissing"", what?

A. Kissing throughout the entire time that we were there.

Q. What about bodies proximity to each other?

A. We were facing each other and if we weren't kissing, we were dancing, touching each other's bodies, I was touching her legs, her hips, her buttocks and she had her hands around me.

Q. Did she resist any of your touches?

A. No, no.

Q. Did she say ""no"" or ""stop"" or anything of that nature?

A. Nothing of that nature.

Q. What happened next?

A. Then after five minutes I said, ""Do you want to go somewhere private?"".

She said, ""Okay”. We held hands and walked over to the stairs, we walked down the stairs and over to Erin.


	
	The appellant accepted in cross-examination that his estimate of the time they were in the intimate exchange at the DJ booth he described in his evidence in chief was considerably less than five minutes given that the CCTV footage shows him approaching the complainant on the dance floor at 3.59am and that two minutes later they had moved down the stairs from the dance floor, into the cloakroom/toilet area where the rear door leads into the laneway.
	
	
	The complainant was not asked in cross-examination whether the appellant was touching her in the sexual suggestive way he described in his evidence, or whether she had her hands “around” him. The cross-examination of her on this issue was as follows:
	


Q. And I’m going to suggest you then started hooking up, that is dancing and kissing and rubbing bodies against each other adjacent to where the DJ was?

A. I don’t recall that.

Q. That may have happened?

HER HONOUR: All three things.

LLOYD: Yes.

HER HONOUR: Dancing, kissing--

LLOYD: Dancing, kissing and rubbing of bodies.

HER HONOUR: Adjacent to the DJ?

LLOYD

Q. Adjacent to the DJ?

A. I do not recall.

Q. You’re not denying any of those three things could have occurred?

A. I suppose they could have, yes.


	
	The complainant gave evidence that it was whilst she was at or near the DJ booth that the appellant proposed, and she agreed, that she go with him to what he called a “VIP area” and that he led her from the dance floor down a short flight of stairs. The CCTV compilation disc showed the appellant and the complainant emerging from the stairs into the cloakroom/toilet area.
	
	
	There was an issue at trial as to whether the appellant spoke to anyone in the cloakroom before he opened the rear door and beckoned, and then ushered the complainant outside as revealed in the CCTV compilation disc. The appellant gave evidence that he introduced the complainant to the cloakroom attendant. The complainant was not invited in cross-examination to confirm that he did. The CCTV footage did not clarify the issue.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that when she left the dance floor with the appellant, she thought she had consumed approximately sixteen standard drinks over the course of that night and that she was feeling its effects. She gave the following evidence:
	


I was drunk but yeah, and I was pretty out of it I guess and just very, I don’t know, drunk is the only way I can really think to describe it.


	
	The Crown relied upon the CCTV footage showing the complainant at the rear door before leaving through it with the appellant and what the Crown submitted the jury would infer from her movements at that time, including her momentary stagger and her leaning on the wall for support, as to her state of intoxication.
	


BW’s evidence


	
	BW estimated that from arriving at McDonalds at 10pm to returning to Soho at around 4am, the complainant had consumed approximately ten standard drinks, as had she. When asked how the alcohol had affected her, she said:
	


A. I suppose the way alcohol affects you. We were, I guess, quite happy and I suppose our judgment wasn't exactly perfect is what happens when you consume alcohol.

Q. When you say ""we"" and ""our"" perhaps if you could just tell us?

A. [The complainant] and I.

Q. Just in relation to you, what effect had the alcohol upon you?

A. Yeah, I suppose I felt quite happy. My judgment might not have been perfect because we had in fact had 10 standard drinks.

Q. Had you observed the alcohol to have any effect on [the complainant]?

A. She was relatively the same as me, happy.

Q. Had you noticed any other effect on [the complainant]?

A. No.


	
	During cross-examination, the BW was taken to the witness statement she provided to police on 12 May 2013:
	


Q. You said - and I don't mind if you refer to your statement – at paragraph 21 at the very end:

“During the night I consumed approximately 10 standard drinks. This ranges from 11pm to 2.30am. I can remember what occurred well and was well composed because I know my limits with alcohol""?

A. Yes.

Q. You would agree now that was your position on that night in relation to your degree of inebriation?

A. Yes.

Q. As I understand it you and the complainant effectively had drink by drink, that is you consumed the same amount of alcohol?

A. Yes.


	
	The statement of ET, another friend of the complainant, was read to the jury by consent. She described seeing the complainant at McDonalds at around 3:30am:
	


I would say that (the complainant) was moderately drunk in that she was happy, but still very aware of her surroundings and walking and talking normally.


	
	The complainant’s sister, AM, gave evidence that she received a phone call from the complainant at about 3am on 12 May 2013 to confirm the address of her apartment. She described her sister as “moderately intoxicated and sounded happy, like she was having a good time”.
	
	
	During cross-examination, AM was taken to her witness statement:
	


Q. And then you say:

“I've seen [the complainant] intoxicated about three times prior to this I can tell that she was moderately intoxicated by the tone of her voice. Her speech was clear and she just sounded happy and excited. I went back to sleep"".

A. Yes.


	
	It was the defence case that the complainant was deliberating exaggerating the amount she had drunk and its effects. When that was put to her in cross-examination she disagreed. The appellant gave evidence that when they left the club and entered Hourigan Lane he believed the complainant was not affected by alcohol. He did not agree that the complainant was steadying herself by placing her hand on the wall before exiting.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that after leaving through the rear door and going down some stairs, they walked for about 50 metres along the lane before they stopped near a fence and began to kiss. The appellant gave evidence that once outside in the laneway, he and the complainant held hands and jogged – he said the complainant “was almost skipping” – to the end of the lane where they started kissing. The complainant was not invited in cross-examination to confirm or deny that she “jogged” or “skipped” down the laneway.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence in chief as to what happened at the end of the laneway as follows:
	


Q. What happened then?

A. We started kissing and then like for a little bit, I - I’m not sure how long and then I wanted to leave so I said - I stopped and I said I’d like to - “I need to go back to my friend, I have to meet my friend”.

Q. When you were kissing what positions were you in?

A. We were standing up. I - I don’t recall where our hands were.

Q. And you have said that you said that you had to stop?

A. Yeah I stopped, yes.

Q. And you mentioned wanting to see a friend?

A. Yeah I said I had to meet my friend back in the club.

Q. Was there any response to that?

A. He said “No, stay here with me”.

Q. Did you say anything further?

A. I said “No, I really need to go”.

Q. And at this time when you were having this conversation that you just told us about what was the tone of the young man’s voice?

A. Normal, just conversational I guess would be the tone.

Q. And after he said “No, stay here with me”, what happened then?

A. I turned to go, I turned around and he - he put his hands on my hips and pulled my stockings down a little bit.

Q. How far did he pull your stockings down?

A. Three inches I would say, just a - a small bit.

Q. And how did he do that?

A. With - he - he put his hands like up my skirt and onto my hips and then pulled my stockings down a little bit.

Q. At the time that he did this which way were you facing?

A. I was facing away from him.

Q. When you say you were facing away from him was he behind you?

A. He was behind me, yes.

Q. And after he pulled your stockings down what happened then?

A. I turned back to him and I pulled them back up and I said “I really have to go.”

Q. And did he reply to that?

A. He - that’s when he said “Put your fucking hands on the wall”.

Q. What was the tone of his voice like when he said that?

A. He - he was getting frustrated and impatient I guess frustrated and impatient would be the tone, more aggressive than [the] previous conversation.

Q. And what did you do then?

A. Put both my hands on the - on the fence.

Q. Are you able to tell the Court why you did that?

A. I was just scared I guess, I didn’t know what to do so I just did what he said.

Q. And in relation to the fence what sort of fence was it?

A. It was a - a wooden like is it called a picket fence, it’s like wooden slats next to each other so a wooden fence.

Q. Do you remember how high the fence was?

A. Not exactly, no.

Q. And you said you did put your hands on the fence?

A. I did put both my hands on the fence, yes.

Q. And what happened then?

A. He pulled my stockings and underwear down to my ankles.

Q. At the time that he did that were you facing towards him or away from him?

A. I was facing the fence away from him.

Q. And what happened then?

A. He said “Just get on your hands and knees and arch your back.”

Q. What tone of voice did he say that to you in?

A. Like authoritarian like do, not - not aggressive but not nice I guess, just do that if you know what I mean.

Q. Did you do that?

A. I did, yes.

Q. Are you able to tell the Court why you did that?

A. I - I was scared, I can't - I was just doing what he asked.

Q. When you did as he said and got on the ground and arched your back where you relative to the fence?

A. I was probably like a metre or two away facing away from the fence.

Q. Do you remember what sort of surface you were on?

A. It was a like gravel like road.

Q. When you did what he asked you to do can you just describe what you actually did?

A. So I got on my hands and knees and arched like arched my back.


	
	As to the intercourse whilst she was on the ground, the complainant said:
	


A. He put his penis into my butt, my bum I guess, I don’t know which correct terminology it is and I said “Ow” and he said “You're so tight” and I said “What do you expect, I’m a fucking virgin” and he said “Oh shit, really” and then I just kept saying “I have to go back to my friend” and he didn’t say anything to that.

Q. Did you say anything else to him?

A. I asked him to - I said “Stop” at the start like at the beginning after - after he said “Oh shit, really” and then I just kept saying “I need to go back to my friend”.


	
	The complainant gave evidence that she thought the penetration of her anus continued for about ten minutes. She was uncertain as to whether the appellant ejaculated. She did not believe he used a condom. She gave the following evidence:
	


Q. Are you aware of whether or not he ejaculated?

A. I – I don’t think he did because I didn’t feel anything so I am assuming that he did not.

Q. And are you aware whether or not he wore a condom?

A. I don’t believe that he did. I didn’t see a wrapper or hear him open anything or anything like that so I’m assuming again that he did not.


	
	The following day, the complainant underwent a forensic examination at North Shore Hospital. An anal swab taken in which semen was detected. The DNA in the anal swab was a mixture of the appellant’s DNA and the complainant’s DNA. DNA was recovered from a vulval swab that was also a mixture of the complainant and another person. The appellant could not be excluded as the contributor to that mixed sample.
	
	
	The complainant also gave the following evidence as to what occurred after the anal intercourse:
	


Q. After this, what did you do?

A. I stood up and I pulled my stockings and my underwear up.

Q. And what happened then?

A. He asked me to put my name in his phone, so I put my name in the notes on his phone and yeah I didn’t put my, I just my name that’s all.

Q. In relation to his phone, how did you come to have his phone?

A. He handed it to me.

Q. And when did he do that?

A. After I had pulled my stockings and underwear up, he said “Put your name in my phone” and handed me his phone then.


	
	When asked by the Crown what she did next, she said:
	


I tried to find the door that we came out of but I, I tried one of the lit up doors but it wouldn’t, it wasn’t open or it was locked or, wrong door I don’t know, and so I, I ran back to the Kings Cross sign, station sign.

Evidence of complaint


	
	On arrival at the station, the complainant telephoned BW who arrived shortly thereafter. The complainant said that she was crying and that she told BW what had happened. The complainant was unable to recall what she said to BW. BW gave the following evidence, relied upon by the Crown as evidence of complaint:
	


Q. When you met up again with [the complainant], did you make any observations about her?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you observe?

A. She couldn't breathe properly. She was crying.

Q. Did she say anything to you?

A. Yes.

Q. What did she say, to the best of your recollection?

A. She said that she met someone that took her up to the - to the DJ area of the club and then to a VIP area and then he took her to an alleyway. And she told me what had happened and she said, he told her to put her hands on the wall and then to arch her back. And she said to him to find her friend, she's with me and he said, she told me he said, ""Your friend won't miss you"". And that's all she said to me at that point.

Q. Did you have any further conversation at that time with [the complainant] about what had happened?

A. I just asked her ""where"" and she said, ""In the alleyway"". I asked her, who it was and she just said it was someone in the DJ area and at this point she was crying so I couldn't get much out of her.

Q. What did you do?

A. I was in shock. So I just hugged her and then she kind of collapsed into my arms. And then we walked to the station to go home.


	
	BW also gave the following evidence:
	


Q. After this conversation with [the complainant] at the crossing and before you arrived back at [the complainant’s sister's] home, was there any other conversation about this incident?

A. We just went over it again and again. And we couldn't talk on the train because there was people near us and people kept asking what was wrong with her and we just tried not to draw attention because she was in hysterics.

Q. Did you reach [the complainant’s sister’s] home?

A. Yes.

Q. What happened then?

A. I asked her to check if she was bleeding because she was in pain and she was. And then we went to sleep. [ST] and [ET] were already there, but they were already asleep so we went to sleep for about two hours.

Q. I will stop you there. You said she said was in pain?

A. Yes.

Q. You're referring to [the complainant]?

A. Yes.

Q. Did she say where she was in pain?

A. Yes.

Q. What did she say?

A. She said it was hurting down there. That's all she said to me.


	
	The two women waited for the train station at Kings Cross to open before travelling to the complainant’s sister’s apartment, from where the complainant sent a text message to her sister in the following terms:
	


Complainant (5.05am): I have something to tell you.


	
	The complainant’s sister did not respond to the text.
	
	
	After the complainant and BW slept for about two hours, the following text message exchange passed between the complainant and her sister, also relied upon by the Crown as evidence of complaint:
	


Complainant (9.38am): Are you awake?

Sister: Yep.

Complainant: Well, could you not be mad at me please but can you please transfer $20.00 into my account so [BW] and I can get home. Sorry.

Sister (10.02am): Never angry baby girl. I am with a different bank. Don't donut. Donut won't hit your account until tomorrow. You can wait until we get home in about an hour or go the back balcony and scab gold coins out of the brown box. Let me know.

Complainant: OK we'll wait.

Sister: Make sure you have tidied up please drunky

Complainant: OK, I have the story to tell you. It's actually really heavy so are you alone?

Sister (10.16am): I am in the car with [P]. Are you OK?

Complainant: OK so we went to the World Bar and Soho and we just kept going back and forth between the two. At about 4.30, [BW] and I went back to Soho and she was hooking up with this boy and I was just dancing beside them and this boy started dancing with me and he was the co-owner of Soho (like for serious, he actually was) and he introduced me to the DJ and then he took me out this back door and we went down this alley and then he was aggressively hooking up with me and I was like ""I have to go back to my friend"" and he was like ""No, its fine, she won't miss you"" and then I was trying to get away and I was like ""No, I really have to find my friend"" and then he just went ""No, put you fucking hands on the ground and arch your back"" and I didn't know how to leave so I just did and he, ah, how do I put this delicately? Anal. Yep. And then I ran away and called [BW] and waited for her and cried. The End. Yeah.


	
	Evidence of complaint was also given by ST and ET, two of the complainant’s friends who were at the apartment in Lane Cove having left Kings Cross before the Complainant and BW.
	
	
	ST, another friend of the complainant’s friends who was in her company from time to time between McDonalds, The World Bar and Soho, described meeting the complainant and BW at The World Bar at approximately 11pm. She gave evidence that she occasionally came across the complainant and BW during the night with another friend of hers but that “there was a bit of disjoint between us and them”.
	
	
	ST described seeing the complainant and BW at McDonalds after 3am before she left Kings Cross and returned to the complainant’s sister’s apartment with another friend by taxi.
	
	
	As to the events of the following morning at the apartment, ST said:
	


A. BW was mainly talking that morning. [The complainant] was quite quiet and quite disengaged from us, she told us that she'd been sexually assaulted at the Soho nightclub.

…

A. Okay. She said that, [the complainant] was dancing with a guy, she was dancing with a guy. He led her through a back way of Soho, he told her to get against the wall and he made her have sex with him anally.

Q. Did you say anything in response to that?

A. I asked if she was - if he wore a condom, if she was going to talk to the police about it? She said that, she wanted to wait for [her sister] to come home and discuss it with her.

…

Q. I think you said a bit ""disengaged"". Did her demeanour change at any stage during the conversation that you were having about the night before?

A. No, she - it was - she was in a state of shock and when she was telling us what had happened it was almost like she couldn't - she hadn't fully reckon - realised - a state of shock I would say, like it would be.


	
	Of the morning after the incident, after ET had also spent the night at the complainant’s sister’s apartment, her statement read:
	


We all sat down on the bed talking about the night and [the complainant] just casually said during the conversation, ""I was raped."" [The complainant] told me the gist of what had happened and she said words like, a guy took me to the back of the Soho and told me to lay on the ground and arch my back. She really didn't explain it at the time. We were both in shock and I told them to call the police.

[The complainant] said she'd already told her sister and [she] was on her way home. She said they were going to wait for the sister to arrive and then they would work out what they were going to do.

[ST] and I probably would've stayed for about an hour. The rest of the time we just spoke about the rest of the night and where they had been when we'd lost them and then left them. The assault was only a small part of the conversation.

AM’s evidence


	
	Following the text message received after 10.16am the following morning (extracted above at [58]), AM gave evidence that she immediately telephoned the complainant:
	


... I called [the complainant] straight away and I asked her if she was okay and she said she was fine and I said ""Are you sure"" and she that she was okay. I said ""You know that when we get home we have to go to the police"".


	
	The complainant attended Chatswood Police Station with her sister where she spoke to police and gave them the clothes she wore to Kings Cross the previous night.
	
	
	The statement of the police officer to whom the original complaint was made at Chatswood Police Station was read to the jury by consent. The statement described the complainant’s account of the events leading to the anal intercourse:
	


Allegedly the POI stated his name, but [the complainant] could not recall it. [The complainant] described the POI AS approximately 23 years old, a bit shorter than her in height, slim build, scruffy hair, Middle Eastern appearance, wearing a white short sleeved t-shirt and black dress pants.

The POI asked [the complainant] if she had met the DJ and stated that he was part owner of the Soho Nightclub. The POI and [the complainant] walked around the DJ booth, out the back door and into a laneway. They walked to their right and along the laneway for about 50 metres to the opposite side of the road. They stood near a wooden fence and [the complainant] recalled the top of the fence palings were in the shape of a diamond.

The POI and [the complainant] started kissing which [the complainant] stated was consensual. The POI then pushed [the complainant] against the fence and inserted his penis into her anus. [The complainant] thought this male was not wearing a condom and didn't ejaculate. [The complainant] ran back along the laneway, past the rear door to Soho and out on to the Victoria Street where she called [BW], who later met up with her.


	
	A forensic examination was then undertaken at Royal North Shore Hospital, including an internal examination. The complainant gave an account of the incident to the examining doctor at Royal North Shore hospital which the doctor recorded as follows:
	


[The complainant] was at [a] club in Kings Cross with [a] friend. She met a man and they went outside. Once outside they started “hooking up” (kissing). [The complainant] said she had to go. The man told her to stay. [The complainant] tried to leave, the man ordered her to put her hands on the wall, he pulled her stockings down. He then pushed her down on all fours. He penetrated her anus with his penis. She said it was very painful. He did not use a condom. She does not think that he ejaculated.

She then ran back to her friend and they went home.


	
	The examination revealed grazes on the complainant’s knees and small tears around her anus. The complainant attended Kings Cross Police Station later that day and provided a statement to police.
	


Cross-examination of the complainant


	
	Various propositions were put to the complainant in cross-examination, where she was invited to concede that some aspects of the events of the evening, and important details of her sexual engagement with the appellant, had been omitted in her evidence in chief. The cross-examination was directed to challenging her credit, it being the defence case that in critical respects she was lying in the evidence she gave as to what occurred in the laneway. It was the appellant’s case that, far from being a non-consenting party to anal intercourse, she was an active and willing participant throughout and that she only changed her attitude when she saw that she was the last addition to a list of female names in the appellant’s phone. It was the appellant’s case that, thereafter, she determined to make a false complaint about non-consensual anal intercourse, claiming (falsely) that she only submitted because she was in a state of fear and because her judgment was compromised because of the alcohol she had consumed.
	
	
	As to the events in the laneway immediately preceding the intercourse, the complainant was asked the following questions:
	


Q. And you you’ve said elsewhere in your evidence, were willingly kissing him, correct?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And you were doing that for at least several minutes down in the lane, weren’t you?

A. That’s correct.

Q. You willingly went with him from the dance floor?

A. That’s correct.

Q. To the area of the DJ, let aside whether you met the DJ, you willingly went with him down the stairs, correct?

A. That’s correct.

Q. You willingly went with him out the door?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And you willingly went with him down the lane?

A. That’s correct.

Q. He didn’t force you?

A. That’s correct.

Q. He ushered(as said) no threats to you at any stage?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And you went down the lane with him some 50 metres where you willingly hooked up with him?

A. That’s correct.

[She had earlier explained that “hooking up” meant kissing.]

Q. He certainly didn’t push you to the ground and push you to your hands and knees, did he?

A. That’s correct.

Q. Nothing like that, there was no force, and there were no threats?

A. That’s correct.


	
	The complainant was also taken by the cross-examiner to the account she gave to the examining doctor at Royal North Shore Hospital. It was put to the complainant that she gave the doctor a false account of the events:
	


Q. Well let’s read the history taken by the doctor from you. “[The complainant] was at a club in Kings Cross with friend. She met a man and they went outside. Once outside they started “hooking up”, (kissing). [The complainant] said she had to go. The man told her to stay. [The complainant] tried to leave, the man ordered her to put her hands on the wall, he pulled her stockings down. He then pushed her down on all fours”. You see that?

A. Yes.

Q. Well if the doctor recorded that from you, it would be wrong wouldn’t it?

A. Yes.

Q. Because you say that didn’t happen?

A. That did not happen.

Q. Madam, again I suggest to you that’s what you told the doctor?

A. I don’t recall telling the doctor that.

Q. And you were again embellishing your account to make it more believable?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Object to the word --

HER HONOUR: She doesn’t recall telling the doctor that.

LLOYD

Q. Madam the truth is you consented to intercourse that night, didn’t you?

A. No.

Q. “He then pushed her down on all fours, he penetrated her anus with his penis, she said it was very painful. He did not use a condom. She does not think that he ejaculated. She then ran back to her friend and they went home”. But that sentence there that the doctor has recorded of our history, “He then pushed her down on all fours”, you disagree with?

A. That’s correct.

Q. As I understand your evidence that’s not what you told the doctor?

A. I don’t recall what I told the doctor.

Q. Well if you told that you would have been mistaken?

HER HONOUR: Well Mr Lloyd, she never agreed or she doesn’t recall what she told the doctor.

LLOYD: No I don’t need to take it any further your Honour.

Q. Because there was no pushing at all was there?

A. That’s correct.


	
	As to the anal intercourse, the complainant gave the following evidence in cross-examination:
	


Q. And I’m going to suggest to you madam that you willingly went down the lane with him?

A. That’s correct.

Q. You hooked up at the end of the lane in the sense of kissing?

A. That’s correct.

Q. Rubbing of bodies?

A. I don’t recall that. I don’t recall that.

Q. But you’re not denying that may have happened?

A. It could have happened, yes.

Q. And that you did say, “I should get back to my friend” and he said, “No, she won’t miss you, stay with me”?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And then you hooked up a bit more in the sense of kissing and body rubbing, that may have happened?

A. I suppose so.

Q. He asked you to lean against the fence which you did?

HER HONOUR

Q. Well firstly did he ask you to lean against the fence?

A. He asked me to put my hands against the fence.

LLOYD

Q. Well yes, put your hands against the fence?

A. That’s correct, yes.

Q. And he took - pulled your stockings down and your underwear?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And you didn’t resist?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And he tried to enter your vagina from behind?

A. I don’t recall.

Q. But he may have?

A. He may have.

Q. And he said words to the effect, “Fuck you’re tight”?

A. After I was on the ground.

Q. He’s been trying to enter your vagina, you’ve just accepted he may have done that?

A. Right.

Q. He said to you, “Fuck you’re tight”?

A. No.

Q. And you said, “What do you fucking expect, I’m a virgin”?

A. Right.

Q. You said that didn’t you?

A. I did say that yes.

Q. And then he entered you?

A. Yeah.

HER HONOUR

Q. What, anally?

A. While I was on the ground yes.

LLOYD

Q. And he did ask you if you could put your hands and knees on the ground?

A. Yes. That was before that conversation, yeah.

Q. Before that conversation?

A. Yeah that’s correct yes.

Q. He tried to enter your vagina and then he entered your anus?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And as he was entering your anus you pushed back towards him?

A. I don’t recall.

Q. But you may have?

A. I may have.


	
	The complainant responded to propositions put to her about saying “Stop” or “No” during anal intercourse as follows:
	


Q. I want to go back to when you were in the lane. I want to suggest to you that at no stage did you say ""stop"" or ""no"" to my client when he was having intercourse with you?

HER HONOUR

Q. Firstly it's suggested at no stage did you say ""stop"" when anal intercourse was occurring?

A. That's incorrect.

Q. And at no stage did you say ""no"" when anal intercourse was occurring?

A. That's correct.


	
	The complainant was taken to her first statement to police at Kings Cross police station in the following questions:
	


Q. Taking you back up to the top of that page I'll pick it up halfway along the first line:

“As soon as he inserted his penis into my anus I felt a lot of pain and said ""ah"". He said ""Fuck you're tight"". I said ""What do you expect, I'm a fucking virgin"". He said ""Oh, shit really"". I continued to tell the male I needed to go back to my friend but he didn't respond. I think at one point I told him to stop, but mostly I was saying that I need to go back to my friend.”

This was the first statement you made, wasn't it?

A. That's correct.

Q. You knew that it was important to be as complete and accurate as possible in giving your account to the police?

A. That's correct.

Q. You read the statement back and you had no corrections or additions to make?

A. That's correct.

Q. You say here ""I think at one point I told him to stop""?

A. That's correct.

Q. Well, you weren't certain were you?

A. I was, yes.

Q. Well you don't say ""I told him to stop"", do you?

A. That's correct.

Q. You say ""I think at one point I told him to stop""?

A. That's correct.

Q. They're very different meanings in English, those phrases, aren't they?

A. I suppose so, yes.


	
	It was put directly to the complainant in cross-examination that her attitude to the appellant changed when she was asked by him to add her name to the list of names in his phone, and that it was that that inspired her to make a false complaint about the appellant’s treatment of her during their sexual encounter as to which she gave the following evidence:
	


Q. Madam, I'm suggesting to you in concluding my cross-examination that once you put your name at the end of that list of girls' names on that phone your attitude changed?

A. I disagree.

Q. You then became upset and you left the lane?

A. I disagree.

Q. That you felt you'd been used and were just a trophy?

A. I disagree.

Q. And I suggest to you that you have lied in this courtroom about what took place in that lane?

A. I disagree.

Detective Senior Constable Dale’s evidence


	
	Officer Dale gave evidence that a statement was obtained from the complainant by Officer Butler at Kings Cross Police station on 12 May 2013 in which she detailed the sexual assault and that she obtained further statements from her on 28 May 2013 and 11 October 2013. There was no evidence led from the Crown or the police as to the content of the additional statement.
	
	
	On 9 August 2013, the appellant attended Kings Cross Police Station with a legal representative where he was formally cautioned and charged. He declined to be interviewed. He consented to the provision of a buccal swab.
	
	
	Officer Dale gave evidence that she obtained data from the appellant’s phone, which included a list of female names, including the complainant’s.
	
	
	A text message exchange between the appellant and a friend of the appellant, Rono, sent at around 2pm on 12 May 2013 and received by the applicant was also retrieved from the phone. It read as follows:
	


Rono: How was your night ??

Appellant: I honestly have zero recollection of calling you.. Was a sick night – took a chicks virginity lol

Rono: Bahahaha nice popping does [sic] cherries. Tight?

Appellant: So tight.. It’s a pretty gross story tell ya later.


	
	The police also intercepted a number of phone calls between the appellant and both his father and a male friend between 3 and 6 August which, in the Crown’s submission, revealed the appellant’s concern as to what the CCTV footage might have revealed and his expressions of relief when he learnt it did not show him with the complainant but interacting with another woman, with no suggestion of wrongdoing.
	


The defence case


	
	The appellant gave evidence that he believed the anal intercourse with the complainant was consensual and that there was nothing in her behaviour towards him, including anything that was said by her or her behaviour before or during intercourse that indicated to him that she was not consenting. Furthermore, the appellant maintained that the complainant was actively and, in his assessment, willingly engaged in anal intercourse with him.
	
	
	The appellant described his approach to the complainant on the dance floor, making eye contact with her, dancing with her and his invitation that she accompany him from the club to a “VIP area”.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence:
	


Q. Was there initial conversation between the two of you?

A. Yes. Whilst we were dancing I said, ""Hi, my name is Luke”. She said, ""I'm [SM]”. We continued to dance a bit further. I said, ""Hey, this is my family's place”. And she said something to the effect of, you're joking, or she expressed disbelief. So I opened my wallet and I showed her what is a business card, a staff business card, and my licence. She looked directly at it, at them. And then I said, ""Okay, have you met the DJ before?"". She said that she hadn't. I said, ""Look, let's go to the VIP area”.


	
	He said that he stopped at the cloakroom at the base of the stairs en route to Hourigan Lane (the place he appeared to nominate as “the VIP area”):
	


Q. What was that about?

A. Erin was cloak room girl who had been there for a few years, was a close personal friend of mine. I said, ""Okay, we're heading off, see you later”. And I said to [the complainant], ""This is Erin”. She said, ""Hello”. Then I said, ""Okay, we're heading off, see you later”. And I walked to the door and held the door open.


	
	The appellant gave evidence that once outside in the laneway, they held hands and jogged – he said the complainant “was almost skipping” – to the end of the lane where they started kissing. He went on to describe what happened:
	


A. Got to the end of the lane, immediately started kissing again, our bodies were touching. At this point I was touching her buttocks and her breasts, our groins were touching, she had her hands around me and, yeah, we were kissing the whole time.

Q. What happened next?

A. Next she said, ""Oh, I should probably go back to my friend”. To which I said, ""No, stay here with me, your friend won't miss you”.

Q. Next?

A. She didn't respond and we continued kissing for another few minutes. There was kissing and then whilst kissing I said, ""Turn around and put your hands on the fence”.

Q. Did you raise your voice on saying that or just ask her?

A. No, I did not raise my voice or I wasn't demanding anything, I just said it as I had been talking to her.

Q. Go on, what did she do?

A. She turned around and put her hands on the fence and kind of bent right over and pointed her buttocks towards me. At that point I tried to pull her stockings down and her underwear down. I did pull her stockings and underwear down, not down to her ankles, but down below her buttocks. I tried to put my penis in her.

Q. Just stopping there, up to this stage did she say ""no"" or ""stop"" in any form?

A. No, no.

Q. Did she try to pull away from you?

A. No.

Q. Okay. Trying to put your penis in her, what part of her?

A. In her vagina.

Q. As you were trying to put it in--

A. As I tried to--

Q. What did she do?

A. Once I put my penis to her vagina and she moved back towards me with her body. I believe that she was encouraging me and sex. It wouldn't go in and I said, ""Fuck, you're tight”. She said, ""What do you expect? I'm a fucking virgin”. I said, ""Okay, well, get on your hands and knees and arch your back”. And she did so.

Q. Did you raise your voice?

A. No, no. She did that and then I tried to put my penis in her vagina again and it wasn't going in. But the whole time I was trying to move my penis towards her vagina, she was pushing back towards me. I then put my penis to her anus and as I did so she did the exact same thing and pushed back towards me, slowly.

Q. Did she say ""no"" at any stage --

A. No.

Q. --when you moved to her anus?

A. No, she did not say the word ""no"". Then as I moved forward slowly she moved back slowly and then I moved back and forwards slowly and she did the exact same thing. Her body - throughout her whole body she was moving back towards me. And then we finished and then I stood up, pulled my clothing back on and she did the same.

I couldn't recall her name and I said to her, ""Can you put your number – put your name in my phone?"" And handed her my phone, I gave her, with the note up, and the screen was alight. At that point she took it, looked at – clearly looked at the names and wrote her name at the bottom.

Q. ""Wrote"", you mean typed?

A. Typed her name at the bottom.

Q. What sort of phone did you have?

A. It was an iPhone 4. She typed her name in. As I was looking at her, she -her demeanour clearly changed.

Q. In what way?

A. She no longer had a smile on her face that she had before, she was disgruntled. She looked - yeah--

HER HONOUR

Q. Rather than your conclusions what did you observe? So she no longer had a smile on her face?

A. A stern look on her face, yeah, she wasn't smiling sweetly anymore and she was - there was a serious look on her face. I realised that at that point that it was clearly a very, very rude thing for me to have done. She gave me the phone back and she just - and she walked away.


	
	The appellant denied raising his voice or physically pushing or threatening her. He said that at no stage did the complainant ever say “no” or “don’t do that” to any of his sexual advances.
	
	
	When asked what steps the appellant took to satisfy himself that the complainant was consenting, he said:
	


A. I knew she was consenting because we had kissed a number of times heading up to - she willingly came down the lane with me, I didn't force her to, we were kissing down in the lane, I didn't ask her to bend over, she just did it, as I put my penis to her vagina she pushed back towards me, and then as we were having sex she was moving back and forwards with me the whole time.

Q. What about the groping of bodies?

A. She was touching my body as well, when I touched her body she never moved my hands away, never said ""no"", never said ""stop"".

Q. Did you actually turn your mind to the fact of her consenting?

A. Of course and her actions told that me she was completely happy to be there as I was.


	
	After intercourse, the appellant stayed in the laneway for some time using his phone before catching a taxi home.
	
	
	The appellant was taken to a series of telephone calls intercepted by police under warrant. The appellant was asked about one conversation with his father:
	


Q. Anyway, your Dad then asked you: “I know but that particular girl could that have possibly ended up going pear shaped”.

You say: “Look this is the one I thought it was”.

Your Dad says: “Right it was a hundred percent, a hundred percent, you didn't have any issues with her on the night"".

What did you take your Dad to be implying by issues?

A. Did she had have complaints about you, was there any drama did she get angry with you, anything like that.

Q. You say, ""No, no, no"" meaning?

A. Meaning that I had no inkling that she could have had a problem that – I thought everything, I knew everything was completely consensual.


	
	During cross-examination, the appellant said that he made the decision to take the complainant out into Hourigan Lane to have intercourse as opposed to a storeroom or other room including a bathroom within Soho as to which he had access. The appellant agreed that he was familiar with the lane and the location of CCTV cameras in that area as follows:
	


Q. There is some distance between those cameras on the residential building?

A. Yes.

Q. And the end of the lane; correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And there's no cameras at the end of the lane, is there?

A. No.

Q. The end of the lane is adjacent to a carpark; correct?

A. Yes. Lit car parks.

Q. And in the region of the end of the lane, when you say the end of the lane, do you mean the area where there was a brick wall at the end of the lane? If you are facing from the back door of Soho straight ahead you are effectively looking at a brick wall?

A. You are looking at a brick wall, yes.

Q. And the wooden fence is adjacent to that on your left if you are facing the wall?

A. Perpendicular - yeah, on my left, yes.

Q. And the roadway there is bitumen?

A. Yes.

Q. Some loose gravel?

A. I'm not sure.

Q. Why did you pick that location to stop with [the complainant]?

A. I thought it was a private area.

Q. Although it was opposite a lit car park?

A. Yes.

Q. You thought it was more private than anywhere in the club?

A. At that time I thought it was, it was, it would give me privacy that I don't think I would have got in the storeroom with people coming in and out of it.


	
	It was put to the appellant that as he and the complainant left Soho via the rear exit, she put her hand against a wall of the nightclub to steady herself, as the Crown suggested was shown in the CCTV compilation. The appellant did not agree that the complainant was steadying herself. The appellant gave evidence that he did not think she was affected by alcohol at that time.
	
	
	As to the complainant’s stockings and underwear being pulled down by the appellant as she tried to leave, the appellant said:
	


Q. You have heard [the complainant] give evidence that after she said that she had to go back to the club she took a step and you pulled her stockings down about three inches and that she pulled them up and said, ""No, I really have to go""?

A. She said that, yes.

Q. You recall that happening?

A. No, I do not.

Q. Could it have happened?

A. Absolutely not.

Q. And is it the case that you just don't recall whether that happened?

A. It definitely did not happen.


	
	The appellant denied using an aggressive or authoritative tone when he directed the complainant to put her hands on the fence and then to get onto her hands and knees on the ground, or that he felt frustrated or impatient. He said his tone of voice did not change. Her Honour asked the following question:
	


Q. Why did you tell her to turn around and put her hands on the fence?

A. At that time we were touching bodies and I'm not, I don't know, I asked her

to do that because I thought that it was leading to sex and I believe that she thought that as well by the way she bent over when I said that.


	
	The appellant said he did not tell the complainant why he wanted her to take up the position against the fence and there was no discussion with her about it. He said that he asked the complainant to get on to ground on her hands and knees to make penetration easier for both of them, after which he was asked the following questions:
	


Q. It was easier for her to be on the ground, in direct contact on the ground?

A. I thought the penetration would have been easier for both of us if she was on the ground. By ""penetration"" I mean sex.

Q. You've heard [the complainant] give evidence that she told you to stop?

A. I recall her saying that, yes.

Q. You recall her saying that shortly after you penetrated her?

A. She gave words to that effect, yes.

Q. Did you stop?

A. I did not stop because she never asked me to stop or never said ""stop"".

Q. You've heard [the complainant] give evidence that she repeatedly said, ""I have to go back and see my friend"" or words to that effect?

A. That's untrue.


	
	He said, save for the exchange about her being “tight”, there were no words exchanged between them at all during intercourse.
	


Ground One


	
	The obligation of the Court in considering whether a verdict of a jury is unreasonable or cannot be supposed having regard to the evidence is the subject of settled principle. The question the Court must ask itself was restated in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 where at [11] the majority (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) held that, in conformity with the approach by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, the question for the Court is:
	


… whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.


	
	The majority went on to say:
	


[12] This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""

[13] The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

[14] In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.


	
	In Kurdi v R [2011] NSWCCA 179, Bathurst CJ said at [8] that in order to comply with M v The Queen:
	


… it is necessary for the Court to review the whole of the evidence available to the jury. That is not to say that a court of appeal conducts its own trial. The question which it must answer is whether it was open to the jury to reach the verdict which it in fact reached. Further, as was pointed out in M v The Queen supra, the Court must pay full regard to the primacy of the jury as the fact-finding tribunal and to the fact that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the evidence.


	
	The appellant submits that the evidence at trial was deficient in proof of two of the three essential elements of the offence: the first that the complainant did not consent to anal intercourse, being the second element of which the jury needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt if they were to find the appellant guilty; and the second (assuming proof of the first), that the appellant either knew she was not consenting, or was reckless as to the fact or had no reasonable grounds for believing that she was consenting.
	


Did the Crown establish beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to anal intercourse?


	
	The appellant conceded that the complainant’s unambiguous evidence at trial was that she did not consent to anal intercourse. The appellant submitted however that the attack on her credit, in particular, what were said to be unexplained and material inconsistencies in the account she gave to her sister, police and a doctor within twelve hours of the incident, together with her behaviour on the night, including that she left the dance floor and went into a darkened laneway with a relative stranger within minutes of meeting him where she had anal intercourse, would satisfy this Court it that was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was giving truthful evidence when she said she did not consent to anal intercourse.
	
	
	In my assessment, having considered all of the complaint evidence, the terms of the complaint made to BW, (including BW’s description of how the complainant presented to her when they met at Kings Cross train station and during the train journey to Artarmon) and then the complaint made to the complainant’s sister and her friends later that morning, and how she presented at that time, were largely consistent. It follows that I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to come to the same conclusion.
	
	
	I have also considered the complainant’s explanation for what were suggested by the cross-examiner to be inconsistencies in the account she gave to the doctor and the police and the account she gave in her evidence as to how she came to be on her knees on the ground, and the potential for that evidence to have impacted adversely on her credit. While it was no part of her complaint to her friends or her sister, or her evidence at trial, that the appellant pushed her to the ground (see generally the summary of her evidence and the evidence of complaint in [25]-[63]), the doctor’s notes do record that the complainant said she was pushed to the ground. The doctor did not give evidence at the trial.
	
	
	I accept that whether or not the complainant told the doctor that she was pushed was relevant to whether the jury could accept her as a witness of truth. On my review of that aspect of the cross-examination, it was at least open to the jury to accept the complainant’s evidence that she did not tell the doctor that she was pushed, allowing for the possibility that it may have been a transcription error on the doctor’s part. That being so, I do not regard that issue, either alone or in combination with the other challenges to her reliability, as significantly undermining her credit.
	
	
	As regards the complainant’s account to police that she thought she told the accused to stop when he was attempting to penetrate her anus (a qualification the cross-examiner sought to highlight as operating adversely to her credit – see [74]), in my assessment the jury would have been entitled to find that the distinction the cross-examiner sought to make between her thinking she told him to stop (in her statement to police) and her telling him to stop (her evidence at trial), was not a distinction the significance of which the complainant appeared to appreciate. If the jury assessed her evidence in that way (as it was open for them to do) the inconsistency would not have undermined the weight of her evidence, expressed categorically at trial, that when she was on the ground she told the appellant to “Stop” when he persisted in the penetration of her anus.
	
	
	Finally, I have given consideration to the complainant’s explanation for allowing the appellant to penetrate her anus at all. In the appellant’s submission the jury should have made the assessment that everything about the complainant's conduct both inside Soho and in the laneway indicated she was a willing sexual partner and, for that reason, they should have had a reasonable doubt on the issue of her consent to anal intercourse. That submission fails to confront the conflict between the complainant’s evidence and the evidence of the appellant as to a series of events both inside and outside Soho. Even if the divergence between the two accounts might have raised a reasonable doubt as to the complainant’s truthfulness and reliability (which, for reasons I will develop later, in my assessment it does not) the submission fails to confront the question as to why the advantage the jury enjoyed in seeing and hearing the evidence was not capable of resolving that doubt.
	
	
	The explanation the complainant gave for participating in non-consensual anal intercourse whilst on her knees in a darkened laneway, was to the effect that although she kissed the appellant on the dance floor and may have had some body contact with him at that time, and although she willingly went into the laneway at his invitation (although it would seem in the expectation that she was being ushered to a VIP area) and willingly kissed the appellant when there, also possibly with some body contact, she did not consent to anal intercourse (or sexual intercourse at all) but unwillingly submitted to it, and the pain that it entailed, out of fear. In short, the complainant’s evidence was that the predicament in which she found herself, in part because she was intoxicated and in part because, as she described it in her evidence, she did not know what else to do, resulted in her submitting to the appellant’s vocal demands of her first to lean on the fence and then to get on the ground and to unwillingly submit to the anal intercourse that followed.
	
	
	In reviewing the complainant’s evidence, I have paid full regard to the primacy of the jury as the tribunal of fact and the advantage they are to be afforded when a verdict is under challenge as unreasonable by having seen and heard the complainant give her evidence, including how she dealt with the cross-examiner’s challenge to her veracity and her reliability.
	
	
	I have also given close consideration to what are said to be the concessions the complainant made in cross-examination operating to undermine her credit to the extent that this Court would have a reasonable doubt about her lack of consent for that reason. The concessions (so styled) included that she may have rubbed against the appellant’s body during the kissing that preceded intercourse; that she did not voice any resistance to the appellant directing her to turn and put her hands on the fence and then to get onto the ground on her hands and knees and arch her back, or show any reticence in doing so; that she did not say “no” before or during anal intercourse and that she may have pushed back towards the appellant during anal intercourse.
	
	
	Depending upon the assessment the jury made of the complainant’s demeanour in the atmosphere of the trial, and such assessment of her age, maturity and experience of the world they could make from the answers she gave and how she gave them, her concession that some things suggested to her “may” have happened in her various engagements with the appellant (including that she may have pushed back during intercourse) might not have been regarded by the jury as adverse to her credit but potentially as enhancing her credbility. That she did not categorically deny all of what was suggested to her by the cross-examiner may have been treated by the jury as an acceptance by her that some things may have happened, that is, she could not recall one way or the other with absolute certainty such as to allow her to truthfully deny them, as distinct from a concession by her that what was suggested to her as something she may possibly have said or done was something she in fact said or did.
	
	
	Even if the cross-examination may have caused the jury to have some concerns about whether she consented, in my assessment they were not such as to raise a reasonable doubt as to that issue after taking into account all the evidence bearing on the question of consent.
	
	
	As the Crown pointed out, it does not necessarily follow that if the complainant did “push back during intercourse”, that this was to facilitate penetration. It may equally have been an involuntary physical response or an attempt to make penetration more difficult, leaving it open to the jury to find either that she did not “push back” or, if she did, it was not to signal her consent. As the Crown pointed out in its submissions, it was not put to her by the cross-examiner that she pushed back to willingly engage with the appellant as he penetrated her.
	
	
	In my view, it was open to the jury to regard such concessions as they consider she made in cross-examination (itself a jury question) as not giving rise to the reasonable possibility that she did consent to anal intercourse. That she did not consent to anal intercourse was a position from which she did not retreat.
	
	
	There was a dispute at trial as to the extent of the complainant’s intoxication and whether it was “substantial” such as to invoke consideration by the jury of s 61HA(6)(a). That section provides:
	


The grounds on which it may be established that a person does not consent to sexual intercourse include:

(a)  if the person has sexual intercourse while substantially intoxicated by alcohol or any drug, …


	
	Even if the jury were not satisfied that she was intoxicated to a “substantial” degree for the purposes of s 61HA(6)(a), the amount of alcohol she consumed (whether it be sixteen alcoholic drinks or ten), and her evidence as to its likely effect at the time of her meeting the appellant and her sexual engagement with him minutes later, remained part of the evidence available to the jury in considering whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that she was not consenting. It was also relevant to proof of the appellant’s knowledge of that fact, including whether the Crown established the appellant had no reasonable grounds to believe she was consenting.
	
	
	I have also taken into account that, having seen and heard both the complainant and the appellant give their evidence, it was open to the jury to have accepted as truthful her rejection of the proposition put by the cross-examiner that upon being told by the appellant to put her name in his phone, her attitude towards him changed from being a willing and enthusiastic sexual partner to being a disgruntled and vengeful sexual partner. I also consider that it was open to the jury to have accepted as truthful her rejection of the proposition, also put in cross-examination, that she believed that the appellant had treated her as another sexual conquest and that it was that which motivated her to make a false complaint of sexual assault.
	
	
	After a critical review of the body of evidence to which I have referred and counsels submission about it, I am of the firm view that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to the anal intercourse the subject of the charge.
	


Did the Crown establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew the complainant was not consenting?


	
	The primary focus of the appellant’s arguments in support of the first ground of appeal was whether there was a sufficiency of evidence upon which the jury could have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew the complainant was not consenting, the third element of the offence the Crown was obliged to prove beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In summary, it was submitted that even were it open to the jury to be satisfied that the complainant was not in fact consenting, the evidence was incapable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt the appellant knew she was not consenting, or negativing the reasonable possibility that he believed on reasonable grounds she was consenting, and that the jury’s verdict cannot stand for that reason.
	
	
	The trial judge directed the jury that it was the Crown’s obligation to prove the appellant knew the complainant was not consenting to anal intercourse. In her Honour’s oral and written directions, she set out the three alternative ways in s 61HA(3)(a)-(c) that knowledge of lack of consent could be established at law: the appellant’s actual knowledge that she was not consenting; his being reckless as to that fact; or an absence of any reasonable grounds for him to honestly believe the complainant was consenting. The adequacy of her Honour’s directions as to the third of the alternate states of knowledge about consent are the subject of the second ground of appeal.
	
	
	In the appellant’s written submissions, the proposition was advanced that there was no evidence available to the jury to support the conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant actually knew the complainant was not consenting, the state of mind provided for in s 61HA(3)(a) of the Crimes Act. It was further submitted that there was no evidence to support the conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant realised there was a possibility that she was not consenting, but proceeded to have anal intercourse notwithstanding, or that he did not even consider whether or not she was consenting, the state of knowledge provided for in s 61HA(3)(b). Additionally, it was submitted that the evidence, taken as a whole, supported the conclusion, or at least raised a reasonable possibility that the Crown could not negative, that the appellant honestly believed, and on reasonable grounds, that the complainant was consenting to anal intercourse, the state of mind provided for in s 61HA(3)(c).
	
	
	The question whether the jury’s verdict is unreasonable is a question of fact. As the High Court emphasised in M v The Queen, the question whether there was any evidence to support the verdict (in this case by proof of the third element) is a question of law. That being so, I understand the appellant’s submission that there was “no evidence” to support proof of actual knowledge s 61HA(3)(a) or recklessness s 61HA(3)(b) to invite the Court to assess the adequacy and the quality of the evidence bearing upon proof of the alternate states of knowledge in s 61HA(3)(a)-(c).
	
	
	The Crown case at trial was that the jury would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting to anal intercourse, or that he was reckless as to that fact. In closing submissions the Crown drew the jury’s attention to a number of features of the complainant’s account of how the sexual intercourse occurred, and how the appellant behaved towards her immediately before and during the intercourse, which the jury were invited to accept as truthful and from which it would follow that the third element of the offence was proved beyond reasonable doubt, requiring them to return a verdict of guilty.
	
	
	In particular, the jury were invited to accept as truthful the complainant’s evidence that after kissing the appellant in the laneway for a time she made it clear that she wanted to return to her friend and, when she refused the appellant’s entreaties that she stay with him and turned to leave, that she was stopped by him putting his hands up her skirt and pulling down her stockings and underwear. They were also invited to reject the appellant’s denial that he acted that way. The Crown also urged the jury to accept the complainant’s evidence that on repeated occasions after her initial attempt to leave, including during intercourse, she said she wanted to go back to her friend which the appellant ignored. Although it was her evidence that after initially trying to leave she did not move away from the appellant in the direction of the door, or seek by any physical means to keep the appellant at bay, but instead that she complied with his directions (delivered aggressively) that she put her hands on the fence and then kneel on the ground and arch her back, the Crown invited to jury to accept that she acted in that way out of fear and some sense of bewilderment at her predicament, and that her submission to anal intercourse should be understood in that context.
	
	
	As further evidence that the appellant either knew she was not consenting or was reckless as to that fact, the jury were also reminded by the Crown that after the appellant described her as being “tight” (prompting her to tell him she was a virgin) the complainant said she asked the appellant to “Stop”, and that he said nothing in response as he continued to penetrate her anus.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown invited the jury to reject as untruthful the appellant’s evidence that from his first encounter with the complainant on the dance floor to his having anal intercourse with her shortly thereafter in the laneway, she presented to him as a willing, eager and enthusiastic sexual partner, and to reject as untruthful his denials that she ever told him to “Stop”, and as unpersuasive his attempt to account for the tone in which he recounted the incident to his friend by text message the following day.
	
	
	For reasons that are neither obvious from the Crown’s written submissions on the appeal nor express in its oral submissions, no issue was taken with the appellant’s contention that the evidence was incapable of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had actual knowledge that the complainant was not consenting. This was so, despite that being the Crown case at trial and despite it being the Crown case on the appeal that the complainant’s evidence alone proved beyond reasonable doubt that she did not in fact consent from which, if she were accepted as a witness of truth on all matters in dispute (including, in particular, that the appellant prevented her from leaving and ignored her telling him to “Stop”) would allow for the conclusion to be reached beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew she was not consenting
	
	
	Although on the appeal the Crown did submit the evidence was sufficient to prove the appellant was reckless as to whether the complainant was consenting, its submissions were primarily focused on meeting the appellant’s submission that this Court would be satisfied that the evidence supported the reasonable possibility that the appellant had an honest belief held on reasonable grounds, that she was consenting and that the verdict was unreasonable for that reason. It was the Crown’s submission that this Court would be satisfied that it was open to the jury, properly instructed, to reject as untrue the appellant’s evidence that he held that belief or, if it might possibly be true that he did believe she was consenting, there were no reasonable grounds for him to have held that belief.
	
	
	That the Crown has taken that approach on the appeal does not dictate that this Court should approach its independent review of the evidence in the same way. For my part, to do so would be contrary to the principled approach that should be adopted by this Court when there is a challenge to the integrity of a verdict under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Accordingly, if upon my review of the whole of the evidence at trial, I consider that it was open to the jury (who saw both the complainant and the appellant give their evidence) to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had actual knowledge that the complainant was not consenting to anal intercourse, or was reckless as to that fact, it would follow that I would dismiss the first ground of appeal.
	
	
	Consistent with the way the jury were directed, the question whether the evidence was capable of proving the appellant had actual knowledge of the absence of consent (or either of the two alternate states of mind in s 61HA(3)(b)-(c)), obliges this Court to consider all the circumstances bearing on that question including, as required by s 61HA(3)(d), any steps taken by the appellant to ascertain whether the complainant was consenting. As to that matter, it was common ground at trial that the appellant made no enquiry of the complainant before or during intercourse as to whether she was willing to have anal intercourse (or intercourse at all), or whether she was willing for him to proceed to try to achieve penetration when, even on his evidence, she expressed pain and declared that she was “a virgin”. It was his evidence that her words and actions gave him no reason to enquire as to whether she was consenting and that her demeanour only changed after intercourse when he told her to add her name to the list of names on his phone.
	
	
	Since the body of surrounding circumstances relied upon by the Crown at trial to prove actual knowledge were the same as those relied upon by the Crown on the appeal to prove recklessness and an absence of any belief held on reasonable grounds that the complainant was consenting, I am content to review the sufficiency and quality of the evidence in proof of the third element of the offence on the basis of the position that was taken by the Crown on the appeal.
	
	
	As I have already pointed out, in the circumstances of this case, the evidence available to the jury going to that question was the same body of evidence relevant to proof of the absence of consent with the jury directed to apply different legal tests to proof of the second and third elements.
	
	
	I have already considered that body of evidence in detail in the course of considering whether the appellant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove an absence of consent. I emphasised then, as I do now, that the contested questions of veracity and reliability that presented in this trial, including whether the complainant made any material concessions in the course of cross-examination, are quintessentially jury questions.
	
	
	I should however refer to one additional aspect of the evidence I have not dealt with. It was the appellant’s case that when he directed the complainant to put her hands on the fence he was intending to have vaginal intercourse but that he was unsuccessful (despite his evidence that she bent over and pointed her buttocks towards him), and that in response to him remarking as to her “tightness” and her telling him she was a virgin, he directed her to take up a position on the ground and arch her back where he attempted vaginal intercourse a second time before anal intercourse was achieved. This was relied upon as part of the surrounding circumstances serving to undermine the Crown case on both the second and third elements of the offence.
	
	
	Under cross-examination the complainant accepted that the appellant may have tried to penetrate her vagina whilst she was leaning on the fence. She was not asked to concede by the cross-examiner that she bent over and thrust her buttocks towards him (despite this being integral to the appellant’s case) and made no concession that the conversation about her being “tight” was other than when she was, as she described it, “on the ground”. While the jury were entitled to accept the possibility that vaginal intercourse was attempted at some point, since there were no questions directed to the complainant by the cross-examiner to invite her to concede that she consented to intercourse by that means, or that she pushed back with her buttocks to facilitate it, it is not open, in my view, for the appellant to invite this Court to find as a fact that it was conduct of the complainant preparatory to the anal intercourse that followed.
	
	
	After undertaking the requisite independent review of all the evidence at trial bearing upon the question of proof of the third element, and paying full regard to the opportunity the jury had of seeing and hearing the complainant and the appellant give their evidence, and for each to be challenged under cross-examination as to their honesty in recounting what was said and done in Soho and in the laneway (or not said or not done as the case may be), I am satisfied that the evidence allows for the jury to have concluded that the appellant was at least reckless as to whether the complainant was consenting to anal intercourse and to have concluded that was his state of mind when he had anal intercourse with her.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am satisfied that the evidence was not deficient in proof of the third element of the offence and, for that reason, that it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The first ground of appeal is dismissed.
	


Ground Two


	
	The trial judge’s oral directions of law were supplemented by written directions. The directions were comprehensive. They covered each of the three elements the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt if the jury were to find the appellant guilty. The jury were also directed as to how they should approach the question of proof of those elements referable to the evidence relied upon by the Crown to prove each the issues at trial as to the adequacy of proof raised by the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	While the written directions and oral directions were obviously not in identical terms, they were, substantially, to the same effect.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that only part of her Honour’s written and oral directions as to the applicable law were in error. In every other respect, it was accepted the directions were unassailable.
	
	
	As regards proof of the third element of the offence, the directions correctly identified the alternate ways in which knowledge concerning consent may be proved at law as provided for in s 61HA(3)(a)-(c) of the Crimes Act. Her Honour also directed the jury that it was the Crown’s obligation to prove beyond reasonable doubt either that the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting at the time of the anal intercourse, was reckless as to that fact, or that he had no reasonable grounds for believing that she was consenting.
	
	
	When the trial judge was reminding the jury of the appellant’s case on the question of his state of mind at the time of anal intercourse in her oral directions, she repeated the one aspect of the written directions said by the appellant to amount to a fundamental misdirection of law.
	
	
	In the written directions as concerns proof of the third element, her Honour said:
	


12. In relation to element iii., the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that [the complainant] did not consent to having penile-anal sexual intercourse with him. What you are concerned with here is the actual state of mind of the accused at the time of that sexual intercourse. It is not a question of what you yourself would have realised, thought or believed nor what a reasonable person would have realised, thought or believed.

13. Proof of this third element requires that you look at what was going on in the mind of the accused. It is not an impossible task to ask a jury to consider what was going on in the mind of an accused. In deciding this issue you can have regard to all the surrounding circumstances in which the act of penile-anal sexual intercourse occurred, including but not limited to, the relationship which existed between the accused and [the complainant] at the time of the intercourse, the accused's actions and/or words, [the complainant]'s actions and/or words, the nature of the act and the condition of [the complainant] at the time of the intercourse.

14. The Crown can succeed in proving the third element if it proves beyond reasonable doubt any one of the following states of knowledge. Namely, that

i. the accused knew that [the complainant] was not consenting to the act of penile-anal sexual intercourse, or

ii. the accused was reckless as to whether [the complainant] was consenting to the act of penile-anal sexual intercourse either because he,

a.   realised there was a possibility that [the complainant] was not consenting to the act of penile-anal sexual intercourse but went ahead and performed that act anyway, or

b.   the accused did not even think about whether [the complainant] was consenting to the act of penile-anal sexual intercourse (in other words, he did not care whether she was consenting or not), or

iii. the accused had no reasonable grounds for believing that [the complainant] was consenting to the act of penile-anal sexual intercourse.

15. When you are considering these alternate ways in which the Crown can prove this third element you must have regard to all of the circumstances that you find established by the evidence in which the act of penile-anal intercourse occurred, including any steps taken by the accused to ascertain whether [the complainant] was consenting to the act of penile-anal intercourse but you cannot take into account the fact that the accused himself might have been intoxicated.

16. If any one of these alternate states of knowledge are proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt, then the law provides that the accused is taken to have known that [the complainant] did not consent to the act of penile-anal sexual intercourse and the third element will have been established.


	
	There is no challenge to any part of the written directions to this point, the impugned direction is contained in the next paragraph:
	


17. Stated briefly, and in no way intending to capture all of what the accused said in his evidence, the accused’s position is that the penile-anal intercourse he had with [the complainant] was consensual and that her consent was evidenced by her actions. If you consider that [the complainant’s] actions caused a belief in the mind of the accused that she was consenting to penile-anal intercourse with him and you consider that such a belief was a reasonable one, then the third element would not have been proven.

[Emphasis added.]


	
	That part of the direction emphasised in bold was said on the appeal to be fundamentally flawed in two respects. First, it imposes an objective test of reasonableness of the appellant’s belief in consent and, second, it imposes an onus on the appellant to satisfy the jury that he believed the complainant was consenting.
	
	
	No redirection was sought by trial counsel. Although Rule 4 applies, at the hearing of the appeal the Crown did not oppose leave being granted. This concession was appropriate. Both the Crown and senior counsel for the appellant had approved the content of the written directions and neither counsel alerted her Honour to what is now said by the appellant to be an error when she repeated the written direction in the summing-up.
	
	
	The appellant referred the Court to the decision of O'Sullivan v R; Flanders v R; Tohu v R & NRH v R [2012] NSWCCA 45 as authority for what this Court has approved as the direction a jury is to be given where proof of the absence of consent is an element of the offence.
	
	
	In that case, it was submitted on the appellant’s behalf that the test in s 61HA(3)(c) was not a completely objective test. Rather, the subjective element (that is the claim to having an honest belief in consent) was to be tested against whether there were reasonable grounds to hold it. Davies and Garling JJ said:
	


[124] … Decisions in relation to the test for self-defence such as Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) (1987) 162 CLR 645 and Re Conlon (1993) 69 A Crim R 92, were called in aid. It was submitted that the meaning to be given to the words in the statute ought to be seen in the light of the use of similar words in other areas of the criminal law such as self-defence. In Zecevic the Court said that where self-defence is raised the question to be asked is whether the accused believed on reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did. In Conlon Hunt CJ at CL said (at 98):

But it is clear from the formulation of the issue in Zecevic v DPP that it is the belief of the accused, and not that of the hypothetical reasonable person in the position of the accused, which has to be reasonable.”

[125] His Honour said in his written directions:

""Knew she was not consenting"" - There are three ways that the Crown can prove that [NRH] knew that [JS] was not consenting:

1) by establishing that at the time of the act he actually knew she was not consenting: or

2) by establishing that at the time of the act he was reckless as to whether she was consenting.

To establish that the accused was acting recklessly, the Crown must prove, beyond reasonable doubt, either:

(a) the accused's state of mind was such that he simply failed to consider whether or not [JS] was consenting at all, and Just went ahead with the act performed, even though the risk that she was not consenting would have been obvious to someone with the accused's mental capacity if he had turned his mind to it, or

(b) the accused's state of mind was such that he realized the possibility that [JS] was not consenting but went ahead regardless of whether she was consenting or not.

If the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the accused at the time of the act was reckless as to whether [JS] consented to the act, then it is the law that the accused is taken to know that she did not consent to the act.

3) by establishing that at the time of the sexual intercourse he had no reasonable ground for believing that [JS] consented to the sexual intercourse.

For the purpose of determining whether the accused [NRH] knew she was not consenting to the sexual intercourse you must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including any steps taken by [NRH] to ascertain whether she was consenting to the sexual intercourse.

It is the accused's actual knowledge of the lack of consent with which you are concerned. You might therefore ask how the Crown can prove that the accused was aware that [JS] did not consent without an admission from the accused to that effect The Crown asks you to infer or conclude from other facts that it has set out to prove that the accused must have known and that he did indeed know that [JS] was not consenting.

In a situation where the complainant does not in fact consent, the accused's state of mind at the time of the act of intercourse might be that he actually knew that she was not consenting. That is a guilty state of mind for this offence. If the Crown satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt that this was the state of mind of the accused at the time of the act of intercourse, then the third element of the charge has been made out.

On the other hand, you may decide that he might have believed, although wrongly, that [JS] was consenting to intercourse with him. Whether that belief amounts to a guilty state of mind depends upon whether the accused honestly held it and, if so, whether he had reasonable grounds for that belief. Therefore if you are not satisfied that the accused knew the complainant wasn't consenting, the Crown must prove one of two facts before you can find the accused guilty: either (a) that the accused did not honestly believe that the complainant was consenting or (b) that, if he did have an honest belief in consent, that he had no reasonable grounds for that belief.

It is for the Crown to prove that the accused had a guilty mind, and so if there is the reasonable possibility that the accused did honestly believe on reasonable grounds that [JS] was consenting, then you would have to find that this third element of the offence is not made out, and return a verdict of ""not guilty "" of this charge.

In determining whether the Crown has proved that the accused actually knew that the complainant was not consenting to intercourse with him you must take into account what steps were actually taken by the accused to ascertain whether the complainant was consenting to intercourse.

(emphasis added)

[126] It is apparent from these directions that the jury was given a construction of s 61HA consistent with what was said in Zecevic and Conlon. The Trial Judge said in that regard:

Whether that belief amounts to a guilty state of mind depends upon whether the accused honestly held it and, if so, whether he had reasonable grounds for that belief.

His directions followed carefully those set out in the Bench Book. There can be no criticism of them.


	
	In the present case the appellant submitted that the impugned direction wrongly directed the jury that the third element of the offence would not be proved unless the appellant had satisfied them by his evidence that he believed in the complainant’s consent and only then if the jury were satisfied that his belief was reasonable.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that while the directions given by the trial judge in O’Sullivan might be more cogently worded than her Honour’s directions, when her Honour’s directions are reviewed in the context of the summing up as a whole and in the context of the written directions as a whole, this Court would not conclude that the impugned direction inverted the onus of proof.
	
	
	In the Crown’s submission, that is borne out by what follows immediately after the impugned direction in the written directions:
	


18. I expect you are wondering how the Crown can prove what the accused knew at the time of his actions in the absence of a spoken admission from him in that regard. The Crown is entitled to seek to prove this third element relating to the accused's knowledge or state of mind by asking you to draw an inference or conclusion from all of the facts and circumstances the Crown has set out to prove, either, that the accused actually knew that [the complainant] was not consenting or that he was reckless as to whether she was consenting or that he did not honestly believe [the complainant] was consenting or if he did, he had no reasonable grounds to hold such a belief.

19. Understand that before you can infer or conclude that the accused had one of these guilty states of mind, you must be satisfied that such a conclusion is the only rational inference or conclusion you can draw from all of the facts and circumstances you find proven by the evidence. That is because before you can draw an inference or conclusion against the accused, you must be satisfied that the inference or conclusion you seek to draw is both reasonable and justified. It is therefore important that you examine carefully any possible inference you seek to draw to ensure it is both reasonable and justified.

20. Furthermore, understand that the drawing of an inference or a conclusion from one or more established facts or circumstances to find that another fact or circumstance is proved, involves a logical and rational process of reasoning. You must not draw inferences or conclusions based upon mere speculation, guess work, hunch, suspicion or supposition.

21. In deciding whether this third element has been proved by the Crown, you can have regard to all the surrounding circumstances in which the act of penile-anal sexual intercourse occurred, including but not limited to, the relationship which existed between the accused and [the complainant] at the time of the intercourse, the accused's actions and/or words, [the complainant]'s actions and/or words, the nature of the act and the condition of [the complainant] at the time of the intercourse.

[Emphasis added.]


	
	In the summing up her Honour elaborated on the written directions when she said:
	


I expect you are wondering how the Crown can prove what an accused person knew at the time he or she does something in the absence of a spoken admission from that person saying loud [sic] what was going on in their mind at a particular time?

The Crown is entitled to seek to prove this third element relating to the accused's knowledge or state of mind by asking you to draw an inference or conclusion from all the facts and circumstances the Crown has set out to prove either that the accused actually knew [the complainant] was not consenting, or he was reckless as to whether she was consenting, or that he did not honestly believe she was consenting, or if he did he had no reasonable grounds to hold such a belief. ""

[Emphasis added]


	
	Very shortly afterward, her Honour said:
	


As you are aware, the central dispute in the trial is whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that [the complainant] did not consent to penile-anal sexual intercourse, that is element 2, and whether the Crown has established the accused knew she was not consenting, that is element 3. 

[Emphasis added.]


	
	There is some force in the Crown submission that in light of her Honour’s repeated directions that the Crown bore the onus of proof of the third element the jury could not have understood the impugned direction to have suggested otherwise. I also accept that one way of interpreting her Honour’s reference in the written direction to the complainant’s actions “causing the appellant to have a belief that she was consenting” was to remind the jury that it was the appellant’s case (either in cross-examination of the complainant or his evidence) that he believed she was consenting, not that she was directing them that it was for the appellant to prove that fact.
	
	
	The Crown submitted (correctly) that, properly understood, s 61HA(3)(c) does impose an objective test, in the sense that (ignoring the onus of proof) the grounds which might lead to a belief of consent must be objectively reasonable. However, this is not the equivalent of the trial judge’s direction that it was for the jury to “consider whether such a belief [that the complainant was consenting] was a reasonable one”. The latter formulation implies that the jury should ask what a reasonable person might have concluded about consent, rather than what the accused himself might have believed in all the circumstances in which he found himself and then test that belief by asking whether there might have been reasonable grounds for it. In many such contestsed cases, perhaps all, there might be a reasonable possibility of the existence of reasonable grounds for believing (mistakenly) that the complainant consented and other reasonable grounds suggesting otherwise. A reasonable person might conclude one way or the other but the statutory test is whether the Crown has proved the accused “has no reasonable grounds for believing” that there was consent. I observe in passing that, in the context of self-defence, the real distinction between what a reasonable person might believe and what the accused might have reasonably believed in all the circumstances, though on the surface perhaps somewhat finer than that to which I have adverted, was the emphasis by Mason J (as his Honour then was) in Viro v R [1978] HCA 9; 141 CLR 88 at 146.
	
	
	Although the appellant’s counsel accepted that the main focus of senior counsel’s closing submissions to the jury was the complainant’s unreliability, it remained incumbent on the trial judge to direct the jury that it was for the Crown to negative any reasonable possibility that the appellant believed (even if wrongly) that she was consenting. It was also incumbent on the trial judge to direct the jury that, in considering whether there were reasonable grounds for that belief as the statutory test requires.
	
	
	Having concluded that her Honour’s directions as to how the jury were to approach their consideration of the appellant’s state of mind were in error, it is not necessary to determine the third particular of Ground 2, namely that the directions failed to detail or explain the evidentiary basis for the appellant’s claim to have reasonably believed that the complainant had consented.
	


Orders


	
	In the event that the first ground of appeal failed, the appellant accepted that he could not resist an order for a retrial under s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Accordingly, I would propose the following orders:
	


1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal allowed.

3. Conviction quashed.

4. Order a new trial.

		09 May 2017",2016-04-11 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769200,Turner v Wheeler (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 431,"judgment


	
	This is a decision on costs following my decision in Turner v Wheeler [2016] NSWSC 345 handed down 31st March 2016. That decision concerned an application for the grant of leave to appeal from an interlocutory order of a of Queanbeyan Local Court magistrate on 2nd April 2015 refusing Ms Turner’s application to withdraw her plea of guilty in respect of 26 of 84 counts of larceny by a servant contrary to s 156 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	I found in favour of the plaintiff, Ms Turner, leave was granted; the appeal was allowed; the decision to refuse Ms Turner’s application to withdraw her pleas of guilt set aside; and the matter remitted for re-determination. I made a costs order in the following terms:
	


“ …(6) The defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the appeal on the ordinary basis forthwith after they have been agreed or assessed.”


	
	There is disagreement between the parties as to the appropriateness of this form of order. I adjourned the matter to permit learned counsel to provide written submissions on the issue.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant Mr McGorey argues that I am not empowered to make an order in the form set out at [2] above. He argues that as these proceedings are criminal rather than civil proceedings, an order as to costs cannot be made under s 98 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). He further argues that neither am I empowered, for the same reason, to order an assessment of costs under s 353)(3) Legal Procession Act 2004 (NSW) (Repealed) but which continues to apply to proceedings such as these commenced before 1st July 2015: cl 59 Legal Profession Uniform Law Application Regulation 2015. Rather, the power as to costs is derived from s 55(3)(a) and s 72 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). The latter provision requires a time stipulation for payment is to be specified in costs order made under the Act. There is no express power to refer the matter to a costs assessor.
	
	
	Section 3 of the Civil Procedure Act defines “criminal proceedings” as “proceedings against a person for an offence (whether summary or indictable)” and then goes on to enumerate a non-exhaustive list of such proceedings, including, inter alia, committal proceedings. Civil proceedings are defined as “any proceedings other than “criminal proceedings”. Mr McGorey submits that the appeal before the court is an appeal from an interlocutory order made in summary criminal proceedings, and is therefore caught by the definition of “criminal proceedings”.
	
	
	Ms Kluss for the plaintiff argues that the proceedings before this Court are separate from the criminal proceedings before the Local Court. The proceedings in this court were initiated by way of summons, the matter listed in the Civil Division and furthermore are interlocutory- not a process enumerated under s 3 as a type of processes caught within the definition of ‘criminal proceedings’. Ms Kluss further relies upon the decision of Hall J Ward v Zimmer (No 2)[2015] NSWSC 1097, at [25]:
	


“I do not accept the plaintiff’s submission that the appeal and the Local Court proceedings are so intrinsically linked as to be considered as together constituting one set of proceedings and that events in the Local Court should inform the costs order made in relation to the appeal to this Court. My consideration of the appropriate costs order to be made is, as such, confined to the conduct of the appeal proceedings before me..”


	
	With all due respect to learned counsel, the submission put forward is not supported by this passage. The words of Hall J were directed towards a question of whether the conduct of a party in the proceedings before the Local Court bore upon the decision as to costs of the appeal to the Supreme Court. Whilst it is true that the current proceedings are managed and heard in the civil list of the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court, this is more an accident of practice or, perhaps, history. The list of types of proceedings in s 3 furthermore is not exhaustive. The omission of this specific type of appeal from the definition is inadequate to support the argument that appeals from interlocutory orders in summary criminal proceedings are not therefore criminal proceedings.
	
	
	The proceedings below are criminal proceedings, and in my judgment an appeal under s 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act is also a criminal proceeding as defined by s 3 Civil Procedure Act. These current proceedings are criminal proceedings. The proper source of the power to order costs is therefore, as argued by Mr McGorey, s 55(3)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, subject to s 72.
	
	
	Before turning to these provisions, in deference to the arguments of counsel it is convenient to say something about another source of a power to order costs in these proceedings brought to my attention by counsel: s 23 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW); see Bimson, Roads & Maritime Services v Damorange Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2014] NSWSC 827 at [3] and [35]. For the reasons given below, it is not necessary to further consider this provision in this case.
	
	
	Section 55(3)(a) provides that the Court may make such order as it thinks fit when determining an appeal. This power has been construed to include a power to order costs. When considering the power to award costs in criminal proceedings, Spigelman CJ in Regina v JS (No 2)[2007] NSWCCA 309; 179 A Crim R 10 at [12]- [13] held:
	


“At common law, and traditionally, costs were not awarded in criminal proceedings. (See e.g. Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534 esp at 557; R v Mosely (1992) 28 NSWLR 735 at 738-740; R v Goia (1988) 19 FCR 212 at 213-214; R v Scott (1993) 42 FCR 1 at 11-13.)

13 Subsequently, provisions empowering a Court to award costs in a criminal case have been adopted in a range of contexts. Courts have become more familiar with awarding costs in such cases and, accordingly, have manifested a preparedness to interpret a provision conferring a power in general terms, such as a power to make any order that the Court thinks fit, as encompassing a power to award costs.” 


	
	Section s 55(3)(a) then empowers the Court to order costs when disposing of an appeal. The question remains whether this includes a power to order a costs assessment. To my mind, s 55(3)(a) must be read with s 72 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act which, materially, is in the following terms:
	


72 Orders for costs

An appeal court that orders an appellant or respondent to pay costs:

(b) must state a time within which the costs or other amount must be paid.

This section stipulates that a time must be fixed for costs to be paid. Importantly for present purposes it does not provide for the power to order an assessment of costs.


	
	Section 353 of the Legal Profession Act 2004 is in the following terms:
	


353 Application for assessment of party/party costs

(1) A person who has paid or is liable to pay, or who is entitled to receive or who has received, costs as a result of an order for the payment of an unspecified amount of costs made by a court or a tribunal may apply to the Manager, Costs Assessment for an assessment of the whole of, or any part of, those costs.

(2) A court or tribunal may direct the Manager, Costs Assessment to refer for assessment costs payable as a result of an order made by the court or tribunal. Any such direction is taken to be an application for assessment duly made under this Division.

(3) An application or direction under this section may not be made in relation to costs arising out of criminal proceedings in a court except as provided by section 257G of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

(4) An application or direction under this section may be made in relation to an application for and the issue of an apprehended violence order within the meaning of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007.

It provides for the right of parties to apply to the Manager, Costs Assessments for an assessment in relation to an order for an unspecified amount of party and party costs. Sub-section (3) restricts this in criminal proceedings except, as provided for by s 257G of the Criminal Procedure Act 2004 (NSW). Section 257G applies to costs orders made in summary proceedings in the Supreme Court and other higher courts only, and hence does not apply in this case. No power to order a costs assessment therefore arises in this case derived from either s 353 or s 257G.


	
	Ms Kluss of counsel argues that while s 72 requires that the order must specify a time for payment, it does not necessarily follow that an order for costs ‘as agreed or assessed’ is inappropriate. She relies upon the decision of Button J in Cunningham v Cunningham (No 2) [2012] NSWSC 954 following Brereton J in Maritime Authority of NSW v Nikolai Rofe [2012] NSWSC 5; 84 NSWLR 51. Both decisions consider s 72 of the Act. In applying that provision, Brereton J at [130] said:
	


“Section 72 of that Act provides that an Appeal Court that orders an appellant or respondent to pay costs must state a time within which the costs must be paid. That poses difficulties in circumstances where, unless the costs are agreed, they will have to be assessed. Nonetheless, I can comply with that section by stating a time relative to the issue of a certificate of assessment.”

Ms Kluss argues from this that nothing in s 72 prevents a costs assessment being ordered.


	
	With respect to my learned colleagues who think differently, I am not convinced that I am empowered to order an assessment of the costs of these proceedings. The right to have disputed costs assessed is an express statutory right confined by the terms in which it is granted. The terms of s 353 dealing with party and party of the Legal Profession Act make clear that it is not merely an adjunctive power to a statutory power to award costs found elsewhere. In terms it does not apply to criminal proceedings, it does not apply here therefore, and counsel have not identified any other head of power which is applicable.
	
	
	I do not except that, as a matter of interpretation, as Mr McGorey argued, s 72 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act requires an appeal court to specify the amount of costs payable when pronouncing a costs order. On the other hand as a matter of practicality there being no access to the costs assessment regime, any dispute about the amount of ordered costs can only be resolved by a court order for lump-sum payment. I will grant liberty to apply in the event that the parties are unable to reach agreement. The power of the court to fix the amount of costs is implicit in its power to award them.
	
	
	The broad ancillary powers contained in s 55(3) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act and the plenary power conferred by s 23 of the Supreme Court Act, do not operate as proverbial blank cheques authorising orders contrary to the express provisions of applicable legislation. Section 72 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides for a specific form of a costs order stipulating a time within which costs are to be paid. Section 353 Legal Profession Act provides for the resolution of disputes about party and party costs by costs assessment but it specifically excludes cases such as the one before me from the regime it establishes. Neither s 55 nor s 23 authorise an order for costs to be assessed contrary to the express terms of s 353.
	
	
	I therefore make the following orders:
	



	
	Revoke order 6 pronounced on 31 March 2016.
	
	
	Defendant to pay the Plaintiff’s costs within 28 days of them being ascertained by agreement or further order.
	
	
	Reserve liberty to the plaintiff to apply for a lump sum cots order in default of agreement being reached within 56 days.

2769223,R v Thomson [2016] NSWCCA 56,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

On 28 September 2015 Williams SC DCJ sentenced the respondent for a Commonwealth offence and State offences. The offences were charged by way of two separate indictments as follows:

First Indictment


	
	Conspiracy (between 18 August 2011 and 20 January 2012) to import a border-controlled drug (commercial quantity – 3.96kgs pure cocaine; 1.3kgs pure methamphetamine; 2.25kgs pure MDMA; 3.79kgs pure PMMA). This was an offence contrary to ss 11.1(5) and 307.1(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) for which the maximum penalty was life imprisonment.
	
	
	Possess (on 19 January 2012) a prohibited weapon (taser) – with a further offence (supply prohibited drug on 19 January 2012) taken into account on a Form 1 under s 32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). These were offences contrary to s 7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW) and s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The maximum penalty for the weapons offence was imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 3 years.
	


Second Indictment

Supply (between 27 September 2011 and 5 October 2011) a prohibited drug (large commercial quantity – 1.97kgs methylamphetamine). This was an offence contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) for which the maximum penalty was life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years.


	
	The respondent was sentenced in respect of the offences on these two indictments as follows:
	



	
	Conspiracy to import a border-controlled drug – imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7½ years commencing 19 January 2012 and expiring 18 July 2019 with a balance of term of 6½ years expiring 18 January 2026.
	
	
	Possess a prohibited weapon (with Form 1 supply offence) and large commercial supply of methylamphetamine – an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years commencing 19 January 2013 and expiring 18 January 2019 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring 18 January 2022. The indicative sentences were imprisonment for 8 years in respect of the supply offence and imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months in respect of the possess prohibited weapon offence.
	



	
	The effect of those sentences is that the sentence of imprisonment in respect of the State offences was wholly concurrent with that imposed in respect of the Commonwealth offence.
	
	
	The Crown has appealed against those sentences on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – His Honour erred in ordering that the sentences for State offences for which the offender was being sentenced, be served wholly concurrently with the Commonwealth sentence.

Ground 2 – The sentence was manifestly inadequate.

Particulars:

(a)   His Honour failed to have due regard to the nature and seriousness of the offending;

(b)   His Honour failed to have due regard to general and specific deterrence;

(c)   His Honour failed to have due regard to totality in sentencing; and

(d)   His Honour erred in giving undue weight to the offender’s subjective circumstances.

Ground 3 – His Honour erred in failing to indicate non-parole periods for the State offences in accordance with s 54B(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).

Factual background

Conspiracy to import commercial quantity of drugs and possession of taser.


	
	The conspiracy involved a plan to import packages containing drugs. The drugs were to be smuggled inside a metal “after market” supporting frame of an industrial oven, but authorities in Canada detected the drugs and removed them before the oven was shipped from Canada. The oven arrived in Sydney on 7 January 2012, and was seized by Australian Federal Police.
	
	
	The respondent had been in Canada between about 19 August and about 25 September 2011. After his return to Australia on 27 September 2011, he made calls to several telephone numbers in Canada.
	
	
	On 3 January 2012 (shortly before the oven arrived by air freight in Sydney), a man named Robert Weller (Weller) (an associate of the respondent) leased a storage unit at Storage City, West Gosford, using the name of another associate, Richard Jansson. The respondent and Weller were in contact (both by phone and in person) with each other around this time, and remained in contact until their arrest on 19 January 2012.
	
	
	After seizing the oven, police prepared 14 substitute packages (to match the packages of drugs seized in Canada) and put them into the frame of the oven, so as to resemble its original condition prior to detection. The oven and frame were placed onto the original timber pallet, and secured with three packing straps, which had been present on the shipment before its interception by police in Canada. After re-constructing the shipment, police released it to a freight forwarding company (Specific Freight) so that it could be delivered to the address on the Airway bill (Mr George Tourvas, at ""Prospero's"" Restaurant, The Entrance, Central Coast, NSW).
	
	
	On 9 January 2012 Weller made arrangements with a furniture removalist to move the oven from Prospero's Restaurant to the storage unit at West Gosford. On 10 January, the respondent met with Weller and then with George Tourvas (Tourvas) (the Consignee named on the Airway bill), at Prospero's Restaurant. At about 2.35pm (during the meeting with the respondent), Tourvas spoke by telephone with someone at Specific Freight and gave them an email address (rweller@live.com.au) to which invoices and Customs documents relating to the oven could be sent. At 2.36pm that day, Specific Freight sent an email to that address, which attached invoices for freight and other charges ($2,606.99) relating to the shipment. Shortly after that email was sent, the respondent left the restaurant and went to the public library at The Entrance, where he used a library computer to view the Specific Freight email and print the attached documents. Shortly after this, Weller deposited $2,607 into the bank account nominated by Specific Freight. Weller met up with the respondent about an hour later.
	
	
	On that same day (10 January 2012) a Controlled Operation Authority was issued to facilitate the controlled delivery of the consignment. The next day, 11 January 2012, Weller attended Active Hire at West Gosford and also spoke by telephone to the respondent about a ""place with forklifts"". Weller and the respondent agreed to meet later that morning.
	
	
	During the afternoon, Weller attended Hornsby Police Station and told police that he was involved in the importation of drugs in an industrial oven. Police advised Weller that, in order to facilitate his co-operation, they would need to apply for a Controlled Operation Authority, which would take some days, and that until then, he would be criminally liable for his actions in relation to the shipment.
	
	
	On 12 January 2012 a forklift (which had been arranged by Weller) was delivered at the back of Prospero's Restaurant. Weller took delivery of the forklift just after 9am and was in contact (by telephone and two-way radio) with the respondent both before and after delivery. The respondent was seen at this time to be driving close to the restaurant and at times stopped in locations which provided a view of the back of the restaurant. At about 11.15am, Weller took delivery of the oven at the restaurant, and then unpacked it, removing the three packing straps. The respondent was seen by police travelling past the rear of the restaurant at about this time. At about 11.56am the removalists (arranged by Weller) arrived at the back of Prospero's Restaurant and were spoken to by Weller. Soon after, the respondent was seen in a car at the back of the restaurant, where he was spoken to by Weller. The oven was then loaded on to a truck by the removalists and taken to the storage unit at West Gosford.
	
	
	Shortly after this, the respondent spoke by telephone with Weller. During the conversation, the respondent asked Weller (a number of times) to confirm that there were three straps still attached to the oven when it was delivered. Weller confirmed that the three straps were still in place. The next day (13 January 2012) the respondent met with Weller, after which Weller attended the storage unit, where he placed a padlock on the roller door of the unit where the oven was located. On 14 January 2012 the respondent was seen in a car being driven past the storage unit building. The respondent and Weller also met on 16 and 18 January 2012.
	
	
	On 19 January 2012, Weller spoke with the respondent, who said that he had ""the keys"" and they arranged to meet at West Gosford in half an hour. Shortly after this call, Weller hired equipment, including an angle grinder and a crow bar, and met briefly with the respondent. Weller then went to the storage unit, where he removed the oven from its supporting frame and used tools to cut into the frame. At around this time the respondent had a telephone conversation with Weller in which reference was made to ""a cooker"". The respondent was seen to drive past the storage unit on two occasions. Weller cut the frame into sections, some of which he placed into a car. He then placed the oven back into the unit, and called the respondent, who agreed to meet him at The Entrance in about an hour.
	
	
	Weller was arrested shortly after this telephone call. In his car, police found two sections which had been cut from the frame, one of which contained a substituted package of ""drugs"". Weller was also in possession of some diagrams and some typed and handwritten instructions on how to cut the frame in order to get access to the drugs. The respondent's handwriting, and fingerprints were found on the page of instructions.
	
	
	Police entered the respondent's home and arrested him and another man (Dong). A search of the respondent's premises and car located a number of items, including the following:
	


A notebook which, after forensic examination, revealed the respondent's handwriting (as well as his fingerprints and those of Weller) which referred to ""drugs"", and a ""6 burner stove for Prospero's"".

A shipping invoice (relating to the oven).

A USB device which contained copies of the Master Airway Bill and other documents referring to the shipment and storage of the oven.

An orange cardboard folder from Storage City, which contained various documents (with fingerprints of the respondent and Weller on many of them) relating to the shipment as well as notes from the notebook referred to above.


	
	The taser was found by police under a cushion in the lounge room of the respondent’s home. A box containing 10 taser cartridges with “darts” was also found by police.
	


Form 1 offence


	
	Police searching the respondent’s home found a number of plastic resealable bags of cocaine. Three bags (57.3gms, 90.8gms, 1gm) were found inside a safe. A fourth bag (0.2gms) was found on a bedside table. The total quantity of cocaine seized was 149.3gms gross weight 95.4gms pure weight. Police also found a packet of bicarbonate of soda on the bedside table and two sets of digital scales, one of which contained traces of cocaine.
	


Large commercial supply of methylamphetamine


	
	This offence was detected in the course of an investigation of an Asian crime syndicate. The investigation was conducted by various police agencies and Customs. It occurred between July 2011 and March 2012. In the course of that investigation police conducted surveillance of two Asian males – Truong and Van.
	
	
	On 3 October 2011 Truong and Van flew from Melbourne to Sydney. Truong was in possession of a black roller suitcase. After arriving in Sydney, the two men travelled to Gosford, during which time they remained in contact by telephone with other suspected members of the crime syndicate. After arriving in Gosford, Truong and Van met with the respondent at a hotel. During the meeting, the respondent gave the men a box (in wrapping paper) which contained 2kgs of ""ice"" (high grade methylamphetamine). Telephone conversations being monitored by police (involving other members of the suspected syndicate) suggested that an amount of $20,000 had been paid by the men as (at least a part) payment for the 2kgs of ice.
	
	
	After receiving the drugs from the respondent, Truong and Van left Gosford and returned to Sydney where a ticket was purchased for Truong to travel to Melbourne by bus. On 4 October 2011 Truong boarded the bus in Sydney and placed the black roller bag into the cargo hold. On his arrival in Melbourne the next morning (5 October 2011), Truong was arrested and the black bag seized.
	
	
	Inside the bag, police found a package, contained within wrapping paper in which there were four resealable plastic bags, each containing about 500gms of ""ice"". The total gross weight of ice (with a purity between 90-100%) was 1971.4gms. The estimated value of the drugs was between $260,000 (""wholesale"") and $3,000,000 (""street"" value).
	
	
	The respondent's fingerprints were detected on the inside of the package wrapping and on the resealable plastic bags of ice. The respondent was formally ""arrested"" on 14 March 2014 in relation to this supply offence while he was in custody at the Silverwater Correctional Centre for the conspiracy to import offence.
	
	
	Two indictments came into existence due to the following circumstances. The respondent was arrested on 19 January 2012 and charged with the conspiracy to import offence and the supply prohibited drug offence (which was later put onto a Form 1). On 7 September 2012 he was charged with the prohibited weapon offence. The respondent was subsequently committed for trial and a trial date (with two co-accused – Dong and Tourvas) set for 21 October 2013 in relation to the conspiracy to import charge. On the first day set for trial, the respondent indicated an intention to plead guilty to the conspiracy and the prohibited weapon offences and to acknowledge guilt in relation to the supply offence.
	
	
	On the next day (22 October 2013) the respondent entered pleas of guilty to the two offences on the “first indictment” and signed the Form 1. However, at that time, the respondent had been informed that he would also be charged with a further offence of supply (large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine) and on 14 March 2014 (when the respondent was in custody) he was charged with that offence. He subsequently entered a plea of guilty to that offence in the Local Court and was committed for sentence. This offence became the subject of the second indictment.
	


Proceedings in District Court


	
	The respondent did not give evidence. Evidence was given by AVL from Canada by the respondent's mother.
	
	
	The Agreed Facts set out the value of the drugs which comprised the conspiracy to import offence as follows. The six blocks of cocaine had a purity of 65 - 70% with a wholesale value of $1,180,000 and a street value of between $2.83 million and $3.16 million. The two packages of methamphetamine had a purity of between 66 - 76% with a wholesale value of $413,600 and a street value of about $1.32 million. The six blocks of MDMA had a purity of between 16 - 20%. This and the MDMA were likely to have been converted to tablets and sold as Ecstasy and would have produced between 50,000 - 120,000 tables with a wholesale value of between $386,000 and $1.57 million and a street value of between $967,000 and $4.232 million.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the evidence before him included a pre-sentence report, references from the respondent’s mother and a family friend and a handwritten letter from the respondent. His Honour found that although the history in the pre-sentence report was not verified, or adopted on oath by the respondent, his Honour was satisfied that the history was reasonably accurate. This was because of the evidence given by his “mother and the other circumstances in the case”.
	
	
	His Honour summarised the respondent’s subjective case as follows. He was a single male, born in Cairns but he grew up mainly in Victoria in British Columbia. His parents had divorced and his mother had left Australia with the two children to escape a violent, alcoholic and mentally ill husband. The respondent had lived in Canada for about 17 years and then returned to Australia when he was about 19 or 20 at which time he made an unsuccessful attempt to establish a meaningful contact with his father.
	
	
	The respondent had been in a relationship, which produced a son, when he was aged 25. The respondent left school after Year 11 having been expelled for smoking cannabis and for truancy. He had worked in manual tasks, including work as a groundsman and handyman, and then in various roles in the hospitality industry as a kitchen hand or chef when he came to Australia. He had stopped working due to his drug use. His drug use included using alcohol at age 5 and being hospitalised for alcohol poisoning at age 11. He started using cannabis at the age of nine and by 12 years was a heavy user. At the age of 13 he went on to LSD, mushrooms and then crack cocaine at the age of 16. He was addicted by the time he was 19. He attended a rehabilitation facility in Canada but was asked to leave after a few days.
	
	
	His Honour accepted that the respondent had made efforts to address his addictions and that he had completed twelve sessions of an addictive behaviour program while in custody. His Honour noted that the respondent had started using ice at the age of 18 and at the age of 26 started using heroin. The respondent said that he was never a particularly heavy user of ice, but was using any drug that became available by the time of his arrest. His Honour accepted that the respondent had been clear of drugs while in custody. The only part of the respondent’s history recorded in the pre-sentence report which his Honour declined to accept, was his assertion that his offending behaviour was intended to fund his own drug habit and to make a small profit in order to pay off his debts to dealers. His Honour found:
	


“In view of the relatively sophisticated operation and the amount of drugs ultimately detected, I am unable to accept that history, particularly where it was not verified and subject to challenge.” (Sentence judgment, 9.2)


	
	His Honour noted that according to the Community Corrections Officer, the respondent had accepted full responsibility for his offending behaviour. His Honour considered that the respondent’s letter to the court indicated that he had a sincere regret for his actions and had a genuine desire to study and engage usefully with society and his family when he was released from his period of imprisonment.
	
	
	By reference to the evidence of the respondent’s mother, his Honour accepted that both the respondent and his sister had suffered traumatically at the hands of their father because of his bi-polar episodes of alcoholism. She described the respondent’s father as a scary and violent person. She said that the children battled depression and that the respondent became angry and went through behaviour modification programs for significant periods during his adolescence and was prescribed anti-depressant medication during those periods. His Honour took into account the evidence of the mother that it had been suggested by a doctor that the respondent “had a heavy genetic load to carry given that his father’s family was beset with addiction problems and his maternal grandmother was a paranoid schizophrenic”.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the respondent had no close family members living in Australia and that he would not have any family support when he was released from prison.
	
	
	His Honour took into account the report of a psychologist, Mr Bradley. He diagnosed a major depressive disorder with anxious distress of moderate severity. He also diagnosed a severe opiate use disorder, a severe amphetamine use disorder and a severe cocaine use disorder, all of which were in full remission while he was in custody. Mr Bradley took a history that at the time of the offending, the respondent’s drug consumption was high including an eight-ball of heroin weekly and substantial consumption of ice and cocaine. Mr Bradley regarded the respondent as being at moderate risk of committing further offences upon his release.
	
	
	In relation to character, his Honour said:
	


“Mr Thomson comes before the Court as essentially a man of good character, having only minor matters on his record of low range PCA and an offensive language matter in 2007, although, as has been noted in the authorities, prior good character is not of particularly significant weight in serious drug matters.” (Sentence judgment, 10.7)


	
	By reference to s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) his Honour said that he had taken into account the nature and circumstances of the offence, the degree to which the respondent had shown contrition and the deterrent effect that any sentence might have. His Honour said that he had also had regard to the need to ensure that the respondent was adequately punished, the prospects of his rehabilitation and the probable effect that any sentence would have on the respondent’s family or dependants. His Honour had regard to the subjective aspects of the respondent.
	
	
	In relation to the role played by the respondent, his Honour accepted that the respondent:
	


“… while not being the principal, was a principal in the conspiracy to import border controlled drugs in that he carried out the following tasks at least: He communicated with the drug exporting syndicate based in Canada including providing the delivery name and address, being his employer, he arranged for his employer to contact the freight forwarder, he oversaw Mr Weller’s actions, including taking delivery of the consignment, organising its transport to the storage facility and directing attempts to extract the drugs for delivery to him, he provided instructions to Weller on how to cut the frame and extract the drugs, and he undertook some surveillance.” (Sentence judgment, 11.3)


	
	His Honour found that in relation to the large commercial supply offence that the respondent was also a principal and that he was substantially involved in the trafficking of significant quantities of drugs with significant wholesale and street values.
	
	
	His Honour found that it was not established by the evidence that the respondent had knowledge of the precise quantities of drugs being imported, although he would have known that a “reasonable amount of border-controlled drugs” were being imported. His Honour accepted that the respondent was involved in the offending for profit, although he was not able to assess the amount of money which the respondent was to receive. The only indication was that the respondent received $20,000 for the supply of the methamphetamine in the second indictment. His Honour concluded:
	


“On any view of objective seriousness, the conspiracy was a sophisticated and well planned operation in which the offender played a substantial role.” (Sentence judgment, 12.9)


	
	His Honour noted that he had to take into account general deterrence so that the sentence was of such severity that it would deter others from engaging in illicit drug activities of this kind and would signal to potential drug traffickers that any financial rewards would be neutralised by the risk of severe punishment.
	
	
	In relation to sentence discounts, his Honour accepted that in relation to the large commercial supply on the second indictment, there should be a discount of 25% on sentence and in relation to the other matters there should be a discount of 10%. In the case of the State offences, this would recognise the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty and in the case of the Commonwealth matter, it would recognise the willingness of the respondent to assist in the administration of justice.
	
	
	His Honour said the following on the question of accumulation:
	


“The Crown submits that a degree of accumulation is warranted in relation to the Commonwealth and State offences because they are factually different and do not form part of the one course of criminal conduct, so that the sentence for the Commonwealth offence could not comprehend and reflect the criminality for the State offences.

Mr Lange conceded that that is an appropriate submission and that there would be a degree of accumulation in the two sentences, and I have taken into account and I am satisfied that the sentences that I impose adequately reflect the degree of criminality involved in both offences.” (Sentence judgment, 14.5)


	
	His Honour made a finding of special circumstances as follows:
	


“I accept Mr Lange’s submission that it is appropriate to make a finding of special circumstances in relation to the State offence and to otherwise reduce the generally accepted ratio of non parole period to head sentence in the Commonwealth offence by virtue of factors such that it will be his first time in custody, and he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.” (Sentence judgment, 15.8)


	
	His Honour noted that he needed to take into account the offence on the Form 1 so that in relation to the possess taser offence, he should have regard to the need for personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to exact retribution for the serious offences.
	


Ground 1 – The imposition of sentences that were effectively wholly concurrent.


	
	By reference to the two principal offences – conspiracy to import and supply large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine – the Crown submitted that each offence was discrete and involved unrelated offending. Each offence was factually different and did not form one course of conduct. Therefore it was wrong in principle for the Commonwealth offence to comprehend and reflect the criminality for the large commercial supply offence, despite the discretionary nature of such an assessment. The Crown noted that both counsel had accepted that some level of accumulation would be appropriate and that his Honour did not indicate either in argument or in his reasons why some level of accumulation was not appropriate.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that because the sentence for the State offences was wholly subsumed within the sentence for the Commonwealth offence, the respondent’s conduct in committing the State offences had effectively gone unpunished. While accepting that a sentencing judge had a wide discretion and should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and principle, the Crown submitted that some accumulation was necessary in circumstances where the principal offences were extremely serious and where both counsel had agreed on that issue. The Crown submitted that no explanation was given by his Honour for the failure to order any effective level of accumulation. The Crown submitted that to say that the concurrent sentences “adequately reflect the criminality involved in both offences” did not provide such an explanation.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that on this issue the sentencing exercise miscarried because in setting the sentences, his Honour failed to order some degree of accumulation and that the sentencing discretion further miscarried by the failure of the sentencing judge to expose his reasoning for the lack of accumulation in the sentences.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the starting point for the Commonwealth offence was about 15 years and 5 months before the 10% discount for the plea of guilty. He submitted that this starting point adequately reflected the total criminality of the Commonwealth offence.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that using that as a starting point, his Honour’s mode of reasoning was clear. He had, as he was entitled to, assessed the sentences for the Commonwealth offence and for the State offences. He had taken into account the parties’ submissions as to accumulation and had found special circumstances. Having done so, he had then looked at the question of totality and had decided that no accumulation beyond the sentence imposed for the Commonwealth offence was necessary. The respondent submitted this was a classic example of the exercise by his Honour of the sentencing discretion. The only way in which it could be successfully challenged was if a House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 error could be demonstrated, and that this had not been done.
	


Consideration


	
	The principles applicable to a Crown appeal are now well understood. A claim of manifest inadequacy requires the Crown to establish that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust in a sentencing environment where there is no single “correct” sentence and judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach (Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6]; Makarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357; Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [58]).
	
	
	“Uniformity of sentencing is a matter of great importance in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice… inadequate sentences also give rise to a sense of injustice, not only in those who are the victims of the crimes in question, but also in the general public and are likely to undermine public confidence in the ability of the courts to play their part in deterring the commission of crime. To permit the Crown as well as convicted persons to appeal against sentences assists in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice (Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at [306] (McHugh J)).
	
	
	The primary purpose of a Crown appeal against sentence is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having a duty of sentencing convicted persons. In the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) the Court retains a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence, even though the sentence is erroneously lenient (Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1]). The Crown must negate any reason why the residual discretion of this Court not to interfere should be exercised (Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293; CMB v Attorney General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9 at [35] - [36]. As was observed in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [42] cases might arise where the court concludes that the inadequacy of the sentence appealed from is so marked that it amounts to “an affront to the administration of justice” and risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system. In such a case, the court is justified in interfering with the sentence.
	
	
	On the issue of accumulation, an important statement of principle was made by Howie J (Adams and Price JJ agreeing) in Regina v Cahyadi [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 where his Honour said:
	


“27    … there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. …”


	
	There is no issue that in this case the criminality of each of the conspiracy to import offence and the supply a large commercial quantity of methamphetamine offence was separate and discrete. There is no issue that the offending in relation to each of the principal offences was extremely serious. Each carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. Moreover, counsel for the respondent in the sentence proceedings accepted that some level of accumulation was appropriate. While his Honour was not bound to accept that concession, he should at the very least, have provided reasons for why he did not do so. On the facts of this case, given the serious criminality involved in each of the principal offences, and given the concession of counsel for the respondent, it was an error for his Honour not to provide some level of accumulation when imposing sentence and in failing to provide reasons why some accumulation was not appropriate.
	
	
	It is, of course, understood that the extent of accumulation is a matter of judicial discretion made in accordance with established principle R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 at [7]. Nevertheless, in circumstances as stark as those confronting his Honour in this case, it was an error not to accumulate in part the sentence for the Commonwealth offence with the aggregate sentence for the State offences.
	
	
	In Regina v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115 Hall J (with whom Tobias JA and Kirby J agreed) set out at [52] a number of propositions concerning accumulation and concurrency that his Honour said could be derived from the case law. Those propositions focused on a consideration of the similarity, differences and degree of connection between the offending both in time and type to ascertain the extent to which the sentence for one offence could comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other. It is clear that when those propositions are applied to the facts and criminality in the two principal offences here, some accumulation was required.
	
	
	As was recently stated in Pannowitz v R [2016] NSWCCA 13 by Davies J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Beech-Jones J agreed):
	


“40   … To those matters may be added a need to ensure public confidence in the administration of criminal justice to avoid the perception that an offender will not be punished more severely for committing multiple offences: Khawaja v R [2014] NSWCCA 80 at [24]-[25] following R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; (2007) 171 A Crim R 267 at [46].”


	
	Applying the principles applicable to a Crown appeal, it is clear that the failure to properly apply the principle of totality in this case has led to the imposition of an inadequate sentence which is likely to give rise to a sense of injustice in the general public and is likely to undermine public confidence in the ability of the courts to appropriately punish serious offending. The inadequacy of the sentence in this case is so marked that it risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system.
	
	
	This ground of appeal is made out.
	


Ground 2 - The sentence was manifestly inadequate

(a)   His Honour failed to have due regard to the nature and seriousness of the offending.


	
	While his Honour set out the factual background to the offending and found that the respondent was “a principal”, that both the index offences were very serious, that the quantity and value of the drugs involved was very high, that considerable sophistication and planning was involved, those findings were not reflected in the sentence ultimately imposed. It is not sufficient for a sentencing judge to record such findings as having been made. Those findings should be reflected in the sentence imposed. As often happens in sentencing, there can be sentencing principles pulling in different directions so that the “instinctive synthesis” process operates to bring about a sentence which adequately takes into account those conflicting principles. Here there was very little by way of conflict. There was no real issue as to the objective seriousness of each of the offences. What was primarily raised on behalf of the respondent was his subjective case. Looked at properly, however, his subjective case was not such as would justify a sentence as low as that which was ultimately imposed.
	
	
	The above comments are directed at the total effective sentence imposed by his Honour of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7½ years and a balance of term of 6½ years, not to the individual sentences imposed for the conspiracy to import offence and the large commercial supply offence. I have concluded that each individual sentence was not inadequate, rather it is the total effective sentence which attracts that characterisation.
	


(b)   His Honour failed to have due regard to general and specific deterrence.


	
	As has been stated earlier, while his Honour recited the importance of general and personal deterrence in this case, he failed to impose a sentence which gave effect to those findings. As with (a) this conclusion applies to the total effective sentence not to the individual sentences.
	


(c)   His Honour failed to have due regard to totality in sentencing.


	
	This has been dealt with under Ground of Appeal 1.
	


(d)   His Honour erred in giving undue weight to subjective circumstances.


	
	While the respondent had a reasonable subjective case, it could not be assessed as strong or compelling. On an acceptance of the respondent’s mother’s evidence, it is apparent that up to the age of three, the respondent was exposed to violence and erratic behaviour on the part of his father. Thereafter, he was taken by his mother to Canada. The events which there occurred seemed to be substantially due to the respondent’s own behaviour. No explanation was offered for his early poly-substance abuse, other than a genetic predilection. This was based on second-hand hearsay speculation on the part of an unnamed doctor. He did have (apparently until he went into custody) a very heavy drug habit. The ease with which he is said to have overcome that addiction while in custody is atypical of persons who have a drug addiction at the level attributed to the respondent. In any event, his Honour rejected the primary submission in the respondent’s subjective case, i.e. that his involvement in drug importation and supply was to support his drug habit and not for profit.
	
	
	Even putting the respondent’s subjective case at its highest, it is not an unusual circumstance for drug-addicted persons to be heavily involved in the supply of drugs. While this can be taken into account in sentencing, depending upon the particular circumstances, it has never been regarded as a factor which substantially reduces the weight to be given to the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	When one takes into account his apparent heavy drug addiction and the rather generous findings by the sentencing judge of “sincere regret” and “remorse and acceptance of responsibility”, those subjective matters still had to be balanced against the objective seriousness of the offending and in particular, the fundamental importance of general deterrence in relation to drug offences. In that regard, the observations of Howie J (with whom Simpson and Buddin JJ agreed) in SZ v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 remain apposite:
	


“4   There is a limited degree to which an otherwise appropriate sentence can be discounted for one reason or a combination of reasons and yet result in a sentence that duly reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and the purposes of punishment. There was by applying common law principles, and there still is by the application of the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1991 (NSW), a bottom line beneath which a sentence cannot legitimately be set. If that bottom line is not respected, the sentence will fail to carry out the purposes of punishment. …

6   These observations are trite and so there is a risk that they will be overlooked in an attempt to achieve one of the purposes of punishment at the expense of another. I simply wish to emphasise that, because there is only limited room to discount a sentence without going below the bottom line, it must follow that the application of one discount for one purpose will inevitably impact upon the extent to which another discount can be applied to achieve a different purpose. …”


	
	I have concluded that if the explanation for why the respondent’s sentence is inadequate is because of the weight which his Honour gave to his subjective case, then House v R error has occurred in that regard. As with the other particulars of inadequacy of sentence, this finding applies to the total effective sentence not to the individual sentences.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has been made out in respect of the total effective sentence.
	


Ground 3 – His Honour erred in failing to indicate non-parole periods for the State offences in accordance with s 54B(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.


	
	Section 54B(4) provides:
	


“(4)   When determining an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for one or more offences, the court is to indicate and make a written record of, for those offences to which a standard non-parole period applies, the non-parole period that it would have set for each such offence to which the aggregate sentence relates had it set a separate sentence of imprisonment for that offence.”


	
	The two State offences of supply a large commercial quantity of drugs and possess a prohibited weapon carried standard non-parole periods of 15 years and 3 years respectively. His Honour clearly failed to comply with s 54B(4). That having been said, s 54B(7) provides that a failure to comply with the section does not “invalidate” the sentence. Nevertheless, his Honour’s failure to indicate in the indicative sentences the non-parole periods which would have been imposed involved another error in sentencing in this case.
	
	
	It follows from the above that the Crown appeal has been made out. This does not end the matter. It remains to be considered whether the Crown has established that the residual discretion should not be exercised in favour of the respondent.
	


The residual discretion


	
	The Crown has been successful in establishing that his Honour erred in making the sentence for the State offences wholly concurrent with that imposed for the Commonwealth offence. That error was exacerbated by his Honour’s failure to properly reflect in the sentence, the principles of personal and most particularly, general deterrence, which are so important in large drug supply offences of this kind. This was not a case where the respondent’s subjective case was of such strength as to require a significant amelioration of the punitive elements which are important in sentencing for drug supply offences. As earlier indicated, the inadequacy in the sentence was such as to risk undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system. In those circumstances, the Crown has been successful in negating any reason why the residual discretion of this Court not to interfere in this sentence should be exercised.
	


Re-sentence


	
	In re-sentencing the respondent, it is necessary to follow the guidance of the High Court in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [42] where the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ) said:
	


“42   … When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. …”


	
	The only additional information before the Court beyond that which was available to the sentencing judge was material from the University of Southern Queensland which supported the submission by the respondent that he intended to engage in tertiary study while in custody. While this is reflective of an intention on the part of the respondent to rehabilitate himself, it does not significantly affect the other material which is before the Court, in particular, that relating to the circumstances in which the offences were committed.
	


In re-sentencing the respondent, I have imposed the same sentences as those imposed by the sentencing judge, but have adjusted the accumulation to increase the non-parole period by 3 years. Accordingly, the orders which I propose are as follows:


	
	The Crown appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by his Honour on 28 September 2015 are quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced as follows:
	



	
	In respect of the State offences, including the matter on the Form 1, the respondent is sentenced to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years commencing 19 January 2012 and expiring 18 January 2018 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring 18 January 2021.
	
	
	In respect of the Commonwealth offence, the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7½ years commencing 19 January 2015 and expiring 18 July 2022 with a balance of term of 6½ years expiring 18 January 2029.
	



	
	HARRISON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		19 April 2016",2016-04-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2769225,R v DINH [2016] NSWDC 131,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Cong Minh Dinh, appears today for sentence in relation to an offence that was pleaded on indictment as alleging that he, on 29 June 2015 at Punchbowl in the State of New South Wales, cultivated a prohibited plant, namely cannabis, cultivated by enhanced indoor means, being not less than the commercial quantity, namely 69 plants.
	
	
	The offence carries a maximum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment and/or 3,500 penalty units. I am informed by the Crown, it has no standard non parole period.
	
	
	The prisoner was born on 5 May 1978. As I would calculate his age, he was 37 years of age, about to turn 38 at the time of the offence. There are no offences on a Form 1. There are no related offences or backup offences, and the prisoner has spent no time in custody. He was arrested on 30 June 2015, in circumstances I will outline in some little length later. They are very relevant to the assessment of some aspects of this matter of some significance.
	
	
	The prisoner had pleaded guilty at the Local Court and was committed for sentence. However, there was a defect in the Court Attendance Notice. He hence is entitled, in my view, to a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to represent the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. In my view, having entered the plea of guilty at the Local Court, he entered his plea of guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. The discount is in accordance with the guideline judgment in relation to such matters of R v Thomson and Houlton. There is no issue as to this aspect of the matter.
	
	
	The facts are that on 26 June 2015, the New South Wales Police Force was granted a search warrant to search 23 Septimus Avenue, Punchbowl. It was a single storey house with a detached single storey granny flat at the rear of the property. When the police attended on 29 June, they found three Asian males and arrested them. One constable entered the property and walked to the granny flat. There he saw the three “Asian males” in handcuffs. Their names were Van Tuan Nguyen, Tom Truong Nguyen and Van Khou Hoang.
	
	
	Police began a search sometime after 9 o’clock and videoed the search. An Ausgrid representative, that is a representative of an electricity supply company, arrived to basically disable what was an electrical bypass arrangement, which is commonplace in cultivations of this type, being cultivation of cannabis plants by an enhanced means. Tom Truong Nguyen told the police he lived at the residence with his father and mother. The three men were taken away and a search was conducted of the premises. The facts seem to suggest, although they do not explicitly state, that the search conducted was in relation to the principal premises, not the granny flat. The rooms were given various letters and all I need identify is the fact that in a room designated as “B” there was clear evidence of an enhanced means of cultivation, with light globes, light shades, electrical transformers and 56 cannabis plants, each in pots. In another room, there were a number of light globes and light shades and some empty pots. Police believe plans had been growing in this room although the plants had been removed. In a dining room area, there was an array of electrical equipment, and a tray of 13 juvenile cannabis plants, as well as a large number of transformers. In another room, a large number of items of an electrical character, such as shades and globes, as well as sticks put together as racks. These racks were believed to dry cannabis heads. Another room had potting mix and another electrical equipment, as did the bathroom, which also contained chemicals believed to be used in hydroponic cannabis cultivation. Other electrical equipment was found in a room designated as “P”.
	
	
	The plants have been identified by an appropriately qualified person as cannabis plants. All up there were 69 plants, being the 56 plants that I referred to in room B, and the 13 juvenile cannabis plants found in room H. Police seized various items for subsequent investigation, digital scales, laptops, iPhones and an iPad. Police returned the cannabis to the police station, and interviewed the three men that I earlier named. Another person called, Tony Nguyen, was arrested at the premises at Septimus Avenue at 12.30pm. Tony Nguyen and Van Hoang, to whom I earlier referred, declined to participate in an interview. The arrest of the then four Vietnamese men was discontinued and they were released.
	
	
	Although it is not stated in the facts on 29 June the prisoner, having learnt that the police had searched the premises, apparently went to the police station near to where he lived to report that he was in fact the lessee of the premises. I accept his evidence to this effect. He subsequently spoke to his solicitor, and on 30 June 2015 he attended the Campsie Police Station and spoke to constables in the presence of a “Vietnamese speaking officer”. He said to the police in the initial conversations that the plants at the premises, “I look after”. He offender then, declining to further speak to his solicitor, participated, as I understand it, willingly in an electronically recorded interview. Paragraph 25 of the statement of facts sets out a summary of what the accused said Mr Stewart, in his helpful written submissions and other material, has extracted parts of the interview verbatim, which sheds some greater detail upon matters particularised in para 25. Essentially, he told the police that he had leased the premises in February 2015.
	
	
	There is evidence of the lease which has been produced by his counsel, showing that he leased the premises for six months. The prisoner had a debt of $30,000 from gambling in clubs in the Bankstown and Yagoona area. He had been approached by the principals of this cultivation and they had told him if he worked for them for six months he would be paid a few hundred dollars each week and his debt would “go away”. In relation to the matter, he said, according to the statement of facts, that he “didn’t want his family to get into trouble”. He went along with what the people told him to do. The extract from the interview conducted with him by the police reads as follows (Q 59), “I got into debt and then they came and gave us trouble and I didn’t want my family to get into trouble, so I worked”. He expressed regret for his conduct in the interview with the police. He did not know where the plants were being on sold to. All he did, he said, was to look after the plants. He was told he could smoke cannabis in the house. He did have a key to the house but “threw it away” out of “fear”. He was told which property to rent. He did not think the landlord knew about the cannabis. He was told to reside in the premises for a period of time to familiarise himself with any neighbours, presumably not to attract suspicion. The people that were responsible for the cultivation in funding it, providing the relevant equipment and setting it up, would come every two or three weeks. He never cut the plants he said, nor arranged for them to be removed.
	
	
	Subsequent DNA analysis found a DNA profile of the accused on various items, including latex gloves and the accused is clearly linked to the contents of the premises, relating to the cultivation, through that evidence. I will come back to some evidence the prisoner gave before me in relation to the matters I have outlined in a moment.
	
	
	The prisoner had no prior criminal convictions or charges. He was born in Vietnam. He came to Australia in 2009. As I understand the family dynamic, he resides with his wife in rental accommodation in the Bankstown district. They share four children, although as I understand it, some of those children are from previous relationships. There is some detail about that in the material that has been provided by the prisoner’s counsel.
	
	
	The prisoner gave evidence in these proceedings and as I would understand it, adopted the detail of what was set out in the helpful written material provided by counsel, which includes not just submissions but of course, a summary of matters pertinent to the prisoner’s subjective circumstances. It includes, in that material, the extracts that I referred to from the record of interview conducted with the prisoner. The parentage of the respective children is not important, but I do understand the prisoner is responsible for his wife and the four children. His wife receives a carer’s benefit from the government in relation to a family member with a disability. The prisoner since his arrest in relation to the current matter set up a nail and beauty business and a certificate of registration of the business name, has been provided to the Court. He would appear to be making approximately $2,000 a week from the business but it would appear from the financial records that he has provided to the Court, including banking records, that it is a tenuous existence for his family, with the out of pocket expenses, including rent for his accommodation and food and the like, perhaps exceeding the income from the business.
	
	
	The Community Corrections Services in its report reflected upon the fact the prisoner reported, “one of the co-accused had coerced him into committing the offence”. It notes that enquiries from the Service reveal that the prisoner has the continuing support of his wife and has a close relationship with his wife and children. He has been a person, up until the commission of the current offence, and subsequently, who has been regularly employed whilst he has been in Australia. He expressed regret for his conduct to the Community Corrections Services and understood the seriousness of his offending.
	
	
	With regard to the evidence he gave before me, in addition to the matters I have already identified, he said, in relation to the offending, that he regretted his involvement. He told me that he knew that what he was doing at the time was illegal. But he also said that the reason that he came forward to report himself to the police on 30 June and, as he said, the day before but was turned away was because he appreciated the fact that the police visit to the premises would reveal the wrongdoing of which he was aware he was involved. In my view, surrendering himself to the police in the manner in which he did and cooperating with the authorities, in the manner in which he did, is a very significant matter. It is true, as the lease agreement shows, that he leased the property in his own name. He clearly was exposed on the occasion, should it arise, of a police search of the premises. As I have said, police enquiries revealed DNA profile of the accused upon items related to the cultivation.
	
	
	That having been said, it is not abundantly clear to me that it necessarily would have followed that, given the details on the lease, that the police would have easily located the offender within in the Vietnamese community.
	
	
	As to the issue of the DNA profile, had one been developed, it is unlikely there would be a DNA profile of the prisoner on record. The same situation as a latent fingerprint being found. The prisoner, with no prior criminal convictions and no reason to have his DNA profile or his fingerprints on record, could not have been easily matched with such samples that were taken. I accept that his timely cooperation with the police in the manner in which I have described not only assisted in the prosecution of him but reflected the significant remorse on his part. In my view, it reflects very good prospects of rehabilitation. The Community Corrections Services noted that he was of low risk of reoffending. It confirmed he was no longer involved in gambling activities through enquiries of the prisoner and his family. He no longer associates with persons described as his “co offenders”, although I note nobody has been charged. The prisoner provided details as to the people that had, or the person who had recruited him, but I do believe he was being untruthful in his vagueness or lack of detail in description. The facts of the matter are that he came forward with the full ‘mea culpa’ and in my view, had nothing to gain by withholding information.
	
	
	As I understand it, he was educated in Vietnam to tertiary level. The information available to the Court, provided by his learned counsel, shows that he undertook a degree in Business Studies in Hanoi and graduated when he was 23 with a degree. Upon arrival in Sydney, he commenced a Master’s degree at some private college and was studying for about a year. It was then that he met his wife and discontinued his studies. The precise details of the family arrangements are that there are two children born of his marriage, his wife had a daughter from a prior marriage and the prisoner had a son from a prior relationship.
	
	
	In respect of his financial commitments, apart from his banking records, there is a summary of his outgoings under the heading, “Fixed Financial Commitments” in the material available to the Court.
	
	
	In respect of the electronically recorded interview, I have quoted a part of that interview. I have not seen the entirety of the interview. I do not have a transcript of last Friday’s proceedings as I may have earlier mentioned. I remember some detail provided by Mr Stewart from the bar table, beyond what was contained within the document, but I have no record of receiving the transcript of the electronic interview and it being made an exhibit in the proceedings.
	
	
	His counsel dealt with a number of matters in his submissions, as did the learned Crown in her submissions. With regard to the submissions of learned counsel for the prisoner, he took me through the terms of s 21A and pointed out, by reference to s 21A(2), there were not in this matter what could be called “additional” aggravating factors that might arise under s 21A(2) beyond the fact the offence was committed for “financial gain”. One might have thought in the scheme of things, that largely such offences were committed for financial gain. The character of the financial gain, as self admitted by the prisoner, was the payment of a couple of a hundred dollars per week to tend plants within the property and the promise, I note, to forgive the $30,000 debt. Events had not run their full course and I have got no doubt the loan sharks, with whom he was dealing in relation to his gambling debts - who figure prominently I hasten to say in many cases with which we deal particularly in relation to drug importation cases from Vietnam - have not, in my observation, experience and understanding, displayed a particularly good record for living up to their promises. Whether the prisoner’s “gambling debts” would have ultimately been forgiven is not entirely clear or sure. There is always in the background that given a person with a gambling addiction, as the prisoner had, there is a question mark about the validity of the sums of money claimed. I am not saying the prisoner’s account I do not believe. But whether he in actual fact owed as much as he believed he owed, whether he was being cheated, for example, in the form of gambling in which he was involved, is something about which one cannot be sure one way or the other. Then there are the dubious interest rates claimed.
	
	
	His learned counsel, by reference to s 21A(3), took me through the issues that arise in mitigation from the material available to the Court. I accept firstly, in the absence of evidence as to matters concerning any prior cultivation that might have been reaped by others, any injury, loss, damage or harm was not substantial. I could not conclude that the activity was not part of organised criminal activity but the prisoner was not an “organisation” member as such.
	
	
	Of course, I have no organisational chart but having sentenced many people, at least a dozen over the last four or five years, in relation to enhanced cultivation cases, there is a pattern or a methodology involved in such matters. Involving either planning or organisation beyond what one would inherently would expect in a cultivation case. The very character of enhanced cultivation involves obtaining a property, ensuring that it is disguised in some way, or internally blocked out from the outside world to prevent prior eyes observing what is going on, bypassing the normal electricity supply, and then provided a great deal of electrical equipment, as was the case here, in order for the cultivation to proceed hydroponically. That having been said, I accept that the prisoner was not part of the planning, and certainly in the context of his background and noting his willingness to admit his guilt and the timeliness of his cooperation, the prisoner is not part of organised activity.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the prisoner, that I should find as a mitigating factor, the prisoner was acting under duress. The prisoner did not give any evidence about this save in a very general way in terms of the adoption of matters contained within the material provided by his counsel. The issue of non exculpatory duress, was discussed at considerable length by Johnson J in the decision of Tiknius v R [2011] NSWCCA 215. His Honour, in that judgment, went through the principles that apply in assessing such claims of duress, particularly at [30] [54]. He concluded, in the matter, it being a Commonwealth sentencing exercise in the context of the Criminal Code, that in sentencing proceedings, non escape exculpatory address was available as a mitigating factor. It is specifically to be taken into account, one would have thought, having regard to the terms of the relevant subparagraph in s 21A(3) of the Act referred to by Counsel.
	
	
	That having been said, his Honour pointed out that courts are entitled to approach claims of this sort with a significant degree of circumspection. Claims may be easily made concerning the alleged conduct of persons in another country but which are said to have applied pressure upon an offender, citing the decision of Le v R [2006] NSWCCA 136. That judgment is also relevant in this sentencing exercise in the context of considering the prisoner’s gambling addiction, or gambling difficulties and debt, in the assessment of his moral or objective criminality. In Le Latham J discussed the relevance of such matters and noted the fact a person commits a crime in order to cleanse or have forgiven a drug debt is not of itself a mitigating factor. Johnson J pointed out the verification of a spurious claim of duress may prove difficult [45]. He made a number of observations about the reliance upon non exculpatory duress. He was, particularly in the facts of that case, addressing both drug supply and importation cases. In the matter, he pointed out that it may be a case where non exculpatory duress is relied upon greater weight may need to be given to general deterrence. He noted at [51], that:
	


“The grooming and pressuring of persons to become involved in drug importation offences, has been said to be: ‘unremarkable features of many importation offences’ (again citing Le)...at times, the persons targeted by those recruiting them, are said to have submissive or compliant personalities, or to be naïve”.


	
	He noted there was ample authority for the proposition that general deterrence was not excluded by the existence of threats to commit crimes and sometimes the fact a person has succumbed to such threats may warrant greater weight being given to general deterrence, given the purpose of that aspect of the purposes of sentencing under s 3A. In other words, greater weight should be given to general deterrence to deter others from not succumbing to the threats.
	
	
	I could not conclude on balance, that the prisoner was under duress. This is no criticism of learned counsel or the prisoner for that matter. He entered the witness box. He was open to be cross examined about any matter, it would seem to me, relevant to the sentencing exercise on the part of the Crown. But the truth of the matter is, beyond what is in the interview and beyond what is asserted by his counsel, little was said, in fact nothing was said, to develop the issue. That having been said, I am prepared to accept the context of the matter is one of a man who without criminal connections, succumbed to the temptation to avoid significant debt arising out his then weakness for gambling, in circumstances where he had an understanding within the milieu in which he lived, that there would be consequences for him if he did not agree to participate in this crime, or alternatively, if he could not pay back the $30,000. I have no doubt he could not afford that sum. Of course, one might say that a person who places themselves in dubious financial position of their own making is not to be in any way ‘accommodated’, if that is the correct expression. On the other hand in the real world one must understand that some people are capable of making decisions by deliberation and the exercise of freewill. Other persons, unfortunately, succumb to decision making in positions of considerable personal pressure which their personalities, or their weaknesses, have placed them.
	
	
	I note, without getting into the philosophical discussion that was developed in the guideline judgment of Henry in respect of armed robbery matters from 1998, this was an issue of tension between the majority of the Court and Simpson J. The learned Chief Justice speaking for the majority described drug addiction ultimately as a matter of choice. Simpson J viewed that drug addiction is not necessarily a matter of choice. Those various observations are more likely to be seen as obiter observations in the scheme of things. However, directly relevant to the matter in which the Court adopted a guideline in relation to armed robbery matters. Wood CJ at CL in his judgment (at [273]) noted in respect of claims of drug addiction, that although it is not a mitigating factor it might be relevant in a range of ways, to the impulsiveness of offending, in the assessment of the objective facts. It may be relevant subjectively to assessing the progress of the rehabilitation of an offender, whether an offender was at the ‘crossroads’ and other matters which have been and can be translated across to other areas of addiction, including a gambling addiction. I am not equating this addiction to a particularly severe form of drug addiction which is at the heart of the observations made by Wood J.
	
	
	Having made all those observations and not being able to conclude duress as a mitigating factor, the claim of the prisoner as to the circumstances as to how he became involved in this offending, is to my mind, truthful. It is truthful in the context of him freely admitting his guilt in a timely fashion to the police, giving evidence and making himself available for cross examination if needs be. It seems to me to be a matter relevant to the issue of his moral culpability. The reason I say that, in the middle of dealing with s 21A(3), is because one of the features of decisions of courts superior to mine, relating to the sentencing of offenders in relation to such offences, is the issue of determining whether a person has committed the crime for profit. Mr Stewart, in his written material, provided a survey of cases that dealt with the sentencing of offenders in relation to commercial and large commercial quantities of cannabis cultivated.
	
	
	Many of the cases involved, of course from the numbers of plants, cultivations far larger than the one with which I am concerned. I have regard to those judgments but they provide little in the way of assistance. The minimum number of plants required to be cultivated to constitute a commercial quantity of cannabis plants is 50. A large commercial quantity, I was informed by the learned Crown, was 200 plants. With no disrespect to the endeavours of Mr Stewart, I considered a number of other authorities which deal with matters of principle rather than figures in respect of the sentencing of offenders in relation to offences under this particular provision or in relation to like provisions. I pause to point out it is well known there are difficulties in relying upon so called “comparative cases”. The decision of Briouzguine v R [2014] NSWCCA 264, particularly at [75] [78], spoke about the difficulties in this regard. Bellew J in that judgment, reflected upon comparative sentencing exercises as well in that matter. Recently, in another context from a case I dealt with last Friday concerning possession of an unauthorised firearm, Davies J, speaking for the Court in the decision of Reniga v R [2016] NSWCCA 36, a decision delivered on 11 March 2016 - in the context of dealing with the matter from the perspective of an appellate court reviewing material available to it in the hearing of the appeal - noted reliance upon comparative cases in determining sentence appeals is “neither helpful nor supported by authority”.
	
	
	Referring to Huynh v R [2008] NSWCCA 216, his Honour noted that:
	


“The sentencing of offenders is an instinctive process and not a mechanical one. The process does not involve a comparison of similar cases where the sentence with the case in hand, is increased or decreased, for differences that can be found. Certainly the instinctive process is informed to some extent by comparative cases but the correctness of a particular sentence, when being reviewed in a higher court, is seldom determined by examining those comparative cases, to see how the sentence in question, fits with the sentence in those cases. At best, those cases provide a range of what has been thought appropriate in the past, but that range must be measured against the maximum penalty”. 


	
	He cited amongst other cases, De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, at [303] [304], a passage approved by the plurality in Hili & Jones v R [2010] HCA 45, (particularly at [54]).  His Honour also referred to the use of statistics.  He noted statistics were a limited “tool”.  Obviously one does not know what the underlying factors or relevant considerations involved in the fixing of a particular sentence.  Statistics might not provide any assistance, particularly where other offences are to be taken into account on the Form 1.  They, at best, as Spigelman CJ pointed out in Bloomfield in 1998, can provide a range for an appellate court, (Reniga at [46] [48])..
	
	
	I am mindful of course, many of the comments made by Davies J and by the other authorities to which his Honour referred, are concerned with the value of such material on appeal. To try and argue for example, a particular sentence was excessive by comparison to comparative sentences. I appreciate, of course, the role of the Court at first instance, is somewhat different. The assistance provided by comparative cases, may be greater, it may be lesser - the same as statistics. There are different considerations at play. One of the matters that needs to be always borne in mind is that a court such as mine, an inferior court, is guided by the range of penalties that are imposed by superior courts, or even by colleagues, to give the Court some indication of an appropriate “range”, bearing in the mind the observations of the High Court of Australia in Markarian from 2005 and the need to give ‘individual justice’ in each sentencing exercise. In that context, of course, it is not uncommon in sentencing in relation to offences of this type, where people are employed as agents, as this prisoner was, that the person will have no prior criminal convictions. Such a person will be hired to do such tasks as are required because such a person will not attract suspicion. I am very mindful of that. The same observations may be made of a courier. There is no point sending someone into Vietnam or China to bring back border controlled drugs, if they have prior convictions. They will only attract attention on their return to Australia.
	
	
	There were, however, some other judgments that were brought to my attention by Mr Stewart, in his submissions. He took me to a decision in Andreata, [2015] NSWCCA 239, which involved the cultivation of prohibited plants, in a similar number but in circumstances where the offender, as I understand the matter, was concerned with the supply of cannabis and could rightfully be seen as having a more substantial role in the cultivation of the benefits to be obtained from the cultivation. Although he claimed he was babysitting the crop. That judgment involves a survey of a number of judgments (at [40]), many of which concerned facts, at least in terms of the numbers of plants which is only one relevant matter of course, more serious than this. Although I note the decision of Tan [2013] NSWCCA 164, involving the cultivation of 53 plants, and the sentence imposed therein, is greater than I am contemplating here. Although I do not know the full details of the Tan subjective case nor the precise basis upon which he was sentenced.
	
	
	Some cases, however, that are known to the Court with the benefit of the Sentencing Bench Book have been of some assistance. Bringing me back to a matter I averted to earlier in my judgment, the decision of R v Godden [2005] NSWCCA 160, reflects upon sentencing in relation to “cultivation” cases. In that matter, the cultivation of prohibited drugs to wit, cannabis, by non enhanced means involving 390 plants but rendering the offender liable to the same maximum penalty as is here. Furthermore, the offender was in possession of 280 grams of cannabis leaf and it is clear from the facts of the case he was himself a cannabis user and a person familiar with cannabis in a range of ways.
	
	
	R S Hulme J observed at [28], “It is clear that profit making activity from going and selling illegal crops and drugs is an offence the nature of which will usually attracts a term of imprisonment”.
	
	
	That statement of principle finds its way by reference to the principle, that where profit is obtained from cultivation, a term of imprisonment will be imposed unless there are exceptional circumstances. In the Bench Book, another decision that I referred to this context is the decision of Nguyen [2007] NSWCCA 94. That offender pleaded guilty to cultivation by non enhanced means for an offence that carried the same maximum penalty, to cultivate the 278 plants. The facts are not that important. What are significant are some observations of principle that appear at [18] [19]. Hulme J again reflected that the, “sole motivation seems to have been profit”. The prisoner denied the use of the drug himself. He reflected upon the significance of the quantity of the crop. He noted, in relation to sentencing of course, that subjective matters were to be taken into account, including findings of good character, although he said that that factor has less weight in cases of deliberate drug offending. He also pointed out, as was pointed out many times before, that “subjective factors must not be allowed to overwhelm the sentence process at the expense of giving proper weight to the offence of subjective seriousness”. (see [18] [25]). In that matter of Nguyen, the offender was sentenced to two years six months’ imprisonment with a “non parole period” or “minimum term” of 15 months’ imprisonment.
	
	
	I have also had regard to the decision of Gattellari [2007] NSWCCA 5. It is in the context of these judgments that I have considered the matters advanced on behalf of the prisoner, both as to the assessment of the prisoner’s level of criminality and the relevance of the subjective matters that were referred to in the submissions of his counsel.
	
	
	The finding I made ultimately, in relation to the offender’s role, was that of a labourer. However, importantly, in my view it could not be regarded, although he was paid, that he was committing the offence for true profit. He was neither a principal in the setting up of the cultivation, nor profited in the common understanding of that word, from the fruits of such cultivation. Certainly, there is no evidence of his involvement in the distribution of cannabis and the like. I have concluded that he was a person without any criminal convictions. That he was a person of good character. I am satisfied that he is unlikely to reoffend, and has excellent prospects of rehabilitation, and shown relevant remorse, taking responsibility for his actions and acknowledging his wrongdoing. He pleaded guilty to the offending but he receives a discrete discount for that. There was a considerable degree of valuable pre-trial disclosure by the prisoner, a mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(l).
	
	
	So far as assistance to law enforcement authorities, this is claimed as a mitigating factor. The Crown disputes this. Clearly he is not entitled to any discrete discount. My view is that he provided assistance in the context of his pre-trial disclosure and certainly, the timeliness of his assistance was a critical matter in his favour.
	
	
	That brings me to the Crown’s helpful written submissions. The Crown notes the circumstances of the matter, citing Godden, as setting out the essential principle. It is a matter I have discussed at some little length. The Crown submitted that he was not entitled to consideration for any assistance to authorities, a matter that I have discussed. The Crown says however, “this is also not a case where he has voluntarily disclosed his unknown guilt”. That is correct. Clearly, the cultivation had been found. Hence the reason for him surrendering himself. I come back to that highly significant matter in the overall assessment of this case, of the prisoner’s willingness to make himself available for arrest, in circumstances where his identify might not have been as easily established as might have been thought.
	
	
	The Crown submits “a strong Crown case”. As the lessee of the premises with DNA material linking him to items within the cultivation, I accept that this is true. That having been said, the cooperation of the prisoner in the manner I have outlined as the Crown concedes, is relevant to matters such as remorse and prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The Crown, in its submissions, deals with the issue of remorse, citing some judgments such as Ceissman from 2004. With regard to “economic duress”, the Crown cites Wood CJ at CL, noting economic duress was not a mitigation for the commission of an offence of breaking and entering, and stealing in company. Ceissman was a case of which I am familiar as to its facts and details, involving a person whose participation of the offence stemmed from his independent criminal conduct arising out of his continued association with Korean criminals. That cannot be said of this prisoner.
	
	
	Thus, having regard to the level of objective seriousness of the offending, noting the plants, although that is not decisive, noting the prisoner’s role and noting the circumstances in which he was introduced into the offending in the context of matters that are relevant to the assessment of his moral culpability, I have concluded his offending is at the lower end of the scale of offences contemplated by this particular section. I have regard to s 5 of the Act, in the context of all the relevant matters, including the discount to which the prisoner is entitled. I have concluded ultimately, that the term of imprisonment I shall imposed upon the prisoner, shall not be greater than two years.
	
	
	Thus, in the circumstances of matter, I have regard to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in EF [2015] NSWCCA 36, and I have determined at this point of the proceedings, that rather than impose a term of imprisonment upon the prisoner, which would be required of him to serve a term of imprisonment immediately, I should have him assessed for his suitability for an Intensive Correction Order. In undertaking that consideration, I have obviously had regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, particularly all the purposes of sentencing beyond general and personal deterrence. I see no need for personal deterrence in this matter for this particular offender, nor do I see a need to protect the community from the offender. I appreciate that I am required to make him accountable for his conduct and to denounce his conduct, and recognise the potential for harm at least, although there is no specific victim of the crime. I am required also to promote his rehabilitation.
	
	
	It seems to me, in the overall scheme of things that all those objectives of sentencing, or purposes of sentencing, can be met potentially by the course that I have foreshadowed.
	
	
	Could stand up please, Mr Dinh. In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty, you are convicted. I have considered s 5(1), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and I am satisfied for the reasons that I have given that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate and the sentence will be a period, for a period of no more than two years. You are referred for assessment as to your suitability for an Intensive Correction Order, as a means of serving your sentence.
	
	
	Take a seat sir.
	
	
	In relation to the matter Madam Crown and Mr Stewart, I am going to stand the matter over for sentence. We will need six to eight weeks for a report. I am not sure whether it is six or eight weeks for ICO report but it’s something in that order. I was going to suggest, subject to mutual availability, a date like Friday 17 June.
	
	
	STEWART: That’s suitable to me.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: How are you placed Madam Crown?
	
	
	KUPPESAMY: I’m available on that date your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Dinh’s matter is adjourned to 17 June 2016. I’ll request that a copy of the transcript of my remarks be taken out, so I can revise it and made available to the parties before the next date. Madam Crown, I’m going to continue the prisoner’s bail, to facilitate the preparation of the report. I propose to direct Community Corrections prepare an Intensive Correction Order assessment report on or before 17 June. I will require the offender, as a condition of his bail, to report to Bankstown Community Corrections services within seven days from today, to facilitate the preparation of the report.
	
	
	Mr Dinh, do you understand you’re required to report to the Community Corrections service at Bankstown within seven days of today?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes, thank you your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you. You can leave the dock. Thanks very much. Just take a seat behind the counsel.
	
	
	Now is there any other matter, Madam Crown, at the moment?
	
	
	KUPPESAMY: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Is there any other matter from you at the moment, Mr Stewart?
	
	
	STEWART: No, may it please the Court.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: My remarks hopefully will be transcribed relatively soon. To be fair, reporting services staff is understaffed and overworked. I’ll ask my associate to put in a request, but it will be done as quickly as possible and I’ll certainly revise as soon as it’s reasonable in the circumstances. Again, we’re very grateful for reporting services for all the hard work they do and we know how desperate they are with their resources. So we’ll just wait and see what happens.
	
	
	Mr Dinh, you’ll be required to be of good behaviour during the period of time that I’ve adjourned the case and you will be required to comply with the directions of Community Corrections services.
	
	
	ADJOURNED TO FRIDAY 17 JUNE 2016

2769228,R v Caldwell [2016] NSWCCA 55,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: I agree with R A Hulme J
	
	
	HARRISON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: William James Caldwell (“the respondent”) was sentenced by her Honour Judge Woodburne SC in the District Court at Sydney in respect of five offences with a further three offences being taken into account.
	
	
	The respondent had been arrested on 27 October 2013. He pleaded guilty to the offences in December 2014. The sentence hearing took place on 4 June and 17 July 2015 and her Honour passed sentence on 28 August 2015.
	
	
	Her Honour imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 6 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 8 months. It was backdated to the day of the respondent’s arrest.
	
	
	The Crown appeals against the sentence on grounds alleging that it is manifestly inadequate and that her Honour erred by failing to take into account that the offences were committed while the respondent was on a good behaviour bond. For the reasons that follow I am satisfied that both grounds have been made good.
	


Offence and sentence details


	
	Details of the offences and the individual sentences that would have been imposed if her Honour had not imposed an aggregate sentence are set out in the following table. All of the offences were contrary to provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offences which the respondent asked her Honour to take into account pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) were listed on Form 1 (“F1”) documents. Standard non-parole periods (“SNPP”) are prescribed where indicated.

Facts


	
	The facts relating to the respondent's offences were not disputed.
	


Offence on Form 1 for Offence 1 and Offence 2 – drive stolen conveyances


	
	A Subaru WRX and a Porsche Cayenne were stolen from commercial car wash facilities at Haberfield and Kingsford on 25 and 28 August 2013 respectively while each car was unattended with the keys left in the ignition. The respondent was seen driving the Porsche on 13 September and was seen driving the Subaru on a number of occasions between then and 17 October 2013.
	


Offence 1 - aggravated break, enter and steal at Westpac Bank, Sydney on Friday 13 September 2013


	
	Shortly before 11.00am on Friday 13 September 2013 the respondent and an unknown male were seen to attend a commercial car park in Harris Street, Ultimo. A short time later the respondent drove away in the Subaru followed by the unknown male driving the Porsche. They drove to the vicinity of the Westpac Bank in Kent Street where the Porsche mounted the footpath and drove through a glass wall. The respondent stopped the Subaru nearby. Another unknown male alighted with a sledgehammer which he used to further smash the glass wall thereby allowing both unknown males to enter the bank. $42,794 was stolen from the teller section. The three offenders escaped in the Subaru driven by the respondent. The Porsche was left wedged in the glass wall. The statement of agreed facts include that there were dozens of people in the area at the time of the incident.
	


Offence 3 - aggravated break, enter and steal at IGA Supermarket, Pyrmont on Monday 7 October 2013


	
	At about 10.50pm on Monday 7 October 2013 the respondent drove the Subaru to the vicinity of the IGA Supermarket in Miller Street, Pyrmont. He and two unknown male companions observed the movements of staff as they prepared to close up. The manager locked the main door at 11.00pm and proceeded to take cash containers out of an ATM at the front of the store. The two unknown males smashed the glass door with a sledgehammer while the respondent waited in the driver's seat of the Subaru.
	
	
	The manager fled with the cash containers to the back of the store, calling out to the approximately ten staff members, ""run and hide, thieves are here"". The staff locked themselves in an office but the offenders banged on the door, yelling ""open it"". Staff members were crying and upset. The manager opened the door out of fear. He was required to assist locating the cash from the ATM. That cash and an entire days takings from the cash registers (totalling $43,000) were taken and the offenders fled in the Subaru.
	


Offence 4 – robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon at Bendigo Bank, Pyrmont on Friday 11 October 2013


	
	Just before closing time on Friday 11 October 2013 the respondent with two unknown passengers drove the Subaru to the corner of Harris and Union Streets in Pyrmont. It mounted the kerb at speed before reversing quickly in the direction of the nearby Bendigo Bank. The two male passengers alighted and entered the bank; one was armed with a sledgehammer. Once inside the teller area they threatened staff and demanded cash. Staff told them that the money had been secured in a time-delayed safe that would take 15 minutes to open. One of the offenders threatened to shoot a staff member but no firearm was seen. Nevertheless she feared for her safety and opened her teller drawer which contained a small amount of money. The offenders ran from the bank with proceeds of $350 and were driven away by the respondent.
	


Offence on Form 1 for Offence 5 - conspiracy to commit armed robbery on Wednesday 16 October 2013


	
	At around 4.00pm on Wednesday 16 October 2013 the respondent and two co-offenders, Bradley Baxter and Koori Fernando, were seen in the stolen Subaru in Taylor Street, Glebe by police officers performing general duties. They activated the warning devices on their police vehicle when the Subaru made a turn contrary to a no right turn sign and a red traffic light. The respondent waved at the pursuing officers and accelerated away. Surveillance devices, which by this time had been installed in the Subaru, depicted the three men entering the car and tying t-shirts over their faces in anticipation of an intended robbery.
	


Offence 5 - aggravated break, enter and steal at Sydney Credit Union, Leichhardt on Thursday 17 October 2013


	
	At 2.15pm on Thursday 17 October 2013 the respondent with Kane Caldwell and Koori Fernando travelled in the Subaru from Ultimo to the Sydney Credit Union at Leichhardt. Kane Caldwell and Koori Fernando alighted, armed with a sledgehammer and a baseball bat. They smashed their way through glass doors with the sledgehammer and approached the sole employee who ran away. They took $38,620, returned to the Subaru and were driven away by the respondent.
	


Arrest and offence on Form 1 for Offence 5 – damage property


	
	Police attended an address in Marrickville on 27 October 2013 in an attempt to locate the respondent. He fled through neighbouring properties and in doing so damaged a fence at one property and a gate at another. He was arrested soon after.
	


Assessment of objective seriousness of the offences


	
	The learned judge made an assessment of the objective seriousness of each of the offences. She found that they were each serious examples of their type; ""very serious"" in the case of Offence 1 (Westpac Bank in Kent Street).
	
	
	In making these assessments, her Honour referred to a number of features including:
	


a)   the degree of planning;

b)   the number of co-offenders;

c)   the use of the sledgehammer and, in one case, a baseball bat;

d)   the use of disguises;

e)   the use of stolen cars;

f)   the nature of the respective premises, some being targeted when they and the surrounding areas would be busy;

g)   the extent of damage to property;

h)   the amount of money taken;

i)   the disregard to public safety; and

j)   the fear and distress caused to innocent people.

Personal circumstances of the respondent


	
	The only oral evidence at the sentence hearing was that of the respondent. Documents relevant to his background and personal circumstances comprised his criminal and custodial history and two reports by Mr Tim Watson-Munro, psychologist. Accompanying one of Mr Watson-Munro's reports was a journal article written by an American obstetrician and gynaecologist on the relationship between methylamphetamine abuse and brain damage.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that the respondent's criminal history commenced in the Children's Court when he was aged about 14. He had been convicted of matters of break and enter as well as robbery. She noted that he was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years 3 months in the District Court in 2005 for an offence of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence [in fact two, with a further two taken into account], driving whilst disqualified, and driving a vehicle taken without the owner's consent. She further noted that in 2009 he was placed on a five-year good behaviour bond for an offence of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon.
	
	
	Her Honour did not say anything about it being an aggravating feature of the present offences that the respondent was in the community under such conditional liberty at the time. This gave rise to ground 2 of the Crown's appeal which should be upheld. Although it was accepted by the Crown that it had not raised the matter with her Honour, it was submitted to have been such a clear ""red flag matter"" that it should have been noticed and taken into account adversely to the respondent. With much respect to her Honour, I think that is right.
	
	
	After reference to the criminal history, the judge continued with a review of his background. She referred to him being a man of Koori descent and the eldest child in a blended family of 13 siblings. His father was an alcoholic and his parents separated when he was about 7 years of age. He was estranged from his mother for five years until 2008 and was largely raised by his paternal uncle with whom he had a very good relationship.
	
	
	The respondent attended about 10 primary schools. He was asked to leave high school in Year 7 but later returned to school in 2001 and completed a Koori mentoring course at the Eora TAFE. He then had limited employment as a mentor for Koori children and had also worked in the hospitality industry and in various souvenir stores. His primary source of income was through the sale of his artwork for which he received $4000 to $5000 for his paintings.
	
	
	The respondent was in a relationship for about 3 years which produced a child who is currently in her mid-teens. The relationship broke down when she was two but he told Mr Watson-Munro in 2008 that he maintained good contact with his daughter.
	
	
	Alcohol and illicit drug use has marred the respondent's life. He began using alcohol and cannabis at age 9 and other drugs including ecstasy, amphetamine and cocaine at age 14. He gave evidence that alcohol abuse was rife amongst adults and children when he was growing up on the missions in Moree. He came to think that drinking was ""the right thing to do"" and said ""I thought it was cool"".
	
	
	The respondent's alcohol abuse escalated in the course of a relationship with a woman who was a heavy drinker but a short time later (11 October 2004 according to the records) he was imprisoned. When he was released (10 October 2006) she was incarcerated for matters arising from her alcohol abuse. According to the history given to Mr Watson-Munro in 2008, this had a ""significant and destabilising impact upon Mr Caldwell who then for a period escalated the intensity of his alcohol consumption"".
	
	
	In relation to another matter, the respondent was refused bail and held in custody from 21 August 2009 until he was acquitted on 25 October 2012. He told Mr Watson-Munro that this was in respect of an armed robbery charge. Referring to it, the psychologist reported:
	


""Since that time until the period of his arrest his life spiralled downwards due to his unresolved depression, anxiety and escalating addiction.""


	
	Her Honour referred to the respondent's evidence that he did not use drugs during his time in custody but after his release in October 2012 he ""started drinking, clubbing"" and soon after started using the drug known as ""ice"". He said he had been using ice on a daily basis for about four months prior to the index offences.
	
	
	The respondent gave an account of having fallen into debt with drug dealing bikies who were threatening him and that this was what motivated him to commit the offences. Her Honour did not accept this so no more needs to be said about it. She did, however, accept that he had been using ice and that ""given the lack of employment, the offences were likely to have been committed to fund the offender's drug habit and lifestyle"". She did not accept that this was any excuse or a matter of mitigation. She added:
	


""It is well established that the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit, even a severe habit, does not operate to mitigate the seriousness of the offending. It is evident from the planning involved in the commission of the offences as well that, whatever the degree of addiction and state of mind as affected by those drugs, the offender was nevertheless able to participate in the planning as well as the execution associated with each of the offences. He knew what he was doing [was] wrong and that is so even if the use of a drug might have affected his reasoning about the matter. The use of ice is not a licence to commit very serious crime.""


	
	This conclusion is unimpeachable and was not challenged.
	


Findings made in the assessment of sentence


	
	Her Honour referred to the remarks of his Honour Judge North in sentencing the co-offender Kane Caldwell:
	


""The offender's underprivileged upbringing, early introduction to alcohol and later introduction to drugs, bearing in mind his Aboriginality, enliven in my view considerations of the principles identified by Wood J in Fernando.""


	
	She identified the authorities on the subject - R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 and Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 - and said, in effect, that the same considerations applied in the respondent's case.
	
	
	A 25 per cent reduction of sentence on account of the utilitarian value of the respondent's early guilty pleas was allowed.
	
	
	Her Honour was ""not entirely persuaded"" that the respondent had true insight into the effect of his offences on their innocent victims but she acknowledged that he had accepted some responsibility for his crimes.
	
	
	She was not prepared to find that he had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to reoffend, holding that such prospects were ""guarded"".
	
	
	Reference was made to the purposes of sentencing: s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. She said that weight had to be given to general deterrence, retribution and punishment. Specific deterrence was also held to be relevant in light of the respondent's criminal history. Rehabilitation was also important ""to prevent a cycle of going in and out of prison"".
	
	
	Her Honour made reference to the totality principle in a perfectly conventional way but, given it relates to the primary complaint made by the Crown, it bears quoting in full:
	


“In imposing sentence on an offender who has committed multiple offences it is proper to proceed by imposing appropriate sentences and to apply the totality principle by the extent to which the sentences are made concurrent or cumulative.

In the case of Mr Caldwell it can be seen that the offences committed by him were committed over a reasonably confined period of time, being from about 13 September 2013 through to about 27 October 2013. It is necessary however to recognise the fact that whilst the offences were committed over a reasonably short period of time, and whilst some of them were of the same general nature as others, these were in fact separate and distinct offences that must be marked by a degree of accumulation of sentence.

The overall sentence to be imposed is intended to achieve a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved taking into account, as I have been asked to do, the Form 1 offences.”


	
	Special circumstances justifying a non-parole period less than the usual three-quarters of the overall term were found: ""I consider that there is a need for rehabilitation and I consider that that warrants an adjustment by way of incentive and support in the community"".
	
	
	Her Honour referred in detail to the sentencing of the three men identified as being co-offenders in the Sydney Credit Union offence (Offence 5 - Kane Caldwell and Koori Fernando) and the conspiracy to commit armed robbery offence (Offence on Form 1 for Offence 5 - Koori Fernando and Bradley Baxter). She said she would take into account the need to avoid unjustifiable disparity but had determined to impose a longer sentence than those men received, particularly having regard to the additional serious offences for which the respondent stood to be sentenced.
	


Crown submissions


	
	The written submissions of counsel for the Crown (not senior counsel who appeared at the hearing) identified four ""particulars"" said to support a conclusion that the sentence is manifestly inadequate.
	


Particulars (i) and (ii)


	
	It was contended that there was a failure by the sentencing judge to take into account the use of offensive weapons and the fact that there were people on the premises as circumstances of aggravation for the aggravated break and enter offences. However, the use of a sledgehammer and, in one case, a baseball bat, the targeting of some premises when they would be busy, the disregard for public safety, and the fear and distress caused to innocent people were among the matters to which her Honour paid specific regard in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences (*see above at [18]). There is no merit in these complaints.
	


Particular (iii)


	
	It was contended that the indicative sentence for Offence 5 did not reflect the criminality involved when taking into account the offences on the Form 1.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the appeal is against the aggregate sentence, not the indicative sentences: Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [227]; JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [40](11); R v Stoupe [2015] NSWCCA 175 at [72]. However, it pointed to the fact that the indicative sentence for Offence 5 was the lowest of all. It was a serious offence by itself but it was also necessary for her Honour to take into account that the previous day the respondent had conspired with two other offenders to commit an armed robbery.
	
	
	There is no point seeking to resolve this specific complaint as the ultimate question is whether the aggregate sentence is proportional to the overall criminality of the respondent.
	


Particular (iv)


	
	The final particular of manifest inadequacy in the aggregate sentence is that the degree of notional accumulation of the indicative sentences was inadequate and failed to reflect the totality of the criminality of the offences: JM v R at [40](13).
	
	
	A recent summary of the correct approach to the assessment of sentence for multiple offences so as to have proper regard to the totality of criminality appeared in R v Van Ryn [2016] NSWCCA 1:
	


“[228] Street CJ described the principle of totality in sentencing in R v Holder; R v Johnston [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 260 as follows:

'The principle of totality is a convenient phrase, descriptive of the significant practical consideration confronting a sentencing judge when sentencing for two or more offences. Not infrequently a straightforward arithmetical addition of sentences appropriate for each individual offence considered separately will arrive at an ultimate aggregate that exceeds what is called for in the whole of the circumstances. In such a situation the sentencing judge will evaluate, in a broad sense, the overall criminality involved in all of the offences and, having done so, will determine what, if any, downward adjustment is necessary, whether by telescoping or otherwise, in the aggregate sentences in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences.'

[229] In R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; 171 A Crim R 267 at [46], the Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Hulme and Hislop JJ) emphasised the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice when sentencing for multiple offences by endorsing the remarks of Sully J in the two-judge bench decision in R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at [36]-[37]:

'... (There) is the need to ensure public confidence in the administration of criminal justice; and, in particular, to ensure that there does not emerge in the community at large a perception that there is not all that much to choose between the person who commits one or two offences, and the person who commits six or seven offences, for the reason that somehow or other they all manage to finish up with effective sentences between or among which there is hardly anything in practical terms to choose.

It needs to be clearly understood by all concerned that a person who commits a deliberate series of discrete offences, - and the present applicant's case, is a good example of the kind, - he must not be left with the idea that by intoning references to the principle of totality as though it were some magic mantra, he can escape effective punishment for the offences which follow successively one upon another throughout the whole course of a studied and deliberate course of criminal behaviour.'

[230] In R v XX (2009) 195 A Crim R 38 at [52], Hall J set out a number of propositions derived from the case law concerning the discretionary exercise of ordering sentences to be served concurrently or cumulatively in accordance with the principle of totality. They included reference to the following passage in the judgment of Howie J in R v Cahyadi [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41at [27]:

'… [T]here is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.' (Emphasis added)""


	
	The Crown did not suggest that Woodburne SC DCJ was not cognisant of the principles. (See above at [37]). She recognised that ""these were in fact separate and distinct offences that must be marked by a degree of accumulation of sentence"". It was submitted, however, that the result did not give effect to the correct application of the principle; the degree of accumulation ""is simply too slight, as clearly demonstrated by the mere 12-month difference between the aggregate head sentence and the longest indicative head sentence"".
	
	
	This was not a case in which the criminality in one offence significantly overlapped with the criminality in another offence, thereby justifying the degree of notional accumulation being ameliorated: see, for example, Delaney v R; R v Delaney [2013] NSWCCA 150; 230 A Crim R 581 at [66]-[67]; Galvin v R [2015] NSWCCA 88 at [49]. Each of the aggravated break and enter offences and the armed robbery offence were distinctly different displays of serious criminal misconduct. They were committed on different days; they involved different victims; and in most cases they involved the theft of substantial amounts of money.
	


Respondent's submissions


	
	Counsel for the respondent characterised the sentencing judgment as well and carefully crafted by a judge with much experience in the criminal law. So much may be readily accepted.
	
	
	Counsel conceded that the sentence imposed was ""at the low end (if not the bottom) of the permissible range"". However, it was submitted that it was not ""wrong in law"" in terms of it being beyond the range of the legitimate exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	Attention was invited to the various subjective matters that stood in favour of a more lenient assessment of sentence than might otherwise have been the case. In this regard, reference was made to matters such as the respondent's ""fractured and dislocated upbringing including an early introduction from about age nine to alcohol and drugs"".
	
	
	No complaint was made about the assessment the judge made as to the objective seriousness of the offences.
	
	
	It was put in written submissions that this was a case which could be considered in the light of the well-known passage from the judgment of King CJ in R v Osenkowski (1982) 30 SASR 212 at 212-213. The written submissions quoted just the following:
	


""It is important that prosecution appeals should not be allowed to circumscribe unduly the sentencing discretion of judges. There must always be a place for the exercise of mercy where a judge's sympathies are reasonably excited by the circumstances of the case. There must always be a place for the leniency which has traditionally been extended even to offenders with bad records when the judge forms the view, almost intuitively in the case of experienced judges, that leniency at that particular stage of the offender's life might lead to reform.""


	
	The judgment in fact continues:
	


""The proper role for prosecution appeals, in my view, is to enable the courts to establish and maintain adequate standards of punishment for crime, to enable idiosyncratic views of individual judges as to particular crimes or types of crime to be corrected, and occasionally to correct a sentence which is so disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime as to shock the public conscience.""


	
	The latter is particularly pertinent to the present case. And, in any event, it is not at all apparent that the sentencing judge's ""sympathies [were] reasonably excited by the circumstances of the case"". Her Honour did not say anything to suggest that she had formed a ""view … that leniency at [this] particular stage of the offender's life might lead to reform"". In fact, her Honour found that the respondent's prospects of rehabilitation were ""guarded"".
	


Conclusion


	
	I am satisfied that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. Each of the aggravated break and enter and robbery offences were of considerable seriousness as the learned judge found and the respondent implicitly accepted. Except for Offence 5, the Crown does not complain about the term of each of the indicative sentences. But I agree with the submission that the fact that the aggregate sentence only exceeds the indicative sentence for Offence 1 by 12 months is a powerful indication that there was an inadequate assessment of the need to notionally accumulate. Put more directly, I am satisfied that the aggregate sentence fails to reflect the overall criminality of the respondent's offences. A substantially higher sentence was required for that purpose, even recognising and giving full weight to the most unfortunate circumstances in the respondent's upbringing; acknowledging his acceptance of ""some"" responsibility for his crimes and his ""guarded” rehabilitation prospects; allowing a reduction for his early pleas of guilty; and making the finding of special circumstances that warranted a reduction in the non-parole period.
	


Discretion as to intervention


	
	It is a matter for the discretion of the Court as to whether it will intervene and re-sentence. Section 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides that the Court ""may in its discretion vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper"". Oddly, as if the default position is intervention, this is often referred to as a residual discretion to refrain from intervention: see, for example, Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1]. Nevertheless, the important thing to bear in mind is that it is for the Crown to persuade the Court that it should intervene: CMB v Attorney General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9; 317 ALR 308.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown reminded the Court of the primary purpose of prosecution appeals against sentence being ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"": Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [1]. It was submitted that intervention in this case would achieve a purpose of providing guidance as to the correct application of the totality principle in sentencing for multiple serious aggravated break and enter and robbery offences. More specifically, it was submitted that the sentence imposed in the instant case remained of importance, particularly in relation to the need for personal and general deterrence. The former was said to be particularly significant where the respondent committed the index offences whilst subject to a good behaviour bond imposed for a serious offence.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted that the period of about three years in which the respondent had been held in custody, bail refused, for an offence for which he was ultimately acquitted was a relevant matter to be taken into account in the consideration of the discretion as to intervention. Reference was made to the report by Mr Watson-Munro which included in the history provided by the respondent a reference to his acquittal in 2012. As indicated earlier (at [27]), it was then stated:
	


""Since that time until the period of his arrest his life spiralled downwards due to his unresolved depression, anxiety and escalating addiction.""


	
	The written submissions implied that this provided some causal link between the 3 years in custody and the respondent's relapse into drugs and criminal conduct following his release. The matter was developed in much the same way in oral submissions.
	
	
	I reject this submission. First, there is nothing in any of the evidence that makes good the contention that there was a causal link between the three years of incarceration from 2009 to 2012 and the respondent's ""unresolved depression, anxiety and escalating addiction"". Mr Watson-Munro certainly did not say that there was. Secondly, as senior counsel for the Crown pointed out, Mr Watson-Munro had reported in 2008 that the respondent had ""a protracted history of depression and anxiety"" which he attributed to the unfortunate circumstances of his upbringing. Accordingly, the evidence was contrary to counsel’s proposition of there being a causal link.
	
	
	The Court should intervene in order to maintain adequate standards of punishment for multiple serious offences such as the present; in particular to provide guidance as to a principled approach to sentencing in such a case.
	


Re-sentencing


	
	No evidence was proffered by the respondent on the issue of re-sentencing. Senior counsel for the Crown informed the Court that the respondent had not committed any disciplinary offences since he had been remanded in custody.
	
	
	I am persuaded that the indicative sentence for Offence 5, taking into account the two offences listed on a Form 1 document, but particularly that of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, was inadequate. I would adopt a starting point for the sentence for that offence of 6 years (as opposed to the 4 years 6 months the primary judge appears to have adopted). After reduction for the plea of guilty the indicative sentence for that offence will be 4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	I would otherwise adopt the same indicative sentences as identified by her Honour given that neither party asserted that there was anything erroneous about them.
	
	
	To properly reflect the totality of the respondent's criminality, there should be an aggregate sentence of 10 years. Neither party made any submission about the non-parole period. I consider that the finding of special circumstances made by the primary judge should be maintained. There should be a non-parole period of 6 years.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Crown appeal against sentence allowed.

2.   Sentence imposed in the District Court on 28 August 2015 quashed.

3.   Respondent sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. The sentence is to date from 27 October 2013. The non-parole period will expire on 26 October 2019 and the total term will expire on 26 October 2023. The respondent will become eligible for release on parole at the end of the non-parole period.

2769230,Trotter v R [2016] NSWCCA 57,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The applicant is charged with one count of knowingly taking part in the supply of cocaine contrary to the Drug Misuse And Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), s 25(1), being count 8 of an indictment comprising 18 counts against six accused. She sought leave to appeal from an interlocutory decision of Lakatos SC DCJ in which his Honour refused her application for a separate trial pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 21(2).

The Crown alleges that the applicant was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with three other accused including her husband, James Trotter, to supply cocaine. Separately, the Crown alleges the existence of a joint criminal enterprise to supply heroin involving four of the other accused. No involvement by the applicant in the supply of heroin is alleged.

By count 8 on the indictment, the Crown contends that the applicant knowingly took part in the supply of approximately 1.5 g of cocaine on 24 January 2014. The evidence proposed to be adduced to support that contention comprises intercepted phone and SMS conversations between James Trotter and the purchaser and between James Trotter and the applicant. The applicant’s case is that she was an innocent agent for her husband in the transaction.

Apart from the intercepts from 24 January 2014, which were said to be likely to take up about 30 minutes of a 5 or 6 week trial, there is no evidence directly implicating the applicant in the joint criminal enterprise to supply cocaine. However, the Crown contended that other evidence relating to that enterprise, including other phone intercept evidence and evidence of drugs and other items found in searches of the applicant’s premises and elsewhere, are relevant to proving the applicant’s knowing participation in the offence with which she is charged.

The applicant contended that the trial judge’s discretion miscarried in refusing to order that the applicant be tried separately. Specifically, she contended that his Honour erred by failing to have regard to a text message which was said to weigh against the proposition that the applicant was knowingly involved in the supply of cocaine and thus in favour of the granting of a separate trial; and that he had failed to turn his mind to the principles of joint criminal enterprise and the evidence required to satisfy them.

The Court held:

(1)   It is clear from his Honour’s reasons that he had regard to the terms of the text message sent on 24 January 2014. [50]

(2)   There was no error in his Honour’s approach to the material upon which the Crown proposed to rely to establish the joint criminal enterprise and the applicant’s involvement in it. [50]

(3)   In order to prove its charge against the applicant, the Crown will need to adduce evidence beyond that which directly relates to her. For that reason, the evidence relevant to the alleged joint criminal enterprise to supply cocaine will not have any substantial prejudicial effect on the applicant’s case. [53]-[54]

(4)   The mere fact that the trial will involve evidence unrelated to the applicant, including the evidence relating to the alleged joint enterprise to supply heroin, is not sufficient to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice if a separate trial is not ordered. The applicant did not demonstrate that the evidence to be adduced in respect of that joint enterprise will be overly lengthy or prejudicial to her. Further, the trial judge will be able to give directions which draw a clear distinction between the two joint criminal enterprises. [56]-[58]

R v Chami; R v Sheikh [2002] NSWCCA 136; 128 A Crim R 428, distinguished

(5)   His Honour did not err in refusing to order a separate trial. [51]-[52]

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The applicant, Erin Trotter, seeks leave to appeal from an interlocutory decision of Lakatos SC DCJ in which his Honour refused her application for a separate trial pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 21(2).
	
	
	The applicant is charged with one count of knowingly taking part in the supply of cocaine contrary to the Drug Misuse And Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), s 25(1), being count 8 of an indictment comprising 18 counts against six accused. A joint trial is presently set down to be heard in July 2016.
	
	
	The other accused on the indictment are the applicant’s husband, James Trotter; her father-in-law, William Trotter; her mother-in-law, Sharon Trotter; her brother-in-law, Trent Trotter; and David Bowman, who is Sharon Trotter’s brother.
	


The Crown case against the applicant


	
	The Crown alleges that the applicant was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with William, James and Trent Trotter to supply cocaine. Separately, the Crown alleges the existence of a joint criminal enterprise to supply heroin. The parties to that enterprise are said to be Sharon, Trent and James Trotter and David Bowman. No involvement by the applicant in the supply of heroin is alleged.
	
	
	The Crown contends that the structure of the joint enterprise involving the applicant was that orders for cocaine would be communicated to James or Trent Trotter by telephone or SMS from another participant in the joint enterprise, Jason Haidar. Mr Haidar would collect the drug either from the Mascot premises of the applicant and James Trotter or from the Rosebery premises of William Trotter. Mr Haidar is deceased.
	
	
	By count 8 on the indictment, the Crown contends that the applicant knowingly took part in the supply of approximately 1.5 g of cocaine on 24 January 2014 at Mascot. The evidence proposed to be adduced to support the applicant’s participation in that transaction includes intercepted SMS messages and telephone conversations between James Trotter and Jason Haidar and between James Trotter and the applicant. Those intercepts comprise the only direct evidence implicating the applicant in the joint enterprise, and it is necessary to set them out in order to understand the submissions of both the applicant and the Crown.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that, on 24 January 2014, Mr Haidar made an arrangement by SMS with James Trotter for the supply of cocaine. The following exchange occurred in those messages:
	


“[16:14, Jason Haidar] Was gonna come and see ya … MSG me when ya home

…

[16:28, Jason Haidar] … I need a full length if [sic] cooper and half length for work that sweet?

[16:29 James Trotter] Only got two lengths there bra n she doesn’t know what’s doin”


	
	Shortly after that SMS exchange, at 16.31, James Trotter called the applicant. The following conversation was intercepted:
	


“[James Trotter] Erin

[Applicant] Hi

[James Trotter] Alright, listen I need you to go into my, into our room

[Applicant] Mmm

[James Trotter] Um, grab out, in my um, my G-Star jacket

[Applicant] Yeah

[James Trotter] In the pocket, grab out them two things,

…

[James Trotter] You got it?

[Applicant] Yeah

…

[James Trotter] Now, those 2 things that you got in your hands I need you to split 1 and there should be a spare thing in that same pocket that you grabbed them out of.

[Applicant] So …

[James Trotter] So split 1 and put the other bit back.

[Applicant] Ok

[James Trotter] Alright now, umm, my mates gunna come past, I’ll just tell him to call me when he’s downstairs, just let him in, it’s Jason, the bloke who was at our house on Sunday.

[Applicant] I don’t feel comfortable with that, I don’t know who that is.

[James Trotter] Baby he’s harmless, I’ve known him all my life.

[Applicant] Alright.”


	
	At 16.44, Mr Haidar sent a text to James Trotter to let him know he was at the Mascot premises. James Trotter again called the applicant, as follows:
	


“[James Trotter] Babe, can you grab, meet him down at the security door please

[Applicant] Umm, so how, what am I giving

[James Trotter] Just the one and the half

[Applicant] The one and the … ok

[James Trotter] Alright bye

[Applicant] Bye”


	
	As previously indicated, the only direct evidence in relation to the applicant are the telephone intercepts from 24 January 2014. The Crown case as to the joint enterprise to supply cocaine otherwise relies on further intercepts between William, James and Trent Trotter on four additional dates in January and February 2014, none of which directly relate to or refer to the applicant; the location of 1.01 g of cocaine found on the person of Mr Haidar when he was searched by police on 11 February 2014; and the location of 6.23 grams of cocaine found at the Mascot premises, in a jacket similar to that described in the intercepted phone conversations, on 21 February 2015.
	
	
	The applicant has not been charged with any offence in relation to the cocaine found in the execution of the search warrant at the Mascot premises where the applicant and James Trotter resided. However, the Crown’s submissions on the question of separate trials below state that the Crown intends to rely upon finding the cocaine in the Mascot premises in order to prove the applicant’s participation in the joint criminal enterprise. It is necessary to briefly outline the evidence in relation to that search.
	
	
	The applicant was present with her newborn baby and a female friend during the search. James Trotter, who was not present, was advised by police that the search was being conducted. He was subsequently observed driving well in excess of the speed limit before running a red light in Mascot. He was stopped due to his manner of driving and then arrested.
	
	
	A black “G-Star” brand jacket, which the Crown alleges is the jacket referred to in the conversation set out above at [8], was found in the main bedroom of the Mascot premises. In the pockets of the jacket were plastic bags containing what was found to be 6.23 g of cocaine and a quantity of heroin, as well as empty plastic bags, a pocket scale and a plastic spoon. James Trotter was charged with a deemed supply offence in relation to the cocaine and a possession offence in relation to the heroin.
	
	
	Other drugs were also found in the main bedroom, namely, 15.74 g of Alprazolam (Xanax) and 0.69 g of MDMA, both found in plastic bags in the pockets of a different jacket, and 4.19 g of 1,4-Butanediol, found under the bed. James Trotter was charged with possession offences in relation to each of those substances. In addition, he was charged with a goods in custody offence in relation to $1,950 in Australian currency found in the wardrobe in the main bedroom.
	
	
	During the course of the hearing in this Court, there was discussion about what aspects of the evidence, if any, relating to the joint enterprise to supply cocaine which does not directly implicate the applicant will be admissible as against her. We will return to that issue below, but pause to observe that any question of admissibility of the evidence will be a matter for determination by the trial judge.
	
	
	Evidence will also be adduced at the joint trial relating to the joint enterprise to supply heroin. It was not suggested that that evidence would be admissible as against the applicant.
	


Legal principles relating to joint trials


	
	The Criminal Procedure Act, s 29 provides for hearings involving multiple accused persons, as follows:
	


“29   When more than one offence may be heard at the same time

…

(2)   A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to offences alleged to have been committed by 2 or more accused persons in any of the following circumstances:

(a)   the accused persons and the prosecutor consent,

(b)   the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances,

(c)   the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character.

(3)   Proceedings related to 2 or more offences or 2 or more accused persons may not be heard together if the court is of the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.”


	
	The applicant sought an order under s 21(2). That section provides:
	


“If of the opinion:

(a)   that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or

(b)   that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.”


	
	The determination of whether to order separate trials was described by Allsop P in DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [77] as:
	


“… a procedural question involving a true discretion in the sense of a power involving a choice for or in respect of its exercise even though the condition for its exercise may have been established.”


	
	Being a discretionary decision, error of the kind identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505 must be demonstrated for the applicant to be successful: see DAO at [78] per Allsop P; DSJ v R; NS v R [2014] NSWCCA 77 at [61] per Gleeson JA, with whom Hidden J agreed. Thus it must be shown that the trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, erred in acting on a wrong principle; allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him; mistook the facts; failed to take into account some material consideration; or that the result is unreasonable or plainly unjust such that the Court may infer a failure to properly exercise the discretion.
	
	
	The rationale for joint trials, and the circumstances in which applications for separate trials will be granted, were considered by the High Court in Webb & Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41, a South Australian murder case in which an application for a separate trial by the second appellant, Ms Hay, had been refused by the trial judge.
	
	
	Toohey J, with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed, held, at 88-89:
	


“… when accused are charged with committing a crime jointly, prima facie there should be a joint trial. There are administrative factors pointing in that direction but, more importantly, consideration by the same jury at the same trial is likely to avoid inconsistent verdicts, particularly when each accused tries to cast the blame on the other or others. There are of course dangers for an accused in a joint trial by reason of the admission of evidence which would not be admitted at the trial of one accused. That risk must be obviated by express and careful directions to the jury as to the use they may make of the evidence so far as it concerns each accused.

In the end the critical question before an appellate court in these circumstances is whether, by reason of the joint trial, there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice or, put another way, whether improper prejudice has been created against an accused.

In the present case adequate directions were given by the trial judge … Properly instructed by the trial judge, as they were, the jury were capable of appreciating the use they could make of evidence as against each of the appellants. It has not been shown that a substantial miscarriage of justice is likely to have occurred.” (citations omitted)


	
	In R v Domican and Drummond (No 2) (1990) 46 A Crim R 408 at 423, Kirby ACJ (Campbell and Studdert JJ agreeing) stated as follows:
	


“The principle to be applied is not in doubt. It is that separate trials should be granted if to refuse them may result in a miscarriage of justice: see Annakin (1988) 37 A Crim R 131 at 138. Normally, where a common purpose is alleged (as in the count charging conspiracy) the persons involved should be jointly tried: Merritt (1985) 19 A Crim R 360 at 364-365. In such circumstances, separate trials should only be ordered where the evidence against each of the accused is “significantly different”: Darby (1982) 148 CLR 668 at 678. The mere fact that some evidence against one of the accused may be admitted in a joint trial which would be inadmissible against the other in a separate trial does not, of itself, warrant the separate trial of the accused or the setting aside of a conviction entered against one or both of them: Guldur (1986) 8 NSWLR 12 at 16; 25 A Crim R 271 at 275.”


	
	The circumstances in which a separate trial will be ordered were considered by Hunt J in R v Middis (unreported, NSW Supreme Court, 27 March 1991), at 4, as follows:
	


“Briefly, the relevant principles are that:

(1) where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him, and

(2) where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him, and

(3) where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material,

a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.”


	
	Hunt J elaborated on the principle, as follows, at 5:
	


“… as some prejudice to one or other accused is inevitable in any joint trial, it must be shown by an applicant for a separate trial that the particular prejudice upon which reliance is placed by him would - if it arises result in positive injustice to him in a joint trial … Obviously enough, all manner of prejudice may be surmised which, if it arises, would not result in such positive injustice. In my opinion, an applicant for a separate trial must demonstrate that there is a real risk (as opposed to a remote possibility) that there will arise in a joint trial prejudice of the type which - if it arises would result in positive injustice to him.”


	
	Hunt J’s formulation has been frequently approved in this Court: see R v Baartman (unreported, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 6 October 1994); R v Chami; R v Sheikh [2002] NSWCCA 136; 128 A Crim R 428 at [12]; Symss v The Queen [2003] NSWCCA 77 at [69]; R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190 at [38]; Pham v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 3 at [10]; Madubuko, Henry Ugo v R [2011] NSWCCA 135 at [28].
	
	
	In Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190, Adams J, with whom Spigelman CJ agreed, expanded on Hunt J’s formulation as follows:
	


“39   Two phrases in this summary need some explanation. In ordinary speech, ‘immeasurably’ usually connotes something of such an enormous degree that it is beyond measurement. It is obvious that it was here not used in this sense. I think that his Honour meant ‘significant, though incommensurable’. The starting point is that the inadmissible, prejudicial material is completely irrelevant. If, when placed on the scales, it would be likely to turn a potential acquittal to a conviction then this would, I think, amount to ‘positive injustice’. Of course, the likelihood cannot be measured: if it is real, as distinct from inconsequential, having regard both to its inherent character and the context of the Crown case, then the trial must necessarily embarrass the affected accused. The question then arises whether the risk that the material might be placed by the jury on the scales is such that the trial miscarried. It should also be noted that Hunt J necessarily assumed that clear and emphatic directions would be given to the jury that the inadmissible material must be ignored and the point made by the summary is that, in the posited circumstances, such directions may well be insufficient to avoid a miscarriage and separate trials should be ordered to prevent such an occurrence.

40   I interpolate that, with unfeigned respect, I am doubtful that the weakness of the applicant’s case as compared with that of the co-accused against whom it is proposed to tender the prejudicial evidence can be a relevant consideration. Assume that the case against the co-accused was much weaker than the applicant, even with the prejudicial evidence. If there was a significant risk that the prejudicial evidence could be used by the jury adversely to the applicant and that evidence was itself significantly prejudicial, I am unable to see why the mere fact that it was adduced in a weaker co-offender’s case is material. Indeed, the opposite would seem to be the case since, if the co-accused’s case was weak, or weaker than the applicant’s, the prejudicial evidence might well assume even more importance than otherwise. As it seems to me, with respect, the crucial issue is the potential effect of the inadmissible evidence on the jury’s consideration of the applicant’s case.”

	Both the applicant and the Crown placed some emphasis on Chami; Sheikh. That case concerned a trial on an indictment consisting of 19 charges relating to five gang rapes and to offences of perverting the course of justice. It was alleged that each of the applicants had been involved in one of the incidents. They sought leave to appeal against the refusal of the trial judge to order that they be tried individually.
	
	
	The trial judge dealt with Sheikh’s application for a separate trial on the basis that if the application were successful, charges against Sheikh and his co-accused in the counts relating to him would be heard jointly. It appeared that his Honour did not consider the possibility of a trial against Sheikh alone. Ipp AJA, with whom Bell J agreed, held that that was in error and that the Court, for that reason, was required to exercise the discretion afresh. His Honour determined that a separate trial in relation to Sheikh should be ordered. Ipp AJA’s reasoning was as follows:
	


“17   The central point made by [counsel for Sheikh] is that while Sheikh was involved in the first incident he was not involved in the others. Sheikh has been joined in an indictment which contains 19 counts, only two of which are in respect of him. None of the evidence that relates to the other 17 counts bears on Sheikh’s guilt or otherwise in respect of the two charges he faces. The trial is likely to last some 12 weeks and involve some 70 witnesses. The charges against Sheikh should not take more than two weeks (and could take less) and will involve far fewer witnesses.

18   Essentially, the prejudice that is likely to be suffered by Sheikh were the trial not to be separated falls into two categories. The first, and most serious, is that evidence relating to sexual assaults and other sexual misconduct, inadmissible against him, would be led at the trial.

19   The conduct giving rise to the 19 counts on the indictment can only be described as brutal, cruel, callous and horrifying. The alleged offenders are all, or all but one, from the same ethnic group. The details of the offences are likely to arouse extremely hostile feelings against these persons. The common ethnicity of the offenders could well give rise to generalised feelings of disgust and anger. It is possible that the jury may be influenced by such feelings, brought about by the conduct of all the offenders, when considering their verdict in respect of the counts alleged against Sheikh.

20   It is true that the trial judge would no doubt give very careful and explicit directions warning the jury against allowing any such feelings to affect their judgment. But in the highly charged atmosphere of such a trial where there will be a mass of evidence of these appalling crimes, it may be difficult for a jury, with the best will in the world, to remain entirely objective. In summary, I think that there is a risk of guilt by association.

…

22   I turn to another category of prejudice that, while relevant, is less important. The trial will be a very long one. As I have said, several weeks of the trial will involve evidence unrelated to Sheikh. It is arguably unfair to require him to bear the vast and unnecessary cost of legal representation that would be required in such a lengthy case when only such a small proportion of it involves the charges faced by him.”


	
	The Crown referred to R v Al Khair (unreported, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 20 June 1994), and Fattal v R [2006] NSWCCA 359 as authorities relating to evidence of phone conversations to which the accused was not a party. In each case, the relevance and therefore the admissibility of evidence of telephone intercepts not involving the applicant was in issue.
	
	
	In Al Khair, Mrs Norhan Al Khair, her brother, her sister-in-law, and a fourth participant, were charged with a number of offences relating to the supply of heroin. The fourth participant pleaded guilty. Each of the other accused was found guilty in a joint trial and each appealed against conviction. On her appeal against conviction, Norhan Al Khair contended that the trial judge had erred in refusing her application for a separate trial. That ground could only succeed if a number of telephone intercept records had wrongly been admitted into evidence against her: see at 37. Norhan Al Khair submitted that the evidence was inadmissible as against her because, although she was referred to in them, she did not participate in any of the telephone calls. That submission was rejected. Priestley JA, with whom Gleeson CJ and Wood J agreed, held at 35:
	


“This submission seems to me to miss the point of the evidence, or at least the point of an important aspect of it. The evidence could be taken by the jury as showing that a drug supply business was being carried on at the premises. That fact, if the jury accepted it as the fact, was relevant in the case against Mrs Norhan Al Khair, even although she [was not staying at the premises at the relevant time] because the jury were also entitled on the evidence, which showed a considerable intimacy between Mr R Al Khair and his sister Norhan, to conclude that if a drug business was being conducted from the premises when Mrs Norhan Al Khair went to stay there, then she knew of it, and this in turn was relevant to the question whether her anxiety about the arrival of Mrs El Ahmed was about the arrival of heroin for supply.”


	
	In Fattal, the appellant was tried for an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of ecstasy. The Crown case was that Fattal participated in a joint criminal enterprise in relation to that supply by picking up the drugs in Sydney and attempting to take them to Brisbane, in the company of another man. Evidence was led of telephone intercepts to which the appellant was not a party but which made reference to his role in the enterprise. Sully J (McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreeing) considered that the telephone intercepts were probative of the joint enterprise. His Honour held, at [42]:
	


“It is, of course, the fact that the appellant was not a party to any of the conversations. There was, however, undisputed evidence in the Crown case that put the appellant at the actual handing over of the tablets to Forrest; and that put the appellant, very shortly thereafter, in a hotel room as a joint occupant overnight with Forrest of the room in anticipation of their joint flying to Queensland on the following day. Had the appellant not been present at Rockdale at the time of the supply to Forrest as agent for the Queensland buyers; and had there been no subsequent attempt at joint travel by him with Forrest to Queensland, then, absent any other evidence of things actually said or done by the appellant himself, the evidence of the contents of the conversations would have been admissible, in my opinion, in order to prove the relevant joint criminal enterprise, and in order to prove that the principals in the enterprise, who were conversing, were intending to make use of the appellant. Without more, the contents of the conversations could not have established that in fact the appellant participated to the intended extent in the particular joint criminal enterprise. That potential gap was filled, - or more precisely it was in my opinion open to the jury to find that it had been filled, - by the evidence, essentially undisputed, of relevant prior associations; of relevant presence; and of relevant subsequent conduct; all of which were consistent, to say the least, with participation as alleged in the supply charged.”

Primary judge’s reasons


	
	The primary judge, at the commencement of his reasons, appropriately referred to the totality of the charges on the indictment. This was necessary in order to put the charge against the applicant in context. His Honour next referred to the principles that governed the determination of an application for a separate trial and to Al Khair and Fattal. His Honour then referred in summary form to the evidence by reference to the revised Crown case statement.
	
	
	His Honour, after outlining the evidence intended to be adduced against the applicant, summarised the Crown’s position as follows:
	


“In short, the Crown contends that the large majority of the evidence establishes the joint criminal enterprise between the co-accused to supply heroin and cocaine. The specific evidence relevant to 24 January 2014, according to the Crown, evidences Erin Trotter’s participation in that joint criminal enterprise. Accordingly, it is submitted that the evidence is relevant and admissible against Erin Trotter.”


	
	Strictly, his Honour is incorrect in this statement to the extent that he stated, or at least implied, that all the evidence relating to both joint criminal enterprises was relevant to the application. No complaint is made as to that overstatement and it is apparent from his Honour’s reasons overall that this was a slip and did not reflect a finding that evidence in relation to the heroin was to be adduced against the applicant.
	
	
	After referring to the telephone and SMS intercepts of 24 January 2014, his Honour noted that there was no other direct evidence against the applicant in relation to her involvement in the actual supply of or in a joint criminal enterprise to supply prohibited drugs. His Honour also referred to the applicant’s submissions which emphasised the limited nature of the direct evidence against her and of the evidence directed to her involvement in a joint criminal enterprise; to her argument that no inference could be drawn from the evidence that she knew that cocaine or any other prohibited drug was involved; to the submission that the evidence against her was weaker than and different from the evidence against the other accused persons; and to the applicant’s contention that there was a large volume of material proposed to be presented by the Crown that was not admissible against her but would be highly prejudicial to her.
	
	
	His Honour accepted that there was “some merit” in the applicant’s contention that the case against her was significantly weaker than that against the other accused. However, his Honour noted that, apart from the quantity of the evidence against the other accused, the applicant had failed to articulate a way in which that material would be prejudicial to her. His Honour considered that the applicant’s contention that the evidence to be adduced at the joint trial that did not relate to her was ‘overwhelming’ evidence could go two ways in that:
	


“… the comparative sparsity of evidence against [the applicant] may provide a powerful argument that the latter was not involved in any joint criminal enterprise or did not have the requisite knowledge.”


	
	In the result, his Honour considered:
	


“Given that appropriate directions will be provided about admissible evidence to each accused, the jury will, I hope, be under no illusion of the weight of the evidence against the other co-accused as any legitimate part in their decision-making process so far as Erin Trotter is concerned.”


	
	His Honour further commented that the authorities to which he had referred supported the proposition that participation in a joint criminal enterprise could be proved by evidence that did not directly involve an accused person, in this case the applicant. His Honour concluded that the applicant had not established that there was a risk that the joint trial would result in a positive injustice to her.
	


Submissions


	
	The applicant’s case is that she was an innocent agent for her husband James Trotter in the one transaction in relation to which she is charged. She submitted that the primary judge erred in failing to make reference to that part of the intercepted message from her husband to Jason Haidar that stated “she doesn’t know what’s doin’”, which she contended supported her case and demonstrated the weakness of the Crown case that she was part of the larger joint criminal enterprise. In oral argument, when pressed to identify a ground on which it might be found that the trial judge erred in the exercise of his discretion, counsel for the applicant further submitted:
	


“The ground is that he hasn’t properly addressed his mind to the concept of joint criminal enterprise so far as the applicant is concerned.”


	
	The import of the applicant’s submissions was that, having regard to its onus, the Crown needed to be able to point to evidence which implicated the applicant in a joint enterprise beyond the isolated event of which there was direct evidence. In the absence of being able to do so, she contended that she should be tried separately on the sole charge against her.
	
	
	The applicant further contended that the trial judge failed to take into account that there was no evidence of the applicant’s presence at or encouragement of the commission of any crime apart from that with which she is charged. Accordingly, there was a real risk that the case against her, which, without the other evidence upon which the Crown sought to rely, was weak, would thereby “be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material”: see the third proposition stated in Middis, set out above.
	
	
	In relation to the prejudice to her if she was tried jointly with the other co-accused, the applicant contended primarily that the jury would be overwhelmed by the quantity of evidence relating to the other accused and would be unable to put it to one side in considering the charge against the applicant: see Chami; Sheikh at [17]. In that context, the applicant pointed out that the evidence directly against her would take about 30 minutes in a 5 or 6 week trial.
	
	
	The applicant also contended that as the applicant is the wife of one of the “main players” in the alleged joint enterprise, it would be very difficult, despite directions, for a jury to disregard the evidence in relation to him which was not admissible against her.
	
	
	The Crown did not contest that the direct evidence against the applicant was confined to the intercepted messages on 24 January 2014. However, the Crown submitted that certain of the evidence not directly relating to the applicant but relating to the joint enterprise would be admissible as against her. In particular, the Crown contended that, in order to prove that the applicant was knowingly taking part in the supply of cocaine, the Crown would need to lead evidence of previous and subsequent occasions on which James Trotter supplied Jason Haidar with cocaine as well as evidence of the cocaine found in the Mascot premises. The additional evidence would also include telephone conversations in which James Trotter is alleged to have arranged the supply of drugs. In turn, those telephone conversations would introduce the relationship of James with his brother Trent and his father William. The Crown informed his Honour that it also intended to adduce evidence of the arrest of Mr Haidar and the location of cocaine in his possession on 11 February 2014, allegedly supplied to him by James Trotter on that day.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this evidence was relevant to the charge against the applicant and that the Crown would seek to adduce it regardless of whether she was tried together with the other accused or separately. However, as the evidence was common to the charges against the other persons alleged to be involved in the joint criminal enterprise to supply cocaine, a joint trial was appropriate: see the Criminal Procedure Act, s 29(2).
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that as the evidence of the telephone intercepts that is alleged to directly implicate the applicant also forms the basis of a charge against James Trotter there was a risk of different and therefore inconsistent verdicts should there be separate trials.
	
	
	As noted above, the Crown did not suggest that the evidence relating to the joint criminal enterprise to supply heroin would be admissible as against the applicant. However, it disputed that the mere quantity of evidence involved was relevantly prejudicial.
	


Consideration


	
	It must be remembered that the question whether to order a separate trial involves a discretionary determination, which only invites appellate intervention if error in the House v The King sense is established. The two specific errors identified by the applicant were a failure to take into account the terms of the SMS message from James Trotter to Jason Haidar, referred to above at [40], and a failure to address the matter of joint criminal enterprise from the applicant’s position.
	
	
	In our opinion, neither error has been made out. Although the primary judge did not set out the terms of the SMS message, his Honour referred to the Crown case as set out in the revised Crown case statement. In dealing with the Crown case against the applicant, his Honour referred to the “intercept material on 24 January 2014”. It could not be contended that his Honour referred to that material without intending to refer to its content. As for the second error, his Honour expressly addressed the material upon which the Crown proposed to rely to establish the joint criminal enterprise and the applicant’s involvement in it.
	
	
	The applicant has failed to demonstrate any error in the primary judge’s discretionary determination.
	
	
	We also do not consider, having had regard to the evidence that the Crown proposes to adduce against the applicant, that the failure to order a separate trial will result in a miscarriage of justice in the sense explained in the authorities to which we have referred.
	
	
	There is no doubt, as the applicant submitted, that the direct evidence against her is within a very short compass. If that was the only evidence that was sought to be adduced by the Crown against her, there may have been good reason to accede to her application. However, we are satisfied that the Crown has demonstrated that, in order to prove its case on the charge against her, it will be necessary to adduce evidence which goes beyond the telephone intercepts between the applicant and her husband and between James Trotter and Jason Haidar on 24 January 2014. That additional evidence will be necessary, inter alia, to prove the nature of the substance that the applicant supplied to Mr Haidar. The additional evidence will also be relevant to the joint criminal enterprise that the Crown seeks to prove, not only against the applicant but against the other accused insofar as the joint criminal enterprise relates to the supply of cocaine: see the discussion above in Al Khair and Fattal. In that respect, it is relevant that the offences, including that with which the applicant is charged, arise out of a series of transactions between the same persons in respect of the same prohibited substance.
	
	
	Accordingly, contrary to the applicant’s submission, the evidence sought to be adduced against her is more extensive than the limited evidence of the telephone intercepts on 24 January 2014. For that reason, the evidence relevant to the joint criminal enterprise to supply cocaine will not have any substantial prejudicial effect. In that regard, it is not sufficient that the evidence will be against her interest.
	
	
	As indicated, it will be a matter for the trial judge to rule upon the admissibility of the evidence at trial, including as against which accused the evidence adduced is admissible. However, for the reasons expressed, the evidence upon which the Crown seeks to rely is likely to be relevant in part to prove the offence of supply with which the applicant is charged and in other respects to prove the joint criminal enterprise alleged by the Crown. As such, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that there is likely to be any miscarriage of justice if she is tried jointly with the other accused charged in relation to the joint criminal enterprise to supply cocaine.
	
	
	The applicant is not alleged to be part of the joint criminal enterprise relating to the supply of heroin. To that extent, she will be involved in a trial in respect of which there will be a body of evidence which is not sought to be adduced against her. However, there was no application to sever the counts relating to the supply of heroin. The mere fact that there will be evidence unrelated to her does not of itself establish that there will be a miscarriage of justice if a separate trial is not ordered.
	
	
	We also do not accept the applicant’s submission that the present case is analogous to Chami; Sheikh. The evidence in that case was particularly prejudicial because of its emotive nature and because of the risk that the jury would come to generalisations by reference to the common ethnicity of the accused. That is not the present case. To the extent that Chami; Sheikh is authority for the proposition that there may be prejudice in the cost of a lengthy trial on irrelevant issues, it also makes clear that that factor is of lesser importance and the applicant has not established that that aspect of the trial that does not relate to her will be overly lengthy or prejudicial to her.
	
	
	Further, in this case there is a clear distinction in the two joint criminal enterprises brought against the various accused persons, one involving cocaine and one involving heroin. It was not suggested that the evidence relating to the two alleged joint criminal enterprises overlapped or overlapped in any significant way. The Court considers that this is a case where the trial judge would clearly be able to give directions to the jury appropriately dealing with any potential prejudice that might arise from the commonality of personnel involved in each enterprise.
	


Conclusion


	
	The issues raised by the applicant were of some substance and leave to appeal should be allowed, but the appeal should be dismissed.

2769231,R v El-Chami [2016] NSWSC 445,"Judgment


	
	Mr Basem Salameh was murdered at his home in Granville during the early hours of 14 August 2013, having been beaten to death with makeshift weapons, including a piece of timber and metal poles. The offender, Mr El-Chami and two co-accused were later each charged with his murder. Mr El-Chami did not deny having been at Mr Salameh’s home before he was killed, but he always denied having been present, or involved in his murder. Accordingly, he pleaded not guilty to the murder charge.
	
	
	At the commencement of the trial in November 2015, it was announced to the Court that Mr El-Chami had made an offer to plead guilty to a lesser charge, an offence under s 316(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which had been accepted by the Director of Public Prosecutions. He was then arraigned on that charge, to which he entered a plea of guilty. The charge to which the plea was entered was:
	


”Whereas Ahmed Kaddour and Daniel Azar having committed the serious indictable offence of murder, Mohamed El-Chami between 13 August 2013 and 21 August 2013 at Granville in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, believing that Ahmed Kaddour and Daniel Azar had committed that offence and knowing that he has information which might be of material assistance in securing the prosecution of Ahmed Kaddour and Daniel Azar for that offence, without reasonable excuse, failed to bring that information to the attention of a member of the Police Force.”


	
	The sentence hearing was later twice adjourned, while Mr El-Chami provided certain assistance to the Crown. After the hearing further submissions and an affidavit sworn by a solicitor employed in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, concerning, amongst other things, the charges laid against Mr El-Chami and the dates they were laid were provided.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami now stands for sentence for his s 316(1) offence.
	


The offence


	
	Mr El-Chami first signed a statement as to the evidence which he would be prepared to give, on 20 August 2013, after having been twice interviewed by police. They did not believe what he there said about not having been involved in Mr Salameh’s killing, with the result that he was charged that day, initially with being an accessory to murder and then with murder. It was common ground, however, that CCTV footage soon came into the hands of investigating police, which supported what Mr El-Chami had said in his statement. Despite this, that footage was neither served on Mr El-Chami, nor considered by the Crown, until after he first made an offer in 2015, to enter a plea to a s 316 offence.
	
	
	From the events which then unfolded, it became apparent that had the CCTV footage been examined earlier, Mr El-Chami would not have faced a murder trial.
	
	
	There has never been any satisfactory explanation given to the Court as to how it came to be that the exculpatory CCTV footage was neither viewed by the Crown, nor served on Mr El-Chami, until shortly before the murder trial was due to commence.
	
	
	On being charged with murder Mr El-Chami was bail refused. Given, even then, the apparent weakness of the Crown case, Johnson J later granted Mr El-Chami bail on strict conditions, notwithstanding the serious charge which he faced. Those conditions were later varied, in various respects, but it was not until after the entry of Mr El-Chami’s plea to the s 316 offence, that onerous conditions such as to daily reporting and curfew were removed.
	
	
	The parties reached an agreement as to other relevant facts and Mr El-Chami and Superintendent Scott Whyte also provided affidavit evidence. They were not required for cross-examination.
	
	
	That evidence established that Mr Salameh’s body was discovered by Housing Commission contractors at 9.30 am on 14 August 2013 at the complex managed by the Department of Housing, where he lived. That complex comprised a number of bed sit units and common recreational areas. Police, who were nearby, having responded to a complaint made by one of Mr Salameh’s neighbours during the night, then began the investigation into the murder.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami was soon identified to be one of the suspects. Mr El-Chami, Daniel Azar, and Ahmed Kaddour had often visited Mr Salameh at his unit and were well-known to other residents of the complex. Mr Salameh had himself called police at about 3:45 am on 13 August 2013, after a disturbance during which another resident, “Ray”, had picked up a pot plant and thrown it through his glass window. “Ray” had apparently been involved in a fight or scuffle with Mr Salameh and Mr Azar.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami was also at Mr Salameh’s unit when police and an ambulance attended after this fight. “Ray” was then taken to hospital and arrangements were made for Mr Salameh to attend the police station the following day, to provide a statement, but he did not attend.
	
	
	On 14 August 2013, police obtained statements from various neighbours which indicated that Mr El-Chami, Mr Azar and Mr Kaddour had all been at Mr Salameh’s unit during the previous day. The sound of glass smashing had been heard and two of the young men had been seen climbing out of a window from Mr Salameh’s unit, at about 8 pm the previous night. Sounds of a disturbance and hitting or banging in the early hours of 14 August, had also been heard. One resident had heard the window of his own unit being smashed during the night and then called police. They were attending that call when Mr Salameh’s body was found.
	
	
	On examination, Mr Salameh was found to have died as the result of multiple blunt force impacts to his head, which had resulted in fractures to the base of his skull and nasal bones; an acute subdural haemorrhage to the left side of his brain; and multifocal subarachnoid haemorrhage. There were also impact injuries to his neck, which had fractured the cricoid cartilage around his larynx; as well as multiple blunt force injuries to his trunk, resulting in numerous bilateral rib fractures. It was the injuries to his head which on later examination were found likely to have been fatal. The injury to Mr Salameh’s larynx may also have contributed to his death.
	
	
	In the opinion of the examining pathologist, whilst it was possible that all of Mr Salameh’s injuries had been inflicted in a couple of minutes, the most likely scenario was that they were inflicted over a longer period of time, during a sustained attack.
	
	
	Mr Salameh’s body was found covered with a pile of linen and a piece of table top. His unit was in disarray and there was substantial blood staining throughout his apartment. Fingerprints and DNA samples were obtained from a number of items. A red handled hacksaw, a white piece of timber with two nails protruding and two bloodstained metal poles were found near his body. An unspent bullet had been placed in his mouth.
	
	
	Shortly before midnight on 15 August 2013, police arrested Mr Azar and Mr El-Chami. They were taken to Parramatta Police Station, where a covert listening device was used to record a conversation during which Mr El-Chami said to Mr Azar that: “I didn’t do nothing, it wasn’t me bro.” And: “I didn’t do shit anyway, you know.”
	
	
	Then, during a recorded interview Mr El-Chami was asked whether he had any knowledge about Mr Salameh’s murder, which he denied. He told police that he had slept overnight at Mr Salameh’s home and that he would smoke marijuana there, chill out and smoke bongs; that he had still been there the following day when Mr Salameh told he and Mr Azar to leave; and that “Biggie”, whose name might be “Ahmed”, also went to the unit.
	
	
	When questioned about when he first became aware that Mr Salameh was dead, Mr El-Chami variously claimed to have been told by his mum; to have heard about it on the news; to not have realised that it was Mr Salameh (as opposed to “Ray”) who had died, and to have only become aware when advised by police after his arrest. He also said “I didn’t know nothing happened to Basem” and denied knowing who killed Mr Salameh.
	
	
	During his interview Mr Azar admitted that he had been present at Mr Salameh’s unit at the time of the altercation with “Ray” on 13 August 2013, but he denied having been present at the unit during the night of 13/14 August.
	
	
	Both Mr El-Chami and Mr Azar were then released without charge.
	
	
	Over the weekend of Saturday, 17 and Sunday, 18 August Mr Azar had a number of conversations with members of his family, during which he made admissions about his involvement in Mr Salameh’s killing. Some of those admissions were made in Mr El-Chami’s presence.
	
	
	On 19 August 2013, various members of Mr Azar’s family provided statements to police about his admissions. That afternoon he and Mr El-Chami were again arrested. Mr Azar then claimed that Mr Salameh had been assaulted by an unnamed person; that Mr El-Chami and Mr Kaddour had also been present; and that they had endeavoured to stop an unidentified fourth man from attacking Mr Salameh. He claimed, however, to have cut Mr Salameh’s throat with a saw in order to, in effect, put him out of his misery. On autopsy, however, no evidence that Mr Salameh’s throat had been cut was found. Mr Azar also claimed that after the attack, all four had left the unit. Mr Azar was then charged with the murder.
	
	
	On 19 August police also requested that Mr El-Chami attend for further questioning. When he attended with his mother he was entered into custody as a volunteer and not under arrest. He was cautioned and consented to being further interviewed. A lengthy interview ensued, during which he told police about an interaction between Mr Salameh and Mr Azar at some time after the incident involving “Ray”, during which Mr Azar had reacted angrily to a perceived suggestion of being gay and that he had punched Mr Salameh. It was then that Mr Salameh had told them both to leave the unit and they had subsequently met up with Mr Kaddour.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami then gave an account which included that Mr Kaddour and Mr Azar had gone back up to the unit, while he waited in the street for 20 minutes to half an hour, before he went back to see what was taking so long and they left. He said that everything was then normal. He also told police: “If I, if I done something to my own fault I take the rap for it but not for anybody else. If they’ve done something that they’ve done they haven’t told me …”.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami also said that he had not told police about the incident of Mr Azar and Mr Kaddour going back up to the unit, when he had first been interviewed because “I was zanied and I didn’t remember and when I woke up clearly I did get a bit of memory back and yeah, that is correct. I was in the street for half an hour, twenty minutes. I went back up and I did, they exited the door”. “And like I said between that time I do not know what happened in that unit.”
	
	
	Mr El-Chami then also denied any knowledge of what had actually happened to Mr Salameh; of having heard anything from Mr Azar about his knowledge as to what had happened; or of having seen Mr Salameh at the time that he went back to the unit door and the other two came out. He was specifically asked about a bowling ball which had been thrown through the next door neighbour’s window and he denied any knowledge of that.
	
	
	In the course of the interview police recounted to Mr El-Chami conversations which had been attributed to Mr Azar by members of his family. Conversations attributed to Mr El-Chami by Mr Azar’s sisters were also put to him, but he persistently claimed to have been absent from the unit during the alleged prolonged assault.
	
	
	At approximately 1:00 am on 20 August 2013, in the course of the recorded interview, Mr El-Chami was advised that he was under arrest and that he was going to be charged with Mr Salameh’s murder. Towards the end of the interview, it was put to him that he had been lying throughout the interview.
	
	
	It is these events which form the basis of the charge to which Mr El-Chami entered his plea.
	
	
	After his arrest was processed, Mr El-Chami indicated to police that he was prepared to continue to be interviewed. He then described the initial interaction between Mr Salameh and Mr Azar, when Mr Azar’s “arse” had been pinched and he described in more detail the events that followed when he, Mr Azar and Mr Kaddour had returned to the unit, after the initial altercation between Mr Azar and Mr Salameh.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami described how Mr Kaddour had initiated the assault upon Mr Salameh and that both he and Mr Azar were hitting Mr Salameh.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami said that he left the room at that point and went down to the street. When he returned, he observed that “Daniel was on his knees and he has a red tool in his hand”. He thought that the object was a “hacksaw” and described how he had kicked it out of Mr Azar’s hands. He also said that Mr Kaddour was then putting clothes on top of Mr Salameh in an attempt to “cover him” and that Mr Kaddour’s shoes had blood on them.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami also said that after they had left the unit, it was Mr Kaddour who had thrown the lawn bowl at the neighbour’s window and that he had been absent from the unit for 20 minutes during the assault, before going back.
	
	
	Police asked Mr El-Chami to confirm that he had been aware of everything he disclosed in the interview, since the time at which it happened, and had failed to tell police until that point.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami agreed, but claimed that he “was scared, like even wha t… when told, like, from his, like his brother, Daniel’s brother, you know? If it happens to him… you know? … And I’ve already been shot”. Mr El-Chami continued to describe his fear, but also offered to “wear a wire” to have a conversation with Mr Kaddour and Mr Azar, separately.
	
	
	It was then that a witness statement was prepared by police and signed by Mr El-Chami, which went to the matters that he had disclosed to police in his records of interview and to the matters in respect of which he was prepared to give evidence.
	
	
	Despite what is now accepted, that Mr El-Chami provided a true statement, he was charged initially with being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Mr Salameh and then with his murder. He then remained bail refused for over seven weeks, until he was granted bail by this Court on 10 October 2013.
	
	
	Mr Kaddour was arrested on 29 August 2013. He claimed in his interview to have left Mr Salameh’s unit at about 7:30 pm on Tuesday 13 August 2013, and not to have returned to the unit thereafter. He denied having been called “Biggie” since he was younger and also denied any involvement in the attack on Mr Salameh.
	
	
	All three accused were committed to stand trial for the murder of Mr Salameh in the Supreme Court, in a joint trial listed to commence on 9 November 2015.
	
	
	It was on 2 November 2015, that Mr El-Chami’s solicitors wrote to the DPP, indicating that he was prepared to plead guilty to a s 316(1) offence and to give evidence against Mr Kaddour and Mr Azar. It was that day that Mr El-Chami’s solicitors were advised that CCTV footage had been located within the material held by the DPP, which had not previously been served.
	
	
	That footage recorded vision of the driveway and car park area of the units where Mr Salameh lived, as well as the balcony area leading to unit 10. The images covered the relevant period between 1:30 am and 2:30 am on 14 August 2013. It corroborated Mr El-Chami’s account that he had been physically absent from the unit for a period of approximately 20 minutes.
	
	
	After viewing the CCTV footage the Crown accepted Mr El-Chami’s offer to have the murder charge discontinued, and a plea was entered to concealing a serious indictable offence.
	
	
	In Mr El-Chami’s submissions, it is claimed that this CCTV footage was obtained by police shortly after the murder had occurred, but had not, until 2 November 2015, been disclosed to the defence.
	
	
	On 9 February 2016, a further interview was conducted in which Mr El-Chami indicated that he had previously told the police the truth. A deal of liaison then took place between the Crown and defence representatives, which ultimately culminated in Mr El-Chami providing a further signed witness statement.
	
	
	That statement was in evidence. It is not necessary to discuss its details. On the affidavit evidence of Superintendent Whyte, the statement is of assistance to the Crown in various ways there described, both to the investigation and the trial of the co-accused.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami also swore another affidavit on 1 April 2016, in which he explained circumstances in which the residence condition of his bail had been varied by consent, to enable him to live at Newcastle, with his partner’s aunt, in order to remove himself from certain negative influences.
	
	
	Attached to the affidavit was a copy of posters which were put up at various public locations near that residence, a short time after he moved there. The poster not only contained his photograph, name and residence; under the heading “warnings” it also contained both true and false information about his background and record. It also said that he should be approached with caution and was likely to make indirect threats towards police. His charges and bail conditions, including the requirement to be of good behaviour, which was followed with the question “really?” were also there specified.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami described the embarrassment and shame which he experienced after he saw these posters, published at a time when he had come to feel ashamed of his past, when he was endeavouring to comply with his bail conditions and to stay away from bad influences and to alter his life. Mr El-Chami said he had later been recognised in the street, with the result that his bail conditions were further varied, to permit him to move to Sydney, to live with his partner and her mother.
	
	
	These events were accepted by the parties as being relevant to a determination of Mr El-Chami’s sentence.
	


The Court’s sentencing task


	
	Mr El-Chami’s sentence must be arrived at having regard to what legislation enacted by the Parliament and binding case law requires, in a sentencing exercise such as this.
	
	
	The rules of evidence do not ordinarily apply at a sentencing hearing (see s 4 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)), but nevertheless, the weight of the evidence which the parties then lead, must be critically assessed.
	
	
	Any disputes about factual findings must be resolved in the way discussed in R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27]. That is, facts may not be taken into account in a way that is adverse to an offender, unless they have been established beyond reasonable doubt. In the case of facts taken into account in favour of an offender, it is enough that they are proved on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	In arriving at the sentence the Court must bear in mind the purposes of sentencing specified in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Those purposes are:
	


“(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)    to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c)    to protect the community from the offender,

(d)    to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e)    to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)    to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g)    to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.”


	
	The sentence imposed on Mr El-Chami must be determined in light of the maximum penalty imposed for the crime in question, in this case 2 years imprisonment. It must also reflect the gravity of his offence, viewed objectively (see R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354). That was in issue in this case.
	
	
	In accordance with s 21A(1)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the sentence for Mr El-Chami’s offence must be assessed by taking into account the objective and subjective factors affecting its relative seriousness, as well as identified aggravating and mitigating factors revealed by the evidence. Mr El-Chami’s moral culpability for his offence must also be taken into account (see Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 249 CLR 600). Consideration must also be given to questions of general and specific deterrence.
	
	
	All of the relevant factors must be taken into account by way of the instinctive synthesis discussed in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]. That requires the sentencing judge to identify all of the factors that are relevant to be considered on sentencing in the particular case, discussing their significance and making a value judgment as to what the appropriate sentence for that offence is. The sentence so imposed must ensure that there is a reasonable proportionality between the sentence and the circumstances of the crime committed (see R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [15]).
	
	
	If a term of imprisonment is imposed, regard must also be paid to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which requires that the balance of the term of the sentence imposed on an offender must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period imposed, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances which warrant a departure from that ratio.
	
	
	If there is to be any such adjustment, it must not be such as to reduce the non-parole period below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve for the offence he has committed (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628 - 629).
	
	
	Section 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires the Court not to sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.
	
	
	Even if the Court concludes that a custodial sentence should be imposed, it was common ground that alternatives such as a suspended sentence (under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act), service of the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community, (under Part 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) and home detention (under Part 6 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) may also arise to be considered. Such sentences impose obvious leniency, which the Crown contended, was not warranted in this case. That was also in issue.
	


The seriousness of Mr El-Chami’s offence


	
	This was in issue.
	
	
	The Crown contended that objectively, the seriousness of Mr El-Chami’s offence was high, given that what he had concealed was Mr Salameh’s murder, in circumstances where he was almost immediately aware, both of what had happened and of the identity of those who had murdered him. Even beforehand he was aware of the danger which Mr Salameh faced and he chose to stand outside, while Mr Salameh was beaten. When he returned he also failed to give him any assistance, in circumstances where he could easily have called an ambulance.
	
	
	It was also submitted to be relevant that Mr El-Chami then chose to continue his association with Mr Azar and Mr Kaddour; he did not inform police of what he knew and even when interviewed, he did not comply with his legal obligation to report the murder. The proper inference was, it was argued, that had police not intervened and persisted in questioning Mr El-Chami, he would not have revealed what he knew.
	
	
	In the result, it would be concluded that this was a very serious offence which, but for certain accepted mitigating factors, including discounts, warranted the maximum penalty being imposed on Mr El-Chami.
	
	
	It was conceded that while other sentencing options, including imposition of an intensive correction order and home detention might be technically available sentencing options in Mr El-Chami’s case, given the objective criminality of his offence, only a custodial sentence would adequately reflect the seriousness of his offence.
	
	
	I cannot accept the Crown’s case.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami is not being sentenced for his callous behaviour to his friend Mr Salameh, who he did not assist, as he should have, when he left him to be beaten by Mr Azar and Mr Kaddour. Nor is he being sentenced for failing to assist him when he returned to find Mr Salameh seriously injured, other than by kicking away the hacksaw, with which Mr Azar was about to inflict further injuries.
	
	
	What Mr El-Chami is being sentenced for is his concealment of the most serious of offences, murder, for a period of some six days, during an ongoing police investigation which had almost immediately identified the three suspects, who were soon charged with his murder. They were each not only known to have been frequent visitors to the unit, but were known to have been with Mr Salameh the day before his death, when police had attended his unit, after the altercation with “Ray”.
	
	
	By the end of the second interview, only six days after Mr Salameh’s death, Mr El-Chami had not only given an accurate account of what had happened to Mr Salameh, but had offered to assist in the ongoing police investigation. That police did not avail themselves of that offer, even when the CCTV footage which corroborated what he had said in his statement was discovered, soon afterwards, does not detract from the fact that the offer was made.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami’s offence, it must be concluded on all of that evidence, does not fall at the upper end of seriousness of such offending, even though it was unarguably a serious offence. Mr El-Chami having failed to provide the information in his hands to police, as he should have, when he first left Mr Azar and Mr Kaddour on 14 August. He did not act then, nor did he tell police what he knew, when first interviewed by police on 15 August, or even initially on 20 August.
	
	
	The catalyst for the provision of the information which he finally provided was undoubtedly the laying of the charges against him on 20 August.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that the proper inference is that but for that development, Mr El-Chami would not have provided the information which he had to police, about this most serious of offences, murder.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	There was no suggestion that there were any relevant aggravating factors arising under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be considered in this sentencing exercise.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	The mitigating factors specified in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which must be taken into account in Mr El-Chami’s favour, are that on the evidence, he has good prospects of rehabilitation (s 21A(3)(h)), given his age, his assistance and his compliance with bail conditions, notwithstanding the vigilantism he was wrongly subjected to. There was also evidence of genuine remorse, shown not only by his pleas, but also by his unchallenged evidence as to his deep remorse, which establishes, I am satisfied, that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and the injury they caused (s 21A(3)(i)).
	


Discounts


	
	It was common ground that Mr El-Chami was entitled to a 25% discount for the entry of his early plea (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383), as well as to the benefit of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, given the assistance he has already provided and that which he has further promised, which is to be encouraged in a sentencing exercise such as this (see R v Cartwright (1989) 19 NSWLR 243 at 252).
	
	
	In the result I have concluded that he must receive a combined discount of 50%, 20% of which should be attributable to the future assistance Mr El-Chami has promised to give (see SZ v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249 at [44]). I note that if that assistance is not forthcoming, the Crown may appeal this sentence under s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	


Deterrence


	
	In all of the circumstances which I have discussed, general deterrence also has a significant role to play in the sentence imposed on Mr El-Chami. Offences such as this, committed by a person who has knowledge of the kind that Mr El-Chami had about Mr Salameh’s murder, must result in a sentence which deters others from failing to abide by the obligation imposed on them to furnish such information to police.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, however, that specific deterrence has a lesser role to play than it would have had, had Mr El-Chami on 20 August 2013 not only signed a witness statement on which the Crown was entitled to rely at the trial of his co-accused, but also offered to assist in the ongoing investigation. That the Crown did not avail itself of that offer, cannot result in a different conclusion.
	


Mr El-Chami’s subjective circumstances


	
	The evidence of Mr El-Chami’s circumstances included letters from him, his mother, his partner, her mother, his aunt and a number of friends, as well as from a psychologist’s report prepared by Mr Borenstein.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami, a young man from an abusive background, with a limited criminal record, principally while a child, formed a friendship with Mr Salameh some 12 months before his murder, at a time when he was dealing with various ongoing mental health and other issues.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami has had a somewhat troubled past. He has twice been the victim of a shooting. The first in 2010, when he was shot in the leg, requiring surgery. Afterwards he received psychological treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and became housebound for about two years. In 2013 he was introduced to the drug ice.
	
	
	The second shooting occurred in 2013, some two months prior to this offence, when he was at home, where he became the victim of a drive by shooting. He fainted and awoke in hospital some four days later, requiring surgery to his hand which left him after release some three weeks later, relatively incapacitated. He told Mr Borenstein that afterwards he was self medicating with marijuana and “a bit of ice”, his PTSD having been magnified.
	
	
	Mr Borenstein considered that Mr Salameh’s death had re-traumatised Mr El-Chami and led him to fear even what friends could do to him. The delay in locating the CCTV footage which had exonerated him of murder, had also adversely impacted his mental health. He had feared being imprisoned for an offence which he had not committed. Mr Borenstein diagnosed him then to be suffering extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and severe and chronic PTSD. He considered his prognosis to be guarded.
	
	
	Since release on bail, Mr El-Chami has removed himself from his former lifestyle. The character evidence attests to steps he has pursued to alter the path of his life, including steps he has taken to provide voluntary assistance to persons with disabilities.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami and his partner have now had a child. The stress of his circumstances has led to difficulties in their relationship, which they hope to resolve, once he has been sentenced. He has her continuing support, as well as that of members of his own family and hers.
	
	
	It is also relevant that since the relaxation of his bail conditions, he has been able to find work.
	


Victim impact statement


	
	Without objection, a victim impact statement was provided by Mr Salameh’s twin brother. There he described Mr Salameh, his difficult life and the sad impact of his death upon him.
	
	
	Mr El-Chami is, of course, not responsible for that loss. His offence is a different one, as I have discussed.
	
	
	In those circumstances, while under s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act, on the application of the prosecutor and if the Court considers it appropriate to do so, such a statement may be considered and taken into account on sentencing, it is not appropriate to take this statement into account in sentencing Mr El-Chami, other than by way of background, shedding further light as it does on why general deterrence must play a role in a sentencing exercise such as this.
	
	
	The impact of Mr Salameh’s death on his immediate family, is an aspect of the harm done to the community. The real and ongoing grief Mr Salameh’s death has caused is acknowledged and must result in very deep sympathy for his brother’s loss and what he must continue to bear, as the result of how his brother’s death was brought about.
	
	
	In due course it is to be hoped that these sentencing proceedings and how our system of justice otherwise deals with Mr Salameh’s murder, will give his brother some small measure of comfort, by revealing how our society has dealt with the awful offence which Mr Salameh’s killing involved.
	


Conviction and sentence


	
	The parties referred to a number of authorities where offences under s 316 have arisen for sentencing, as well as sentencing statistics. Those cases are limited. They each turn on their own facts and do not disclose any relevant sentencing range.
	
	
	As discussed in R v Crofts (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 10 March 1995, unrep) by Gleeson CJ, also a case involving a failure to provide information to police about a murder, the evaluation of an offender’s culpability for offences of this kind, can be extremely difficult. There the sentence imposed was a fixed term of 6 months, where the original charge laid was an accessory offence, in circumstances where a contract shooting had resulted in the wrong victim being killed. The shooters were only identified after the accidental discovery of the pistol used and listening devices were deployed. On appeal the sentence was found to have been comparatively lenient, but within the permissible range.
	
	
	In R v CQD [2002] NSWSC 732, Hidden J sentenced an offender who was a juvenile at the time, who was also charged with a detain for advantage offence, for which a sentence of 5 years was imposed before reduction by 40% for plea and assistance, to an additional undiscounted sentence of 6 months, where the delay between the murder and the initial interview with police was some 3 months.
	
	
	In R v Newbold [2008] NSWSC 942, Fullerton J imposed no sentence for an offence found to fall at the lowest order of objective criminality, on an offender who had spent over 12 months in custody, by dealing with the offence under s 10 and recording no conviction. There the offender’s act of concealment had lasted no longer than half an hour, but he had not been believed by police and so charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and concealment were preferred. Her Honour observed at [21] - [22]:
	


“21    I am compelled to add that I have persisting doubts as to whether the charge of conceal serious offence, or a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, would ever have been preferred against Mr Newbold were police to have taken the view that he was in fact telling them the truth and were they to have offered him the opportunity to sign a witness statement against Kutschera. While I accept that this was not a view that commended itself to police either on the 21 July 2007 or as the investigation proceeded, the simple fact is that Mr Newbold spent 400 days in custody as a remand prisoner facing a murder charge - a charge which he denied on the night of his arrest, that he has persistently denied throughout successive arraignments and a denial that the Crown ultimately accepts as true.

22    I acknowledge, of course, that our system of criminal justice has as its pinnacle the jury system as the established mechanism by which the guilt of those charged with serious indictable offences is determined. Nonetheless, the responsibility for ensuring that only those against whom a positive case of guilt can be mounted ought to be put to their trial rests first with the investigating police and then with prosecuting authorities in the independent exercise of their statutory powers. In my view, the need for judgments made at the point of arrest and charge to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and well in advance of trial is essential, especially where the person arrested and charged voluntarily participates in a recorded interview and gives an exculpatory account that is neither inherently improbable nor, in the context of other evidence, plainly untenable. In my view this case falls squarely into that category.”


	
	This was submitted to be a similar case.
	
	
	There are obvious similarities but in this case, I consider that Mr El-Chami’s offence was more serious, albeit that there were also significant problems in the police approach to the investigation and the Crown’s approach to his prosecution, which I have already explained, given what happened to the exonerating CCTV footage.
	
	
	In Mr El-Chami’s case, I am satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment is warranted, given the nature and seriousness of his offence, notwithstanding his personal circumstances and the mitigating matters I have discussed.
	
	
	But for the discounts for his early plea and assistance, I consider that the appropriate sentence would have been 6 months imprisonment. As I have explained, there must, however, be a combined discount of 50%, attributable to the plea and the assistance Mr El-Chami has already given and further promised to give. That results in a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment.
	
	
	I am also satisfied that the term of that sentence must be suspended in accordance with s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	In determining what sentence should be imposed, a sentencing court can take into account that the offender has already suffered some serious loss or detriment as a result of having committed the offence.
	
	
	In this case in resolving the question of whether a non-custodial sentence would properly reflect the required proportionality between Mr El-Chami’s serious offence and his sentence, three relevant matters must be taken into account. Firstly, the fact that Mr El-Chami has already spent some 7 weeks in custody, bail refused, after his arrest on 14 August 2014 when he was charged with murder, in the circumstances I earlier discussed.
	
	
	Secondly, that Mr El-Chami then spent considerable time on bail, subject to stringent bail conditions, including daily reporting and curfew, which would either not have been imposed upon him at all, or at least would not have continued as long as they did, had the CCTV footage been examined and served, as it ought to have been. Had that occurred, the abandonment of the pursuit of the murder charge and acceptance of his plea to the s 316 offence, would also have occurred long before December 2015, when those conditions were relaxed.
	
	
	Thirdly, Mr El-Chami was also subjected to the extra curial punishment inflicted by those who wrongly posted information in public places about his alleged offending, bail conditions and the alleged risks which he posed. That, I am satisfied, was punishment wrongly meted out by others, in order to extract retribution or revenge for the alleged commission of a murder, which it is common ground Mr El-Chami did not commit. I am well satisfied that it is appropriate to take this punishment into account in arriving at Mr El-Chami’s sentence for the lesser offence which he actually committed (see R v Daetz; R v Wilson [2003] NSWCCA 216; (2003) 139 A Crim R 398 at [62]).
	
	
	In all of these circumstances I am satisfied that the suspended sentence which will be imposed on Mr El-Chami will fulfil all of the purposes of punishment I have earlier discussed, for the offence which it is common ground that he actually committed.
	
	
	The sentence which will be imposed on Mr El-Chami is accordingly a sentence of 3 months imprisonment, which will be suspended, subject to him entering into a good behaviour bond for a term of 3 months and providing the assistance he has promised.
	


Orders


	
	Mohamed El-Chami you are convicted under s 316(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of knowing that you had information which might be of material assistance in securing the prosecution of Ahmed Kaddour and Daniel Azar for the murder of Basem Salameh, without reasonable excuse, you failed to bring that information to the attention of the Police Force.
	
	
	For that offence you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 months, commencing 19 April 2016 which is to be suspended, subject to you entering into a good behaviour bond for a term of 3 months and providing the assistance you have promised.

		24 May 2017",2016-04-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769240,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 48) [2016] NSWSC 479,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	The accused McNamara has, in the course of his evidence, made reference to communications that he had with Rogerson whilst they were in custody. Part of McNamara's evidence is to the effect that in the course of that correspondence, Rogerson proposed that they construct a false defence to the charges which had been brought.
	
	
	Commencing at T3253 L20 McNamara gave evidence that the correspondence between he and Rogerson took place in various forms, one of which was a “case summary” which had been written by Rogerson, and another of which was a document in the form of questions that he (McNamara) wrote and answers that Rogerson gave in response.
	
	
	It is in that context that Mr Wendler now seeks to tender a number of documents. There is no dispute, in the case of each of the documents, that they are either wholly or partly in Rogerson's handwriting.
	
	
	The documents sought to be tendered were marked for identification 173 to 177 inclusive. As events have transpired, documents MFI 175 and 176 are no longer pressed. The parties agree that MFI 177 can be tendered on the basis that the tender includes a copy of the Crown Case Statement (MFI 177 being a document that purports to reply to that statement). It is also agreed between the parties that in respect of MFI 177( and in respect of each of the remaining two documents that may be admitted into evidence) it will be necessary for me to direct the jury as to the purpose for which the particular document is tendered, and the use to which it can be put.
	
	
	It is common ground that any such direction would include the jury being directed that the document is not being tendered as evidence of the truth of its contents but is relied upon as relevant to the issue of duress raised by McNamara, and to establish that in terms of the construction of a defence, it was Rogerson who was “controlling” the relevant events.
	
	
	I turn firstly to MFI 173. That is a document headed ""Cross X"" and dated 13 November 2014. It is in the form of questions and answers. The questions are in the handwriting of McNamara and the answers are in the handwriting of Rogerson.
	
	
	In the course of argument, Mr Wendler made it clear that paragraphs 3 and 5 in that document were not pressed.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the contents of MFI 173 were clearly relevant to the issues to which I have referred. The Crown further submitted that the document provided some support for the proposition that Rogerson was, in effect, in control of the circumstances surrounding the alleged construction of a defence.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that the document was evidence of significant and serious post offence conduct on the part of both of the accused, and that there was an inference available that both were engaged in constructing a false defence.
	
	
	Mr Thomas, who appears for Rogerson, submitted the evidence was not relevant on any of the bases on which it was sought to be tendered. He submitted the document was open to both misuse and confusion, and that its probative value was substantially lessened because of the date on which it had apparently been prepared, which was some six months or thereabouts after the deceased had been shot.
	
	
	In my view the document (bearing in mind those parts which are to be excluded from it) is clearly relevant. It is relevant to the issue of duress which has been raised by McNamara. It is also relevant to the issue of “control” on the part of Rogerson to which Mr Wendler referred, such control being part of the issue of duress which is raised. I also consider that the document is relevant, in the sense described by the Crown, as evidence of post offence conduct by both of the accused.
	
	
	In each of those respects, I have come to the view that the probative value of the document is significant. I do not accept that the date on which the document was created lessens, to any degree, such probative value.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the probative value of the document is substantially outweighed, either by the danger that it may be unfairly prejudicial to Rogerson, or by the danger that it might be misleading and confusing. The circumstances in which the document came into existence are, on the evidence before me at the present time, quite clear. There is no danger of the document being misused in those circumstances. I am also not satisfied that there is a danger of any unfair prejudice to Rogerson. Certainly, the document is prejudicial to Rogerson but in my view it is not unfairly so. Quite apart from any other consideration, the document is partly in Rogerson's own handwriting.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose to admit MFI 173 in its existing form.
	
	
	MFI 174 is a document headed, ""Thoughts Re Committal Hearing"". It is addressed to McNamara, as is evident by the use of the word ""Glen"". It is dated 2 December 2014. The Crown submitted that this document was relevant on the same bases as those relied upon by Mr Wendler in respect of MFI 173. Mr Thomas submitted that in all of the circumstances, the document was not relevant at all, and that even if it was, there was a clear danger of it being misused.
	
	
	On a reading of the whole of the document, it refers to a particular approach which, it seems, somebody (probably Rogerson) proposed in respect of a committal hearing. It is common ground that no committal hearing ever took place.
	
	
	Further, the document makes reference to what might happen at a trial, and to the necessity for each of the accused to prove ""that there is another side to this case - our side - which is the truth as to what actually happened"". There are other references in the document (which have not been pressed) and which relate to what a Magistrate may or may not do at a committal proceeding, as well as what might transpire in respect of the question of bail.
	
	
	In my view, the probative value of the document is low. This is partly due to the fact that it was prepared in relation to a procedure which never took place. The probative value of the document, such as it is, is substantially outweighed by the danger that it may be misleading or confusing if it were admitted. Even allowing for the limited basis on which it is sought to be tendered, and the limited use to which it could be put, it has the capacity to cause the jury to speculate about a number of matters which were proposed to in relation to the conduct of a committal hearing which never occurred.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose to reject the tender of MFI 174.

		15 June 2016",2016-04-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769253,Hamilton v R [2016] NSWCCA 59,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Schmidt J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: I agree with Schmidt J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: In February 2015 Lerve DCJ sentenced Barry Hamilton, then aged 20 years, for an offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence whilst in company, which he had committed in April 2014. The offence involved smashing a window to enter a house at Coonamble, where $700 was stolen. The maximum penalty for the offence was 20 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 5 years. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months commencing from the date of sentence, due to expire on 5 August 2016, with a further term of 16 months, due to expire on 5 December 2017.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence on two grounds:
	


“Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in not backdating or otherwise taking into account the applicant’s pre-trial custody.

Ground 2: The sentence imposed in respect of the s. 112(2) offence is infected by error, and that this error has resulted in a miscarriage of justice which should be rectified by this Court.”


	
	Both grounds of appeal can be dealt with together, the Crown conceding that the appeal should be upheld and the applicant resentenced.
	
	
	An affidavit of Mr Thomson, a solicitor employed by the NSW Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was received on appeal and sentence.
	
	
	The applicant was granted bail in respect of this offence after he was charged on 27 April 2014. He came before the Coonamble Local Court on 20 May, when bail was continued. On 29 September, however, he was arrested and bail refused on an unrelated aggravated robbery offence under s 95 of the Crimes Act. On 21 October he entered a plea to the s 112 offence in the Local Court and was then committed for sentence before the District Court in Dubbo and was also refused bail for that offence.
	
	
	On sentence in February 2015 the applicant had thus spent over 3 months in custody, bail refused, for this offence.
	
	
	In written submissions on sentence it was contended for the applicant that his presentencing custody should be taken into account from 29 September 2014. That submission was inaccurate, because he was not then in custody in respect of this offence. This was raised in oral submissions before Lerve DCJ and the matter was stood down so that the parties could consider the applicant’s custodial history.
	
	
	On resumption it was announced by the applicant’s solicitor that it had been agreed that the sentence should commence from that day. After his Honour raised his concern as to the operation of the principle of totality, given the s 95 offence which was being dealt with in the Local Court, it was submitted that the commencement date was in the Court’s discretion, but that totality did not arise, because he had not yet been sentenced for the other offence.
	
	
	In his sentencing remarks, after referring to the agreed commencement date, Lerve DCJ ordered that the sentence commence from that day, 6 February 2015.
	
	
	The applicant now claims that this approach involved relevant error, given that he had been bail refused for this offence on 21 October and that he should, accordingly, be resentenced. That claim is advanced in circumstances where, it is common ground, in August 2015 the Director of Public Prosecutions no billed the s 95 charge, for which he then still remained bail refused.
	
	
	The applicant’s case was that the concession as to the start date of his sentence, 2 February involved a legal error, given the requirements of s 24(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The usual and preferable course is that presentence custody is taken into account in a sentencing exercise such as this, for the reasons discussed in R v Newman & Simpson [2005] NSWCCA 102; (2004) 145 A Crim R 361 at [26] – [31]. The case which had been advanced for the appellant on sentencing was thus submitted to have involved error and that it was a mistake which had resulted in a miscarriage of justice, which should now be rectified.
	
	
	The requirements of s 24 and s 47(2)(a), which require presentence custody to be considered and which permit a court to direct that a term of imprisonment commence on a day before the day on which a sentence is imposed, do not mean that offenders accrue “credit in the bank” for time spent in custody for matters not referable to those for which they are being sentenced, such as the time that the applicant spent in custody for the s 95 offence (see Hampton v R [2014] NSWCCA 131; (2014) 243 A Crim R 193 at [26] - [39]). In Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 it was also observed that s 24 does not impose a mandatory requirement that sentences be backdated in every case where presentence custody has been served, although reasons for not doing so should be clearly stated. Here Lerve DCJ provided such reasons, namely, the parties’ agreement.
	
	
	Ordinarily a party is bound by the way a case is presented at first instance, but that rule is not absolute, as the Crown accepted, it having to bend to what the interests of justice require in a particular case (see R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 683 and 685 and Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; (2011) 209 A Crim R 509 at [104] - [105]).
	
	
	Here it could clearly not be known to the parties or to the sentencing judge, that the s 95 charge would later be no billed, but the Crown properly conceded that in the applicant’s circumstances on sentencing, the starting date for the sentence imposed for this offence should, as a matter of justice, have been 21 October 2014, not 6 February 2015.
	
	
	The Court’s powers on appeal are those given by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) which requires:
	


“6(3)   ... the court, if it is of the opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.""


	
	As discussed in Khoury v R at [110] “evidence of events or circumstances or facts that have arisen entirely since sentencing generally cannot be taken into account on appeal, no matter how compelling they may be”. However, error having been established and the Crown accepting that some other sentence is warranted, the Court must itself exercise the sentencing discretion as discussed in Kentwell v R (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [42]).
	
	
	In all of those circumstances, in resentencing the applicant it is appropriate to take into account not only that the applicant was bail refused in relation to this offence, from 21 October 2014, but also that the s 95 offence, in respect of which he was bail refused from 29 September, was later no billed. Those circumstances compel the acceptance of the parties’ common ground that this sentence should start from the date on which the applicant was refused bail in respect of this offence, 21 October 2014.
	
	
	Otherwise I consider that no lesser sentence than that imposed on the appellant is warranted, namely, a sentence comprising a non parole period of 18 months and a further term of 16 months. That sentence properly reflects the evidence as to the nature and seriousness of the applicant’s offence, the objective and subjective matters and other relevant factors discussed by Lerve DCJ, considered by way of the instinctive synthesis discussed in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357, about which there was no other dispute between the parties.
	
	
	In the result the applicant must be resentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 34 months. The earliest date of his release will be 20 April 2016, after service of a non-parole period of 18 months, commencing 21 October 2014. The balance of his term will expire on 20 August 2017.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I would order:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is upheld.
	
	
	The sentence is quashed.
	
	
	The appellant is resentenced to a total term of 34 months imprisonment commencing on 21 October 2014, with a non-parole period of 18 months expiring on 20 April 2016 and a balance of term of 16 months expiring on 20 August 2017.
	
	
	Under s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the applicant be released on parole at the expiry of the non-parole period on 20 April 2016.
	
	
	The applicant’s parole be supervised and that he comply with all reasonable directions of the Department of Corrective Services relating to his ongoing treatment and counselling for substance abuse.

		12 July 2016",2016-04-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2769260,R v Turnbull (No. 7) [2016] NSWSC 517,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: Yesterday, the Accused, Ian Robert Turnbull, was arraigned upon a charge of murder, to which he pleaded not guilty, and a jury was empanelled for his trial.
	
	
	Following introductory comments from me to the jury, both the Crown and senior counsel for the Accused made opening addresses to the jury. The trial was adjourned until today, with the taking of evidence to commence this morning.
	
	
	This morning, the Sheriff’s Officer brought to my attention a note provided by a member of the jury. The juror in question has indicated in the note (MFI4) that a close relative is receiving treatment for cancer with surgery expected to take place in early May. The juror indicates that she is the primary carer for the relative. The juror indicates in the note: ""Due to this circumstance, I'm afraid that I won't be able to serve my duty as a juror”. A medical certificate is attached to the note which confirms the illness of the close relative.
	
	
	It is most unfortunate that the juror in question did not reveal these matters yesterday by way of an application to be excused from jury service. I went to considerable lengths to explain to the panel the importance of potential problems being identified before empanelment. The health difficulties of the juror’s relative represent a state of affairs which existed yesterday. This is not a sudden development overnight. However, the juror has raised this matter this morning and the Court must deal with it.
	
	
	Section 53B Jury Act 1977 permits the Court to exercise discretion to discharge an individual juror in certain circumstances. It does not seem to me that any of the circumstances referred to in s.53B(a), (b) or (c) presently operate.
	
	
	Section 53B(d) states that the Court may discharge a juror if it appears to the Court that, for any other reason affecting the juror's ability to perform the functions of a juror, a juror should not continue to act as a juror. This is a broad category which clearly picks up a range of circumstances not otherwise identified in the section.
	
	
	Both the Crown and senior counsel for the Accused submit that a proper basis has been demonstrated to discharge the individual juror. At the least, it can be said that, if this juror remains on the jury, she is likely to be distracted and, for practical purposes, reluctant. I am satisfied in the circumstances that the appropriate course is to discharge the juror who has made application to be discharged from the jury.
	
	
	A second and separate question which must be considered is whether the trial of the Accused should continue with a jury of 11. Section 53C Jury Act 1977 states, relevantly, that if the Court discharges a juror in the course of a trial, the Court must discharge the jury if the Court is of the opinion that, to continue the trial with the remaining jurors, would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. If the Court is of the opinion that there is no such risk, and, subject to s.22 of the Act, the Court may order that the trial continue with a reduced number of jurors.
	
	
	Section 22 of the Act provides, relevantly, that a criminal jury cannot drop below a number of 10 persons without consent. That provision is not presently relevant as the question is whether the trial should proceed with a jury of 11.
	
	
	Apart from the terms of s.53C, the Court of Criminal Appeal has made clear that there are other discretionary factors to be taken into account in this, the second phase of decision-making: Le v R [2012] NSWCCA 202.
	
	
	The Crown has submitted that the trial should proceed with a jury of 11. In support of this, the Crown submits that this is a relatively short trial of three-to-four weeks’ duration and that the concerns that might arise about the risk of losing another juror (to go from 11 to ten jurors) are of limited application in the circumstances of a short trial. It is submitted, as well, that there are witnesses who are anxious that the matter proceed, given some delays which have occurred as a result of certain pretrial issues which required resolution.
	
	
	It has been submitted for the Accused that, if the trial was to continue with a jury of 11, there would be a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice which would flow from the suggested gender imbalance that would result. The jury, as presently constituted, contains eight men and four women. The juror whom I have discharged is a woman, so a jury of 11 would be constituted by eight men and three women.
	
	
	I do not think that this factor is capable of giving rise to a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. The very process of selection of a jury from randomly gathered members of a community means that the gender balance of a jury is always uncertain. In some cases, there may be a significantly larger number of one sex to the other. I do not think this factor is relevant to the exercise of discretion.
	
	
	The other matter raised by senior counsel for the Accused is a significant one. It has been said in other trials where, at a very early stage, something happens that leads to a juror being discharged, that the Court should keep firmly in mind the prima facie entitlement of the Accused and the community to have an accused person tried for an alleged serious crime by a jury of 12 persons: R v Karimi; R v Khoury; R v Mir (No. 2) [2013] NSWSC 199 at [23]; R v Jacobs [2013] NSWSC 942 at [13]. That is an important factor in the exercise of discretion. That said, ss.53B and 53C allow the Court to discharge a juror and to proceed with a trial with a reduced number of jurors. So, that proposition is not a controlling factor in the exercise of discretion.
	
	
	There are some other matters which I should mention. The decision which the Court must make involves a choice between a number of options.
	
	
	Firstly, to continue with a jury of 11 being the course proposed by the Crown and opposed by the Accused.
	
	
	Secondly, to discharge the jury but to proceed to empanel another jury today from the balance of the panel used yesterday (26 persons who are in this Court building today) and to utilise, potentially, the remaining 11 jurors who are on the jury at present. That would leave a pool of 37 persons from which a jury could be selected.
	
	
	Both the Crown and the Accused oppose the second option. It is submitted that the trial has reached a point where both opening addresses have been made. This is not a trial where the problem has presented itself before the commencement of opening addresses. It is submitted, as well, that the intermingling of the 11 jurors with the 26 persons from yesterday, in circumstances where the 11 have heard opening addresses and the others have not, may give rise to problems. A further factor which I take into account is that the 26 members of the panel, who were here yesterday and who are back here today, have not been subjected to the embargo which applies to the jury about internet and other researching about the case. I do not think, on balance, that utilising the balance of the panel today, with or without the 11 members of the jury, is the appropriate course to take.
	
	
	That brings me to the third option, which is to discharge the entire jury and to commence again next Tuesday with a fresh panel. That is the course which senior counsel for the Accused submits that I should take.   
	
	
	There is a further submission made on behalf of the Accused in that respect. That is, if the Court takes that course, there ought be a non-publication order on what has happened today, including the discharge of the jury. It is submitted that this step would be appropriate in circumstances where there has been overnight very substantial publicity about the commencement of this trial. If there was publicity of the fact that the present jury is discharged and a new jury was to be empanelled on Tuesday, it is submitted that panel members attending this Court on Tuesday would have a potential trigger to conduct internet searching about the trial between now and then.
	
	
	One response to that argument may be to not empanel next Tuesday, but to defer the commencement of the trial for a period of time. I do not think that a delay of that sort would be appropriate. It is true that this trial has come on relatively quickly in this Court. The Accused first appeared in this Court in December 2015 and the trial commenced five months later. The Accused is 81 years old. There are many people affected by this trial, directly and indirectly, who have an interest in the trial proceeding without any further delay.
	
	
	That brings me back then to the critical issue for decision.
	
	
	I have considered whether the process of ending this trial today, so as to commence a new one on Tuesday, involves an unavoidable risk of the jury panel on Tuesday being, in some way, influenced by knowledge of what has happened in this trial and the potential for internet searching by panel members. If I thought that was a very substantial risk, then it would operate in favour of the continuation of the present trial with a jury of 11.
	
	
	I approach the matter, however, upon the basis that the usual expectation of a trial of a person on a serious charge (and murder is the most serious charge of all) is that the trial is to proceed with a jury of 12.
	
	
	In the end, I am satisfied that the appropriate course to take is to discharge the balance of the present jury and to direct that the trial of the Accused commence next Tuesday before a fresh panel.
	
	
	I am satisfied, in the unusual circumstances of this case, that there should be a non-publication order made with respect to everything that has occurred this morning, including the orders that I am making as part of this judgment. I am satisfied that that order is appropriate to protect the administration of justice in the relatively short period between now and Tuesday.
	
	
	Once a panel is here on Tuesday, and the empanelment of a new jury is underway, there would be no impediment to informing that jury panel, who would be under the control of the Court, that the previous jury was discharged.
	
	
	As part of the empanelment process on Tuesday, I will enquire whether any panel member has undertaken any electronic or other searching about this case so that any person can apply to be excused from the panel.
	
	
	I agree with the submission of senior counsel for the Accused that the media publicity about this trial reflects what was said by both the Crown and senior counsel for the Accused in their opening addresses. There has been a balance in the reporting to date.
	
	
	However, I am satisfied that a temporary non-publication order should be made concerning today’s events for the reasons I have expressed.
	
	
	Shortly, I will bring in the jury and give them what will no doubt be unhappy news. For the 11 who are in attendance for the purpose of serving on this jury, they will no doubt be disappointed. However, I consider that the administration of justice requires that I take the course which I have indicated.
	
	
	Pursuant to s.53B Jury Act 1977, I discharge the individual juror who has made application to be discharged.
	
	
	I direct that the balance of the jury be discharged.
	


[Further submissions made]


	
	The trial of the Accused will commence next Tuesday, 26 April 2016 and an expanded jury panel is required for that purpose.

		14 June 2016",2016-04-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769261,R v Turnbull (No. 8) [2016] NSWSC 714,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: Last Friday, 15 April 2016, I made a strong recommendation with respect to the transport of the Accused, Ian Robert Turnbull, to and from Court for the purpose of his trial.
	
	
	The Accused is 81 years old, and he is held in the Long Bay Hospital Wing. I will not repeat what I said on that occasion, but it should be read together with what I am saying now. My judgment, R v Turnbull (No. 6) [2016] NSWSC 706, will be attached to the present judgment.
	
	
	As I stated in that judgment, I well understand the practical difficulties affecting the Department of Corrective Services and the demands upon their resources, including the transporting of prisoners. I have been informed, however, that despite the strong recommendation made a week ago, the Accused, at the completion of what was the first day of his trial yesterday, was transported from this Court to other places, not arriving at the Long Bay Hospital Wing until about 9.00 pm.
	
	
	If that pattern was continued daily during this trial, it is not fanciful to consider that the Accused will suffer some adverse health outcome which will endanger the progress of this trial.
	
	
	My principal concern is the proper administration of justice. The Department of Corrective Services, in all its forms and in all its functions, plays a fundamental part in the administration of justice. Its role, in the present respect, is to facilitate the functioning of the criminal courts. Any step which may be taken in transporting the Accused which causes an adverse health outcome, and causes his trial to be interrupted (or even aborted), would constitute a direct interference with the administration of justice.
	
	
	I am speaking more plainly on this occasion because it does not seem that what I said a week ago has had any effect.
	
	
	I am not saying this because of any personal desire that the Accused be given special treatment. At the same time, everyone, including the Court and the Department of Corrective Services, must take into account his unusual circumstances. His age and his state of health are such that it must be obvious to all concerned that to treat him as an ordinary prisoner, to be transported from one place to another until he does not arrive at his present place of custody until late at night, is entirely wrong.
	
	
	I strongly recommend that the Accused be transported to and from Court directly each day. If there is an inability to comply with this recommendation, I require the attendance of a senior officer of the Department of Corrective Services in this Court at 9.30 am next Wednesday, 28 April to inform the Court of what the problem is.
	
	
	I direct that a copy of these remarks be communicated personally to Mr Severin, the Commissioner for Corrective Services, the Medical Officer in charge of the Long Bay Hospital Wing, the Officer-in-Charge of the Transport Section of the Department of Corrective Services and the Senior Corrective Services Officer working within the Supreme Court Complex.
	
	
	I note that the Accused is next required at this Court next Tuesday for his trial. Should my recommendation not be implemented that day, as I have said, personal attendance is required at 9.30 am the next day by a senior officer of the Department of Corrective Services to explain why it has not been acted on.
	


[No further difficulty occurred in the transport arrangements of the Accused during the course of the trial]

2769276,Hadchiti v R [2016] NSWCCA 63,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

In late 2013, Mr Michael Hadchiti was tried for murder before a judge and a jury of 12. It was common ground at the trial that Mr Hadchiti had inflicted the wound to the deceased’s neck from which he died. The issues were Mr Hadchiti’s intention at the time, self-defence and provocation. The trial judge gave the jury oral directions over more than a day, and also provided the jury with seven pages of written directions. Before adjourning, the trial judge gave the jury an unreliability warning under s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) in respect of the evidence given by members of the Hadchiti family. No objection was taken at trial to the oral or written directions or the unreliability warning.

The jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder. Mr Hadchiti was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 29 years, with a non-parole period of 21 years, 9 months commencing on 14 October 2013.

Mr Hadchiti sought leave to appeal from both his conviction and sentence. The main issues on appeal were: (a) whether the oral and written directions to the jury disclosed error, and (b) whether the trial judge erred in giving an unreliability warning. In the event that the Court found error, the Crown sought to rely on the proviso.

Held by the Court, allowing the appeal:

First issue: written directions 

1.  In addressing a complaint as to a jury direction, the court will have regard to the overall impression which the whole summing up would have created in the minds of the jury: at [68].

Lin v Tasmania [2015] TASCCA 13, applied

2.  Where a direction to a jury is in part oral and in part written, then to the extent that the written document overlaps with the oral direction, the written document will tend to swamp the force of the oral direction in the jury room: at [70].

Justins v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 242; 79 NSWLR 544, applied

3.  Explanation should not, save in unusual circumstances, be given of the expression “beyond reasonable doubt”: at [79]-[82].

Dawson v The Queen (1961) 106 CLR 1; Green v The Queen (1971) 126 CLR 28; Darkan v The Queen [2006] HCA 34; 227 CLR 373, applied

4.  The written directions impermissibly equated beyond reasonable doubt with the existence of a reasonable possibility, without linking that possibility to a statement that it was for the Crown to remove or eliminate it, and thus materially departed from the conventional formulation of the standard of proof: at [87], [107].

Second issue: unreliability warning

5.  The Court was not persuaded that the unreliability warning amounted to such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it went to the root of the proceedings. Accordingly, leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was not granted to raise the unreliability warning as a ground of appeal: at [136].

R v Germakian [2007] NSWCCA 373; 70 NSWLR 467, applied

Third issue: proviso

6.  In a conviction appeal the Crown should provide detailed and substantial assistance in explaining why a guilty verdict was inevitable and how that conclusion can safely be reached, notwithstanding the natural limitations of appellate review: at [140].

Mortada v R [2014] NSWCCA 36, applied

7.  In applying the proviso, the task is to decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. There is no single universally applicable description of what constitutes a substantial miscarriage of justice: at [142]-[144].

Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300; Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29; 89 ALJR 776; Handlen v The Queen [2011] HCA 51; 245 CLR 282; Baini v The Queen [2012] HCA 59; 246 CLR 469, considered and applied

8.  Where a direction as to the standard or onus of proof or the function of the jury is substantially wrong, it will be rare for the weight of evidence against the accused to affect the conclusion that a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred: at [146]-[151].

Krakouer v The Queen [1998] HCA 43; 194 CLR 202; R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363, appliedBaiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen [2012] HCA 14; 246 CLR 92; R v AJS [2005] VSCA 288; 12 VR 563; R v Kerin [2013] SASCFC 56; 116 SASR 316; Green v State of Western Australia [No 2] [2014] WASCA 53; 240 A Crim R 73; Graham v R [2000] TASSC 153; Lin v Tasmania [2015] TASCCA 13; McGrath v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 48; 199 A Crim R 527, considered

9.  The effect of the written direction was to deny to the appellant the right for the jury to assess whether the Crown has established the four essential issues beyond reasonable doubt, such that this case falls within the category of cases as being incapable of engaging the proviso: at [152].

Krakouer v The Queen [1998] HCA 43; 194 CLR 202, applied

10.  In any event, the possibility that the appellant has been denied a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to him could not be excluded beyond reasonable doubt: at [153].

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: In October and early November 2013, Mr Michael Hadchiti was tried before the primary judge and a jury of 12 and convicted of murdering Mr Billy Mack on 30 October 2011. Following a sentencing hearing on 21 February 2014, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 29 years, with a non-parole period of 21 years, 9 months commencing on 14 October 2013: R v Hadchiti (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 257.
	
	
	Mr Hadchiti seeks leave to appeal from both his conviction and the sentence imposed by the Court. For the reasons which follow, we have concluded that his appeal against conviction must be allowed, and that there must be a retrial.
	


Background


	
	The deceased was the boyfriend of the appellant’s sister, Ms Marian Roumanos, who was separated from the father of her two young children. Ms Roumanos gave evidence that her parents were unhappy about her separation from her former husband.
	
	
	On Sunday 30 October 2011, Ms Roumanos’ children had been staying in the Hadchiti family home, which was located on a large semi-rural block in Londonderry in outer northwestern Sydney. The appellant, who was then aged 20, lived there with his parents George and Sonia, and brothers Mehriz and Rabih. Another son, John, lived with his wife and children in a granny flat at the back of the block. Without conveying any disrespect, we will refer to the members of the Hadchiti family by their given names.
	
	
	On the evening of 30 October 2011, the deceased drove to the Hadchiti residence in order to collect Marian’s children. With him in the car were Marian and the deceased’s niece, who cannot be identified because she was then aged 14, whom we shall call TB.
	
	
	The evidence permitted the timing of the critical events to be placed with some precision. At 8.50pm, the deceased purchased two bottles of soft drink and a bottle of water from a store in North Richmond. A call lasting 94 seconds was made by the deceased to Sonia at 9.07pm, shortly before he arrived at the Hadchiti family home. (There was evidence that it would take around 8 minutes to drive from the store to the Hadchiti residence.) The first “000” call was made by Sonia at 9.17pm, and police arrived at 9.29pm. When the police arrived, the deceased was lying face down on the grassed area at the front of the house. There was a large amount of blood. The appellant was sitting near the deceased with a brown-handled knife between his feet. His shoes and hands were stained with blood.
	
	
	While the events that took place between 9.07pm and the arrival of the police at 9.29pm were the subject of conflicting evidence at trial, the following facts are uncontroversial, save where otherwise indicated.
	
	
	The deceased stopped the car outside the Hadchiti premises, and walked into the front yard alone to collect the children. There was no street lighting outside the Hadchiti residence. Marian and TB remained outside the property.
	
	
	At around 9.15pm, Marian and TB were let into the house of two near neighbours, who lived around three houses along the street, although that was “[a]pproximately 500 metres or so” along the street. The neighbours knew Marian. One gave evidence that Marian said: “My phone is flat. Can I use your phone? I need to ring the police. They are going to kill Billy.” The calls to “000” did not connect, but Marian did eventually speak to the local police. The neighbour said that Marian also tried to call her mother, and the deceased, without success. Telephone records showed two short calls (of 8 and 5 seconds’ duration) from the neighbours’ landline to the deceased’s mobile phone at 9.27pm and 9.29pm. The neighbour gave this evidence:
	


“A. She didn’t get through to her mother or Billy but then she rang the home phone and she got through to somebody. I heard her scream at the top of her lungs: ‘Where is Billy?’ I don’t know who she was talking to at the time and she started talking in Lebanese. I didn’t understand the conversation and then she hung up.

Q. Did you speak to her and ask her who she was speaking to?

A. Yes I did. I asked her who she spoke to and she said: ‘That was my father I spoke to.’

Q. Did she say what he said?

A. Yes she did. She said that he told her to ‘eat shit’.”


	
	Sonia made two “000” calls that night. Both were recorded, and transcripts were tendered at the trial. In the first, at 9.17pm, she asked for the police. She said “he had a knife in his hand please hurry he attacked me.” The second, made at 9.22pm, was to the ambulance. She said “please hurry someone tried to stab me … someone is injured and the guy who stabbed me had a knife please hurry”.
	
	
	A brown coloured steel chair frame was found by the police in the front yard of the Hadchiti premises. It was photographed by police, resting on its side. Underneath it were the black sunglasses the deceased had been wearing, and his car keys and a swipe pass. Numerous blood stains were also found on the steel chair frame. There was an injury to the middle of the deceased’s back at the level of the T3 vertebra, in the shape of a 23 mm x 23 mm square, which corresponded to the edge of the chair frame.
	
	
	Two knives were recovered from the property. One was a brown handled pocket knife, with the blood of the deceased on it. Another was a “Columbia” brand knife, which also contained the deceased’s blood.
	
	
	The autopsy showed that although the deceased had suffered many wounds to his head and chest, including a punctured lung, and two wounds to the back of his head, one of which fractured his skull, the cause of his death was a broad slicing 16 x 7 cm transversely aligned horizontal gaping incised wound to the front of his neck. An expert forensic pathologist gave evidence that the knife had severed both sternomastoid muscles (the thick muscles on the side of the neck) as well as the right common carotid artery and the adjacent right internal jugular vein. On the right side of the neck was a “fish tail” like appearance. The forensic pathologist gave evidence that:
	


“by far the most common means by which such an appearance is caused in an incised wound is by a to-ing and fro-ing motion of the knife. In other words a single slice of the knife should not cause multiple defects in the skin so it is much more likely it is a cut one way followed by being brought back at the same level. A sawing motion if you like.”


	
	However, the pathologist conceded in cross-examination that he could not exclude as a possibility that the wound had been inflicted in a face-to-face struggle.
	
	
	It was common ground at trial that the appellant had inflicted the wound to the deceased’s neck from which he died. The issues were his intention at the time, self-defence and provocation. The defence case was that the deceased had attacked Sonia with a knife, that the appellant had gone to her aid, struggled with the deceased and killed him while struggling for control of the knife.
	
	
	A yellow t-shirt which had been worn by Sonia was torn and the deceased’s DNA was found on its left sleeve.
	
	
	The appellant had blood on his hands, his shoes and his clothes when the police arrived (photographs taken of him that evening were tendered at the trial). He told police at the scene that “He stabbed me, I didn’t have a choice”.
	
	
	The appellant had suffered a wound to his left wrist. A director of the police Clinical Forensic Unit, who had seen photographs of the wound, gave the following evidence of that wound:
	


“The injury to the left wrist is clearly an incised wound resulting from a sharp instrument such as a knife. It is probable that the injury was a result of an assault described by the subject but self-inflicted injury cannot be excluded definitely [sic, definitively]”.


	
	The deceased had a background involving violence, including violence to women involving a knife. The jury was told of his antecedents, including matters for which he was not convicted. He had been charged with assaulting a woman outside her home in 2001 (and was not convicted), he was charged in 2002 with two counts of common assault including upon a previous girlfriend with whom he had a child, but was not convicted. He was apprehended by police in 2003 after throwing a knife to the footpath, and he confronted a woman in 2007 with a large bread knife and said “I’m going to cut your throat”. Both of these matters resulted in convictions. In June 2008 he had entered the Blacktown Methadone Clinic with a large knife; this did not result in a conviction. Finally, on 5 August 2008, when asked by police to stop a car he was driving whose registration had expired, the deceased reversed the car into the police vehicle. It collided heavily with the front of the police car. The police alighted with firearms drawn, but the deceased drove away. Eventually he was arrested. The evidence was not clear as to whether he was convicted.
	


The course of the trial before the primary judge


	
	The Crown called (amongst many others) Marian Roumanos, George, Sonia, Mehriz, and Rabih Hadchiti, and Mr Amin (an unrelated family friend who was visiting that evening). Each was advised of their rights under s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). In each case, application was made under s 38 of the Evidence Act for a determination that they were unfavourable witnesses. In each case, the application was unopposed. TB also gave evidence, by a DVD played to the jury, which recorded an interview commencing just after 11am on the day following the events at the Hadchiti residence.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence, and admitted that he had inflicted the wound to the deceased’s neck. However, he denied that he intended to kill the deceased or cause him serious injury.
	
	
	On the 10th day of the trial, Friday 8 November 2013, the trial judge provided some draft written directions, which became MFI 17, to counsel. The appellant’s case concluded shortly thereafter. In the absence of a Crown case in reply, the Court almost immediately adjourned. On the morning of Monday 11 November 2013, the primary judge circulated a further draft of the proposed written directions as MFI 18. Addresses by the Crown and defence occupied the whole of the Monday, following which defence counsel raised (in the absence of the jury) some minor changes to parts of MFI 18.
	
	
	The closing address by the defence concluded on the Tuesday, following which the trial judge addressed the jury for the balance of that day, handing to them the final version of the written direction which became MFI 19. Her summing up was made by reference to that document. The summing up occupied 75 pages of transcript on the Tuesday (by which time her Honour had reached “Issue 4 – Provocation”), and a further 18 pages of transcript on Wednesday. It will be necessary in what follows to deal in detail with both the oral and written directions to the jury, which are the subject of ground 1 of the appeal against conviction.
	
	
	Before adjourning on Friday 8 November 2013, the trial judge had raised the possibility of a warning under s 165 of the Evidence Act in respect of the evidence given by members of the Hadchiti family with the Crown, who agreed. The warning given in relation to the jury’s acceptance of the exculpatory evidence of those witnesses is the subject of ground 2 of the appeal against conviction.
	
	
	The jury retired at 10.36am on Wednesday 13 November 2013, and returned a guilty murder verdict some five hours later.
	


Ground 1 – the directions to the jury


	
	The first ground of appeal in the conviction appeal was that “[t]he directions to the jury reversed the onus and standard of proof”. Some parts of the appellant’s written and oral submissions extended beyond that ground. This occurred without any objection from the Crown, who responsibly took the view that it was appropriate to address the totality of the complaints about the directions to the jury on their merits.
	


The written direction


	
	The written direction occupied seven pages. It is reproduced in its entirety as an annexure to this judgment. The first page, accurately and, it might be said, conventionally, directed the jury that they would find that the crime of murder had been committed by the accused if they concluded that the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt each of the following four elements:
	


“(i) that the accused deliberately stabbed Billy Mack in the neck, causing his death; and

(ii) that the stabbing was done with an intention to kill Billy Mack or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him (grievous bodily harm means really serious physical injury); and

(iii) that the stabbing was not carried out in self-defence; and

(iv) that the accused was not acting under provocation.”


	
	The first page then identified the elements of manslaughter in a similar fashion.
	
	
	Allowing for the inclusion of the defence of provocation which was left to the jury, the first page of the document substantially corresponds with the model written direction appended to this Court’s decision in R v Jones (1995) 38 NSWLR 652 at 663 which Hunt CJ at CL considered would greatly assist the jury to follow the summing up.
	
	
	The following six pages identified five issues and asked eight questions over 42 numbered paragraphs. They amount to what has been described as a “question trail”. It was these pages to which the submissions on appeal were principally directed.
	
	
	As originally formulated on page 1, the issues were framed in terms of whether the Crown had established a matter beyond reasonable doubt. However, the questions relating to the elements of murder posed on the following pages did not – save for two exceptions – refer to beyond reasonable doubt at all. This was the principal objection to the directions advanced by Mr Game SC, who appeared for the appellant, although not at trial.
	
	
	For example, the first issue, whether the Crown had shown that the stabbing was deliberate, involved the following question and chain of steps:
	


“10. Question 1 – Is there a reasonable possibility that the accused did not deliberately stab Billy Mack in the neck?

11. If the answer to this question is yes, then the accused is not guilty of murder and the question of manslaughter does not arise. The proper verdict is then not guilty of murder.

12. If the answer to this question is no, then you must consider question 2.”


	
	“Issue 2” was “did the accused have the relevant intention?” and involved the following chain:
	


“13. Question 2 – Is there a reasonable possibility that the accused stabbed Billy Mack in the neck, neither intending to kill him, nor intending to cause him really serious physical injury?

14. If the answer to this question is yes, then the accused is not guilty of murder. You must then consider whether he is guilty of manslaughter. (Go to issue 5).

15. If the answer to this question is no, then you must consider issue 3.”


	
	That is to say, the existence of a reasonable possibility that the appellant did not deliberately stab the deceased in the neck was equated to a failure by the Crown to discharge its onus of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant deliberately stabbed the deceased in the neck. The existence of a reasonable possibility that the appellant did not intend to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased was likewise equated to a failure by the Crown to discharge its onus of establishing that intent beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The exceptional use of “beyond reasonable doubt” in a question in the written directions arose in relation to self-defence and provocation. The questions in relation to self-defence were framed as follows:
	


“20. Question 4: Is there a reasonable possibility that stabbing Billy Mack’s neck was a reasonable response to the circumstances as the accused perceived them?

21. If the answer to that question is yes, then the accused is not guilty of murder and the question of manslaughter does not arise.

22. If the answer to this question is no, because you conclude that the Crown has shown beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s response was excessive, then the accused is not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.”


	
	That formulation appears to proceed, once again, on the basis that the existence of a reasonable possibility is the converse of the Crown establishing beyond reasonable doubt. If that were not so, then a negative answer to “Question 4” would not be fully dealt with by the question trail. That is to say, paragraph 22 proceeds on the basis that a negative answer to “Question 4” equates to a conclusion that the Crown had shown beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s response was excessive. Similar reasoning demonstrates that the words “because you conclude that the Crown has shown beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s response was excessive” were redundant in the direction.
	
	
	We will turn to the written directions concerning provocation when dealing with the appellant’s submissions on that issue.
	


The oral summing up


	
	As noted above, the primary judge’s oral summing up followed MFI 19. When dealing with “beyond reasonable doubt”, her Honour said:
	


“Repeated mention has been made of the Crown’s obligation to prove that the accused is guilty, beyond reasonable doubt. This expression ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’ is an ancient one, which does not need further explanation from the trial judges. The words are words of ordinary everyday usage. You should thus ask yourself, ‘Is there a reasonable possibility that the accused is not guilty?’ If you conclude on the evidence that there is such a possibility, then you will conclude that the Crown has not proven the charges which the accused faces.”


	
	Mr Game described this as a “serious misdirection”. He did so for two main reasons. The first was that notwithstanding that the trial judge correctly stated that the expression “beyond reasonable doubt” should not be explained further, that was precisely what her Honour went on to do, in the very next two sentences, which once again equate beyond reasonable doubt to the absence of a reasonable possibility.
	
	
	The second reason for his criticism was that the explanation by her Honour involved the jury reaching a conclusion that there was a “reasonable possibility” of innocence, which amounted, so it was said, to a reversal of onus.
	
	
	The Crown observed, correctly, that the passage reproduced above resembled the model direction on standard of proof in the Bench Book prepared by the Judicial Commission. The Court was told that the present form of the passage in the Bench Book had remained unchanged since at least 2007. The passage (at [3-600]) is as follows:
	


“Standard of proof

The Crown must prove the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That is the high standard of proof that the Crown must achieve before you can convict the accused. At the end of your consideration of the evidence in the trial and the submissions made to you by the parties you must ask yourself whether the Crown has established the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In other words, you should ask yourself, ‘Is there any reasonable possibility that the accused is not guilty?’”


	
	The passage correctly refers, in a note, to “longstanding authority for the proposition that, except in certain limited circumstances, no attempt should be made to explain or embellish the meaning of the phrase ‘beyond reasonable doubt’”.
	
	
	Mr Game’s submission was as follows:
	


“[W]e would say that Bench Book is wrong. And we would say it’s actually also quite different to say once, shall we say, in passing. But then to turn it into an entire kind of template or to talk about it in the terms of exclusion of reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence ...”


	
	With great respect to the authors of the passage in the Bench Book, we have some difficulty reconciling the note (which correctly states the law that no attempt should be made to explain the expression) with the last sentence of the passage (which purports to explain the expression). However, that is not to say that a judge who summed up to the jury in terms taken from the Bench Book would necessarily be committing error, or even that the judge would probably be committing error. As Mr Game made clear in the passage reproduced above, the focus in this appeal is not so much equating proof beyond reasonable doubt to the existence of reasonable possibility of innocence, but the repetition of the latter terminology throughout a written direction designed to be the document against which the jury’s deliberations were to be conducted. To be clear, nothing in these reasons should be taken to support the proposition that merely by reading from the passage in the Bench Book there will have been a misdirection of the jury.
	
	
	Mr Game was also, very properly, at pains to point out that there were many occasions where her Honour correctly addressed on onus and standard. Moreover, that very often occurred immediately before or after (or both before and after) an erroneous explanation of “beyond reasonable doubt” was given or the need to identify a reasonable possibility of innocence was referred to. Mr Game accepted:
	


“There is no doubt at all that at certain point[s] going through the summing up, you will find the directions correctly given. I am not trying to get away from that. You have to look at the whole thing and decide ...”


	
	Later, he added:
	


“[N]one of the submissions for or against the propositions I put should be taken in isolation. It has to be taken as given. There are things I am arguing about that if they just appeared on their own in a summing up, I probably wouldn’t be arguing about it. You have to look at the whole thing to see what comes of it, good or bad.”


	
	There were some additional criticisms made by Mr Game.
	
	
	First, although her Honour mostly used the language of “reasonable possibility”, on some occasions her Honour referred to a “real possibility”. For example, when dealing with the beginning of the question trail, her Honour said:
	


“Turning then to issue one; was the stabbing deliberate? There is no issue that Billy Mack died or that the accused stabbing him in the neck caused his death. What is in issue is whether the stabbing was deliberate. If you conclude that there is a real possibility that the stab to Bill Mack’s neck was an involuntary, unintended act of the accused, then it was not his deliberate act.”


	
	Another example was in relation to provocation. The primary judge instructed:
	


“If you believe that there is a real possibility that the accused did lose his self-control as a result of provocation by the deceased ...”


	
	Secondly, Mr Game emphasised that most of the questions required, in order for the jury to proceed on a path to read a not guilty verdict, a positive finding of the existence of a reasonable possibility, even in circumstances where there was no complexity in framing the issue. Her Honour said in summing up:
	


“If, however, you[r] answer to question 2 ‘Is there a reasonable possibility that the accused stabbed Billy Mack in the neck neither intending to kill him nor intending to cause him really serious physical injury’ is ‘yes’, then you must turn to consider issue 3 which is self-defence.”


	
	Mr Game said of this:
	


“[Y]ou have to get through two negatives to be [found] not guilty here. The accused to get off has to establish that there is a reasonable possibility that ‘[he] neither intended to kill [him nor intended to cause him really serious physical injury]’. It’s very simple to state that as a positive. ‘The accused intended to do grievous bodily harm’, it’s said thousands of time, full stop. It’s not complicated. It is, in a way, the persistence and insistence of these directions we ... rely on.”


	
	Thirdly, Mr Game said that the written direction should be regarded as having primacy over the oral address, even though her Honour clearly stated that the written directions were “a guide for your deliberations but are not intended to replace or alter anything I said to you in the summing up”. Her Honour’s summing up followed the structure and order of MFI 19. For example when proceeding to deal with manslaughter, her Honour said:
	


“I must emphasise that the only way in which you can arrive at a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter is by a process of reasoning which follows the written directions.”


	
	More fundamentally, Mr Game pointed to the fact that it was the written direction which the jury actually took into the jury room.
	
	
	Fourthly, Mr Game added a discrete point in that respect, on the strength of Stanton v The Queen [2003] HCA 29; 77 ALJR 1151. Contrary to what was there held, the jury was told they were not permitted to consider manslaughter first. Mr Game came close to conceding that this point was not one that could stand alone (“I probably wouldn’t be making it if that is all there was in this case”).
	
	
	Fifthly, Mr Game levelled a series of submissions against the directions as to provocation (in the form s 23 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) took prior to the commencement of the Crimes Amendment (Provocation) Act 2014 (NSW)). The written direction correctly identified at paragraph 24 that the Crown would exclude provocation if it established beyond reasonable doubt any one of three matters (essentially, that there was no loss of self-control, that the loss of self-control was not induced or caused by the deceased, or that a reasonable person would not have lost self-control). However, the questions posed in MFI 19 were as follows:
	


“25.  Question 5: Is there a reasonable possibility that the things Billy Mack did or said, or both, induced, that is caused, the accused to lose his self control?

26. If the answer to that question is yes, then you must consider question 6.

27. If the answer is no, then the accused is guilty of murder.

28. Question 6: Is there a reasonable possibility that Billy Mack’s conduct could have caused an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self control as to have formed an intent to kill, or inflict grievous bodily harm on him?

29. If the answer to this question is no, then the accused is guilty of murder.

30. If the answer is yes, the accused is not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.”


	
	Once again, it was submitted that there was an equation of beyond reasonable doubt with the existence of a reasonable possibility. It was also submitted that the onus of the Crown to exclude beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the defence of provocation was, in questions 5 and 6, translated to a requirement that the jury positively find the existence of a reasonable possibility in order to avoid a guilty verdict. This was said to amount to a shifting of onus.
	
	
	The shifting of onus which was said to have occurred in the directions was, so it was submitted, confirmed by what the jury was told orally. Mr Game put the matter in oral submissions as follows (the page references are to the pages of transcript of the oral summing up, which addressed provocation on Wednesday morning, at pages 80-91):
	


“Back to onus on [page] 83, ‘To answer yes, you must find that there is [a possibility that Billy Mack’s provocation] actually caused the accused [to lose his self-control and kill Billy Mack wile deprived of his self-control]’. To get a positive answer you have to make a finding of actual possibility, of actual cause, and that’s wrong. Then we see, ‘It is not enough [that the accused simply lost his temper but he must have lost his] self-control’. Further down, ‘In determining whether there is the possibility ...’. I don’t mean to be critical of the judge, but my impression is the judge actually thinks that these things are interchangeable and that’s why the directions are so framed.

Top of page 84, ‘So you have to consider whether there is a reasonable possibility [that] the accused did lose his self-control ...’. It’s the reverse. The Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused didn’t lose his self-control. It’s a result of a provocation.”


	
	There were other, subsidiary, submissions made in relation to the instructions to the jury. On the view we take it is unnecessary to take the appellant’s criticisms of the directions to the jury any further.
	
	
	The Crown advanced two submissions in response to the appellant’s principal point. First, the Crown emphasised that the oral summing up “was replete with her Honour directing the jury that the Crown bore the onus and that that was an onus that needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt”. As noted above, it is true that the primary judge had almost invariably referred in conventional terms to the burden and onus either immediately before, or immediately after, or both before and after, each of the passages to which Mr Game took objection. Indeed, the fact that her Honour did so supported the appellant’s submission that her Honour regarded the expressions as interchangeable.
	
	
	The Crown’s second submission, advanced by reference to the Bench Book and three decisions of this Court, was that “certainly there is passage of time and some appearance in authorities that indicates [references to a reasonable possibility] is not controversial ... times do move on and there has been some earlier consideration in the cases I have taken your Honours to that there is other terminology that can be used”.  In respect of the Bench Book, the Crown accepted that the passage on the standard of proof “is just a model direction”.
	
	
	The Crown relied on R v Ayoub [2004] NSWCCA 209, Kanaan v R [2006] NSWCCA 109 and Ward v R [2013] NSWCCA 46, drawing attention to the following passages.
	
	
	In Ayoub at [4], Howie J said, with the agreement of Grove J, that:
	


“There is nothing wrong with a submission to the jury that, if there is a reasonable or real possibility that the Crown case had not been made out, they should acquit the accused. That submission is merely a different formulation of the standard direction that the jury cannot convict the accused unless they are satisfied of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. If a real or reasonable possibility exists that, for whatever reason, the Crown’s contention in support of the charge is not true, it follows that the jury cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has made its case.”


	
	In Kanaan at [144]-[145], the joint judgment of Hunt AJA, Buddin and Hoeben JJ stated:
	


“We would add that the direction sought … is not an easy concept for the jury to follow, and in our view it would be more likely to confuse rather than assist the jury. In our opinion, as stated earlier (at par [133] supra), a trial judge must at all times emphasise that the jury has to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown that it was the accused who committed the crime charged. Where an issue arises on the evidence as to whether some other person may have committed that crime, the judge should make it clear to the jury that they cannot be satisfied by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt that the crime was committed by the accused if there remains a reasonable possibility that the crime was committed by someone else. An appropriate direction would be that the Crown must remove or eliminate any such possibility, as well as satisfy the jury, on the evidence on which it relies, that beyond reasonable doubt the accused committed the offence.

This Court recently stated that, when an alibi is raised, an appropriate direction to the jury would be that the Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was at the scene of the crime at the relevant time, that the Crown cannot do so if there is any reasonable possibility that he was somewhere else at that time as asserted by the alibi evidence, and that the Crown must therefore remove or eliminate any reasonable possibility that the accused was at that other place at the relevant time and also persuade the jury, on the evidence on which the Crown relies, that beyond reasonable doubt he was at the scene of the crime at that time: Regina v Kanaan at [134]–[135]. A similar direction is appropriate in cases where self-defence or provocation is raised, where the onus of proof remains on the Crown.” 


	
	In Ward, McClellan CJ at CL (Latham and Adamson JJ concurring) rejected a ground of appeal based on misdirection to the jury where the following explanation was given:
	


“Another way of doing it is to ask yourself, is there any reasonable possibility that when she drove at the deceased on the second occasion she did not intend to drive at him? If that reasonable possibility exists the Crown does not satisfy you that her version, in effect, in the record of interview could not possibly be true then the Crown has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that [sic] the charge of murder. It is the same way of looking at it. Am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, means the same thing as saying, has the Crown convinced me that the opposite could not possibly reasonably be true? The easiest way to think about it, as I say, is in relation to the accused’s record of interview. The Crown must satisfy you to the charge of murder that account could not reasonably be true. She does not have the proving that it is, or could possibly be true [sic]. The Crown ... for the charge of murder has to make it clear to you that you would reject it as a possible account, as a possible scenario.”


	
	His Honour observed at [50]:
	


“[C]ritical to a conclusion that a direction which is not confined as required by Green has caused a miscarriage of justice will be whether or not the direction which has been given had the effect of diminishing the standard of proof[:] FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 at [178].”


	
	In response to the submissions based on Stanton, the Crown pointed to Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83 at [452] and Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93; 81 NSWLR 119 at [86]-[94], to illustrate how a jury’s deliberations could be regulated. On the view we take, it will not be necessary to resolve this point, which as has been noted was regarded by the appellant as relatively minor. However, it will be noted that paragraph 2 of MFI 19, which provided that “You must first consider whether the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused murdered Billy Mack”, was squarely contrary to what was said by the High Court of a materially identical direction in Stanton at [35].
	


Consideration of ground 1


	
	We have concluded that the submissions made in connection with this ground have been made out, for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, the task when addressing a complaint as to a jury direction is as stated by Porter J, with the agreement of Wood and Pearce JJ, in Lin v Tasmania [2015] TASCCA 13 at [108]:
	


“[I]t is important for the Court to have regard to the overall impression which the whole summing up would have created in the minds of the jury: R v Ho (2002) 130 A Crim R 545 at [32]; R v Daniel (2010) 207 A Crim R 449 at [25]; R v Thomas [2015] SASCFC 55 at [79]. Small snippets from a summing up should not be wholly divorced from their context; questions of whether particular parts invalidate an otherwise proper summing up raise matters of fact, degree and general impression: R v Calides (1983) 34 SASR 355 at 357.”

The submissions of both counsel on appeal accorded with that approach.


	
	We do not consider that the oral summing up, correctly emphasising the Crown’s obligation to prove beyond reasonable doubt, displaced the force of the seven page written direction. It is not necessary to express a concluded view, but if the oral direction were considered alone, then we would very much doubt that the errors to which Mr Game pointed would have been sufficient to detract from the jurors performing their task in accordance with law. The weight of the address, considered as a whole, reiterated the obligation borne by the Crown to establish the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. We would accept the Crown’s submission to that effect.
	
	
	But it was the seven pages of MFI 19 which were taken into the jury room. It is to be presumed that since they commanded the jury to approach their task in a particular way (for example “If the answer to this question is no, then you must consider question 2”) the jurors paid close regard to the document at the very time that they reached their verdict. That is after all what the trial judge instructed the jury to do in terms. Moreover, and decisively, to our minds, is the common-sense consideration that it would be the written document in the jury room which would decisively frame the jurors’ deliberations, as opposed to the jurors’ recollections of a lengthy oral address. We would respectfully adopt what Simpson J said of the effect of a written direction in Justins v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 242; 79 NSWLR 544 at [242]:
	


“[I]t must also be remembered that a jury will have the written directions in the jury room long after the oral directions have concluded. It will be written directions to which the jury will have resort, perhaps repeatedly. And the force of the written word will be likely to override the recollection the jury has of the oral directions.”


	
	Written directions to juries are authorised by s 55B of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) and are undoubtedly useful in clarifying the issues for the jury and assisting their understanding of the structure of a summing up and the issues of fact left for them to determine. There is much to be said for a summary of issues, especially if (as Hunt CJ at CL contemplated in Jones) it occupies a single page, so that the jurors can appreciate the structure of the issues for determination at a glance.
	
	
	However, this was far from being a straightforward trial. There were a number of defences and partial defences open on the evidence. The strength of the Crown case lay in a great deal of circumstantial evidence, and the challenge made – not without force – to the testimonial evidence of members of the Hadchiti family. As will be seen when dealing with ground 2 below, the challenge to the reliability of their evidence was very powerful. Central to the jury’s verdict were questions such as whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to who had initiated, and how many people had participated in, the struggle between the deceased and the appellant. It was essential that the jury not evaluate the evidence piecemeal, but rather assess the various possibilities in light of the whole of the evidence: see R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at [46]-[48] and the authorities there cited. Indeed, the critical questions of intention, self-defence and provocation were inter-related, and very much dependent upon the assessment by the jury of the facts. Considerations such as those might tend to suggest that this was a trial where a series of questions such as those in MFI 19 might not assist the jury in reaching their verdict.
	
	
	There is a further point. In New Zealand, a jurisdiction where “question trails” of the nature of pages 2 to 7 of MFI 19 are more common, emphasis has been given to the importance of avoiding unnecessary length and complexity: Singh v The Queen [2014] NZCA 306 at [8], [27] and [30]. In Budrodeen v R [2014] NSWCCA 332 at [3] and [24] this Court emphasised the care that needs to accompany a question trail. We respectfully agree, and would add that it is important to bear in mind, especially if it be proposed to give a relatively lengthy written direction, an inevitable consequence of written directions as has been noted above. Where a direction to the jury is in part oral and in part written, then to the extent that the written document overlaps with the oral direction, the written document will tend to swamp the force of the oral direction in the jury room. It will do so because of (a) the power of the written word, (b) the fact that it is with the jury at the critical time, and (c) unlike the oral directions, it is apt to be read repeatedly.
	
	
	Secondly, we do not consider that the correct and traditional formulation of issues on the first page displaces the effect of the remaining pages. The document is to be read as a whole. What was the jury to do? To apply the first page, and convict only if they were satisfied the Crown had established each of the four elements beyond reasonable doubt? Or to apply the following 39 paragraphs, largely framed by reference to mandatory questions in a particular order?
	
	
	On a natural reading of the document as a whole, pages 2 to 7 of the document prescribed how the issues stated on page 1 were to be approached, and the order in which they were to be approached. It cannot be thought that the jurors would have approached their task in any other way.
	
	
	The same considerations lead us to conclude that when the jury came to address provocation, they would have relied on the questions as formulated in paragraphs 25 to 30, rather than the summary at paragraph 24.
	
	
	Thirdly, the natural force of the questions contained in pages 2 to 7 is to equate beyond reasonable doubt with the existence of a reasonable possibility. In this country, that is wrong.
	
	
	Many countries which have inherited a common law system have departed from the traditional “beyond reasonable doubt” formulation of the criminal standard. The appellate decisions in footnote 83 of the joint judgment in Darkan v The Queen [2006] HCA 34; 227 CLR 373 record the extent to which this has occurred in England, New Zealand, Canada and the United States of America. Some Australian judges, writing extra-judicially, have suggested that some explanation of the traditional formulation be given: see (for example) B Martin, “Beyond reasonable doubt” (2010) 10 The Judicial Review 83 at 116 and G Eames, “Tackling the complexity of criminal trial directions: What role for appellate courts?” (2007) 29 Aust Bar Rev 161 at 179-183. The New South Wales Law Reform Commission was of the same view: NSWLRC Rep 136, Jury Directions (November 2012) pp 62-73. But the issue is a divisive one. The Queensland Law Reform Commission concluded in 2009 that there should be no significant change: Report 66, A Review of Jury Directions, Volume 2, para 17.46. The New South Wales Law Reform Commission proposed consideration of a range of alternative formulations, suggesting that each should be empirically tested, and not recommending any.
	
	
	The varying opinions expressed by Law Reform Commissions and in professional literature may be put to one side, because the position for all Australian courts below the High Court is very clear. Explanation should not, save in unusual circumstances, be given of the expression “beyond reasonable doubt”. It was not suggested that this case was an exception to the general rule (examples where an explanation should be given include when the defence propounds possibilities which are fanciful, and in some cases in response to a juror’s question: see RWB v R; R v RWB [2010] NSWCCA 147; 202 A Crim R 209 at [49]-[50]; and s 63 of the Jury Directions Act 2015 (Vic)).
	
	
	In Dawson v The Queen (1961) 106 CLR 1 at 18 Dixon CJ said:
	


“[I]n my view it is a mistake to depart from the time-honoured formula. It is, I think, used by ordinary people and is understood well enough by the average man in the community. The attempts to substitute other expressions, of which there have been many examples not only here but in England, have never prospered. It is wise as well as proper to avoid such expressions.”


	
	In Green v The Queen (1971) 126 CLR 28 at 32, a unanimous High Court, after reproducing that passage, as well as passages to similar effect from judgments of Barton ACJ, Kitto J and Windeyer J, said:
	


“Those quotations are but some of many admonitions to judges presiding over criminal trials to adhere to and not to attempt needless explanations of the classical statement of the nature of the onus of proof resting on the Crown.

It is thus remarkable that in this instance the learned trial judge, undeterred by the failures of illustrious predecessors, has made a new endeavour to explain that which requires no explanation and to improve upon the traditional formula. So far from succeeding where they did not, he has, in our opinion, not only confused the jury but has misdirected them. In consequence there must be a new trial ...”


	
	The position was confirmed (in obiter dicta) by all members of the High Court in Darkan at [69] and [131].
	
	
	The history of alternative formulations such as those employed by the primary judge was considered by Macrossan CJ in The Queen v Holman [1997] 1 Qd R 373, a case which bears some resemblance to this appeal. Mr Holman was convicted of attempted murder, and self-defence was left to the jury. As in the present appeal, the focus was on the summing up to the jury, which in part followed the conventional course, but which also repeatedly referred to the existence of a reasonable possibility. For example, the trial judge said “it is sufficient for the purpose of the accused if you think that there is a reasonable possibility that he stabbed Mr Page in self-defence”. Macrossan CJ reproduced (at 376-377) a series of similar statements made during the course of the summing up.
	
	
	Macrossan CJ then said at 378:
	


“It seems that his Honour’s references to ‘reasonable possibility’ may be traceable to observations made in the Court of Criminal Appeal in New South Wales.”


	
	After referring to two decisions of Hunt CJ at CL (R v Reeves (1992) 29 NSWLR 109 and R v Jones (1995) 38 NSWLR 652), the Chief Justice observed that Hunt CJ at CL was:
	


“adverting to special considerations which he saw as arising in a certain category of case where the Crown had to exclude particular defences, eg alibi, provocation, self-defence, duress, and the like. Even there Hunt CJ at CL saw the need to keep the emphasis on the Crown’s obligation to prove beyond reasonable doubt.”


	
	Macrossan CJ then stated at 378:
	


“With all due respect to the judge in New South Wales and the phrase which he suggests as suitable for use (although admittedly only in a limited category including self defence cases), a danger will intrude when the word ‘reasonable’ is detached from the word ‘doubt’ and attached to ‘possibility of innocence’. It is better as a continuing reminder of the underlying onus to leave ‘reasonable’ attached to ‘doubt’ where it enshrines the fundamental concept to be applied by the jury. The firm objective of the law in this area is to preserve a standardised expression of the onus. Different phrases may strike different chords in people’s minds and provide encouragement to a jury to follow an inappropriate path. Accordingly, however much a particular judge may, in addition, wish to suggest to a jury that they give attention to this or that part of the evidence as important in the consideration of the case, he must be careful to ensure that there is firmly fixed in their minds the fundamental overriding onus summed up in the time honoured phrase. If the possibility of error is to be avoided even when dealing with ‘defences’ which the Crown is obliged to exclude, it is suggested that it would be wiser to direct the jury to ask themselves, ‘Has the Crown to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt excluded the possibility that the accused acted in self defence?’, rather than, ‘Do we think there is a reasonable possibility that the accused acted in self defence?’.”


	
	It will be seen that, repeatedly, in the document taken into the jury room at the time of the jury’s deliberations, the notion of reasonable doubt was equated to the existence of a reasonable possibility. That is contrary to the authorities referred to above. It contrasts with the question trail reproduced in part by RA Hulme J in FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182; 224 A Crim R 82 at [127].
	
	
	Fourthly, we would firmly reject the Crown’s qualified reliance on the formulation having been “for some considerable period of time in the Bench Book” and things having “moved on”. Until the High Court or the Legislature determines otherwise, this Court must apply the High Court authorities referred to above: Garcia v National Australia Bank Ltd [1998] HCA 48; 194 CLR 395 at [17]; Phillips v The Queen [2006] HCA 4; 225 CLR 303 at [60].
	
	
	Fifthly, we do not consider that the Crown’s reliance on the passages from Ayoub, Kanaan and Ward is a sufficient answer to the appellant’s submissions when attention is focussed, as in our view it must be focussed, on the written directions in MFI 19. The way in which instructions to the jury posed in terms “Is there a reasonable possibility that ...” have been considered in those cases is as follows.
	
	
	In Ayoub the appellant appealed his conviction for the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent upon the victim. The trial judge in the District Court interrupted defence counsel’s closing address in which counsel asked the jury to consider whether it thought “there’s a possibility that [Walsh] has done it or that any of the other persons have actually done the stabbing …”. The judge interrupted and said that that was not a proper submission and it confused the question of reasonable doubt.
	
	
	On appeal, Howie J observed that there was nothing wrong with the submission to the jury that if there was a reasonable or real possibility that the Crown case had not been made out they should acquit. His Honour said it was a different formulation of the standard direction that unless they were satisfied of the offence beyond reasonable doubt they must acquit. He said that if a real or reasonable possibility existed, such that (for whatever reason), the Crown’s contention in support of the charge was not true, it followed that the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had made out its case: at [4].
	
	
	His Honour also observed at [6]:
	


“The only possible danger with putting the standard of proof in this way is that it might suggest that the accused has an onus of raising the possible scenario that is inconsistent with the Crown case.  But I do not believe that a jury would have the slightest difficulty understanding that it is not for the accused to prove that such a possibility exists, especially where it is made clear that the accused has to prove nothing by way of defence to the charge …” (emphasis added).


	
	On one view this latter observation may be said to operate to support the directions in MFI 19. However, on the other hand, it specifically cautioned as to a possible danger of putting the standard of proof in that way. As to whether such a “danger” existed would, as his Honour indicated, however, have to be considered in light of whether it was clear to the jury that the accused did not have to prove such a possibility exists.
	
	
	In Kanaan the Court addressed cases where an issue arises on the evidence as to whether some other person may have committed the crime charged. The Court at [144] stated:
	


“… the judge should make it clear to the jury that they cannot be satisfied by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt that the crime was committed by the accused if there remains a reasonable possibility that the crime was committed by someone else. An appropriate direction would be that the Crown must remove or eliminate any such possibility, as well as satisfy the jury, on the evidence on which it relies, that beyond reasonable doubt the accused committed the offence” (emphasis added).


	
	Thus the relevant “reasonable possibility” was linked to the statement that it was for the Crown to remove or eliminate it.
	
	
	In Ward the trial judge (Howie J) gave a comprehensive direction in relation to the standard of proof. In the course of doing so his Honour referred to the defence case which was, in effect, that the appellant did not intend to drive at the victim. It is important to observe that Howie J linked discussion of the existence of a “reasonable possibility” specifically to the Crown’s onus of proof. His Honour stated:
	


“Another way of doing it is to ask yourself, is there any reasonable possibility that when she drove at the deceased on the second occasion she did not intend to drive at him? If that reasonable possibility exists the Crown does not satisfy you that her version, in effect, in the record of interview could not possibly be true then the Crown has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that [sic] the charge of murder. It is the same way of looking at it. Am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, means the same thing as saying, has the Crown convinced me that the opposite could not possibly reasonably be true?  The easiest way to think about it, as I say, is in relation to the accused’s record of interview. The Crown must satisfy you to the charge of murder that account could not reasonably be true. She does not have the proving that it is, or could possibly be true [sic]. The Crown … for the charge of murder has to make it clear to you that you would reject it as a possible account, as a possible scenario. So that is how the onus of proof works” (extracted from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal at [48], emphasis added).


	
	The emphasised words are significant.
	
	
	In assessing the significance of the written directions in MFI 19, it is necessary to consider the legal onus upon the Crown in the particular framework and evidence in this case. By way of example, in R v Youssef (1990) 50 A Crim R 1, the appellant was convicted of manslaughter after a motor vehicle that he was driving struck and killed a pedestrian. His defence was that as part of the collision he suffered an epileptic seizure causing automatism. The ground of appeal was that the judge was wrong in excluding sane automatism as being available to the appellant.
	
	
	Hunt J observed that the Crown must remove any reasonable possibility that the act of the accused was accidental or that it was involuntary as a result of a state of automatism or as a result of duress.
	
	
	His Honour observed that the Crown must bring evidence to meet every such “defence” which could possibly arise in relation to the offence charged. In every case, however, his Honour observed that the accused bears an evidentiary onus to point to or produce evidence (or material in an unsworn statement) from which it could be inferred that there is at least a reasonable possibility that, for example, the act of the accused was accidental, or that it was provoked or done in self-defence (at 3).
	
	
	His Honour continued:
	


“The authorities make it clear that such a reasonable possibility must be shown by admissible evidence. … [M]ost Australian authority, are … more in accordance with principle and logic, when they say that there must be evidence from which it could be inferred that there is the reasonable possibility that the act of the accused was of such a nature” (at 3, emphasis in original).


	
	His Honour referred to The Queen v Howe (1958) 100 CLR 448 at 459 in which Dixon CJ said that the legal onus was placed upon the Crown to remove any reasonable doubt in relation to any issue “once a ground is disclosed by the evidence upon which a plea of self-defence may arise”.
	
	
	Returning to the facts underlying this appeal, the appellant’s account to police was that in the initial stage of events he was attacked by the deceased which then led to a violent struggle between the two men.
	
	
	The Crown had the legal onus to prove the elements of the offence of murder beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant had an evidentiary onus to point to or produce evidence from which there is at least a reasonable possibility that the act of stabbing by him was carried out by him in self-defence: R v Youssef (1990) 50 A Crim R 1 at 3. This he initially did by making a statement to police and later giving evidence at the trial. In these circumstances the onus fell upon the Crown to remove any reasonable doubt in relation to the “reasonable possibility” raised by the defence, ie, the ground of self-defence disclosed by the evidence: Howe at 459.
	
	
	The accused in this case discharged the evidentiary onus as to a reasonable possibility of self-defence (and an attack by the deceased). In those circumstances the question at trial became whether the jury believed and accepted his account.
	
	
	But the central point is that the “reasonable possibility” established by the evidence was one that the Crown had to eliminate or remove as part of its onus of proof. It was important that the directions in MFI 19 made that clear.
	
	
	This was not a case where, in relation to the elements which the Crown had to negate beyond reasonable doubt, MFI 19 instructed the jury that the Crown must “remove or eliminate any reasonable possibility” (cf Kanaan at [145]) or that if any reasonable possibility remained, the jury must acquit (cf Ayoub at [4]). There is nothing wrong with such formulations. But to our minds there is a critical difference between what will necessarily result in an acquittal and what is sufficient to reach a guilty verdict. There is a critical difference between an instruction to the effect that the Crown must remove a reasonable possibility in order for a guilty verdict to be available and an instruction that turns on whether the jury has found there to be a reasonable possibility in order to avoid a guilty verdict. This is essentially the point made by Macrossan CJ in Holman and may be seen in the passages from Ayoub, Kanaan and Ward considered above.
	
	
	Sixthly, a deal of the force in Mr Game’s submissions, to our minds, was that there was no occasion for much of the elaboration in the “question trail”. The first issue was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused deliberately stabbed the deceased in the neck. The second issue was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased. Of course, as Hunt CJ at CL pointed out, there is a potential for confusion when the Crown must negative a defence to the criminal standard, for which reason it has long been accepted in this State that in relation to negative elements, it can be appropriate to ask whether the Crown has eliminated any reasonable possibility that the accused, say, acted in self-defence: see Jones at 659-660. But the written direction was not framed in those terms even in respect of the elements which the Crown had to negative. MFI 19 treated identically the positive and negative elements which the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	We regard the departure from the conventional formulation to be material. One way of explaining why is as follows. If the answer to “Question 1” was affirmative, such that there was found to be a reasonable possibility that the appellant did not deliberately stab the deceased in the neck, then it is plain that the Crown case was not made out and a not guilty verdict should have been returned. But that is not the only way in which the Crown could fail on that issue. The Crown could fall short of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant deliberately stabbed the deceased in the neck, even if the jury were unable to conclude that there was a reasonable possibility that the appellant did not do so. We think that a jury would be unlikely readily to grasp the nuances here, between the reasonable possibility which is sufficient for an acquittal but the absence of which is not necessary for a guilty verdict.
	
	
	We are strengthened in that conclusion by the direction relating to provocation. Although paragraph 24 of the written directions correctly identifies the legal issues, we conclude that the jury would have applied the questions in paragraphs 25 to 30 on the following page of MFI 19. As will be seen in more detail below, provocation was very much alive on the evidence: the deceased had a history of attacking women with knives, there was evidence that he had threatened Marian’s estranged husband, and there were tears on Sonia’s shirt as well as the DNA of the deceased. The defence case was that Sonia was attacked by the deceased, which caused the appellant to attack him with a knife in order to protect his mother. We consider that it is quite possible that the framing of questions 5 and 6 in terms of there being a reasonable possibility could have distracted the jury from their task of determining whether the Crown had negatived provocation beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In the particular facts of this trial, where there was great uncertainty as to exactly what occurred in the critical minutes after 9.07pm, we have concluded that the departures from what the High Court requires should not be regarded as immaterial.
	
	
	Ground 1 as advanced in written and (especially) oral submissions essentially challenged the directions in MFI 19 as erroneous and contrary to law. For reasons given above, we have concluded that the challenge has been made good. Although the ground as drafted is that the directions reversed the onus and standard of proof, it has not been necessary to make an affirmative finding in that respect. The focus of Ground 1 in submissions was the question as to whether the directions in MFI 19 contravened well-established principles by which juries in criminal trials must be directed concerning the legal onus upon the Crown. The ground has, accordingly, been determined on the latter basis.
	
	
	The trial judge gave more than ample notice to the parties of the form of the proposed written direction, and acceded, on two occasions, to relatively minor changes to it. No objection to the directions was taken by counsel appearing. The consequences are that her Honour did not receive the assistance to which she was entitled from the parties in this respect, and the appellant requires leave, pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, to advance on appeal a complaint about a written direction which was not taken at trial.
	
	
	It is trite that “[t]he requirements of r 4 do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside”: R v Germakian [2007] NSWCCA 373; 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]. Further, as the Court added at [13] (citations omitted):
	


“Generally speaking, leave under r 4 will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings ...”


	
	For the reasons upon which we will elaborate below, when dealing with the proviso, we have concluded that the written direction goes to the root of the proceedings in the sense described in Germakian, such that there should be a grant of leave. We note that an appeal against conviction was allowed on the ground of a misdirection elaborating on reasonable doubt in Lin v Tasmania [2015] TASCCA 13, despite the fact that no exception was taken to the misdirection at trial: see at [136].
	
	
	Before considering the operation of the proviso, we turn to address the second ground of the appeal against conviction.
	


Ground 2 – the unreliability warning


	
	Ground 2 in the appeal against conviction was that the trial judge erred “in giving an unreliability warning in respect of the Hadchiti family because there were ‘good reasons for not giving the direction’”.
	
	
	The primary judge gave a relatively lengthy warning against the reliability of the evidence of George, Sonia, Mehriz, Rabih and Mr Amin.  (Her Honour did not mention the other son who was called to give evidence, John, but although her failure to do so was briefly criticised in oral submissions on appeal, it was not challenged that he was in a “granny flat” the entire evening; indeed he was not challenged by the Crown in any respect in his evidence.)
	
	
	The warning was modelled on a standard accomplice warning. The Crown accepted on appeal that “[i]t may well be perceived that the Judge should have tempered the direction” and “[s]ome aspects of the warning [were] arguably not necessary” (written submissions, paragraph 55). The Crown concluded that “although not the subject of complaint at the time, the terms of the warning may well have extended beyond what was necessary or required in the circumstances of this case” (written submissions, paragraph 58).
	
	
	The warning was not sought by a party. The trial judge proposed it, in the absence of the jury, as follows:
	


“I take it, given the way in which the Crown has put its case, that one of the things that will need to be addressed in the summing up is directions in relation to witnesses who might have been criminally concerned in this matter.”


	
	The Crown said that was correct. There was no opposition or objection from the defence.
	
	
	Section 165 of the Evidence Act relevantly provides:
	


“165 Unreliable evidence

(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:

...

(d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding,

...

(2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:

(a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and

(b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and

(c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.

(3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.”


	
	The warning to the jury was framed in mandatory terms (“it is necessary for me to give you particular warnings”, “The law requires me to give you certain warnings”). That is not strictly correct. The obligation arises only upon a request being made, and is qualified by there being “good reasons for not doing so”. However, that was not the complaint advanced by the appellant.
	
	
	The appellant pointed to two matters. The first was that all of the witnesses the subject of the warning had been called by the Crown, had been the subject of s 38 applications, and had been cross-examined by the Crown. In the case of all save Sonia, the evidence was largely exculpatory of the appellant. It was said, in accordance with what was said in R v Baker [2001] NSWCCA 151 that, to the extent that their evidence tended to support the appellant, they should have been regarded as ordinary witnesses. Baker was a case where error was identified when an accomplice warning was given. Ipp AJA there said at [34]:
	


“In my view, [h]is Honour should have explained that, to the extent that Young’s evidence tended to support the evidence of the appellant, he should be regarded as an ordinary witness and his evidence should be treated on its merits without there being a need for a special warning.”


	
	The second was that in the case of Sonia, while part of her evidence inculpated the appellant and part was exculpatory, the direction did not distinguish between the evidence. Reliance was placed on R v Vu [2005] NSWCCA 266 where it was said at [36]:
	


“In my view, there were good reasons for not giving the warning in question. Pham’s evidence did not implicate the appellant in the crime charged. To the contrary, it tended to exculpate him. See R v Rose (2002) 55 NSWLR 701 at [294], [295], [297] and [343]. If a warning was given, it should have been limited to those parts of the evidence of the witness that inculpated the appellant. In this case, virtually the whole of her evidence was exculpatory of him.”


	
	No objection was taken at trial to the warning which was given. The position may be contrasted with Baker where objection was made immediately to the direction.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this proposed ground of appeal, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules has particular force. It is plain, for example, that Sonia’s evidence was utterly inconsistent, including on critical matters (such as whether she heard the deceased say “Let me go you scumbags”).
	
	
	Sonia gave evidence that after being called by the deceased shortly after 9pm:
	


“A. He came in the driveway in my daughter’s car. After he stopped I realised it was my daughter’s car. He came in like very dangerously braked the car, came straight in and started saying and aggravation and that.

Q. Stop there; what did he say when he came in?

A. ‘Where are they you fuckin’ grunts’ something along those lines.

Q. He started swearing at you did he?

A. Yes.”


	
	She said that the deceased grabbed her and pushed her to the ground, and she felt him kicking her. She said that he and the appellant got into a fight, and that no other member of the family was involved.
	
	
	It was then put to Sonia that her evidence was “a total load of hogwash”, because someone had hit the deceased over the head with the metal chair. Sonia was cross-examined vigorously by the Crown but maintained her evidence.
	
	
	It is not necessary to summarise the evidence of George, Mehriz and Rabih Hadchiti and Mr Amin. Speaking generally, they denied part of what they had said on the evening to police, in ways that are difficult to explain as cases of faulty memories. For example, Rabih denied that his father had tried to separate the appellant and the deceased, contrary to his statement to police that evening. The inconsistencies were put to them.
	
	
	It is perhaps unusual for so many Crown witnesses to be called, regarded as unfavourable, cross-examined twice, and then be the subject of a warning. However, at no stage was there any objection taken by the defence to that course.
	
	
	There was good reason for counsel taking that course for it is perfectly plain even from the transcript of evidence of Sonia, George, Mehriz, Rabih and Mr Amin that their evidence was inconsistent. What is more, defence counsel’s address to the jury well illustrates what was perceived at the time.
	
	
	In his entire address to the jury, which on its face appears to have been cogent and squarely directed to the evidence, counsel for the accused did not mention that his client might be exonerated by the evidence of any of his family or by Mr Amin. He focussed first on the medical and forensic evidence, and pointed to the facts that the Crown’s expert agreed that the deceased’s throat could have been cut by his twisting his neck against a stationary knife, and that the injuries connected with the chair frame could have been incurred by the deceased falling onto the chair. He stressed the limited time for an opportunistic attack by more than one member of the Hadchiti family, and the unreliability of the evidence of TB and Marian. Finally, he emphasised the absence of any plausible motive, his client’s good character, and the proven association of the deceased with knives and violence to women and drugs.
	
	
	Indeed, to the extent that he referred to the witnesses the subject of the s 165 direction, his point was only that the prosecution had failed to produce any blood-stained clothing from any other family member, notwithstanding that the police were at the home and had secured the site within minutes of the death. Counsel did not rely on any of the testimonial evidence given by the members of the Hadchiti family.
	
	
	In short, proposed ground 2 criticises a direction not objected to at the time which in effect mirrored the approach taken by counsel for the accused the previous day in his final address. We do not consider that leave should be granted to raise this ground of appeal. Even if the judge’s ruling went too far, as the Crown’s submissions came close to conceding, we are not persuaded that there was “such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings”.
	


The proviso


	
	Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides as follows:
	


“The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred” (emphasis added).


	
	The emphasised portion of s 6(1) is generally referred to as the “proviso”, empowering this Court to dismiss an appeal, even in the face of error by the primary judge.
	
	
	The Crown submitted in writing that, in respect of ground 1:
	


“If, contrary to these submissions, the Court were to be satisfied of error, then dependent on the view taken of the asserted errors, the proviso may apply.”


	
	That was the entirety of the Crown’s reliance on the proviso in its written submissions. That course is less than desirable. As was said in Mortada v R [2014] NSWCCA 36 at [156]:
	


“It is important for the person convicted at such a trial, as well as for the efficient operation of the Court, and the avoidance of a needless retrial in the limited circumstances where the proviso operates, that the Crown provide detailed and substantial assistance in explaining why a guilty verdict was inevitable and how that conclusion can safely be reached, notwithstanding the natural limitations of appellate review.”


	
	The Crown’s reliance on the proviso was expanded upon in oral address:
	


“This was a case that your Honours were considering the evidence, where there was spectacularly compelling evidence in relation to material that supported the Crown’s case. … [T]hey’re very clear parts [of the evidence] showing this was a concerted attack upon the deceased that commenced from the moment he arrived.”

The Crown outlined a number of aspects of the evidence to support this submission. In response, Mr Game drew attention to a number of aspects of the evidence which he said “could raise a reasonable doubt”.

The law on the proviso


	
	The history of the adoption of the proviso is set out in the High Court’s judgment in Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300 at [12]-[30], by reference to equivalent Victorian legislation. The High Court there held at [35] that “in applying the proviso, the task is to decide whether a ‘substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred’.” More specifically, at [41]:
	


“[t]he appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the ‘natural limitations’ that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty” (citations omitted).


	
	As Gageler J said in Baini v The Queen [2012] HCA 59; 246 CLR 469 at [51]-[52]:
	


“… Weiss v The Queen overturned that understanding of the essential condition of the respondent persuading the court of criminal appeal that ‘no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred’. … As reformulated, the essential condition became that the court of criminal appeal itself be persuaded ‘that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused’s guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty’. … The reformulation in Weiss must, of course, be applied by courts of criminal appeal ‘[u]nless, and until, a majority of this Court qualifies what is said in [it]’” (citations omitted).


	
	As the majority stated in Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29; 89 ALJR 776 at [15]:
	


“By ‘substantial miscarriage of justice’ what is meant is that the possibility cannot be excluded beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant has been denied a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to him or her or that there was some other departure from a trial according to law that warrants that description” (citations omitted).


	
	There are two reasons why we would not apply the proviso in this matter. The first is by reason of a body of authority on the importance of a jury instruction about the standard and onus of proof. However strong the Crown case be, the appellant was entitled to a trial according to law. And however strong the Crown case, there are trials to which the proviso is incapable of applying. The second is that, having reviewed the evidence, we are not satisfied that the Crown case is as “spectacularly compelling” as was submitted. We deal with each reason in turn.
	


Misdirection as to standard and onus of proof


	
	As a majority of the High Court said in Handlen v The Queen [2011] HCA 51; 245 CLR 282 at [47] by reference to Weiss, “there is no single universally applicable description of what constitutes a ‘substantial miscarriage of justice’” (emphasis in original). In Krakouer v The Queen [1998] HCA 43; 194 CLR 202 at [74]-[75], McHugh J gave an example of such an error. His Honour said:
	


“Misdirections of law in a criminal trial can take many forms. Of few of them can it be said that, at all times and in all circumstances, they constitute a miscarriage of justice. Legal error must often give way to cogent evidence of guilt. But on such matters as the standard or onus of proof or the functions of the jury, the position is different. These matters go to the root of a criminal trial according to law. It is difficult to see how the weight of evidence can have any relevance as to whether or not a misdirection on such matters is a miscarriage of justice.

That is not to say that a misdirection as to one of those matters is always a miscarriage of justice. The error may be so trivial that a Court of Criminal Appeal can properly conclude that there has been a trial according to law, notwithstanding the misdirection. But if a direction on the standard or onus of proof or the function of the jury is substantially wrong, I cannot presently conceive of a case where the weight of evidence against the accused could affect the conclusion that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. An accused person is entitled to a trial according to law. Where the law requires that an issue be tried by a jury, the accused does not have a trial in any meaningful sense where the jury is prevented by judicial direction from determining the issue. It is of no relevance in my opinion that a court of criminal appeal thinks that the evidence of guilt is overwhelming. An accused is entitled to be tried by the jury. That is the tribunal that is given the responsibility for determining the guilt of an accused person.”


	
	His Honour was the only member of the Court who declined to apply the proviso. On the other hand, his Honour’s statement about the standard or onus of proof or the function of the jury being substantially wrong, although obiter, was not something denied by the joint judgment. Indeed, a deal of subsequent authority supports it.
	
	
	At the level of the High Court, it has received the qualified support of French CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen [2012] HCA 14; 246 CLR 92 at [31]:
	


“It may well be right to observe that the proviso could seldom be applied in a case where, as here, the jury were not sufficiently directed of the need to be satisfied to the requisite standard of an element of the offence being considered.”


	
	At the level of intermediate appellate courts, McHugh J’s statement was quoted, with evident approval, by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v AJS [2005] VSCA 288; 12 VR 563 at [31] and by Peek J, with whom Nicholson J agreed, in R v Kerin [2013] SASCFC 56; 116 SASR 316 at [328]. It was accepted as correct by Pullin JA in Green v State of Western Australia [No 2] [2014] WASCA 53; 240 A Crim R 73 at [77].
	
	
	Moreover, the passage was applied, in a misdirection case where the primary judge sought to explain the meaning of “beyond reasonable doubt” in Graham v R [2000] TASSC 153 by Cox CJ at [20], and by Underwood J at [69], with both of whom Evans J agreed. Most recently, it was applied by Porter J, with the agreement of Wood and Pearce JJ, in Lin v Tasmania [2015] TASCCA 13 at [142].
	
	
	We are not aware of judicial disapproval being expressed of the statement of McHugh J in Krakouer, or its citation and application in the four intermediate appellate courts referred to above. We are conscious that in McGrath v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 48; 199 A Crim R 527, this Court applied the proviso in circumstances when it was said that the views of McHugh J would “require the convictions in the present case on counts 1 and 3 to be quashed” (at [27]). However, that was a case where the misdirection was as to the elements of those counts, rather than on standard or onus of proof generally. We are not persuaded that there is a compelling reason to depart from those authorities:  R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363 at [30]. To the contrary, we think they are right in principle.
	
	
	In this case, the natural effect of the written direction was to deny to the appellant the right for the jury to assess whether the Crown has established the four essential issues beyond reasonable doubt. Instead, we have concluded that the jury is to be taken to have asked itself a series of questions as to whether there was a reasonable possibility, which we consider to fall within the category of case described by McHugh J in Krakouer as being incapable of engaging the proviso.
	


Denial of a chance of acquittal fairly open


	
	Even if that be not the case, we are nonetheless satisfied that, in the language of the majority in Filippou, “the possibility cannot be excluded beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant has been denied a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to him”.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the deceased was set upon by the appellant and other members of the Hadchiti family immediately upon his arrival at the residence. Particular reliance was placed upon the fact that Marian and TB gave evidence that the deceased shouted several times “Let me go you scumbags” (emphasising the plural “scumbags”), and the expert evidence of the nature of the deceased’s wounds. The Crown case was that there was no provocation or self-defence.
	
	
	We will deal with each aspect of the Crown’s case in turn. First, as noted at the outset of these reasons, the expert evidence was powerful, but not conclusive.
	
	
	Secondly, Marian’s evidence was highly contradictory. At first, she said that both the deceased and she were on drugs on 30 October 2011, and “I didn’t want my parents to see me high on drugs.” She said that the deceased rang her mother, Sonia, as they approached the residence, and then:
	


“Q. Do you remember what he said to your mother?

A. I don’t know, I didn’t hear no conversation, he just bolted. He went crazy. Like everything went so quick. He did a U-turn quickly, just went, he didn’t communicate with me at all, he just chucked us out of the car and didn’t communicate at all with us. Me and [TB] were just stranded on the side of the road.

Q. It wasn’t that you requested Billy to let you out, both you and [TB]?

A. Well he told us to get out.

Q. Now when Billy went to the property what did you hear?

A. I heard mum scream really loud like something terrible had happened and dogs barking and I grabbed [TB’s] phone and--

Q. Just stopping there Marian; did you hear anything from Billy?

A. Not that I recall.”


	
	At that stage, in the absence of the jury, the Crown applied under s 38 of the Evidence Act that she be regarded as an unfavourable witness, having regard to her prior statement to police and the evidence she had given at the committal, to the effect that she had heard the deceased say three or four times “Let me go you scumbags”, her evidence to the neighbour that “I need to ring the police. They are going to kill him” and her evidence to a police constable when she returned to the property: “Oh no, oh my God, they’ve executed him”. Counsel for the appellant conceded the application should succeed.
	
	
	Marian’s evidence in chief continued on the following day. She said that she heard the deceased scream out, “Get your hands off me you scumbags”. She was taken to the statement she gave on the evening in question at Windsor Police Station, and portions of a recording of that interview were played to the jury, parts of which she confirmed and parts of which she maintained that she did not recall. Marian said that she had been stressed when giving evidence in court the previous day when she said that she could not remember the deceased screaming out the words “Let me go you scumbags”.
	
	
	Marian maintained that she was “high off my head” on drugs when she was interviewed by police. In relation to what she said when she arrived at her family’s home after the deceased’s death, she gave this evidence:
	


“Q. You I suggest became hysterical and screamed: ‘Oh no, oh my God they executed him’?

A. No I did not say that.

Q. Do you say you didn’t say that?

A. I didn’t say that. I don’t recall saying that. I was in shock.

Q. Oh no, oh my God they executed him?

A. I was in shock when they told me.

Q. You were down at the [neighbours’] place and I suggest you said to them that they are going to kill him or kill Billy, correct?

A. No I did not say that. What are you trying to say I am a liar?”


	
	She said she could not remember running to the neighbours and calling the police. She denied telling the neighbours, “I need to ring the police. They are going to kill him”.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Marian initially maintained that she heard the deceased saying “Let me go you scumbags”, saying that “I heard it because it is in my head, my mum and him doesn’t go away in my head.” Eventually she conceded she had a doubt about it, however in re-examination she said that she did hear the deceased scream out “Let me go you scumbags”.
	
	
	Thirdly, to the extent that the Crown case turned on the deceased saying “Let me go you scumbags”, the evidence of TB was vital. As noted above, TB gave evidence by a DVD played to the jury. The DVD was not in the appeal papers, but a transcript of the evidence stated by her to be accurate was MFI 9 and we have relied on that for what follows. TB said that when the deceased entered into the property, “we heard him say, ‘Let me go’” and she said “when I heard him say, ‘Let me go’, I could see a few people standing around”. She then said she heard him say “Let me go you scumbags”.
	
	
	In his closing address to the jury, counsel for the accused said that:
	


“Now [TB] is important to the prosecution case obviously because of what she says she can see and what she claims she can hear. The essence of what I want to say about [TB] is you would not accept anything of relevance that she has to say about this matter.”

Counsel for the accused then drew attention to several inconsistencies between TB’s evidence and the evidence of other witnesses, including the undisputed evidence of police officers who attended the scene, particularly in relation to TB’s recollection of what she saw occur inside the Hadchiti premises from her vantage point outside the fence of the yard and what she heard.


	
	Doing the best we can, and without having seen the DVD of TB’s evidence, we consider there is force in these submissions. We cannot conclude that her recollection of what she saw and heard would necessarily have been persuasive beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Fourthly, the deceased’s antecedents, which have been summarised above, go some way to corroborating the appellant’s defences of self-defence and provocation. The defence addressed on this, concisely but effectively:
	


“So there you have four examples of Billy Mack and a knife, seen by the police throwing one behind a tree, threatening [a woman] and saying he was going to cut her throat; the incident at Blacktown Methadone Clinic and the incident in the High Street, Penrith. Would Billy Mack have been carrying a knife? Is he capable of swinging the knife at Michael Hadchiti? Well the submission in a nutshell, members of the jury, is that is exactly the sort of thing that Billy Mack did and you would have little doubt in finding as a fact that, firstly, he came in possession of a knife; secondly, he assaulted Sonia Hadchiti; and thirdly he swung the knife at Michael Hadchiti in the manner described.”


	
	Fifthly, the evidence of the appellant contradicted the Crown’s case. The appellant was interviewed by police on the evening following the events in question, and a DVD of the interview was played to the jury. In a further electronically recorded statement to the police on 3 November 2011, he said that the deceased “attacked my mum, mate, and when I said let go of her, he pulled a knife on me mate”. He said that he was eating an apple at the time and was using a knife to cut it.
	
	
	When giving evidence at trial, the appellant admitted that he had inflicted the wound to the deceased’s neck, but denied intending to cut the deceased’s throat, or intending to kill him or to cause him serious bodily injury. His case was that the deceased arrived armed with a knife and affected by drugs and assaulted Sonia, knocking her to the ground and kicking her, and then attacked the appellant with the knife when the appellant went to his mother’s assistance. He said that he had never seen or met the deceased before. He said he was stabbed in the left wrist by the deceased when he had put his hands up to protect his face from an attack by the deceased. He said that the two men struggled for the control of the Columbia knife, and that “I was pushing down and my hand was holding the knife too and it has gone straight down to Billy’s neck.”
	
	
	He was cross-examined about the inconsistencies of his account with the injuries suffered by the deceased, including two lacerations on the back of the deceased’s head, one of which fractured his skull, the other of which caused an open wound in the back of the skull, and the square injury to the deceased’s back of dimensions which corresponded with the chair. He maintained that this happened when the deceased fell against the chair. The appellant denied that there was anyone else in the front yard of his house assisting him. He denied cutting the deceased’s throat from behind, contrary to the evidence that that was probably the way in which the deceased’s throat had been cut.
	
	
	In light of these, and other, inconsistencies in the evidence, even making “due allowance” for the “natural limitations” of the case on the record, we are unable to determine whether the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of murder, especially in light of the defence of provocation. In light of the foregoing, even putting Krakouer to one side, we are not satisfied that this is a case in which the proviso should be applied.
	


Orders


	
	For those reasons, there should be a grant of leave, confined to ground 1. The appeal should be allowed, the appellant’s conviction set aside, and a new trial ordered. This is plainly a case where the power to order a new trial is available and should be exercised: see ST v R [2010] NSWCCA 5.
	
	
	It is not necessary to address the application for leave to appeal against sentence, save for one matter, which we mention against the possibility that her Honour’s remarks on sentence need to be considered in the future, and because they are publicly available. Her Honour said at [107] of the remarks on sentence:
	


“Objectively, this was a most serious offence. In sentencing the offender it cannot be overlooked that he still actively persists in sheltering those involved with him from the consequences of their part in this terrible crime. It follows that his moral culpability for his awful offence is also high.”


	
	On a natural reading of that passage in its context, her Honour was using the fact that the appellant presented a case and maintained a case that he acted alone, which was rejected by the jury, to increase the finding of moral culpability. The Crown in our view properly conceded that, when so read, this was erroneous. As was said in Siganto v The Queen [1998] HCA 74; 194 CLR 656 at [22]:
	


“A person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to plead not guilty, and defend himself or herself, without thereby attracting the risk of the imposition of a penalty more serious than would otherwise have been imposed.”


	
	The formal orders will therefore be as follows:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal against conviction, confined to ground 1 of the notice of application for leave to appeal filed 28 May 2015.
	
	
	Appeal against conviction allowed.
	
	
	Quash the appellant’s conviction for murder on the charge contained in the indictment against him dated 28 October 2013.
	
	
	Order that the matter be remitted to the Supreme Court for retrial.
