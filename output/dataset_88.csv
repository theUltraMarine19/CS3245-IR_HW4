The two appellants were tried and convicted in the High Court on the following charge: 
 
You, Ramachandran a/l Suppiah and Krishnan a/l Varadan, are charged that on or about 27 July 1984 at about 9am and 11am at Block 131, Tah Ching Road, #09-703, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, committed murder by causing the death of one Packiria Pillai Krishnasamy, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code.
 
 
 
They appealed against their conviction. We allowed the appeal of the first appellant and dismissed the appeal of the second appellant. We now give our reasons.
The deceased, an elderly man aged 74 years, lived with his wife Mutthu and daughter Purhanam at their flat at Block 131, Tah Ching Road, #09-703. The deceased was unemployed, Mutthu managed a provision stall at Taman Jurong and Purhanam worked at an electronic factory.
In 1981, the second appellant (who was then about 15 years of age) had for a period of about ten months worked for Mutthu at her provision stall as a stall assistant. Whilst working for her he had also stayed at her flat. Some time in June 1984, the second appellant paid a casual visit to Mutthu`s stall. Mutthu told him she needed a stall assistant and asked him to recommend someone for the job. The second appellant did not have anyone immediately in mind but promised to find a person.
In early July 1984, at about 6pm, the second appellant called at Mutthu`s flat with the first appellant and told Mutthu that the first appellant`s brother was interested in the job. The two appellants then left promising that they would bring the first appellant`s brother to see Mutthu at her stall.
On 26 July 1984, the second appellant telephoned the flat. Mutthu, Purhanam and the deceased all spoke with the second appellant. The gist of the conversation as told to the court by Mutthu and Purhanam was that the first appellant`s brother would be able to come for an interview the next morning with the first appellant but that the second appellant himself would be unable to accompany them as his passport was expiring that day and he had to leave Singapore. As the first appellant did not know how to get to Mutthu`s stall, the second appellant enquired if the first appellant could, instead, take his brother to the flat at 11am the next morning so that the deceased could interview the brother. This was agreed upon.
On 27 July 1984, at about 4.30am and 6.25am respectively, Mutthu and Purhanam left the flat as usual to attend to their respective work. At about 7.50pm that evening when Purhanam returned home from work she saw that the flat had been ransacked and her father was lying naked in a pool of blood at the doorway to her room. She ran out of the flat, met her mother Mutthu who was also returning from her work, and told her what she had seen. Both of them went back into the flat. They called out to the deceased, but there was no response from him. Later, on checking the flat, Purhanam found that a pair of gold earrings (value $140); two lady`s wrist-watches (value $150); 30 imitation precious stones (value $50); a gold ring (value $100); and cash of $1,990 were missing from her cupboard.
Police officers who went to the scene recovered a blood-stained letter-opener from the floor in the hall. The letter-opener was hidden from view by the articles from two drawers which were strewn on the floor. The bloodstains on the letter-opener matched the deceased`s blood. On the patches of blood in the hall near where the deceased was lying the police found shoe imprints. The pattern of these imprints showed that they were from two different shoes. Photographs of the two different imprints were taken.
The next day Dr Wee Keng Poh, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on the deceased. Dr Wee testified that the deceased died from haemorrhage due to a stab wound on the neck. This fatal wound was on the front of the neck. Its direction was from front to back, slightly downwards and laterally. It had penetrated to a depth of 8cm and had cut the internal jugular vein. Besides the stab wound on the neck, Dr Wee found a linear superficial scratch on the neck, two stab wounds on the chest (which did not penetrate the chest) and one stab wound at the abdomen which had penetrated into the abdomen to a depth of 5cm.
Dr Wee testified that all these wounds could have been caused by the letter-opener found at the scene; that the fatal injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; that death would have occurred in a matter of minutes after the fatal injury was inflicted and that moderate force would be required to cause that fatal injury.
Dr Wee was of the opinion that all the injuries were inflicted in a frontal assault and, in view of the degree of air embolism in the brain, he opined that the fatal injury was inflicted when the deceased was in a standing position. Dr Wee was also of the opinion that the absence of defensive injuries on the deceased indicated that the first wound inflicted on the deceased was the stab wound on the neck.
On 20 August 1984, at about 3.35pm, the first appellant was arrested by the Malaysian police at Tapah, Perak. He was sent to Singapore on 27 August 1984 and on arrival was arrested by the Singapore police. Shortly after his arrest he was charged under s 302 of the Penal Code for the murder of the deceased and a s 122(6) statement was recorded from him. In the statement he stated: 
 
It is true that on the day in question I was brought to Taman Jurong. I asked the male Indian why he was bringing me there. He said that we could go to his house to steal. The `his` refers to `Party`s` house. I told him that I did not have any experience in this. He told me that I should stand near the lift whilst he would go up. After a while, he came running with blood stains on him. He told me that he had stabbed that man. He invited me to go to the house to look for the knife. I went into the house and searched for it, but I could not find it. He too went with me to the house. Krishnan was holding a plastic bag. He said that since we could not find the knife, we had better flee from the place. We left the said place. I went to my room at Jalan Boon Lay Lama. Krishnan went to his room there. Krishnan told me to flee to Johor Bahru. He said that he would meet me there later. Until today I have not seen him. I did not commit the murder. The man appeared to be dead when I saw him.
 
 
 
On 19 September 1984, Suppiah Alagiri, the father of the first appellant, at the request of the first appellant, brought to the Criminal Investigation Department (`CID`) a pair of shoes belonging to the first appellant. These shoes were seized. The pattern on the sole of the shoes was similar to the pattern of the imprint in one of the two photographs taken at the scene.
On 1 October 1984, Suppiah Alagiri, again at the request of the first appellant, brought to the CID four pieces of imitation precious stones. These were seized. They were later identified by Purhanam as being part of the 30 imitation precious stones missing from her cupboard.
The second appellant was arrested by the Malaysian police on 30 December 1985 at Batu Gajah, Perak. He was sent to Singapore on 4 January 1986 and at about 4pm that day he was arrested by the Singapore police. The second appellant also made a s 122(6) statement. He objected to the admissibility of the statement on the grounds that he had been assaulted and threatened with being further assaulted if he did not make the statement in the way the inspector wanted. He had also been told that if he co-operated he could escape the gallows as he was under 21 at the time of the offence. The learned trial judges after a trial-within-a-trial were satisfied that the statement was voluntary and admitted it in evidence. This statement was as follows: 
 
I admit that Ramachandran and I committed the murder. I am the one who knocked the door. Both of us went in, Ramachandran kicked the deceased and held both his hands. I then stabbed the deceased. After stabbing the deceased, both Ramachandran and I went into the rooms and looked for money and jewellery. We found some money and jewellery which we took away with us. I got a gold ring, a pair of gold earrings, and a lady`s watch from Ramachandran. I do not know what things Ramachandran took.
 
 
 
On the above evidence, the learned trial judges were satisfied that a prima facie case had been made out against both the appellants and called upon them to make their defence. This finding of a prima facie case was challenged in this appeal, particularly by counsel for the first appellant.
The evidence adduced by the prosecution as against the first appellant was: 
 
 
(1) His s 122(6) statement. 
 
(2) The presence of a shoe imprint in the hall with a tread similar to that of a pair of shoes belonging to the first appellant. 
 
(3) Four imitation precious stones recovered from the first appellant which were identified as being part of 30 such stones missing from the flat after the incident. 
 
(4) The confession (s 122(6) statement) of the second appellant.
  
 
 
The first appellant in his s 122(6) statement (the admissibility of which he did not challenge) had stated that he had gone into the flat with the second appellant after the incident in order to try to assist the second appellant to recover the knife the second appellant had used. That being so, the presence of a shoe imprint in the hall with a tread consistent with the tread on the first appellant`s shoes does not, by itself, take the case against the first appellant any further than what is contained in the s 122(6) statement. Similarly, the recovery of the four imitation precious stones from the first appellant does not take the case for the prosecution beyond what can reasonably be inferred from that statement.
Before an accused person can be called upon to make his defence the court has to be satisfied that the requirements of s 189 of the Criminal Procedure Code have been satisfied. Section 189 provides as follows: 
 
When the case for the prosecution is concluded the court, if it finds that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction, shall record an order of acquittal or, if it does not so find, shall call on the accused to enter on his defence.
 
 
 
The Privy Council, in the oft-quoted case of 
 Haw Tua Tau v 
 
PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  has considered what the burden on the prosecution is at the end of the prosecution case and the test as enunciated therein by Lord Diplock is: whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if the court were to accept as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence.
There is nothing in the s 122(6) statement of the first appellant which shows or from which it can be inferred that the first appellant had, either by himself or in concert with the second appellant, intended to kill or even cause hurt to the deceased. All that that statement shows is that the first appellant had accompanied the second appellant that day in order to steal from the flat but on reaching the foot of the block of flats in which the deceased lived had refused to proceed further with the plan and the second appellant had taken the lift up and proceeded alone to the deceased`s flat. There is nothing in that statement to indicate that the first appellant knew that the second appellant was armed with any weapon. There was also no evidence to indicate that the first appellant knew that there would be anyone in the flat at that time. The only evidence in this regard was that the second appellant had made an appointment for the first appellant to take his brother to the flat at 11am for the deceased to interview the first appellant`s brother. There was no evidence that the first appellant knew about these arrangements. The conversation between Mutthu, Purhanam and the second appellant in which the appointment to see the deceased that morning was arranged was clearly hearsay and (in the absence of evidence of common intention) inadmissible as against the first appellant.
The learned trial judges found the first appellant`s s 122(6) statement `entirely exculpatory of Ramachandran`. This finding was not challenged before us. The s 122(6) statement being exculpatory, the only evidence left against the first appellant was the confession of the second appellant contained in the second appellant`s s 122(6) statement in which the second appellant had incriminated both himself and the first appellant. It would appear that the learned trial judges in calling upon the first appellant to make his defence had relied entirely on this s 122(6) statement by the second appellant. The s 122(6) statement made by the second appellant is admissible as evidence against the second appellant under s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code but can be used as evidence against the first appellant only if the requirements of s 30 of the Evidence Act are satisfied.
To understand s 30 it will be useful to look at some other sections in the Act dealing with admissions and confessions. By s 21 of the Evidence Act, admissions are declared to be relevant and may be proved as against the person who makes them. An `admission` is defined in s 17(1) of the Evidence Act as a statement, oral or documentary, which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact. Section 17(2) defines a `confession` as an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence. By s 24 of the Evidence Act, a confession is declared to be irrelevant if the making of the confession appears to have been caused by any inducement, threat, or promise, ie if the confession is not voluntary. By s 5 of the Evidence Act: `evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are hereinafter declared to be relevant`. The Evidence Act has declared admissions (which are against the interest of the party making them) and confessions made by an accused (so long as they are voluntary) to be relevant and accordingly evidence of such admissions or confessions may be given under ss 5 and 21 of the Act against the person who made the admission or confession.
To use a confession by an accused against a co-accused, s 30 of the Evidence Act would have to be complied with. Section 30 reads as follows: 
 
When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession.
 
 
 
It is immediately apparent that the language used in s 30 is different from that used in ss 5, 21 and 24. Section 30 of the Act does not declare the confession of an accused where it incriminates a co-accused to be `relevant` as against the co-accused. All that s 30 provides is that `the court may take into consideration` such confession as against the co-accused.
The extent to which the court `may take into consideration` the confession of a co-accused that incriminates an accused person has been considered in numerous cases here, in Malaysia and in India. Perhaps the most well-known of these decisions is that of the Privy Council in 
Bhuboni Sahu v The King
 
[1949] PC 257
 where at p 260 Sir John Beaumont said: 
 
Section 30 seems to be based on the view that an admission by an accused person of his own guilt affords some sort of sanction in support of the truth of his confession against others as well as himself. But a confession of a co-accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type. It does not indeed come within the definition of `evidence` contained in s 3, Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, and it cannot be tested by cross-examination. It is a much weaker type of evidence than the evidence of an approver which is not subject to any of those infirmities. Section 30, however, provides that the court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it evidence on which the court may act; but the section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. 
 Clearly there must be other evidence
. The confession is only one element in the consideration of all the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed with the other evidence. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
In 
Hari Charan Kurmi v State of Bihar,
 
[1964] 6 SCR 623
 the principles enunciated in 
Bhuboni Sahu v The King
 
[1949] PC 257
 were re-stated by the Supreme Court of India. To quote from the judgment of Gajendragadkar CJ at p 630: 
 
When s 30 provides that the confession of a co-accused may be taken into consideration, what exactly is the scope and effect of such taking into consideration, is precisely the problem which has been raised in the present appeals. It is clear that the confession mentioned in s 30 is not evidence under s 3 of the Act. Section 3 defines `evidence` as meaning and including - 
(1) all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under inquiry; such statements are called oral evidence; 
(2) all documents produced for the inspection of the Court; such documents are called documentary evidence.
 
 
 
Technically construed, this definition will not apply to a confession. Part (1) of the definition refers to oral statements which the court permits or requires to be made before it; and clearly, a confession made by an accused person is not such a statement; it is not made or permitted to be made before the court that tries the criminal case. Part (2) of the definition refers to documents produced for the inspection of the court; and a confession cannot be said to fall even under this part. Even so, s 30 provides that a confession may be taken into consideration not only against its maker but also against a co-accused person; that is to say, though such a confession may not be evidence as strictly defined by s 3 of the Act, it is an element which may be taken into consideration by the criminal court and in that sense, it may be described as evidence in a non-technical way. But it is significant that like other evidence which is produced before the court, it is not obligatory on the court to take the confession into account. When evidence as defined by the Act is produced before the court, it is the duty of the court to consider that evidence. What weight should be attached to such evidence, is a matter in the discretion of the court. But a court cannot say in respect of such evidence that it will just not take that evidence into account. Such an approach can, however, be adopted by the court in dealing with a confession, because s 30 merely enables the court to take the confession into account.
 
 
 
As we have already indicated, this question has been considered on several occasions by judicial decisions and it has been consistently held that a confession cannot be treated as evidence which is substantive evidence against a co-accused person. In dealing with a criminal case where the prosecution relies upon the confession of one accused person against another accused person, the proper approach to adopt is to consider the other evidence against such an accused person, and if the said evidence appears to be satisfactory and the court is inclined to hold that the said evidence may sustain the charge framed against the said accused person, the court turns to the confession with a view to assure itself that the conclusion which it is inclined to draw from the other evidence is right. As was observed by Sir Lawrence Jenkins in 
 Emperor v Lalit Mohan Chuckerbutty 
 a confession can only be used to `lend assurance to other evidence against a co-accused`. In 
 In re Peryaswami Moopan 
, Reilly J observed that the provision of s 30 goes not further than this: `where there is evidence against the co-accused sufficient, if believed, to support his conviction, then the kind of confession described in s 30 may be thrown into the scale as an additional reason for believing that evidence.` (Emphasis added.)
In 
Bhuboni Sahu v The King
 
[1949] PC 257
 and in 
Hari Charan Kurmi v State of Bihar
 
[1964] 6 SCR 623
 there is reference to the fact that the confession of a co-accused does not come within the definition of `evidence` in s 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. It is to be noted that the definition of `evidence` (in the Indian Act) is an exhaustive one in that `evidence` is defined as `meaning and including` the matters enumerated in the two subsections following. That definition is different from the definition in our Evidence Act in that in our Act `evidence` is defined to `include` the two subsections. In our view, the fact that `evidence` in the Indian Act is given an exhaustive definition does not affect the conclusions reached by the Privy Council and the Supreme Court of India in their interpretation of s 30. In both 
Bhuboni Sahu
 
[1949] PC 257
 and 
Hari Charan Kurmi
 
[1964] 6 SCR 623
 the court, whilst recognizing that the definition of `evidence` would exclude the confession made by a co-accused, nevertheless noted that s 30 of the Act made such confessions evidence on which the court may act. What our Evidence Act does is to recognize that an exhaustive definition of `evidence` will not sit well with sections of the Act, such as s 30, which permit the court to consider matters which fall outside the definition. In our Act therefore the word `evidence` is given an inclusive definition. We are of the view that the differences in the way `evidence` is defined in our Act and the Indian Act do not make any difference to the principles enunciated in the above cases.
In 
Yusoff & Anor v PP
 
 [1956] 22 MLJ 47 
 the Malayan Court of Appeal considered the meaning to be given to the words `may take into consideration` in s 30 of the Evidence Ordinance. Mathew CJ in delivering the judgment of the court said at p 48: 
 
The effect of the words `may take into consideration` is well set out in Woodroffe and Ameer Ali`s 
 Law of Evidence
 (9th Ed) at pp 312 and 313, as follows:
 
 
 
`These words do not mean that the confession is to have the force of sworn evidence, but such a confession is nevertheless evidence in the sense that it is matter which the court, before whom it is made, may take into consideration in order to determine whether the issue of guilt is proved or not. The wording, however, of this section (which is an exception) shows that such a confession is merely to be an element in the consideration of all the facts of the case; while allowing it to be so considered, it does not do away with the necessity of other evidence.`
 
 
 
And, in dealing with the facts of that case, Mathew CJ continued: 
 
The other evidence is of little, if of any, value and merely shows that the two appellants were seen together about midnight on 19/20 September 1955. In fact, the convictions rest entirely on the confession of the second appellant which we have already pointed out is wrong.
 
 
 
And in 
PP v Nordin bin Johan & Anor,
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 221
  Raja Azlan Shah LP in giving the decision of the Federal Court (of Malaysia) said at p 222: 
 
This leaves the question of the application of the provisions of s 30 of the Evidence Act 1950 in relation to the two respondents as a result of the statement made by Rahmat Satiman, the third accused in these proceedings, which was admitted and accepted and which clearly implicates the two respondents. 
 Section 30 provides that this statement may be taken into consideration against the two respondents but on the decided authorities the prerequisite to this is that there must be some cogent evidence against them quite apart from the statement of the third accused.
The nature of this evidence which would be extraneous to the confession of a co-accused and its qualitative and probative value in relation to the charge must 
 ex necessitate rei
 be a factual matter in the context and circumstances of the particular case.
 
 
 
Having considered the evidence against the two respondents which is fairly voluminous and lengthy, the learned judge came to the conclusion that it did not in relation to them have any real probative value to the charge and even taken as a whole did not take the prosecution case anywhere for the purposes of proving common intention under s 34 of the Penal Code. The learned trial judge had opportunities which are denied to us of considering whether it would be safe to draw the inference that the two respondents were present at the scene of the crime and participated in the commission of the offence. He said: 
 
`Does the totality of the evidence against the second accused and the fourth accused excluding the confession (P101) lead the court to the irresistible inference that they were present at the scene of the crime and participated in the commission of the offence? I am afraid I am unable to honestly give an affirmative answer to this question.` ... We are satisfied that the evidence against the two respondents, apart from the third accused`s confession, was not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the charge against them and that calling on their defence would on the authorities not only go beyond taking into consideration the third accused`s statement but be tantamount to virtually relying on it to an extent that would not be permissible for the purposes of s 30 of the Evidence Act. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
The Court of Appeal in Singapore in 
Koh Ah Chua & Ors v PP
 
 [1948] 14 MLJ 11 
 dealt with the application of s 30 of the Evidence Act. In setting aside the conviction of the fourth appellant in that case, Murray-Anysley CJ said (at p 12): 
 
In the case of the fourth appellant a serious question arose. The principal evidence against him consisted of a confession made by a co-accused to a magistrate and duly proved at the trial. Apart from this the most that could be said was that some of the evidence tended to corroborate parts of the confession.
 
 
 
Section 30 of the Evidence Enactment, which alone makes it possible to consider such a confession, merely says that the court may take into consideration such confession. 
 No legislation can add to the value of such a confession as evidence. 
 We consider that its value is less than that of the evidence of an accomplice because it was made in the absence of the appellant, was not made on oath nor subject to cross-examination, and usually in such cases the person making the confession attributes the chief blame to others.
In the circumstances we do not consider that the evidence against the fourth appellant was sufficient, and his appeal is allowed and conviction quashed. (Emphasis added.)
And recently this court in 
Sim Ah Cheoh v PP
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  again accepted the narrow construction to the words `may take into consideration` favoured by the courts. In delivering the decision of the court, LP Thean J referred to the cases of 
Bhuboni Sahu v The King
 
[1949] PC 257
 
Kashmira Singh v State of Madhya Pradesh,
 
[1952] SC 526
 
Yusoff & Anor v PP
 
 [1956] 22 MLJ 47 
 and 
PP v Nordin bin Johan & Anor
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 221
  as undoubted authorities on the construction and application of s 30 of the Evidence Act and agreed with the views expressed in these decisions.
On the basis of the decided authorities, it is abundantly clear that the confession of a co-accused can only play a supportive role in a criminal prosecution. It cannot by itself form the basis of a conviction. In this case, apart from the confession of the second appellant, there was no evidence before the court to establish that the first appellant on 27 July 1984, `in furtherance of the common intention between him and the second appellant committed murder by causing the death of the deceased`. That being so, by reason of s 189 of the Criminal Procedure Code, his defence should not have been called and the court should have recorded an order of acquittal.
As for the second appellant, the evidence against him at the close of the prosecution case consisted essentially of the confession made by him in his s 122(6) statement. Although that was a retracted confession, the learned trial judges were satisfied that it was voluntarily given. We can see no reason to interfere with this finding of fact by the learned trial judges. The courts have always treated confessions (especially retracted confessions) with caution but there can be no doubt that such a confession is evidence against the maker of the confession and can by itself constitute a prima facie case. Indeed, counsel for the second appellant has not sought to submit otherwise. What he did submit was that as there was, as against the first appellant, no evidence of common intention, the second appellant`s defence should not have been called on the charge as framed.
On the basis of the confession of the second appellant there was, at the close of the case for the prosecution, evidence before the court (which was not inherently incredible) that the second appellant had stabbed the deceased. There was also evidence that the deceased had been stabbed a number of times, that the fatal stab wound was in the region of the neck, that that wound was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, that moderate force would be required to inflict that wound and that that wound was probably inflicted in a frontal assault on the deceased whilst the deceased was standing up. At the close of the prosecution case there was clearly a prima facie case made out against the second appellant under s 302 of the Penal Code.
The question that has to be considered is whether the fact that the defence of the second appellant was called on a charge that included an averment of a common intention between him and the first appellant (as to which there was no evidence) had so vitiated the proceedings that the conviction against the second appellant ought to be set aside.
An appeal court will set aside a conviction on the grounds that there was an error in the charge only if such error has occasioned a failure of justice (see s 396 of the Criminal Procedure Code). We perused the record in detail but could find nothing therein which indicated that calling on the defence of the second appellant on a charge which included the reference to common intention with the first appellant in any way prejudiced the second appellant. Counsel submitted that the fact that the first appellant was (wrongly) called on to make his defence was by itself prejudicial to the second appellant. We could not accept that submission. The record shows that, if at all, the evidence given by the first appellant in his defence was supportive and not prejudicial to the defence of the second appellant.
The learned trial judges` summary of the evidence given by the second appellant was as follows: 
 
After he had stabbed the deceased on the stomach, the deceased put up a struggle. Krishnan attempted to pull the letter-opener away from the deceased whereas the deceased was pulling his hand with the letter-opener towards himself. Krishnan claimed that thereafter he suffered a complete loss of memory and he did not know how the deceased was fatally stabbed in the throat ... According to Krishnan, the next thing he knew was that he ran away from the deceased intending to take refuge in the room when the deceased chased after him and collapsed in a pool of blood. He suggested that the fatal stabbing was entirely accidental; he did not know how it happened and he kept reiterating that he had no intention to kill the deceased. Krishnan explained that he had brought along the letter-opener, tucked in his trousers, so that it could be used to break open the locks and cupboard doors.
 
 
 
The learned trial judges completely rejected this evidence. In rejecting it, they said: 
 
Krishnan`s version given before us was even more incredible. He did not give any reason as to why he was unable to recall how the fatal wound was inflicted. Against this claim of a total lack of knowledge as to what transpired, we have the fact that the letter-opener he was holding had caused the fatal gash at the throat of the deceased. We are of the view that a struggle between them had not taken place. The deceased did not have any defensive wound which a struggle like that described by Krishnan would most probably have left behind. Moreover, the condition of the flat immediately after the discovery of the deceased`s body did not suggest any sign of a struggle.
 
 
 
The learned trial judges found the defence of the second appellant to be `incredible`. They considered the evidence against, and the defence of, each appellant separately. Having done so they concluded that the second appellant when he stabbed the deceased intended to kill him. That was a finding of fact which the learned trial judges, on the evidence before them, were entitled to arrive at. We saw no reason to interfere with that finding. Accordingly, in respect of the first appellant, we allowed the appeal and ordered that he be acquitted and discharged. In respect of the second appellant, we dismissed the appeal and, in view of the first appellant`s acquittal, directed that the references in the charge to the first appellant and to s 34 be deleted.
