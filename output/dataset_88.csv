     REGINA v Paul James KREMMER 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   STUDDERT J: I have had the advantage of considering the judgment of Dowd J in draft form. I agree with what his Honour has written as to the second and third counts of appeal addressed in that judgment and I propose to consider only the ground of appeal identified by his Honour as the first ground of appeal. I do so because, regrettably, I have reached a contrary conclusion in relation to it. 
     
      
       
      
    2   Dowd J has fully stated the competing submissions of counsel on the hearing of the appeal and I shall not repeat what his Honour has written in identifying those submissions. 
     
      
       
      
    3   Section 84 of the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996 provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         (1) 
          Despite any rule of law to the contrary:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) an application for statutory compensation, and  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) any documents supporting the application (whether or not furnished when the application is lodged), and  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) any transcript of evidence given to the Tribunal in a hearing of the application,  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         are not admissible in evidence against any person in criminal proceedings (other than criminal proceedings in which the applicant is the accused) arising from substantially the same facts as those on which the application is based.  
         
        
        
         
         (2) 
          A person cannot be required (whether by subpoena or any other procedure) to produce any application, document or transcript of evidence that is not admissible in evidence in criminal proceedings under subsection (1) in, or in connection with, any criminal proceeding.” 
         
        
       
      
    4   The appellant, having been charged with an offence under s 66C of the Crimes Act, issued a subpoena addressed to the Registrar of the Victims’ Compensation Tribunal requiring the production of the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “All records held by the Victims’ Compensation Tribunal in respect of: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) [DLR], date of birth 7 May 1986; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) [NMD], date of birth unknown but aged thirty-six years as at 24 August 1999; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) [SJD], date of birth unknown but aged forty-one years as at 24 August 1999.” 
         
        
       
      
    5   The Tribunal declined to produce the subpoenaed documents because of the provisions of s 84(2) set out above, and Coolahan DCJ ruled that the Tribunal was entitled to do so. This appeal concerns the correctness of such ruling, and the matter is before this Court after the District Court judge granted a certificate under s 5(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
       
      
    6   Hence this appeal concerns the proper construction of s 84(2) of the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act. This sub-section was added to s 84 by the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual Assault Communications Privilege) Act in 1999. Prior thereto, s 84(1) stood alone, and it addressed the admissibility of documents in the following categories: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “(a) an application for statutory compensation; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) any documents supporting the application; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) any transcript of evidence given to the Tribunal on a hearing of the application.” 
         
        
       
      
    7   Section 84(1) provided that documents in categories (a), (b) and (c) were not admissible in evidence 
     
      
       
        
         
         “against any person in criminal proceedings (other than criminal proceedings in which the applicant is the accused) arising from substantially the same facts as those upon which the application is based.” 
         
        
       
      
    8   The only accused person against whom documents in any of those categories could be used was an accused person who had been the applicant for statutory compensation. Section 84(1) quite clearly prohibited the use of documents of the type identified for a criminal prosecution of any person other than such an applicant. The sub-section would not, however, have prevented access to documents for a legitimate forensic purpose: see as to this R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14, in particular at 22. 
     
      
       
      
    9   Whilst s 84(1) prohibited the evidentiary use of the documents categorised, upon its introduction s 84(2) was directed at the removal of any requirement to produce such documents in the circumstances addressed in the sub-section. A person cannot be required, by way of subpoena or otherwise, “in or in connection with any criminal proceedings” to produce any such documents if they are “not admissible in evidence in criminal proceedings under sub-s (1).” 
     
      
       
      
    10   The crux of the appellant’s submission is that s 84(1) only prohibits the admissibility of documents in the defined categories against any person and does not prohibit such admissibility for any person. For example, the sub-section, it was submitted, does not prohibit the admission of such documents into evidence for a relevant purpose such as to challenge the evidence of an alleged victim. It was submitted that s 84(2) does not permit resistance to a subpoena or other procedure for the production of a document of the type identified where the production is called for by the person charged in the criminal proceedings. 
     
      
       
      
    11   Section 84(2) could have been more clearly expressed but I do not consider it ought to be construed in the manner for which the appellant contends. It is not, of course, for this Court to amend the sub-section, but rather to determine what Parliament meant by the language it employed. Spigelman CJ recently reviewed the relevant principles of statutory construction in R v Young (1998-99) 46 NSWLR 681 at paras 5-10. The Chief Justice said at para 6: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “In order to construe the words actually used by Parliament, it is sometimes necessary to give them an effect as if they contained additional words. This is not, however, to introduce words into the Act. This involves the construction of the words actually used…” 
         
        
       
      
    12   The sub-section in my opinion is to be construed as though the words “against any person” appear immediately before the words “in criminal proceedings”. The reference to “criminal proceedings under sub-s (1)”, appearing in s 84(2), is a reference to “proceedings against any person” where those words appear in sub-s (1). 
     
      
       
      
    13   I am fortified in the construction I have placed upon the sub-section by what was said when the relevant Bill was introduced. Because of the uncertainty created by the language which Parliament has used in the sub-section, I consider the operation of s 34 of the Interpretation Act 1987 is enlivened and that it is legitimate in ascertaining the meaning of the sub-section to have regard to the Second Reading Speech of the Attorney General concerning the Bill introducing the sub-section. The introduction followed the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Young (supra). In that case objection had been taken in the District Court to the production of documents on the ground of sexual assault communications privilege in reliance upon Div 1B of Pt 3.10 of the Evidence Act, 1995. The District Court judge determined that Div 1B applied derivatively to the production of documents, but on appeal it was held that that Division did not apply to the production of documents. In the relevant Second Reading Speech, the Attorney General said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual Assault Communications Privilege) Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 by re-enacting the provisions of division 1B of part 3.10 of the Evidence Act 1995, with modifications, in order to address issues arising out of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Young (1999) NSWCCA 166 and the experiences of those working with the privilege since the Evidence Act provisions were commenced. The principal purpose of the bill is to redress the finding of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Young’s case that the sexual assault communications privilege enacted in division 1B of part 3.10 of the Evidence Act did not apply to the production of documents by subpoena…” 
         
        
       
      
    14   The Attorney General later proceeded: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “It has become apparent that it is relatively common for defence counsel in sexual assault matters to seek access to material used in an application for victims compensation. This material may include information arising from a counselling relationship. A cognate amendment to the Victims Compensation Act seeks to categorically close this avenue of investigation. I commend the bill to the House.” 
         
        
       
      
    15   The construction which I perceive to be the correct construction of the sub-section is thus consistent with a stated object of the statute by means of which it was introduced. 
     
      
       
      
    16   In my opinion, the District Court judge was correct to conclude that the Tribunal was not required to produce documents in the categories addressed in s 84 and the matter should be remitted to the District Court for further consideration by a judge of that Court consistent with the appropriate construction of s 84(2). 
     
      
       
      
    17   It does not follow from what I have said that s 84(2) would relieve the Tribunal of the requirement to produce any documents in respect of the three persons named in the subpoena. The categories of documents identified in s 84 are confined to any application for statutory compensation and any documents supporting such applications and any transcript of evidence given to the Tribunal on hearings of any such applications. There may well be documents outside those categories which should be produced. However, this would be a matter for the primary judge to determine. 
     
      
       
      
    18   I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
       1. Appeal dismissed; 
        
        
       2. Matter to be remitted to the District Court for further consideration by a judge of that Court consistent with the appropriate construction of s 84(2). 
        
       
      
    19   SIMPSON J: I agree with the judgment of Studdert J. 
     
      
       
      
    20   DOWD J: This is an appeal by an accused person under s5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, concerning the construction of s84 of the Victims Compensation Act 1996, which since 14 July 2000 is called the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996 (‘the Act’), Coolahan DCJ the trial judge having certified that the judgment was a proper one for determination by this court on the ground that consideration should be given to the proper construction of the s84(2) of the Act. It is in my view, a proper matter for this court to determine. 
     
      
       
      
    21   Section 84 of the Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Section 84 Inadmissibility of certain evidence in subsequent criminal proceedings 
         
        
        
         
         (1) Despite any rule of law to the contrary: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) an application for statutory compensation, and 
            
           (b) any documents supporting the application (whether or not furnished when the application is lodged), and 
            
           (c) any transcript of evidence given to the Tribunal in a hearing of the application, 
           
          
         
         
         are not admissible in evidence against any person in criminal proceedings (other than criminal proceedings in which the applicant is the accused) arising from substantially the same facts as those on which the application is based. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) A person cannot be required (whether by subpoena or any other procedure) to produce any application, document or transcript of evidence that is not admissible in evidence in criminal proceedings under subsection (1) in, or in connection with, any criminal proceeding. 
         
        
       
      
    22   The appellant in these proceedings had been charged with one count of sexual intercourse with a child between the age of ten and sixteen years, contrary to s66C of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
       
      
    23   On 11 April 2000, the appellant issued a subpoena for production, requiring the Registrar of the Victims Compensation Tribunal to produce documents, being “all records held by the Victims Compensation tribunal in respect of (persons who were children at the time of the offences, whose initials I shall use to describe them, thus);  
     
      
       
        
         
         (a) DLR, date of birth 7 May 1986  
          
         (b) NMD, date of birth unknown, but aged thirty-six as at 24 August 1999; and  
          
         (c) SJD, date of birth unknown but aged forty-one years as at 24 August 1999. 
         
        
       
      
    24   The Tribunal opposed production of the subpoenaed documents on the basis that s84(2) of the Act provided a blanket prohibition against production. 
     
      
       
      
    25   On 2 June 2000, Coolahan DCJ, sitting at Newcastle, accepted the argument advanced by the Tribunal, and thus did not require production of the documents the subject of the subpoena. The Tribunal had conceded that the appellant had had a legitimate forensic purpose for requiring production.  
     
      
       
      
    26   His Honour, in declining to order production of the documents, said in relation to s84 of the Act, that he found the section “sloppy”, but that he should interpret it to give effect to the intention of the Attorney-General’s Second Reading Speech, introducing the Bill, without His Honour specifying what he perceived that intention to be, other than, that the tribunal was not required to produce the documents. 
     
      
       
      
    27   It was noted by Coolahan DCJ that, in the vast majority of cases of this sort, complaints are late and are uncorroborated, and that the accused’s only means of investigating the veracity of the complaint, is to compare what was said by the complainant on other occasions to other people. 
     
      
       
      
    28   The procedure followed before His Honour was somewhat unusual, in that a blanket non-production order was made without the benefit of an affidavit being filed setting out material which may or may not be claimed to be within the terms of s84(2) of the Act. 
     
      
       
      
    29   His Honour made a number of comments of an uncomplimentary nature about the whole Victim’s Compensation Scheme. 
     
      
       
      
    30   Grounds of Appeal 
     
      
       
       In the first ground of appeal, the appellant contends that s84(2) of the Act is designed to protect the accused and not the victim of an act of violence, and thus the section does not prevent an accused from issuing a subpoena to the tribunal or any other person, requiring production of documents caught by s84(1) of the Act, in order that access be permitted for valid forensic purposes. 
        
       
      
    31   The appellant’s alternative submission is that Schedules 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual Assault Communication Privilege) Act 1999, insofar as both schedules purport to cover protected confidences, as defined by s148 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, are mutually inconsistent. Section 150 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, would, consequent upon the amending Act, permit production and the adducing of evidence with leave in relation to a protected confidence, s84(2) of the Victims Compensation Act 1996, as introduced by the amending Act, would prohibit the production of such material, and therefore, s84(2) must be read subject to the rights created by s150 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     
      
       
      
    32   The third ground of appeal is that the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999, to the Criminal Procedure Act, impliedly repealed s84(2) of the Victims Compensation Act, to the extent that it applies to protected confidences. 
     
      
       
      
    33   First Ground of Appeal 
     
      
       
       It is submitted by the appellant that s84 does not prohibit evidence of the class referred to, that is; that the application, documentation supporting the application, and the transcript of evidence at the hearing, being made available to an accused person as the section only provides that the documents are not admissible against the perpetrator of an offence although they may be admissible against a claimant victim if, for instance, false evidence is being put forward in a claim by the victim who is thus being charged, or there is a conspiracy to produce and receive a false claim. 
        
       
      
    34   It is therefore argued that s84(1) does not prevent the admission into evidence of the material described if it is not to be admitted against an accused, and thus s84(1) does not prohibit the admission of the specified material, as such. It is further argued that s84(1) of the Act does not prevent the use of any material provided to the Tribunal being used for legitimate forensic purposes. 
     
      
       
      
    35   It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the effect of the decision of Coolahan DCJ is that as a consequence alone of being submitted to the Tribunal, that the application, supporting material and transcripts are stamped with immunity from production, even if the material might assist the accused to defend himself or herself. 
     
      
       
      
    36   The appellant contends that His Honour’s construction of the section denies an accused access not only to material which is a “protected confidence” within the meaning of s148 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, in relation to sexual assault offences, but to any material provided to the Victims Compensation Tribunal, in relation to an application for compensation, whether the violence involves sexual assault or otherwise.  
     
      
       
      
    37   It is also argued for the appellant that s84(2) is not limited as suggested by the Preamble to the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual Assault Communications Privilege) Act, to preserve the confidentiality of counselling communications in sexual assault offences. A preamble to an Act which also amends a series of cognate Acts, does not assist very much in the interpretation of the specific amendments in the cognate Acts. Section 84(2) of the Act covers applications, documents and transcripts in respect of all offences giving rise to a claim for compensation. The long title to the amending Act clearly does not specifically relate to the cognate amendment to the Act.  
     
      
       
      
    38   It is further submitted that the prohibition in s84(2) of the Act is not absolute. The legislature chose not to do so, thus, it is argued for the appellant that documents may be admissible in evidence at a trial of the accused, provided that the documents are not sought to be admitted “against” the accused. They may provide a basis for cross-examination or other proper forensic purpose. 
     
      
       
      
    39   It is further submitted by the appellant that His Honour’s judgment gives no meaning to the words “….is not admissible in evidence in criminal proceedings under ss(1)…”, and it is submitted that all words must prima facie be given some meaning and effect: Commonwealth v Baume (1905) 2 CLR 405, at 414. It is thus submitted that it was not open to His Honour to rely on the Attorney-General’s words, as the words in the Act have a clear meaning. The appellant asserts that this is particularly so when the wording of the legislation is consistent with procedural fairness to the accused: Re Bolton; ex parte Beane (1987) 162 CLR 514, at 518. 
     
      
       
      
    40   It is argued to the contrary, on behalf of the Tribunal, that s84(2) provides a blanket prohibition against production, but only against documents falling within paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of s84(1) of the Act. It is noted that the material subject to the prohibition is not all material provided, since the words “in respect of” the Victims Compensation Act application is used, but only “documents supporting the application”. Therefore, documents which come into existence independently, can still be subpoenaed from any other source, even though a copy may be made and sent to the Tribunal. 
     
      
       
      
    41   It is further submitted on behalf of the Tribunal that the words of s84(2) of the Act could not be clearer; that is, that a person cannot be required “whether by subpoena or any other procedure” to produce. 
     
      
       
      
    42   It is submitted on behalf of the Tribunal that the Parliament had intended to block access to the material referred to in ss84(1), and that was done by enacting the same words as used in ss84(1), but has widened the words to insert “not admissible in evidence against any person in criminal proceedings”. 
     
      
       
      
    43   It is also submitted on behalf of the Tribunal that s84(2) of the Act is not about admissibility, but that it is about production and that s84(1) of the Act does not just deal with documents. It imprints documents of a particular category with a stamp of non-admissibility, where those documents would otherwise be sought to be admitted against an accused in criminal proceedings arising out of an injury. That is, s84(1) prevents material supporting the victim’s application for compensation being used against the perpetrator of the injury. 
     
      
       
      
    44   In my view, the difficulty about the framing of s84(2) of the Act is that s84(1) deals with documents not being admissible. Subsection (2) deals with documents at a time of production pursuant to a subpoena or other device which is not a time when adduction of evidence or admissibility of evidence is a relevant issue. Production of documents on subpoena is not an attempt to adduce or admit evidence, it is the making available of material in proceedings for examination by either or both parties. Admissibility is not to the point in issue at that time. 
     
      
       
      
    45   Before its amendment, by the addition of s84(2), the clear intention of s84(1) was that the section only applied to admissibility of evidence, and did not cover other procedures, such as a subpoena or a call to produce. The section also dealt with criminal proceedings only, first, against any accused person arising from substantially the same facts as those on which the application is based, secondly, proceedings of a criminal nature brought against the applicant for compensation. There was no prohibition on the production of documents pursuant to a subpoena or call to produce in any civil proceedings or in any proceedings before a Tribunal or any other body with power to issue subpoenas, or for that matter, in any criminal proceedings brought against the applicant for compensation. 
     
      
       
      
    46   There was no prohibition in s84(1) of the Act on a document being admitted as evidence in favour of an accused or being used for cross examination or providing the accused with information that may lead to other avenues of inquiry, which may disclose information which may be established in some other admissible form: see R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at p 22 per Hunt CJ in CL. 
     
      
       
      
    47   It must be noted in terms of the interpretation of the new s84, that s84(2) relies primarily on subsection (1) for its meaning. Subsection (2) is directed towards subpoenas or other procedures and the fact of production, but is limited specifically to material that is not admissible in evidence in criminal proceedings under subsection (1) ,that is, it relates to evidence sought to be admitted against an accused. It therefore does not vary in terms of subject matter from subsection (1), nor, does it prevent the use of subpoenas or other procedures to produce material which, in the case of proceedings against a person in criminal proceedings, may be sought to be admitted on behalf of that accused or defendant, and in the case of proceedings against the applicant for compensation, against that applicant. 
     
      
       
      
    48   To give meaning to the words “in, or in connection with, any criminal proceeding”, in s84(2) of the Act, would be to expand the prohibition on subpoenas and other procedures, to related inquiries such as disciplinary inquiries or civil proceedings arising out of or related to the same events, such as a claim for malicious prosecution. 
     
      
       
      
    49   In my view, whatever the expressed intention may be suggested in terms of the speech introducing the legislation, the section has a clearly defined meaning and does not need the assistance, in terms of the Interpretation Act (1987) or any other extrinsic document to assist in its interpretation. 
     
      
       
      
    50   Section 84 of the Victims Compensation Act 1996 covers matter of far wider import than the matters the subject of these proceedings, or s150 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and applies to all applications for compensation. 
     
      
       
      
    51   The section therefore does not, by the addition of the subsection, lose its original character and clearly there has not been a clear legislative intention expressed to override procedural fairness to an accused. 
     
      
       
      
    52   His Honour’s finding that the section requires external reference to other documents for its interpretation, in any event, misconceives the nature of the assistance provided by the Attorney General’s Second Reading Speech, when introducing the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual Assault Communications Privilege) Act 1999. 
     
      
       
      
    53   The Act amended the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and also amends certain cognate Bills. The Second Reading Speech, related largely to the amendments to the Criminal Procedure (Sexual Assault Communications Privilege) Act 1999 and the specific reference to the cognate bill, being an amendment to the then Victims Compensation Act 1996 at the end of that speech, in a few lines only, states merely that the intention was to seek to categorically close the avenue of investigation for the issue of subpoenas to examine material before the Victims Compensation Tribunal, and says little else. 
     
      
       
      
    54   The balance of the speech relates to the Criminal Procedure Act and the procedures which it sets up as a regime for the examination of confidential, privileged information. The fact that an introductory speech says that a Bill does something does not assist in the interpretation of a bill if the expressed words do not, in the bill itself, do what the introducer of the bill intends. 
     
      
       
      
    55   The very decision, R v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR at 681, which led to the introduction of the bill, clearly sets out the very limited circumstances, as held by Spigelman CJ, whose judgment was supported by the majority of the judges in the court, the circumstances in which extrinsic material can be used to interpret a statute, in particular at page 686: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         “In order to construe the words actually used by parliament, it is sometimes necessary to give them an effect as if they contained additional words. This is not however, to introduce words into the Act. This involves the construction of the words actually used. Judicial statements which appear to have been prepared to countenance something more than this, should be so understood. 
          
          
         The most frequently cited formulations are: 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
           ‘…It is a strong thing to read into an Act of Parliament words which are not there, and in the absence of clear necessity it is a wrong thing to do.’  
           Thompson v Goold & Co  
           [1910] AC 409 at 420, per Lord Mersey; and 
           
          
         
         
          
           
           ‘…we are not entitled to read words into an Act of Parliament unless clear reason for it is to be found with in the four corners of the Act itself.’  
           Vikers, Sons & Maxim Ltd v Evans  
           [1910] AC 444 at 445, per Lord Loreburn LC. 
           
          
          
         To similar effect is the following formulation: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Additional words ought not to be read into a statute unless they are required in order to make provision intelligible.’  
           Wills v Bowley  
           [1983] 1 AC 57 at 78B. 
           
          
         
         
          
         The process by which words omitted by inadvertence on the part of the draftsperson may be supplied by the court, must remain capable of characterisation as a process of construction of the words actually used.” 
         
        
        
       And further at p 690: 
        
        
         
         “The two techniques of construction to which I have referred- reading down general words and giving words an ambulatory construction- are based on the text. In my opinion, there is no warrant for supplying omitted words, unless the result of some such recognised technique of construction can be so described. 
          
          
         It is not, in my opinion, appropriate to take an expression of intention from extrinsic materials to supply the omission by the draftsperson, when the result cannot reasonably be deduced from the words actually used by a recognised technique of construction.” 
         
        
       
      
    56   In my view, the amendment to s84 of the Act does not come within those circumstances.  
     
      
       
      
    57   The words “admissible in evidence” disclose a clear legislative intention to protect the accused charged of an offence, the offence giving rise to a victim’s compensation claim. There is, therefore, no expressly legislative prohibition against the subpoenaed material which may be used by an accused. Clearly, an accused does not seek to admit evidence against his or her own interest. 
     
      
       
      
    58   An accused may therefore use any material, either within the prohibited categories or any other material not within those categories. Section 84(2) of the Act deals with the subpoena or any other means of a requirement to produce documents, and incorporates the following: “any application, document or transcript of evidence”. These three categories are qualified by the adjectival clause “that is not admissible in evidence in criminal proceedings under s(1)”. Therefore, the prohibition under the subpoena or a call to produce or other such device is completely qualified by the phrase, and therefore, since an accused can require production of documents for the accused’s own forensic purposes. An accused’s requirement to produce cannot be in the prohibited category referred to in ss84(1), and therefore, an accused may require production of documents under s84(2) of the Act.  
     
      
       
      
    59   In my view, His Honour, the Learned District Judge, erred in interpreting s84(2) of the Act as holding that it prevented production of all documents subpoenaed by the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    60   Ground of Appeal - Internal Inconsistency 
     
      
       
       I accept the submission of the respondent to the appeal, there are two regimes created. One deals with criminal procedure in relation to sexual assault counselling communications, the other deals with victims compensation. There is some overlap in terms of material, the subject of each regime, but the two different legislative provisions are directed to differently described classes of documents for different purposes. The Act deals with a wide range of matters outside matters relating to privileged counselling communications, although in a proportion of the applications for compensation, material sought to be examined will relate to this type of offence. But the procedure under the  
       Criminal Procedure Act 
        1986 as to privileged communications with counsellors sets up a procedure designed to achieve a balance of the interests in matters arising from subpoenas to produce, documents and other such material in relation to sexual assault counselling communications. 
        
       
      
    61   It must be remembered that s148 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 gives a very restricted definition to counselling communications, which are the subject of that part of the Act, and in many cases, even though there may be counselling communications with a victim, that still may not result in material which comes within s84 of the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996. Most material will be of a medical and other similar expert nature. 
     
      
       
      
    62   In my view, there is no inconsistency between the two provisions. This ground of appeal therefore fails. 
     
      
       
      
    63   Implied Repeal of subsection 84(2) of the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996 
     
      
       
       There is in my view, no inconsistency between the two provisions, and the question of implied repeal does not arise. The Act, the  
       Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act  
       1999, which affected the renumbering from ss57 to 69 of the  
       Criminal Procedure Act  
       1986, to ss147 - 159. Express amendments were made to the Act itself. 
        
       
      
    64   I accept the submission on behalf of the Tribunal that if Parliament had intended that s84(2) should be repealed or partially repealed, it would have done so expressly. In any event, s84(2) covers all applications for statutory compensation and is, as I have earlier indicated, only likely to cover the specific matters covered by s148 in a number of cases. 
     
      
       
      
    65   In my view, this ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      
    66   I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
         1. That leave to appeal be granted. 
          
         2. That the order of Coolahan DCJ be vacated.

      REGINA v RAYMOND ARNOLD BOND 
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1   STEIN JA: I agree with the conclusion of Smart AJ that there was a reasonable possibility that if the jury had been aware of the victim's compensation claim and the credibility issues concerning Mr Eric Whitfield, their verdict could have been different. I share the reasons which led his Honour to that conclusion. Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by Smart AJ, regrettable as that course is. 
    2   SMART AJ: Raymond Arnold Bond appeals against his conviction on eight counts of being a father, unlawfully and carnally knowing his daughter when above the age of 10 years and under the age of 17 years. These offences are covered by s 73 of the Crimes Act 1900 and carry a maximum penalty of penal servitude for 14 years. The offences allegedly took place between 1 January 1973 and 1 March 1979 and when the daughter was aged 11, 12, 14-15 and 15. The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him. On counts 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 he was sentenced to a minimum term of 5 years 3 months penal servitude and an additional term of 1 year 9 months and on counts 2, 3 and 5 to a minimum term of 3 years 9 months penal servitude and an additional term of 1 year 3 months. All sentences were to commence on 20 August 1999. The appellant was acquitted of count 1 which alleged that between 1 January and 25 October 1971 he carnally knew his daughter, a girl then being under the age of 10 years, to wit, the age of 8 years. 
    3   The appellant denied that any of the acts of intercourse alleged took place. He challenged his convictions on numerous grounds, including erroneous and inadequate directions, omitting to give the jury necessary directions, inconsistent verdicts, unreasonable verdicts not sufficiently supported by the evidence and fresh or new evidence involving the Crown not providing material to the accused. Those conducting the prosecution were not aware of it. 
     
      
     The Crown Case 
    4   The complainant was born on 25 October 1962. She was the eldest of four children. The second was Brian, the third was Eric and the fourth was Kylie. The complainant gave evidence of sexual acts by the appellant which were the subject of the various counts and others which were not. The effect of her evidence was that the appellant had been sexually active with her over many years. When she was 5 years old and living at Punchbowl there was an incident in the garage in which the appellant touched her on the vagina. 
    5   Between 1 January 1971 and 25 October 1971 when the complainant was aged 8 years the appellant was alleged to have collected her from her Auntie Kitty’s house and taken her to their home which the complainant said was at Hastings River Drive Port Macquarie. The appellant wanted her to clean the house. When they were there the appellant sat her on the side of the bed, took her pants off and had intercourse with her. She told him not to do it as it was hurting her. She was crying. The appellant denied the allegation and gave evidence that in 1971 the family lived at Grandview Parade and did not move to Hastings River Drive until mid 1972 by which time the complainant would have been ten. For obvious reasons the appellant was acquitted of this charge (count 1). 
    6   When she was aged 11 the family was living at St Marys. On one occasion allegedly between 1 January 1973 and 31 December 1973 the appellant took her to her parent’s bedroom and pushed her back onto the end of the bed. Kylie was in the cot. He removed the complainant’s pants and put his penis inside her vagina. She and Kylie were crying. After that, the appellant told her to change the nappy for Kylie (count 2 - the cot incident). 
    7   The family later moved to Batar Road, Kendall. On an occasion during the Christmas holidays she was cleaning the windows of a small back bedroom of a house prior to moving in. She was about 12. Her brothers were outside. The appellant came in, put her down on the floor and put his penis into her vagina (count 3 - the backroom incident). The indictment originally alleged that the offence occurred between 25 October 1973 and 31 December 1973. The judge granted leave to amend the indictment and the date 1 February 1975 was substituted for 31 December 1973. 
    8   There was a further incident when she was about 12 years old and allegedly between 25 October 1974 and 25 October 1975. She was in a truck with the appellant who was driving to Wauchope. He offered to buy her nail polish. She was not normally allowed to wear it and was excited. However, he said that she would only get the nail polish if she was a good girl. As she knew what that meant, she was no longer happy. He drove into the bush. She resisted by fighting but he pushed her back onto the seat, removed her pants and had intercourse with her (count 4 - the nail polish incident). 
    9   On another occasion allegedly between 25 October 1974 and 31 December 1974 she was in the truck with the appellant returning from Wauchope. When they arrived at Lake Cathie the tide was out. The appellant stated that he wished to investigate a site to harvest yabbies. They got out of the truck. The appellant put her down on a sandy area and inserted his penis inside her vagina (count 5 - the yabbie incident) On her return home she was not asked anything about her clothing. 
    10   The complainant stated that while living with the appellant and her family she had become pregnant twice. The first pregnancy occurred when she was living at Batar Road, Kendall beside the showground just before her thirteenth birthday (25 October 1975). The intercourse allegedly occurred between 1 January 1975 and 25 October 1975. Her mother and the appellant took her to Sydney to have the pregnancy terminated. She did not have intercourse with anyone other than the appellant prior to her having the abortion. 
    11   The second abortion occurred in 1977. The complainant was living in Kew Road, Kendall beside the bridge. She went with her mother and her sister to Sydney for the abortion. 
    12  In re-examination the complainant said that she told her friend, VB, that the appellant was responsible for her pregnancy but at his direction she had told everyone else it was RC, a local lad. (Count 6 - “the first pregnancy incident”) Ms Brown was called. She gave evidence of an occasion in 1975 when the complainant visited her house with the complainant’s mother and father. In 1977 the complainant, her mother and her sister visited her and her mother and apparently stayed with them. She gave no other evidence and was not cross-examined. The Crown was not permitted to adduce any evidence from Vanessa Brown as to any conversation between her and the complainant as to complaint. 
    13  At Easter (1976) when she was 13 years old she was in a tent in the backyard of her grandmother’s home in Sydney. Her mother and brothers were at the park at the time. The appellant pushed her onto the floor of the tent and had sexual intercourse with her. She tried to fight him off but to no avail. She was unable to scream because he had his hand over her mouth (count 7 - the tent incident) The indictment originally alleged that this incident took place between 1 April 1975 and 30 April 1975. The judge gave leave to amend the indictment so that 30 April 1975 became 30 April 1976. The trial judge incorrectly told the jury in her summing up that the relevant dates were 1 April 1975 and 30 April 1975. It was in cross-examination that the complainant stated that the incident took place at Easter 1976 when she was 13, not 12. The judge was not asked to correct the slip. The jury had a copy of the amended indictment. 
    14  When she was aged 14 there was an incident when she was sweeping the hallway. Her mother was out. The appellant sent the other children outside the house. The appellant pulled her up in the hallway and she tried to fight him off. Her younger sister came into the house. The appellant showed the younger sister how to ride a broom like a horse and sent her off to play. The appellant took her to the master bedroom where he had intercourse with her. (count 8 - the broom incident). 
    15  In cross-examination the complainant agreed that at the committal proceedings she had given evidence that at the time of the incident she was between 10 and 11 and that Kylie had not had her first birthday. There was some difficulty about the dates. The indictment initially alleged that the incident had occurred between 1 January 1977 and 31 December 1977. The judge gave leave to amend so that count 8 alleged the occurrence of the incident between 25 October 1976 and 31 December 1977. In her summing up the judge referred to the original dates and not the amended dates. She was not asked to correct this slip. 
    16  On an occasion shortly before her parents separated and allegedly between January 1978 and 1 March 1979 and when she was 15 the complainant wanted to accompany her mother to a game of bingo. There was a question whether the incident occurred in February 1978 or February 1979. The appellant refused to let her go on the pretext that she had not cleaned the skirting boards and Bryan went instead. The appellant urged her mother to go without her. After that he sent Eric and Kylie to the shop across the road. The appellant told the complainant to stop cleaning the skirting boards. She asked why she was not allowed to go with her mother. The appellant replied “How else could I keep you at home.” Her response was, “Not again.” He took her to the bedroom and had sexual intercourse with her. Later she told the appellant that she had heard her mother returning to the house. The appellant did not believe her and stated, “You are not gettting away until I have finished.” Her mother walked into the bedroom and told the complainant to get out. Her parents then had an argument and separated shortly afterwards. The complainant said that while she may have got the date wrong, the incident occurred. (count 9 - ""the mother came in incident”"").  
    17  The complainant’s mother did not give evidence due to illness and Dr K J Dobler gave evidence that the mother was suffering from extremely severe asthma and unstable diabetes and was unfit to come to court to give evidence. At the time of the hearing she was in Cessnock Hospital and had earlier been in the intensive care unit there. 
    18  The indictment originally alleged that the incident took place between 31 January 1978 and 1 March 1978 at Kendall. The judge gave leave to amend and the date 1 March 1979 was substituted for the date 1 March 1978 in the indictment. The judge in her summing up wrongly said that the complainant was alleged by the Crown to be 12 at the time. She was not asked to correct the mistake. 
    19  The complainant gave evidence of other sexual assaults on her. She said that when she was 15 years old there was an incident when she was dragged onto the floor and taken into a bedroom by the appellant where attempts were made to remove a splinter from her bottom with a pen knife. Sexual intercourse followed.  
    20   In cross examination she said there was an incident in which the appellant had intercourse with her at the back of and under the house at Batar Road Kendall while there were workmen in the vicinity.  
    21   She gave evidence of an occasion in the house beside the showground when she was practising her reading. She was 13 years old. The appellant was in bed and required her to obtain a book and bring it to him. Her brothers were outside. He made her sit on top of him while she was reading the book. During this time he had sexual intercourse with her. She said that Eric came in and was sent out, the appellant telling Eric that he was teaching the complainant to read better.  
    22  In her evidence in chief and initially in cross-examination she said that only her brother Eric walked in. Later in cross-examination she said that both her brothers walked in. This was consistent with the statement which she had given to the police. In explanation in cross-examination when asked why she had only said it was Eric who came in she replied, “They both are, Eric just stuck in my mind more than Brian.”  
    23  Eric Whitfield (aka Bond) said that on one occasion when he was aged 10 or 11 he returned to the house and heard the complainant crying. She was in her parent’s bedroom. He found the complainant’s “feet sticking out from and shins sticking out from behind the end of the bed.” Her knickers were around one ankle and the appellant’s feet were in between hers with his stubby shorts down around his ankles. In cross examination he confirmed that they were on the floor of the bedroom and not on the bed. Eric Whitfield recalled an incident happening before his thirteenth birthday (3 April 1976). He was living at Kendall. His mother and brother went to bingo and he was sent by the appellant to a corner store with Kylie. The complainant was at home with the appellant. On Eric’s way home he saw his mother’s brown station-wagon parked near the house. There was a fairly loud argument between his mother and the appellant. The complainant was in the bedroom crying. Eric Whitfield also gave evidence of the appellant on occasions when his wife and the children’s mother went out sending the other children out of the house for substantial periods while the complainant was kept in the house. The other children were not to return early. It was described as the unwritten rule. 
    24   Brian Raymond Bond, gave evidence that there was an incident when he went with his mother to bingo and came home early. He heard his mother and the appellant arguing. Within a very short period his father left home. 
    25   Detective Garside stated that he was unable to obtain any medical records from Dr Dainius of Port Macquarie whom the complainant had seen about her second pregnancy or any medical records about the termination. 
     
      
     The complainant first saw the police on 4 May 1995. 
      
      
     The Defence case 
    26  The appellant said that none of the incidents alleged occurred including those not the subject of the counts on the indictment. As to count 3 the appellant gave evidence that the family did not move into the house at Batar Road until February 1975. Mr William McKenzie, an owner driver of an interstate road transport truck, and who did work for Mr Bond for about 7 years from about 1973 when he was approximately 18 or 19 years of age, remembered assisting him to move a house from Port Macquarie to Kendall. The job was in Batar Creek Road. He said that once all the brick work had been done for all the piers for the foundations at the new site the house was let down, steel pulled out from underneath it and loaded onto trucks along with accompanying timber. There was then a lot of work to be done on the house. Mr McKenzie assisted Mr Bond at the weekends. Mr McKenzie said that lowering the house and pulling the steel out was dangerous. There was nobody under the house or around it and certainly no children. It is apparent from Mr McKenzie’s evidence that there was quite a lot of work done on the site before the house was shifted and even more work done on the house once it had been shifted and that this work extended over many weeks if not months. Mr McKenzie’s evidence is relevant to the incident which allegedly occurred while the house was being completed. 
    27   As to the 6th count the appellant gave evidence that the complainant told him that RC (a friend of the appellant’s sons) was responsible for her pregnancy. As to the 7th count the appellant stated that the family had stayed in a tent on several occasions when attending the Royal Easter Show to show dogs. As to the 8th count the appellant could not recall teaching Kylie to ride a broom like a horse. As to the 9th count the appellant said that the separation from his wife did not occur until February 1979 and occurred because he was having an affair with Elaine (his current wife). Some Family Court documents filed on behalf of the appellant indicated that the date of separation was 6 February 1979. There was no independent corroboration of this fact. The decree Nisi was made on 30 September 1980 and became absolute on 31 October 1980. The appellant attached considerable weight to the lengthy delay in complaint. It was about 17 years from the last incident and 24 years from the incident the subject of count 1. He also relied on no complaint being made until she had seen a solicitor consequent upon her arrest for stealing (shoplifting). He had advised her to see the police about the appellant’s misconduct. 
    28   Appeal Grounds 8, 8A and 9 read: 
     
      
       
       8. The appellant has available to him fresh evidence the absence of which at trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 8A. The failure by the Crown to provide the appellant’s legal representatives with copies of medical reports prepared in relation to the complainant’s claim for victim compensation resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      
      
       
       9. There is a significant possibility that the jury acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant if the new evidence had been before them. 
       
      
    29   Eric Frank Whitfield had convictions which were not known to the Crown prosecutor, his instructing solicitor, counsel for the appellant and his instructing solicitor. There is no direct evidence as to the appellant’s lack of knowledge. The convictions were in the name of Eric Frank Bond. There was no cross reference to Eric Frank Whitfield, which was his mother’s maiden name. The appellant and his son have been on poor terms for many years. However, as his daughter, Kylie and his former wife knew, there is a real chance, despite the poor relations in the family that the rest of the family and the appellant knew. In the absence of evidence from the appellant or other acceptable evidence I am unable to make any findings as to whether the appellant knew or did not know of the convictions of Mr Whitfield. 
    30  Having been committed for trial on 3 August 1986 Eric Frank Whitfield was sentenced on 13 August 1987, consequent upon pleas of guilty to each of two counts of indecent assault, to 4 years hard labour suspended on his entering a recognisance himself in the sum of $4000 to be of good behaviour for four years. On a charge of sexual intercourse without consent he was sentenced to 6 years hard labour suspended on him entering into a recognisance himself in the sum of $6000 to be of good behaviour for 6 years. He was subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. 
    31  The victim was his younger sister, Kylie. She wrote a moving letter for leniency. She attributed his conduct to the serious accident which he had in October 1984. She was worried that he was going to die. She wrote, “He was in hospital for about 1 month and 4 days and in that time the doctors had told us that he had brain damage … He was out of hospital for about 1 month before he started coming into my room and touching me. I blame it on the accident because he never touched me before the accident …” She wrote of the help he had given her, of her love for him and his rehabilitation. 
    32   It appears that at the sentence hearing Mr Whitfield relied upon the reports of Dr G F Mackintosh, a consultant psychiatrist. The doctor recorded that the appellant had sustained a head injury in a motor vehicle accident in October 1984 and was unconscious for 7 days. He regarded this as very significant. The doctor thought that the symptoms which he described were consistent with the type of post head injury syndrome which is commonly seen after the sort of accident he described. In his report of 26 September 1986 Dr Mackintosh adhered to his view that the appellant had a post head injury syndrome and that this had made him more impulsive and may have helped him act with less discretion than he otherwise might have. He wrote: 
     
      
       
       ""In the main though I feel his problem is a psychological one. His main problem is immaturity and he is going to need continued counselling and guidance for some time to come."" 
       
      
    33   The doctor thought his unstable childhood was a major problem. The doctor stated that Eric Frank Whitfield appeared to be genuinely sorry for what he had done. 
    34   In his report of 7 August 1987 Dr Mackintosh adhered to his earlier views. He wrote that Mr Whitfield would need counselling for a year or two and that he had quite a lot of maturing to do. 
    35  The records of Hastings District Hospital reveal that Eric Frank Bond was admitted on 6 October 1984 and discharged on 8 November 1984. The discharge summary states that he was initially quite shocked and required resuscitation. He underwent surgery on 6 and 8 October 1984. He is not recorded as being unconscious. The entries suggest the contrary. The discharge summary states that there was no head injury. 
    36   The medical reports and the pre-sentence report suggest rather strongly that Eric Frank Bond was much affected by his father’s alleged sexual abuse of the complainant. Any use of the hospital notes and the reports of Dr Mackintosh would have to be skilful and not let in evidence in cross examination or re-examination any matter as to the father’s behaviour. That would strengthen the Crown case considerably. The difficulty is that that behaviour was said to be a significant factor in the son’s behaviour. 
    37  The appellant also complained that the prosecution had failed to make available the documents relating to the complainant’s claim for victim’s compensation, and, in particular, two reports of Ms T Chauncy, consultant psychologist. These were available at the sentence hearing but not at the trial. The report of 13 February 1997 records the history given by the complainant. It includes: 
     
      
       
       ""Her most salient memories of the sexual assaults appear to begin around the age of 5 however Ms Marsh has experienced flashbacks and memory lapses dating back to a much younger age, possibly 2 years. Ms Marsh informed me that her father sexually assaulted her many times over the years, sometimes with other people in the near vicinity of the assaults, and at one stage Ms Marsh’s mother had interrupted Mr Bond assaulting Ms Marsh."" 
       
      
      
    38   Counsel submitted that this was inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence. I do not agree. She gave evidence of an incident when she was 5 years old. Her memories of earlier occasions were not sufficiently formed to be led in evidence. The reports record Ms Marsh’s distress. There was no mileage for the cross examiner in these reports. 
    39   There is a further matter. In cross examination the complainant was asked about the advice that Mr P Cleaves, solicitor had given when she consulted him about the charge of stealing (shoplifting). That was finalised on 27 March 1995 without a conviction being recorded, that is about 6 weeks before she went to the police. Mr Cleaves advised her to go to the police and talk to them about her complaints of sexual assault. This passage appears in her cross examination: 
     
      
       
       ""Q. Did he also tell you about your rights generally as a victim of sexual assault? 
        
        A. I don’t remember much of what was said to me that day I was very upset and that whole day’s a real blur, I don’t remember. I remember going home and going back, I don’t remember much else. 
        
        
        Q. And do you remember that Mr Cleaves told you about your rights to obtain financial compensation didn’t he? 
        
       A. No he didn’t. 
        
        
        Q. I suggest to you that he did, and you know about that don’t you? 
        
        A. I don’t remember. 
        
        
       Q. You don’t remember? 
        
       A. No."" 
       
      
      
    40   Unfortunately, a double-barrelled question was asked and only the first part of the question was answered, namely: 
     
      
       
       ""Q. I suggest to you that he did, and you know about that don’t you? 
        
        A. I don’t remember."" 
       
      
      
    41   The cross examiner did not press for an answer to the second question he had asked, allowing it to pass. The evidence does not sustain the suggestion that Mr Cleaves told her about her rights to victim’s compensation. 
    42  The complainant had another solicitor, namely, Mr Geoff Oliver of Oliver Campbell, Cessnock prepare her victim’s compensation claim. She saw the consultant psychologist on 5 February 1997 to obtain a report supporting the claim. The psychologist treated and counselled the complainant for some considerable time. That may have started prior to 5 February 1997. It continued during 1997 and probably until at least May 1999 on an irregular basis. Mrs Marsh found herself “stressed” after the treatment sessions. 
    43  After counsel made their final addresses the Crown prosecutor pointed out that it was never put to the complainant that she made her complaint because she had been charged with stealing and that the only question that was put in relation to victim’s compensation was that her solicitor had made her aware of it, which she denied. 
    44   In summing up the judge said: 
     
      
       
       ""She was cross examined about her entitlement to claim compensation if she was a victim of sexual assault. She denied she knew of her rights. That is a matter for you to make of what you will."" 
       
      
      
    45   The evidence quoted earlier does not completely coincide with the passage just quoted from the summing up. The complainant did not deny that she knew of her rights to claim compensation. She could not remember what Mr Cleaves said to her. She did not deal with the question that she knew about financial compensation for victims. If neither the judge nor counsel had a transcript and everyone was relying on memory what happened is very understandable. Perhaps the court was left with the impression encapsulated in the summing up. 
    46   The significant point is that the case went to the jury upon the basis that she was not aware of her rights to claim victim’s compensation. That may have been true in May 1995. The evidence upon that point is not conclusive. However by at least 21 January 1997, if not much earlier she was aware of her rights as her solicitors (Oliver Campbell) were seeking a report for the purposes of victim compensation. 
    47   After the verdicts, the solicitor handling the matter for the prosecution turned her mind to the preparation of a Victim Impact Statement and sought advice as to how to prepare it from another officer in the prosecution office. She was advised to ascertain whether Ms Marsh had any psychological reports. The solicitor thinks that the two reports were first handed to her by Ms Marsh at the sentence hearing on 17 September 1999. They were attached to the Victim Impact Statement and tendered during the sentence hearing. 
    48   Counsel for the appellant relied on Lewis-Hamilton 1997 92 A Crim R 532 and CPK (NSW CCA unreported 21 June 1995) In CPK Gleeson CJ referred to the obligation of the prosecuting authorities to make available relevant material to the defence. It was held that the prosecution was bound to make available medical reports which contained information appearing to contradict some of the evidence of the complainant and other information potentially damaging to her reliability. 
    49   In K (1991) 161 LSJS, (SA CCA) King CJ said: 
     
      
       
       "" the prosecution must disclose to the defence any conviction of prosecution witnesses of which the prosecution is aware This obligation must in principle extend … also to any information in the possession of the prosecution which reflects materially upon the credibility of prosecution witnesses … The obligation arises … only if the information is sufficiently solid to cause reasonable persons conducting the prosecution to think that cross examination based upon it might elicit answers materially affecting the credibility of the witness."" 
       
      
      
    50   In Lewis-Hamilton, the victim impact statement was not disclosed to the applicant until after he had been found guilty of two counts of sexual penetration. That statement contained material which defence counsel could have cross-examined upon. That material was relevant to the issues in the trial but counsel would have to be very careful in cross examining. The judges thought that skilful cross examination based on that material could have affected, perhaps changed, the jury’s verdict. Her credibility could have been adversely affected. It was held that a miscarriage of justice had resulted from the prosecution’s failure to make the material available prior to the trial. 
    51   In New South Wales the Victim Impact Statement is usually (but certainly not always) prepared after the conviction of the accused. The question of sentence is usually adjourned for a pre-sentence report and to enable the accused to obtain reports and evidence for the sentence hearing. Frequently, the only evidence tendered immediately after the verdicts is that containing the criminal antecedents of the accused. 
    52  Bearing in mind the practice in New South Wales I would not hold that the victim impact statement has to be disclosed prior to trial unless it has been prepared and contains relevant material. If the Crown holds any medical reports prior to or at the trial containing relevant material they should be disclosed to the accused. 
    53  The appellant further relied on the affidavit of Brian Raymond Bond of 27 March 2000. At the request of Det Snr Cons Garside, he attended at Toronto Police station on 8 December 1997 and made a statement. Mr BR Bond said that at no time prior to giving his statement was he informed of the details of the allegations made by his older sister against his father. He was asked what he remembered of his childhood and his mother and father splitting up and supplied as many details as he could. He was asked if he had ever walked into a room and seen his father in a position with the complainant that he should not have been in. He replied in the negative. At no time was he informed that his elder sister had alleged that he and Eric walked in on her and her father when he was assaulting her sexually. 
    54   Mr BR Bond stated that he was told that he was not allowed to talk to his father or his sister about his statement as he was a witness. Mr BR Bond said that he was subpoenaed to give evidence at his father’s trial starting on 16 August 1999 and attended at court. When waiting outside he heard an officer say words to this effect, “In court you can only be asked about what’s in your statement.” Mr Bond gave evidence on 17 August 1999. Mr BR Bond said that as well as the evidence he gave he could have said: 
     
      
       
       ""8.1 At no time did I ever observe my father having sex with or engaged in any other inappropriate behaviour with Maxine. 
       
      
      
       
        8.2 In relation to the third count in the indictment said to have occurred between 25 October 1973 and 1 February 1975 at Kendall, I helped with the work removing steel from under the house and can say that at no time was Maxine not present when that occurred. 
       
      
      
       
        8.3 In relation to the ninth count in the indictment said to have occurred between 31 January 1978 and 1 March 1979 at Kendall I recall that I went to bingo with my mother. Maxine stayed home with my father. When I left with my mother, Eric and Kylie were across the road. My mother was angry in the car but not crying. We were out for about 2-3 hours. After we returned my mother told me that my father was moving out, which occurred the next morning."" 
       
      
      
    55  It was common ground that Senior Counsel for the appellant and his solicitor had not interviewed Mr BR Bond prior to his giving evidence. Nevertheless, counsel questioned Mr BR Bond in some detail about the argument between his parents when his mother returned home unexpectedly before going to bingo and the subsequent split in their relationship. His elder sister had stayed home with the appellant. 
    56  Mr BR Bond stated in his evidence at the trial that there were occasions when his mother was away from the home, when the three younger children were sent outside by the appellant and the complainant remained in the house with him. 
    57  The “further evidence” which Mr RA Bond states that he could give would make no difference to the outcome of the trial. Further, arrangements could have been made by counsel and the solicitor for the appellant to interview Mr RA Bond at the court complex while he was there. I reject the application to lead evidence from Mr RA Bond. 
    58   I return to the evidence as to Mr Eric Frank Whitfield, the psychological reports and the victim’s compensation claim. Mr Whitfield was born on 3 April 1965 and was thus 19 at the time of his accident and 22 at the time of sentencing. In 1986 when he first saw Dr Mackintosh he had been committed for trial. There are substantial grounds for contending that Eric Frank Whitfield exaggerated the effects of his serious accident and misled the doctor by stating that he had suffered a head injury and been unconscious for seven days. The focus in subsequent reports switched to the appellant’s psychological problems, his immaturity and the effect of the father’s incestuous conduct with his daughter. 
    59   The jury could conclude that Mr Whitfield was a person of bad character because of the charges on which he was sentenced and that he was dishonest or prepared to be dishonest when that advanced his interests and helped him to avoid a prison sentence. On the other hand this conduct occurred 12 years prior to the trial when Mr Whitfield was a young man. Mr Whitfield did not have the same incentive to be deceptive over his father’s conduct. 
    60  Mr Whitfield’s evidence did not directly support any of the counts. His description of finding the appellant and the complainant together on the floor of the bedroom on one occasion was not supported by the complainant. He only heard of the aftermath of the bingo incident (count 9). The most telling piece of evidence which he gave was of the appellant, when his wife was away, sending the other children out of the house and to other activities while he kept the complainant at home. That showed an unusual relationship. There was other evidence of this, namely, that of BR Bond. It did not, of course, prove that any particular act or transgression had occurred. For present purposes I have not taken into account the capacity of the Whitfield materials to rebound upon the appellant if evidence explaining Mr Whitfield’s condition and conduct was admitted. I have assumed that counsel cross examining would do so in such a way as not to render such material admissible. 
    61   There is a reasonable possibility that the jury could have regarded the evidence of Mr Whitfield as affording some support to that of the complainant and it could have been one of the factors in the jury accepting the complainant. 
    62  As to the statement of the judge that the complainant denied that she knew of her rights to claim victims compensation the case went forward to the jury on an incorrect basis. A claim had been in contemplation since at least January 1997. A jury could regard a pending or intended claim for victim’s compensation as a factor relevant to her credibility. In a case in which credibility was very important the prosecution case went to the jury upon materials which were incomplete and with them not knowing of factors which could affect their view of the credibility of the complainant and Mr Eric Whitfield. In combination, the matters have weight and a new trial must be had as there is a reasonable possibility that if the jury had known of these matters their verdicts could have been different. 
    63  In view of this conclusion it is unnecessary for this Court to deal with grounds of appeal 2 to 5 relating to the judge’s directions. The appellant was represented at his trial by senior counsel who is one of the leaders of the bar in the criminal field and expert in the areas of the law covered by these grounds. The objections were not taken at the trial. Senior Counsel must have determined that it was in the best interests of the accused’s not to raise the complaints now made. There had been a relatively short trial and a short summing up. That could be seen to favour the accused. It is not necessary to deal further with these grounds. Appeal Ground 1 was not pressed. 
    64   Appeal Grounds 6 and 7 read: 
     
      
       
       ""6. The not guilty verdict in relation to count 1 was inconsistent with guilty verdicts in relation to counts 2 to 9. 
       
      
      
       
       7. The verdicts were unreasonable/incapable of being supported by the evidence."" 
       
      
      
    65  The appellant submitted that if the jury entertained a reasonable doubt as to the first count they should logically have entertained a reasonable doubt in relation to the balance of the counts. On all counts, the jury’s decision depended solely on their acceptance or otherwise of the complainant. As earlier indicated there was evidence that the intercourse alleged could not have happened at the venue suggested - because the family did not live there at the time at which the offence was alleged to have occurred. While there were amendments to the Indictment to accommodate the approximate dates of other offences this was the only case where the intercourse could not have taken place where suggested. Thus, it is readily understandable why the jury would not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to count 1. 
     
      
    66  In cross-examination she said that the sexual intercourse the subject of count 1 hurt but it did not cause her any injury of which she knew. She did not see a doctor. When asked whether she had blood on any part of her clothing she said, “I don’t remember, I don’t know.” This passage appears: 
     
      
       
       ""Q. You say that was the very first time … that your father had sexual intercourse with you, but you can’t remember anything about it other than it hurt? 
        
        A. Yeah that’s all I can remember.”"" 
       
      
      
    67   There was also the problem that the complainant was aged about 8 years if the incident happened prior to 25 October 1971 and 10 years of age if the incident happened after 25 October 1972. The date of the move to Hastings River Drive was said to be about mid 1972. The evidence did not enable the jury to say with any degree of certainty that the incident happened prior to 25 October 1972. It was an element of the count charged that the complainant was under the age of 10 years. The jury may not have been satisfied that the complainant was under the age of ten years at the time of the offence. 
    68  In support of his submission that the verdicts were unreasonable and that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt the appellant relied on an examination of the whole of the evidence and these matters in particular: 
     
      
     (a) the lack of corroboration of the complainant; 
     (b) other evidence tendered to contradict the truth of the claims made by the complainant. Reliance was placed on her evidence as to who witnessed the reading incident and the failure of her brothers to support her version. Eric Whitfield also deposed to an incident taking place on the floor and not on the bed. There was also the evidence as to what occurred while work was being carried out at Batar Road, Kendall; 
     (c) the unexplained delay in complaint and complaint only being made after she was charged with stealing; 
     (d) the unexplained delay in the matter coming to trial; 
     (e) the absence of detail in the complainant’s evidence and problems with her evidence as to when the incidents alleged occurred. Four of the counts were amended as to the approximate dates of the offence alleged; 
     (f) it was in cross examination that the complainant gave evidence of the appellant having sexual intercourse under the house at Batar Road while work was in progress on the house. The evidence of Mr McKenzie makes this unlikely; 
     (g) the absence of medical evidence in relation to any of the allegations and the terminations; 
      
       
      (h) the evidence as led of Brian Bond did not put forward matters which tended to support the evidence of the appellant and undermine that of the complainant; 
      (i) the absence of any suggestion by the complainant that her maternal great grandfather, who lived with the family from 1971 to 1979, ever witnessed any sexual misconduct. Further, as to the 9th count, there was the comment of Eric Whitfield in response to a fairly broad question from the Crown Prosecutor that after he (Whitfield) returned to the house the great grandfather “actually was telling my brother that my father was a bad and evil man.” This may have impermissibly prejudiced the jury against the appellant; 
      
      
     (j) the not guilty verdict returned on count 1; 
      
    69   I have earlier explained why I do not regard the “not guilty” verdict on count 1 as affecting the verdicts on the other counts. The point about the great grandfather lacks substance. There is no evidence that he is still alive. It would be surprising if any of the allegedly criminal acts of the appellant towards his daughter took place in the presence of the great grandfather. I doubt if the impermissible comment of Eric Whitfield would have influenced the jury. Having regard to the relationship between the father and the son it is the sort of comment that would be ignored. 
    70  I do not agree that the complainant’s evidence generally lacked cogency. I would not attach much importance to the complainant’s difficulty with dates when the events occurred so many years ago and the complainant was aged between 8 and 15 years. 
    71  The delay in complaint is an important point but that is not of itself or in conjunction with the other points sufficient to render the verdicts insupportable. There is evidence that the appellant was and is a big man and that the children were afraid of him and submissive to him as they grew up. 
    72  The Crown contended that the appellant’s evidence supported many of the details in the complainant’s evidence. As to count 2 the appellant agreed that Kylie’s cot was in his bedroom at the house at St Mary’s in 1973. As to count 3 the appellant accepted that the windows of the house at Batar Creek Road had to be cleaned when the house was completed in February 1975 and that he could have asked the complainant to clean the windows at the house during the school holidays in 1974-1975. However, he later denied that this occurred. As to count 4 the appellant conceded that it was possible that he took the complainant on her own in his truck. 
    73   As to count 6 the appellant said that he went to Sydney with the complainant and his wife for the termination of the first pregnancy but he did not go with them for the second termination. He did not know who was responsible for the second pregnancy and made no enquiries to this end.” He said, “I was fed up with it by then.” As to count 7 the appellant agreed that his family camped in a tent in his mother’s backyard in Sydney at Easter 1976. 
    74   As to count 9 the appellant agreed that there were occasions when he allowed his other children to go across to the Dicky Croese Shop “and I’ve kept [the complainant] at home”. 
    75   The complainant did not say as was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the act of sexual intercourse occurred while the house was being “lowered”. She said it occurred while the house was being “worked on, built.” 
    76   There is no direct corroborating evidence in respect of any of the counts of the appellant having intercourse with the complainant. The pregnancies certainly provide evidence of the complainant having had intercourse. The failure of the appellant to make enquiries as to the father on the second occasion is curious. The appellant’s concession that there were occasions when he allowed the three younger children to go across to the Dicky Croese Shop must be taken with the evidence of Eric Whitfield that he sent the three younger children out and kept the complainant at home and that there was an unwritten rule that the younger child should not return until after the lapse of a substantial period of time. This points to dubious conduct. Mr BR Bond gave evidence of a similar practice on the appellant’s part. If the alleged practice had only happened on 2 or 3 occasions that would not raise a question in the mind but the evidence suggests greater frequency. 
    77   Any examination of the evidence leads to the conclusion that it is well open to a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on counts 2 to 9. 
     
     I propose the following orders: 
    78 (a) Appeal allowed; convictions and sentences quashed; (b) A new trial be had. 
     
      
    79   IRELAND AJ: I agree with Smart AJ for the reasons given by his Honour, sharing the regret expressed by Stein JA.

      FACTS 
       
       
      The appellant was convicted on eleven counts of sexual assault, indecent assault, attempted homosexual intercourse and homosexual intercourse against his stepsons under ss 61D, 61E, 78H and 78I of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 (NSW). the offences had allegedly been committed 12 - 14 years earlier. There was delay in complaint, no corroborative evidence and the credit of both complainants was seriously in issue. 
       
       
      HELD 
       
       
      Per Beazley JA (Greg James J and Kirby J agreeing): 
       
       
      (i) The trial judge failed to adequately warn the jury against using the offences of one complainant towards proof of the guilt of the appellant of offences involving the second complainant. The trial judge’s directions to consider each charge separately were insufficient to achieve this end: see  
      R v Mitchell 
       (unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 5 April 1995) 
       
       
      (ii) This was a case which required a warning to be given to the jury in accordance with  
      R v Longman 
       (1989) 168 CLR 79, and in particular that it was dangerous to convict on the complainants’ evidence unless, after carefully scrutinising it, they were satisfied of its truth and accuracy: see also  
      Crampton v The Queen 
       [2000] HCA 60. 
       
       
      (iii) This was not a case in which the appellate court should, on reading the transcript, interfere with the verdicts of the jury on the ground that they were unsafe and unsatisfactory. It was apparent that demeanour would have played a significant role in the jury’s assessment of the complainants’ credit: see  
      R v M 
       (1994) 181 CLR 487. 
       
       
      ORDERS 
       
       
      (i) Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      (ii) The convictions and sentences on all counts to be quashed. 
       
       
      (iii) Order that there be a new trial on all counts.

       REGINA v MAYBERRY 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
       
       
      
    1    BEAZLEY JA: The appellant was indicted on 11 counts of sexual assault, indecent assault, attempted homosexual intercourse and homosexual intercourse against his two stepsons under the provisions of ss 61D, 61E, 78H and 78I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), respectively. The offences under sections 61D and 61E relate to offences committed against a child under the age of 16 years, and sections 78H and 78I offences relate to offences committed against a child under the age of 10 years. All counts were heard together. 
     
      
    2    The appellant was found guilty on each count and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. The longest sentence imposed was in respect of counts 6, 8 and 9, being counts of homosexual intercourse under s 78H, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years. The appellant was sentenced to a minimum term of 6 years, with an additional term of 2 years on each of these three counts.  
     
      
    3    The appellant appeals against his conviction in respect of each count.  
     
      
    4    Essentially two issues are raised on the appeal. The first relates to the trial judge’s directions to the jury. The appellant contends that the trial judge’s directions in relation to the need for caution in scrutinising the complainants’ evidence were inadequate: Ground 1; as were his directions in relation to the use of evidence touching on the allegations made by each complainant in respect of the other: Ground 3. The second issue raised is that the quality of the evidence was such that the verdicts are unsafe and unsatisfactory: Ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Background  
       
      
    5    The appellant was the stepfather of both complainants, NRD and JMD. He had married the complainants’ mother (Ms D) in March 1981 and they had one child, a daughter SD, in July 1983. JMD was born on 14 November 1974 and NRD was born on 7 August 1977. The appellant and Ms D separated in 1995 and were divorced in mid 1997. 
     
      
    6    All offences, except that specified in count 10, were alleged to have been committed in 1985 when the family lived at Bidwell. At that time, NRD was 7 - 8 years of age and JMD was about 11 - 12 years of age. The appellant had given up work as a teacher because of illness and had become the primary carer of the children. At this time their mother had joined the air force. Between June and November 1985 she was mostly away from home attending Officer Training School in Melbourne.  
     
      
    7    Count 10 was alleged to have been committed in 1983. That count involved JMD when he was about 9 years old. 
     
      
    8    Counts 1 to 9 were all alleged to have been committed on NRD, between February and November 1985. They were representative complaints in the sense it was alleged there was a continuing relationship between the appellant and NRD, which extended up until NRD left home in 1992 when he was 14, and that the assaults continued up until that time. 
     
      
    9    Counts 10 and 11 involved JMD, the first in 1983 and the second in 1985. Evidence of other incidents was admitted as relationship evidence. 
     
      
    10    The counts may be summarised as follows. 
     
      
    11    The events alleged in counts 1, 2 and 3 were said to have been committed on the same day against NRD when he was 7 or 8 years of age. Count 1 involved an allegation of an act of indecency, namely, placing the hands of NRD on his penis: s 61E(1A). Count 2 involved an allegation of sexual intercourse: s 61D(1) and count 3 was an allegation of attempted homosexual intercourse: s 78I. 
     
      
    12    Count 4 was an allegation of an act of indecency whereby the appellant required NRD to masturbate him until he ejaculated, while the appellant touched NRD’s penis: s 61E(1A). Count 7 again involved another indecent assault whereby the appellant required NRD to masturbate him until he ejaculated and played with NRD’s penis: s 61E(1A). 
     
      
    13    Counts 5 and 6 were alleged to have occurred on the same day as each other, after school, and were allegations of sexual intercourse: s 61D(1) and homosexual intercourse: s 78H. 
     
      
    14    Count 8 and count 9 were separate acts of homosexual intercourse on NRD: s 78H. 
     
      
    15    Counts 10 and 11 related to the complainant JMD and were alleged to have been committed approximately two years apart. Count 10 was an indecent assault on JMD, when he was about 9 years of age and in third grade, involving the appellant rubbing and squeezing JMD’s penis: s 61E(1A). Count 11 was an indecent assault on JMD when he was 10 involving the appellant touching JMD’s penis and testicles: s 61E(1A). Evidence was admitted of two other incidents as relationship evidence 
     
      
    16    It is convenient for the purposes of introduction to refer to the various incidents as ‘assaults’.  
     
      
    17    NRD alleged he had been subjected to a series of assaults from an early time after the appellant commenced living in their home. JMD was also subjected to a number of assaults but not with the extent, frequency or repetition involved in NRD’s case. Both complainants alleged, however, that the appellant had been very authoritarian and had physically and harshly disciplined them over a long period, including belting them with an electric jug cord. The appellant did not deny he had physically disciplined the complainants. 
     
      
    18    Most of the assaults occurred on occasions when there was no one else home. Some of the assaults on NRD occurred in the locked bedroom of the appellant and the complainants’ mother. None of the incidents occurred in the presence of the other complainant. There was, therefore, no corroboration of any of the incidents alleged in the indictments. However, there was some commonality of evidence, in particular relating to the locks on the doors and a black bag under the appellant’s bed. Both complainants gave evidence that there was always a lock on the bedroom door of the appellant and their mother, and that if a particular home in which they lived did not have a lock on the bedroom door, the appellant would install one. The complainants’ mother’s evidence supported this. The appellant maintained that he had only installed a lock on the bedroom door in Canberra.  
     
      
    19    NRD gave evidence that the appellant sometimes used condoms in the attacks on him. He said these were kept in a black bag under the appellant’s bed. The bag had a padlock on it and contained both adult and child pornographic magazines. He said he told JMD about the bag and when JMD did not believe him, he showed it to him. JMD gave evidence that NRD had shown him the bag and it contained condoms, pornographic magazines and a scrapbook. Ms D gave evidence that the appellant had a black bag which was “used to carry his medication in”. The appellant did not give evidence about what the bag contained, but denied that it contained pornographic magazines, a scrapbook or condoms, which he said he “had no need for”. 
     
      
    20    An issue was raised on appeal about the admissibility of the evidence as to the magazines, on the ground it was highly prejudicial material: s 137 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). There was no objection taken at trial and no ground of appeal relating to it. In those circumstances, I do not propose to deal with the question of admissibility of the evidence in these reasons. 
     
      
    21    Because there was no corroboration in the true sense of the word, the credit of each complainant was the critical issue in the case. Ground 2 is directed to that issue. It is alleged that both complainants, but especially NRD, were so lacking in credibility that it was dangerous to convict on their evidence. 
     
      
    22    Another issue in the trial was the delay by each complainant in making any complaint. 
     
      
    23    The Crown conceded there was no recent complaint by NRD, although he alleged he had complained on a number of occasions but was ignored or disbelieved. He said he had complained in an indirect way to his mother and to counsellors after he left home in 1992. NRD first complained to police in 1997. 
     
      
    24    JMD alleged he first complained to his mother in 1989 when he left a note in her lunch box. Ms D did not know whether to believe her son or her husband. However, she had a confrontation with the appellant and threatened to call the police, but did not do so. JMD was contacted by police in 1997 after NRD had complained and he too lodged a complaint. 
     
      
    25    The appellant denied the allegations, claiming they were fabricated and that they may have been the result of collusion between the complainants. He advanced a number of reasons why the complainants may have made the allegations against him. He alleged the complainants may have been motivated to assist their mother in relation to property proceedings which were on foot at about the time the allegations were made, or to avenge themselves on him because of his authoritarian approach to them. It was also suggested to NRD in cross-examination that he was motivated by a desire to obtain up to $50,000 by way of victim’s compensation by making the complaint.  
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 and 3: Adequacy of the Trial Judge’s Directions 
       
      
    26    The appellant contends that the directions of the trial judge were inadequate in two significant respects: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. That the … trial judge’s warning to the jury as to the need for caution in scrutinising the evidence was … inadequate. [Ground 1] 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        3. The trial judge failed to direct and warn the jury adequately against the use of evidence touching on the allegations made by each complainant in respect of the other. [Ground 3]” 
        
       
      
    27    Before commencing his summing up, the trial judge raised with the Crown and counsel for the appellant the particular directions each considered were necessary to be given to the jury. Initially the discussion focussed upon the direction which was required in relation to corroboration in a case where collusion was alleged. However, it was eventually accepted by the Crown at the trial that there was no corroborative evidence and accordingly it was only necessary to give a direction as to collusion. 
     
      
    28    The Crown then submitted that two other directions might be necessary: first, an instruction to the jury against the misuse of the evidence of one complainant in the case against the other; secondly, a direction to the jury that they could not use evidence of propensity to reason that a father who sexually abused one child sexually abused another child. 
     
      
    29    The trial judge summarised the direction he was being asked to make in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “In effect saying, in order to be satisfied of the guilt of the accused in regard to any one count, they must be satisfied from the evidence that relates to that count.” 
        
       
       
      Crown counsel agreed and his Honour further commented: 
       
       
        
        “They cannot use the relationship evidence to establish the guilt” 
        
       
      
    30    The appellant’s counsel at trial agreed such a direction was necessary. 
     
      
    31    The appellant’s counsel at trial also sought a direction in accordance with R v Mitchell (unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 5 April 1995) (the Mitchell direction) to the effect that it was necessary to warn the jury, in a case where there was a possibility of contact and contamination between complainants, that the evidence of one complainant could not be used in proof of the Crown case against the other.  
     
      
    32    Both counsel at trial agreed that because of the delay in complaint a direction in accordance with Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 was required. In particular, the appellant’s counsel at trial submitted that, if the trial judge proposed to give a direction to the jury favourable to the complainants in relation to delay - by putting before the jury reasons why they may have failed to complain - it was necessary that a direction also be given that “they should scrutinise the evidence carefully, because conviction on the evidence of [each] complainant alone, in the absence of corroboration, would be dangerous”. See R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12.  
     
      
    33    The appellant contends that notwithstanding these discussions as to the appropriate directions, his Honour’s directions were inadequate in two fundamental respects. The first was that his Honour failed to adequately explain to the jury that they could not use the evidence of one complainant to assist in the determination of the charges that related to the other, as required by Mitchell. The second was that his Honour’s Longman direction was inadequate.  
     
      
    34    Counsel for the Crown submitted however that the summing up, viewed as a whole, was adequate.  
     
      
       
      The  
      Mitchell 
       Direction 
       
      
    35    R v Mitchell involved four charges of aggravated indecent assault against two complainants. The appellant was the de facto husband of the complainants’ mother. The allegations surfaced when the complainants went to live with their father. 
     
      
    36    All charges were heard together and each complainant gave evidence so that “the jury had before them the whole of the evidence relating to both complainants”. The appellant denied the charges and alleged that the complaints were concocted to get back at him and the complainants’ mother. 
     
      
    37    The trial judge accepted that collusion was open on the evidence. However, the trial judge did not give any direction against using the evidence of one complainant in proof of the Crown case relating to the other complainant. On appeal, it was held the trial judge had erred in failing to do so. Gleeson CJ stated at 4: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the trial judge was obliged to warn the jury in clear terms against using the evidence of one complainant towards proof of the guilt of the appellant of offences involving the other complainant. There was also a need to give the jury careful directions about the way in which evidence admissible towards proof of the guilt of the appellant of a particular offence against one complainant could be treated in relation to the other alleged offence against the same complainant.” 
        
       
      
    38    The need for such a direction is obvious. When there is more than one complainant there is invariably some common features in their evidence. Although an accused can seek to use this to advantage by trying to establish inconsistencies in such evidence, it can work to the serious disadvantage of the accused if the evidence is largely consistent. In that circumstance, the evidence of one complainant can help to strengthen the case relating to the other or others. The disadvantage can be even more marked where the evidence of one complainant is particularly under attack. In that case the possibility of a jury assessing that complainant’s evidence favourably, because the evidence of the other is more reliable, is a real one. 
     
      
    39    In this case, the trial judge did not give the first part of the direction to which the Chief Justice referred in Mitchell. He did, on more than one occasion, however, refer to the need to look at each charge separately. The Crown submitted that in the context of the summing up as a whole the directions were, in all the circumstances, adequate. That submission is difficult to sustain in light of the further statement by the Chief Justice in Mitchell at 5 that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The directions given about considering the charges separately and returning separate verdicts are standard directions given in any case where there is more than one charge against an accused person.” 
        
       
      
    40    Nevertheless, as the point has been taken by the Crown that the directions were sufficient, it is necessary to consider the summing up to determine whether the appellant might have been deprived of a fair trial. 
     
      
    41    The trial judge referred on a number of occasions to the need for the jury to look at each charge separately. He did so at the very commencement of the summing up in clear and unequivocal terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “[Y]ou must look at each charge separately and determine what your verdict will be in regard to that charge before you turn to a consideration of the second charge … the verdict that you bring in in regard to any one charge should not influence you in the verdict you will bring in regard to the other charges.” 
        
       
      
    42    He informed the jury that the charges related to two complainants and that the eleven counts were being heard together as a matter of convenience and that the onus was on the Crown “to prove each of those charges”. 
     
      
    43    His Honour re-emphasised the importance of considering each charge separately again at page 6: 
     
      
       
        
        “… you will look at each of them separately. You will identify the evidence that relates to each charge and determine whether that evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused in relation to that charge. … if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the essential elements that go to constitute the charge you are then considering was proven you will be duty bound to return a verdict of guilty. But you must look at each charge separately. It would be quite wrong for you to look at the charges globally. That is not the way the law operates. … 
        
       
       
        
        … look at the evidence that relates to that charge to determine what your verdict will be by applying the law that I direct you that is applicable to that type of charge, having determined what your verdict will be you then turn to a consideration of the second charge. It by no means follows that because your verdict in regard to one charge is a verdict of guilty or not guilty that the same verdict will be found in regard to the other charges because each charge must be looked at separately so that you can determine what your verdict in relation to that charge is.” 
        
       
      
    44    His Honour then directed the jury that the ultimate question for their determination was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… when you come to deal with each of these counts in regard to each of these charges and which you have to ask yourself is am I satisfied from the evidentiary material that relates to that charge of the guilt of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    45    Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that, although these directions were both necessary and unexceptional, they were insufficient in the circumstances because there was no direction that there were two separate complainants and that the evidence of one could not be used towards proof of the charges brought by the other as required by Mitchell. It was further submitted that his Honour’s omission to give an appropriate direction was compounded because he thereafter tended to consider the charges as a “job lot”. It was submitted this was particularly obvious when his Honour came to deal with the essential elements of the offences.  
     
      
    46    His Honour first referred to counts 3, 6, 8, 9, 2 and 5 - all of which, he told the jury, related to NRD. He then mentioned counts 1, 4, 7, 10 and 11 together. He said “counts 1, 4 and 7 related to the complainant [NRD] and counts 10 and 11 relate to the complainant [JMD]”. His purpose in dealing with the counts in this way was clear - they fitted into the four categories of charges with which, he informed the jury, the appellant had been charged. This emerges from the next passage in the summing up. He suggested to them that when considering their verdicts they “start at the first and deal with the first charge in the indictment and go through it in that way”. He said, however, 
     
      
       
        
        …when I come to deal with ... the essential elements that go to constitute [the charges] I will deal with the four different types of charges that the [appellant] faces in these proceedings…” 
        
       
      
    47    The summing up went into a second day and his Honour summarised where he had got to the previous day and reminded the jury that he had been dealing with the essential elements of the counts against the accused. Again he referred to them in categories: 
     
      
       
        
        “I then went on to take you to the first group of charges I have mentioned … I said then that I would defer saying anything about the concept of homosexual intercourse until I identified the essential elements which related to the next group of charges I mentioned, that is the three counts, being counts six, eight and nine, which allege that the accused had homosexual intercourse with a male under the age of ten. I will turn now to a consideration of ‘that’ charge. 
        
       
       
        
        … then I will turn to a consideration or identify the evidence the Crown relies upon in support of the three charges of homosexual intercourse. Then we will go on to deal with the sexual intercourse  
        charge 
         without consent … and the five counts of indecent assault and I will approach them the same way.”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    48    It is worth noting at this stage that there are three problems with this passage. His Honour again rolled up the charges into groups. He referred to one count of sexual intercourse without consent, when there were two. And he referred to the indecent assault charges as a group without reference to the fact that there were three separate counts involving NRD and two separate counts involving JMD.  
     
      
    49    His Honour then proceeded to deal with the evidence relevant to each charge - dealing with the charges in the categories which he had established at the outset. In doing so his Honour grouped aspects of the evidence together. The charges in relation to sexual assault are a good example. His Honour directed the jury that they would have no difficulty in being satisfied that the appropriate age limit had been proved but that the “real live issues in regard [to] those charges … [is that they] occurred without … consent …”.  
     
      
    50    He then dealt with the indecent assault charges which related to both complainants. He distinguished those which related to JMD from those that related to NRD. He identified the “live issues” in respect of those charges as being whether they occurred and whether they constituted indecent assaults. He then gave certain directions about what was meant by assault “[i]n regard to this charge of indecent assault” (emphasis added). There were five such charges, three involving NRD and two involving JMD. 
     
      
    51    His Honour continued dealing with this category in mostly global terms, but then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Let me identify the evidence on which the Crown relies in regard to each of those charges”. 
        
       
      
    52    Senior counsel for the appellant resisted any suggestion that, by directing the jury in respect of each charge, the trial judge was, in effect, impliedly directing them not to permit evidence of one complainant to have a flow over effect to the case of the other complainant. He submitted that a jury could not possibly have any perception that was the purpose of such direction which, as Gleeson CJ pointed out in Mitchell, is a standard direction in any trial involving more than one count. He submitted that the trial judge was required to give a warning in the strongest possible terms that the evidence in respect of one complainant could not be used as evidence in relation to the other. He submitted that the closest his Honour came to so instructing the jury was in the direction: 
     
      
       
        
        “When you come to consider the question of whether the Crown has established the guilt of the accused on any one of these charges you must look at the evidence given by the complainant about that incident. The other relationship evidence is put before you solely as relationship evidence. … You must not use the relationship evidence other than to put in context the evidence, other evidence given by the complainants about the specific instances on which the Crown relies. 
        
       
       
        
        So in regard to counts one to nine the Crown relies specifically on the evidence of [NRD], while in respect of counts ten and eleven it relies specifically on the evidence of [JMD] 
        .  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    53    His Honour then told the jury that there was no corroborative evidence to support any of the individual acts which the complainant alleged although there was “some support for some of the evidence”.  
     
      
    54    In my opinion, the appellant has made good this ground of appeal. Although his Honour gave directions in relation to the requirement to look at each charge separately, from time to time during his summing up he treated the charges globally. That, in itself, could potentially have been misleading to the jury. However, the fundamental error was that his Honour failed to give what I have referred to as the Mitchell direction. I do not think that the direction which I have emphasised in para 52 satisfied the requirement in Mitchell and in any event, it has its own inbuilt flaw. His Honour ‘rolled up’ counts 1 to 9 and counts 10 and 11 and invited the jury to consider the evidence of NRD in respect of counts 1 to 9 and the evidence of JMD in respect of counts 10 and 11. The correct direction was that each charge had to be considered separately and that the evidence in respect of each count in JMD’s case could not be used in respect of the offences in NRD’s case. The direction was not sufficiently close to the required directions as to be adequate in the circumstances. There was nothing else in the summing up to ameliorate this failure. Rather, the tendency from time to time to treat the charges in categories, in my opinion, compounded the failure. I consider that on this ground alone the appellant should have a new trial.  
     
      
       
      The  
      Longman 
       Direction 
       
      
    55    After his Honour had referred to the fact that there was no corroborative evidence, although there was some supporting evidence, he gave the following direction: 
     
      
       
        
        “In these circumstances you must carefully scrutinise their evidence, both generally and particularly when you come to consider their evidence in regard to each of the charges the accused faces in these proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        You will take into account the time that has elapsed since these events allegedly happened. Their age at the time. The demeanour of the complainants as they gave their evidence. The reliability of their evidence. And you can only act upon their evidence if you are satisfied that it is reliable, it is true and safe to act upon.”  
        
       
      
    56    His Honour drew attention to the difficulties which confronted the appellant because of the time which had elapsed since the alleged happening of the assaults and the complaints, and the appellant’s consequential difficulties in being able to meet each allegation specifically. 
     
      
    57    His Honour concluded this portion of the summing up with the statement: 
     
      
       
        
        Lack of specific details in this case might be of concern to you. Because both [complainants], in most cases, have not been able to tell you, with any degree of certainty as to when a particular event occurred. They use expressions ‘while my mother was at Point Cook’, ‘a week later’, and ‘a week later’, and ‘a week later’. 
        
       
       
        
        … there is no real date been put before you. It does put the accused at a disadvantage. You will bear that in mind when you come to consider the evidence that has been placed before you in these proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        You should also take into account, of course, not only that time that has elapsed, but the age of the complainants at that time, their age now and their demeanour. You should always bear in mind, of course, the Crown having laid the charges the onus is on the Crown to prove the charges. There is no onus on the accused to prove anything.” 
        
       
      
    58    Senior counsel for the appellant said that whilst this was an attempt to comply with Longman, it was inadequate in all the circumstances, particularly given the serious attack made upon the reliability of NRD’s evidence. He submitted that a warning in terms of s 165 Evidence Act should have been given, and in giving such a warning his Honour should have drawn attention to some of the major inconsistencies in NRD’s evidence. It was submitted that similar assistance should have been given in respect of JMD’s evidence, although it was conceded that the attack on his credit was not as far reaching.  
     
      
    59    In Longman, the majority (Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) stated at 91: 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than twenty years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. To leave a jury without such a full appreciation of the danger was to risk a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    60    The need for a ‘Longman direction’ in cases of delay was reasserted in Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60, where Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ stated at 45: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the denial to an accused of the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides, constitutes a significant disadvantage which a judge must recognise and to which an unmistakable and firm voice must be given by appropriate directions.” 
        
       
       
      Including, in that case, a direction that: 
       
       
        
        “… it would be dangerous to convict on the complainant’s evidence alone without the closest scrutiny of the complainant’s evidence.” 
        
       
      
    61    The trial judge did not give any such direction. In my opinion, the direction was required. There was no corroboration. The case turned on the credit of the complainants. There was a significant delay in the making of formal complaint and earlier complaints (if the jury accepted them) were not acted upon. NRD said that he was subject to assaults on occasions when other members of the family were not home; or were watching TV, or when JMD was out playing or at his godparents’ home. The difficulties in the appellant meeting the specifics of such allegations are obvious. In my opinion, the failure to give an adequate direction on this aspect of the case also requires that there be a new trial.  
     
      
    62    Counsel at trial did not seek a direction under s 165. However, the inconsistencies in NRD’s evidence, particularly in relation to complaint, were such as required the judge to give a warning which encompassed the type of matters specified in s 165(2). In particular, he should have warned the jury that NRD’s evidence may be unreliable, pointed out for them the matters which might cause the evidence to be unreliable and given a warning to the jury of the need for caution in assessing whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Unsafe and Unsatisfactory 
       
      
    63    Ground 2 was expressed in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “That the verdicts of the jury are … unsafe and unsatisfactory.” 
        
       
      
    64    The appellant contended that his convictions involved a miscarriage of justice because they were against the evidence and the weight of the evidence. In particular, it was submitted that neither complainant could be relied upon as honest, truthful or reliable so as to establish the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    65    In written submissions, counsel for the appellant analysed the evidence by reference to a number of categories, which, it was claimed, demonstrated the inherent improbability of the evidence as truthful or reliable. Those categories were: 
     
      
       
      (i) the improbable accounts of each complainant and the absence of any corroborative evidence; 
       
       
      (ii) the delay in complaint by each complainant (indicating that the complaints were fabricated); 
       
       
      (iii) NRD’s reputation as a person who confabulated;  
       
       
      (iv) the fact that each complainant had a motive to lie; and  
       
       
      (v) the significant contradictions between the evidence of NRD and every other Crown witness. 
       
      
    66    Before dealing with the evidence relied upon to establish this ground, the legal basis upon which it was put forward should be identified. 
     
      
    67    Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the case was one where the improbability of the accounts, given the inconsistencies in the evidence, the motive to lie and the delay were so obvious that this Court would, by reading the transcript, “be satisfied for itself that there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction”: see R v M (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 at 378. Senior counsel submitted that this approach was permitted by R v Jones (1997) 191 CLR 439. That case in fact involved inconsistent verdicts. However, it was submitted that here, as in Jones, the Court could assess for itself the credibility and cogency of the evidence from the transcript so as to “ask itself whether … upon the whole of the evidence it is open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty”. The circumstances in which an appellate court may so act were stated by the majority in M at 494: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice has occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making a full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” 
        
       
       
      It was submitted that this case was one which fell within the precepts in  
      M 
      .  
       
      
    68    In dealing with the arguments advanced in support of this ground, it is convenient to deal first with the ‘category’ motive to lie and then with the other categories together. 
     
      
       
      Motive to Lie  
       
      
    69    It was contended on behalf of the appellant that each complainant had a motive to lie. In NRD’s case two motives were advanced: one, that it would have some positive effect on his mother’s property settlement, his mother and the appellant having separated in 1995; and two, as a way of obtaining victim’s compensation. In JMD’s case, the mother’s property settlement and a desire to get back at the appellant for his authoritarian behaviour were relied upon, although in one set of submissions, the appellant contended that both complainants were seeking to avenge themselves on him because of his authoritarian attitude. 
     
      
    70    NRD said he was aware his mother and the appellant had separated a few weeks after it happened and that he also knew there were divorce proceedings in 1997. He said however that he was not aware at that time that there was a property dispute and did not know there was any dispute prior to going to the police in 1997. He agreed in cross-examination that JMD told him about a dispute between their mother and the appellant over the sum of $5,000, but said he had also heard of a dispute over $250,000 “so I don’t know what’s going on”. 
     
      
    71    JMD said he was not aware in 1997 that there were property disputes between his mother and the complainant although he knew there were divorce proceedings. His cross-examination on this issue continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q I am suggesting that you have brought up these allegations in September 1997 because you thought it might assist your mother in relation to property disputes that existed between her and your stepfather? 
        
       
       
        
        A Why would I care about the property dispute? I have nothing to gain out of it, so why would I care about it? No, that’s a lie. I deny it, your Honour.  
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q You say you haven’t brought these allegations up to assist your mother? 
        
       
       
        
        A As far as I know, even if he went to gaol he still gets a property settlement anyway so its not going to help anyway.” 
        
       
      
    72    Ms D’s evidence on this issue is also relevant. She said that sometime around the time of the divorce (the decree nisi was made in May 1997 and became absolute in June 1997) the appellant told her he wished to have a property settlement. She said to her recollection nothing then happened for about twelve months when the appellant filed a property application. She said at that time she sought legal advice from her solicitor Andrew Swift. It was her understanding that the criminal proceedings had no relevance to the property proceedings. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have been given very clear advice by Andrew Swift that the proceedings in this Court have absolutely no bearing on any property matters at all. The Family Court will not take any notice.” 
        
       
      
    73    She denied that she had used the criminal proceedings as a means of delaying the property settlement although she conceded she had given an affidavit in those proceedings stating the criminal proceedings had caused her “unbelievable distress” and that she understood her solicitor had said at the conciliation conference relating to the property settlement that she was too distressed to continue with the conciliation matter. Her understanding, however, was that the property proceedings were “undergoing due process in the Family Court”. 
     
      
    74    The appellant relied upon the property settlement at trial and again on appeal as providing a motive for each of the complainants to lie. He was entitled to do so and it was a matter for the jury to determine if they accepted that was the case or not. It is clear from the verdicts they did not. This is not surprising. The attack made on each of the complainants and on Ms D in cross-examination on this issue failed, in my opinion, to produce any real comfort to the appellant. 
     
      
    75    The potential entitlement to receive a substantial sum (up to $50,000) by way of victim’s compensation was, potentially, forensically more powerful. NRD said that, although he had been told in relation to an unconnected matter he had the possibility of getting $50,000 as compensation as a victim of crime, it did not occur to him that he might be able to likewise benefit if he made allegations against the appellant. That was a matter for the jury to assess. Again it is clear from the verdicts that they did not accept the appellant’s case on this issue. That course was open to them and taken on its own there is nothing remarkable in the jury accepting NRD’s denial that that was the reason for him making these allegations. 
     
      
    76    The same is to be said in relation to the contention that JMD (or both complainants) had a motive to get back at the appellant for being so authoritarian. JMD was not directly challenged in cross-examination that he had such a motive although he agreed the appellant was authoritarian. NRD was not cross-examined on this at all. Even if it could be said that this particular matter was properly before the jury two things must be said. First, such a motive is less likely in my opinion than the potential for financial reward. Secondly, in any event, it was a jury issue. 
     
      
    77    There was another basis for motivation to lie put to JMD in cross-examination, namely that he wanted to excuse his own bad behaviour. He was cross-examined in particular about an incident of alleged assault in 1989. A series of questions were asked seeking to establish that, at about that time, he was in trouble at school. He had been suspended on a number of occasions and had punched a younger boy. He was then cross-examined in detail about having deliberately run over the cord of the electric lawn mower because he did not want to mow the lawn. He agreed that was correct. He identified that day as being an occurrence of one of the relationship assaults. He was cross-examined as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q See, the whole of this story about this event happening in 1989 is invented to excuse your behaviour in smashing the lawn mower, wasn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        A Why do I have to excuse my behaviour in smashing the lawn mower? I mean, explain to me why. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q It is being put to you -- 
        
       
       
        
        A Well, that’s a lie your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        Q --you invented this incident to excuse you for it? 
        
       
       
        
        A Why would I do such a thing? No, that’s a blatant lie. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You deny it, you say it wasn’t? 
        
       
       
        
        A Why would I - yeah, why would I do it? I mean, what do I care about a lawn mower for? I mean -- 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q … I am suggesting to you … that if you did something wrong, you had a habit of blaming -- 
        
       
       
        
        A Hold on. 
        
       
       
        
        Q The other person? 
        
       
       
        
        A Like, let’s put this in perspective. You are saying because I broke the lawn mower, let me get my head around this, because I broke the lawn mower I fabricated this huge story about this. Wake up to yourself. I put myself through all this torment over a lawn mower? If Mum was really worried about it, I would buy her a new lawn mower tomorrow. I have put myself through all this torment, nearly split up my marriage, over a lawn mower. Where did you get your qualifications, out of a Weetbix box?” 
        
       
      
    78    His Honour called a short adjournment at this point. 
     
      
    79    This evidence is also relevant to the importance of demeanour in this case, to which I shall refer shortly. But again, it was a jury question whether they accepted JMD refutation of the suggested motivation or not. 
     
      
    80    In my opinion, this category of evidence provides little, if any, support to the unsafe and unsatisfactory ground. 
     
      
       
       
      Improbable Accounts: Delay in Complaint; Fabricated Evidence; Tendency to Confabulate; Inconsistent Evidence Amongst the Various Witnesses 
       
      
    81    As these ‘categories’ are all directed to specific aspects of credibility it is convenient to deal with them together.  
     
      
    82    It was submitted that, given the extensive period over which NRD alleged he had been assaulted, it was extraordinary that there was no evidence of him being noticeably upset, being overheard to cry or being reluctant to stay in the appellant’s company and no evidence that he complained or sought help. It was further submitted that the incidents took place in circumstances where there was a high risk of detection and that they could have been easily avoided by the complainants. It was said that the incidents involving NRD “were so brazen and so easily avoided by him (yet he apparently did little to avoid them)”.  
     
      
    83    It was submitted that it was improbable that NRD would not have stayed out of the house if the assaults occurred at all, let alone with the frequency alleged. It was also submitted that the basic theme of NRD’s evidence was that the assaults came to fit a pattern. An examination of that evidence showed, however, that there were significant variations in the alleged complaints, so as to make it unlikely that NRD’s evidence was true. Again a number of examples were given, such as the fact that sometimes condoms were used and sometimes they were not; he said he did not know where the condoms came from, yet in cross examination he said they were contained in a black bag under the appellant’s bed; sometimes NRD’s sister and, on other occasions, the whole family were at home yet the allegation was that the appellant tended to take advantage of NRD when no one else was at home. 
     
      
    84    It was also submitted that there was the absence of detail, when detail might have been expected. For example, neither complainant was sure whether the appellant was circumcised although JMD said he thought he was not. The Crown pointed out, however, that although the appellant gave evidence, he did not give evidence as to whether he was circumcised, as he presumably would have done, if JMD’s recollection was wrong.  
     
      
    85    In the case of JMD, it was said that he could have physically resisted the appellant and, on his account, had done so on one occasion, when he was about 13. It was therefore improbable that he did not resist the appellant on later occasions when the appellant allegedly assaulted him, particularly when JMD was a physically fit youth. There was evidence he was a member of the Australian gridiron football team.  
     
      
    86    In my opinion, these were all matters which the jury were entitled to assess in determining whether the complainants’ evidence should be accepted. However, it is not without relevance that these assaults were sexual in nature and commenced when the complainants were young children. The degree of maturity, knowledge, resilience and self reliance with which, it is implied in this submission, the complainants should have acted, is somewhat unrealistic, given their ages and family circumstances. This is particularly demonstrated by the complainants’ evidence in relation to failure to complain.  
     
      
    87    Having given evidence of the events which gave rise to the first three counts, NRD said the appellant told him he would “kill” him if he told anyone. NRD said he believed him because he used to hit them a fair bit. His sister was asleep during this incident and JMD was away. The incident ceased when his sister woke up crying and the appellant blamed NRD for waking her up. He said he was “too young and too scared” to tell anyone. He was aged 7 at the time and was in second class at school. He said his reason for doing as the appellant told him in relation to the second incident was because he “didn’t want to get belted”. His evidence remained consistent as to being scared of the appellant. The appellant admitted he hit the complainants with the cord from an electric jug. He said this only happened two to three times a year and only if all else failed (for example grounding, withdrawing pocket money, not allowing them to watch television or to play with their friends). He also said he smacked them “as soft as I could manage”. 
     
      
    88    NRD gave similar evidence as to why he didn’t complain to anyone at school. He said that he did not tell anyone at school when he discovered he was bleeding after one of the assaults because he was “too scared”; that he and his brother both got into a bit of trouble at school; that he knew what would happen to him if he told anyone; that he was too scared to say anything. 
     
      
    89    He described the incidents as “just [becoming] a set routine” and said he had no one to talk to about it - his mother was away at that time. He said there was nothing he could do about it to stop it. 
     
      
    90    He said he told his brother JMD that the appellant was “a faggot” but that JMD did not believe him so he did not tell him what was happening and when said “he didn’t believe me about that … I just got too scared to tell him what had been happening”. 
     
      
    91    This conversation probably occurred in 1986, although NRD also said that he told JMD this repeatedly. It was submitted that if the conversation had occurred, it would be extraordinary if JMD did not believe him, because by this time, JMD had come to realise that the appellant was homosexual.  
     
      
    92    JMD’s evidence about his awareness of the appellant’s sexual orientation began in 1987 (he thought that was the year) when the appellant took him into a room and asked him “did I want to learn what you did about sex”. He said that on this occasion the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… that when he was at school he would like boys and I said, ‘Oh, I like boys as well’ and then he said, no, he liked them in a different way.” 
        
       
      
    93    He said that when the appellant said that he, JMD: 
     
      
       
        
        “Had a fair inkling what he was talking about, that he, you know, I thought he was gay straight away or a poofter, that is what I would have thought.” 
        
       
      
    94    JMD’s evidence as to whether NRD told him the appellant was “a faggot” does not precisely reflect what NRD said, particularly as to the language used. However, JMD said there were conversations with NRD about incidents involving the appellant. JMD said that NRD would be “yelling and screaming” and would saying something like “he’d done it”, “he’d fucked me”, “things like that”. He said however that NRD was not “very coherent” in these conversations. He also said he did not pursue the complaints because: 
     
      
       
        
        “A … I don’t know, I just didn’t think it was the appropriate time. Didn’t really want to talk about it either. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Why didn’t you want to talk about it? 
        
       
       
        
        A It was something I tried to suppress. … I tried to keep it all out of my mind.” 
        
       
      
    95    This is how JMD appears to have always dealt with NRD’s complaints right up until 1997. For example, when asked about complaints during the period 1992 - 1997 he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I’ve stated, there were a few ramblings that he’d said but I just took it to say that he was off his head or something like that.” 
        
       
      
    96    JMD also pointed out that the family was not close. He gave evidence that he had not wanted to invite his brother to his wedding, that he had little contact with him after he left home, and he wanted to get on with his own life.  
     
      
    97    Although the appellant sought to make something of the fact that NRD did not complain to anyone at home (it being alleged he made no complaints to JMD) and did not appear upset after these assaults, the fact is NRD experienced considerable difficulty both at home and at school. The appellant sought to rely on this fact to undermine NRD’s credibility and to attack his character. However, it is clear from a reading of the transcript that this was a two-edged sword for the appellant. On the one hand it might have demonstrated that NRD was a devious individual who lied, stole and had been in a lot of trouble and therefore was someone who should not be believed. On the other hand, his conduct may well have been explained by the conduct of the appellant towards him. NRD left home at the age of 14 after an argument with the appellant during which, he said, the appellant told him that his mother did not want him at home and she would never believe him if he told her of the assaults. He said he was “pretty upset about it all” and “took a whole bunch of pills” and ended up in hospital. He said he felt he had lost all his family, his mother did not want him any more and she had not come looking for him and he believed what the appellant told him. 
     
      
    98    He agreed in cross-examination that he had used a false name when he went to the refuge (where he first went when he left home) and although he had seen his mother and brother in the shopping centre a few days later he had run away from them. He was cross-examined about the “story” he had given concerning where he got the tablets from on which he attempted to overdose. He agreed that when he overdosed on prescription migraine pills in 1992 he told doctors, staff and social workers about a variety of matters (including that his brother had been given $5,000 to go overseas by his mother, which was true). He agreed, however, that he did not “tell a single one of [them] you’d been sexually assaulted, let alone by your stepfather”. He sought to explain his position as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I’m pretty sure I didn’t tell them, its like why I didn’t tell them about the pills”. 
        
       
      
    99    However, NRD had given evidence that his life had been ruined because of what the appellant had done to him. Again he was challenged that he had fabricated these allegations “in order to justify your own bad behaviour”. He responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, I mean, why would I do that? Who do I have to justify it to?” 
        
       
      
    100    Not only was NRD’s credit attacked, so was his character. He was cross-examined about drug taking, drunkenness, stealing money to buy drugs, about being in trouble with the police and about having a criminal record, all of which were true. It was also put to him in cross-examination that he had been expelled from a couple of schools, that his “own bad behaviour” had been the cause of his running away from home, from school and from the refuge.  
     
      
    101    It was suggested that he had made up these allegations so that he might be able to get $50,000 as a victim of crime. He refuted that allegation. It was suggested he had colluded with his brother, which he denied and that making these allegations might put him in his mother’s “good books”. He responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “A Why would I want to be in the good books with her. I don’t speak to her. 
        
       
       
        
        Q That may be one reason, maybe things would settle down? 
        
       
       
        
        A I haven’t spoken to her for a while but that’s my choosing. Why would I want to speak to her. If she’d done her job properly as a mum I wouldn’t be here now.” 
        
       
      
    102    Again, for the reasons already given (see para 97) it seems to me that these attacks on NRD, although legitimate, carried a significant risk for the appellant. 
     
      
    103    Another area of significant attack made on the credit of both complainant’s was in respect of complaint. The appellant submitted that it was: 
     
      
       
        
        “difficult to escape the very strong possibility that [NRD] fabricated evidence of complaint to a number of people. It is also clear that his family, particularly his brother and mother were of the view that [NRD] was capable of making wild and incoherent allegations. … he had ‘mood swings’ for which he was seeking professional assistance. He had a history of dishonesty, anti-social and illegal behaviour. The evidence tends to establish he had a tendency to confabulate.” 
        
       
      
    104    JMD gave evidence of two assaults, one in 1983 and one in 1985, which were the subject of counts 10 and 11. He also gave evidence of two other assaults, one in 1987 and the other in 1989, to which I have referred earlier. These were admitted as relationship evidence. 
     
      
    105    He first complained, on his evidence, to his mother after the 1989 incident when he left a note in her lunch box. That complaint related only to the incident the previous day. He made no other complaint until 1997. It was submitted that JMD failed to explain why he did not complain at that time about the earlier incidents, which touched upon his credibility and upon the probability of his allegations both truthful and reliable.  
     
      
    106    In my opinion, JMD gave evidence which explained his failure to complain which was open to the jury to accept. In relation to the 1987 incident he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Did you tell your Mum what had happened to you? 
        
       
       
        
        A No, still hadn’t told her. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And at that stage, why didn’t you tell her what had happened? 
        
       
       
        
        A Just shame, just shamed about it all. How can you tell your Mum someone - like, she was happy at this stage. We had watched her as kids being upset, with no father, she had struggled to support us and everything and she was happy, you know, you can’t tell her - we didn’t want to make her unhappy. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q And was there anyone at school that you felt you could tell about what had happened? 
        
       
       
        
        A No, its just not the sort of thing I wanted to talk about, you know. In hindsight, great, there was probably a counsellor I could have spoken to but I spent my whole time getting into trouble, not thinking about how I could sort things out.” 
        
       
      
    107    He said that after the 1989 incident he was scared and could not sleep. He said he thought he “had to tell [his mother] but [he] couldn’t tell her to her face” because he was “just so ashamed about it … I didn’t know what to say”. He explained that his mother was “a very hard to approach person”. Ms D gave evidence. The jury, therefore, had an opportunity to assess whether JMD’s view about his mother was likely to be accurate.  
     
      
    108    The appellant also relied upon the discrepancy between JMD’s evidence that he complained in 1989 when he put a note in his mother’s lunch box, whereas Ms D placed this as having occurred in 1990. For my part, I doubt whether a jury would place a great deal of importance on the difference in the dates in respect of this incident. What was important was the account each gave about it. In that regard, there were some discrepancies but significant correlation. Again it was a jury question. It is worth commenting at that point that the mother’s reaction to the complaint provides another reason why JMD might have been reluctant to complain to her again, or at all. She told JMD that he and the appellant would have to work out who was telling the truth and she would either report JMD for creating a public nuisance or the appellant for sexual assault. 
     
      
    109    JMD also explained why he said nothing to his mother when she called him in 1997 and told him NRD had made a statement to police: 
     
      
       
        
        “At first I wasn’t going to make a statement. I was getting on with my life and thought I was over it all and quite happy with my life.” 
        
       
      
    110    He said he changed his mind after being contacted by police because he was “tormented”. He continued, “I thought I was over it but obviously its still there”. He was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q You’re now 24 years of age. Now, after this period of time, how do you feel about what your stepfather had done to you? 
        
       
       
        
        A Well, it’s wrong. I go to counselling for it all and that seems to be helping. Now I think I’m starting to be over it and starting to realise it wasn’t my fault and I’m not the only one in the whole world. At first I thought it was such a shameful thing; I must have asked for it. But now it seems that it is quite a common thing and I’m not the only one.” 
        
       
      
    111    The other significant area relied on in relation to complaint and discrepancies was in relation to NRD’s evidence of complaint made to counsellors.  
     
      
    112    In his evidence in chief, NRD said he had seen a number of different counsellors. He said he was seen by a female counsellor, whose name he could not recall. He said he told her his stepfather had been assaulting him and he was told “it was something I should try and forget about and to get on with my life”. 
     
      
    113    He said that about this time he was placed in foster care. He said that he saw Sue Ryan, a counsellor from DOCS, and was “pretty sure [he] had mentioned” the assaults to her. In cross-examination he said that he was “sure she knew about it”; “I don’t know if I complained but we spoke about it” but she effectively brushed it aside. He also spoke to his mother at about this time but she said she did not believe him. He said his mother had actually raised the topic and said it never happened.  
     
      
    114    NRD also saw a school counsellor at Orange High School. However, he did not say anything in his evidence in chief about making a complaint to that counsellor. Initially, in cross-examination, he said he did not tell him. NRD’s evidence at the committal hearing was then put to him. That evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q And you complained to a counsellor at Orange High School? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yep but I only saw the one counsellor in relation to this. The other counsellors I told them but I had to see them for something else. They decided that my drug problems I had to go and see a counsellor for. 
        
       
       
        
        Q So the counsellors you saw were people referred by Family Services in Canberra? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q One of them is a school counsellor at Orange High School? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And one of them was Sue Ryan? 
        
       
       
        
        A Mm, mm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And to each of these people you made a compliant(sic) of being repeatedly sexually assaulted, is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A I don’t know if I said repeatedly. All I said was ‘I was sexually assaulted by my stepfather’ and they were like, oh well brush that aside.” 
        
       
      
    115    NRD then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A Yeah, we spoke. I didn’t come up and say this happened and this happened and this happened but we spoke about different things, about problems I was having with it, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You said you’d been sexually assaulted when you’d spoken to that person? 
        
       
       
        
        A I said I’d been assaulted, yeah.” 
        
       
      
    116    He was also cross-examined about his evidence at the committal that he complained to a male counsellor that he had been sexually assaulted, a matter he did not refer to in his evidence in chief: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yeah, we spoke about what happened. I didn’t say this happened and this happened and this happened. What I said was I was having problems sleeping at night. What else - you know just various different things like that. You’ve probably got the notes in front of you and can read them yourself that he would have taken.” 
        
       
      
    117    NRD also mentioned that he had seen an “Open Family Counsellor”. He stated that he thought the counsellor’s name was Ted but he could not “really remember”. NRD did not say in his evidence in chief whether he had told Ted that he had been assaulted. In cross-examination he stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, I didn’t tell him. I didn’t come up and say, ‘This is what happened to me’, no. We talked around it, but I didn’t say this happened, this happened, and this happened and this happened.” 
        
       
      
    118    NRD was then cross-examined about his committal evidence in which he stated that he had “complained to” Ted but had told him he “didn’t want it to go further … [and] .. said [he] didn’t want anything … done about it”.  
     
      
    119    Following these comments, NRD was asked in re-examination: 
     
      
       
        
        “… you were asked about whether you told him about being sexually assault ‘No, I didn’t say this is what happened to me. We talked around it’? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Did you ever outline as you’ve done for us, all the things that had happened to you?” 
        
       
      
    120    He answered, “no”. 
     
      
    121    It was submitted that NRD’s evidence was internally inconsistent and that when challenged with the committal proceedings evidence he gradually enlarged his evidence to say he had complained to four counsellors and that “when … confronted with the proposition none of these complaints had been made he refused to answer and left the court”.  The transcript records the following to have occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q I suggest that these - what you’re putting is that there’s been a whole series of people to whom you said that you’d been sexually assaulted by your stepfather and you said that you complained to them in 1992 and that’s just not true, is it? 
        
       
       
        
        A It is. 
        
       
       
        
        Q None of those complaints were made, were they? 
        
       
       
        
        A (No verbal answer.) 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Just answer the question. You say you spoke to those people? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah I did. I’ve just answered that. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Just answer the questions, that’s all. 
        
       
       
        
        A I want a break. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Wait a minute, just sit down, please. Members of the jury, I think we will take a morning adjournment now and we will adjourn. Would you leave the witness box [NRD], please? 
        
       
       
        
        A How many times do I have to answer the same question? What do you do, go home and jerk off over it?” 
        
       
      
    122    The trial judge then explained to NRD, in the absence of the jury, that he understood how distressing the proceedings were but the barrister was entitled to ask certain questions. NRD responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I can answer that. It’s when he said that never happened; the same question over.” 
        
       
      
    123    After a short adjournment the cross-examination continued. 
     
      
    124    There was no doubt the appellant’s counsel had managed to create inconsistencies in NRD’s evidence. Having done so, counsel for the appellant then sought to use NRD’s behaviour to underscore that his evidence was inherently unreliable. This particular attack in cross-examination was undoubtedly a moment of great tension in the trial. But contrary to the appellant’s submission, this was not an incident which unequivocally pointed to NRD being a confabulator. NRD’s reaction was of such a nature that it could too have been assessed by the jury in one of two ways: either as impugning NRD’s credit or as a factor which pointed to him being a witness of credit. Either way, it was a matter for the jury to assess. What can be said, however, is that this incident was a palpable demonstration that demeanour must have played a part, and probably a very significant part in the jury’s assessment of the various witnesses.  
     
      
    125    Other parts of the cross-examination point to the importance of demeanour in the case. For example, at the commencement of the third day of giving evidence, NRD’s credit was immediately attacked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q … these allegations, all of them, about sexual assault by your stepfather, they are a total fabrication, they are made up, aren’t they? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And this is an act that you bunged on to draw attention to yourself, isn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And when you were in the witness box the other day giving evidence-in-chief, you were play acting, weren’t you? I will be specific, the shaking hands, the sniffling nose, that was an act, wasn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Designed to attract sympathy to yourself? 
        
       
       
        
        A (No verbal answer). 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q Would you answer this question, it is being put to you it is an act to draw sympathy to yourself? 
        
       
       
        
        A No.” 
        
       
      
    126    This cross-examination was vigorous and NRD obviously reacted to it adversely by not answering the question, requiring the judge’s intervention.  
     
      
    127    There was another occasion that day where the following exchange took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q … I suggest that you have made that up and the reason there is a confusion about these dates 1989 and 1992 is because you can’t remember a lot of the things that you told the police? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q What is your answer to that, sorry? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Sorry? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. It’s not true. I mean, we were interrupted by my brother once. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: All right, just answer the question. 
        
       
       
        
        WITNESS: This is really annoying, I should just get a tape recorder and leave it saying, ‘No, no, no’.” 
        
       
      
    128    JMD’s response to his cross-examination in respect of the lawn mower incident (para 77) provides another illustration of the importance of demeanour in this case. 
     
      
    129    There are other inconsistencies relied upon to demonstrate that it was unreasonable of the jury to find that the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence relating to the counselling session with Susan Ryan was an example. 
     
      
    130    I have already referred to NRD’s evidence in respect of the counselling sessions. JMD recalled being present on one occasion with NRD and his mother at a counselling session with Susan Ryan. He said they were there to try and work out “problems in the family between [NRD] and I think it was Mum”. He said that the meeting lasted about three minutes. He described what happened in the meeting: 
     
      
       
        
        “A … Mum was yelling at Sue, Sue was yelling at Mum, [NRD] was yelling at everybody. I was just watching this screaming match going on. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Do you remember anything that [NRD] said during that? 
        
       
       
        
        A Not at all. It was just noise, just yelling, screaming, he was calling Mum a bitch and Mum was saying it’s not her fault and just everything. 
        
       
       
        
        Q What about Sue Ryan, do you remember anything she was saying? 
        
       
       
        
        A She was blaming Mum mostly, that’s all I could see. She was a very pro person, children have rights, that is what I gathered from what she was saying. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q How did that meeting come to an end? 
        
       
       
        
        A Mum walked out and I walked out and I think NRD walked out as well.” 
        
       
      
    131    Ms D said she believed JMD came to one of the meetings with Susan Ryan and she believed it was the one where NRD raised the sexual assault. 
     
      
    132    She described the conferences generally with Susan Ryan as involving NRD making a lot of allegations against her - how she had favoured the other two children over him; against JMD - that he had bashed him up; and against the appellant having “beaten him up and … assaulted him … I understood he had made a statement that indicated he had been sexually assaulted by [the appellant]”. She went on to describe her own confusion at the time. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[I] believed because he made some many statements. Susan Ryan, and I have the impression that she gave me, to understand that he was saying whatever he could think of saying to get back at me, that he was upset, distressed and certainly he wouldn’t return home. I carried that impression and that inability to understand or to determine what was correct and what wasn’t correct right up until 1997 when [NRD] rang me and told me he was going to make a police statement.” 
        
       
      
    133    Susan Ryan had no recollection of NRD having told her that he had been sexually assaulted nor did her file have any notation to that effect. She said the law in the Australian Capital Territory at that time required her to make a note of and report such disclosures. 
     
      
    134    Although the evidence of each does not correspond precisely with the evidence of the others and JMD’s evidence, in particular, does not correspond, I do not think the evidence of NRD, JMD and Ms D is inconsistent or in conflict. If the conference occurred as JMD described it, it was quite possible he did not hear or comprehend what had been said about the sexual assault. Ms D’s evidence supports the view the conference was volatile. Ms Ryan’s evidence, however, is inconsistent and it was a matter for the jury to determine whether they accepted her or NRD. It should be noted that even if the jury did accept Ms Ryan on the question of complaint, that would not necessarily have been fatal to the Crown case. Complaint is not an ingredient of any of the offences with which the appellant was charged.  
     
      
    135    Another incident relied on by the appellant to demonstrate NRD could not be believed occurred in 1992 when NRD alleged another assault. After that he and the appellant went to pick up his sister at the shopping centre. He said that he told the appellant that he was going to tell his mother what had occurred. He said they had a “big argument” in the shopping centre which continued on in the car. He said the appellant stopped the car and told him to get out and not bother coming back. He then went to a refuge. He said he returned home a few days later to collect some clothes and had another argument with the appellant. NRD gave evidence that as he was leaving, the appellant said to him “that [his] Mum would never believe [him] if [he] told her and she didn’t want [him] there anyway”. 
     
      
    136    His sister’s recollection of that incident was that it involved an argument over oatmeal biscuits. She did not hear any argument concerning whether NRD was going to complain to their mother. Again, whilst it was appropriate for the appellant’s counsel to make a forensic point about this discrepancy, this incident does not, of itself, advance the appellant’s case. The jury may have considered that S was too young at the time to appreciate the import of the argument. As she was seated in the back seat, they may have decided that she did not hear everything that was said. They may have considered that NRD was wrong in respect of the incident, but still accepted his evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in respect of the nine assaults with which the appellant was charged. Whatever view they came to, it was a matter for them to assess.  
     
      
    137    The above summary of the evidence does not encompass the whole of the evidence or all of the evidence to which counsel referred in written and oral submissions. However, it is a sufficient exposition to demonstrate that the second ground of appeal must fail. The evidence is such that, rather than coming to a conclusion that a jury must have had a reasonable doubt about the evidence, one is left with the overwhelming impression that this was a case where the appellant’s counsel, having set out to discredit both complainants, was left in a position where their demeanour must have played an important role in the jury’s assessment of their credit. As such, the case is not one which invites appellate interference on the basis that it is apparent from the transcript that a jury would have a real doubt as to the guilt of the accused: R v M. It must be said that to the extent that demeanour can be gleaned from the transcript, there were significant parts of the evidence of both complainants which a jury might have found compelling. The verdicts of guilty indicates that this jury must have so found it.  
     
      
    138    In the result, the appellant has succeeded in establishing that the trial judge’s directions were inadequate and accordingly there should be a new trial.  
     
      
    139    I propose the following Orders:  
     
      
       
      (i) Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      (ii) The convictions and sentences on all counts to be quashed. 
       
       
      (iii) Order that there be a new trial on all counts. 
       
      
    140    GREG JAMES J: I agree with Beazley JA. 
     
      
    141    KIRBY J: I agree with Beazley JA.

     REGINA v Elie EL-YOUSSEF  
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    BARR J: I agree with Carruthers AJ. 
     
      
    2    CARRUTHERS AJ: Elie El-Youssef seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him by Judge O’Reilly QC at the Liverpool District Court on 15 December 1998. 
     
      
    3    The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to an indictment containing five counts of robbery in company under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, 1900 (the Act). His Honour also took into account, at the applicant’s request, four offences of robbery in company by way of a prescribed Form 1. 
     
      
    4    His Honour imposed, on the first count, an overall sentence of ten years imprisonment with a minimum term of seven years to commence on 26 May 1998 and to expire on 25 May 2005 and an additional term of three years to commence on 26 May 2005. With regard to counts 2 to 5, his Honour imposed concurrent fixed terms of seven years imprisonment to commence on 26 May 1998 and to expire on 25 May 2005. The Form 1 matters were taken into account in passing sentence on the first count. 
     
      
    5    His Honour found special circumstances for the purposes of s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 based upon the applicant’s perceived need for a full three years of parole supervision “to help him settle down and make absolutely certain he has dealt with his drug problem.” This perceived need for extended supervision was not challenged by the applicant in this Court. 
     
      
    6    The maximum penalty prescribed for the subject offence is twenty years imprisonment. 
     
      
    7    The applicant was born in Spain on 16 October 1966 and arrived in Australia with his parents in about 1970. His father died in 1986 and his mother is still alive but, unfortunately, because of a stroke, she is now a paraplegic with little or no speech. 
     
      
    8    The applicant obtained the Higher School Certificate and, having found employment with the State Rail Authority, became a Track Engineer which is a responsible position. 
     
      
    9    However, in 1988 he suffered a severe injury to his left knee which rendered him unfit to continue his employment with the Rail Authority, and it is said that this became a catalyst for his future criminal activity. 
     
      
    10    The knee injury left him with continuing pain which, it is further said, led to addiction to narcotic substances. 
     
      
    11    The applicant contends that he committed the subject offences to obtain funds to support this addiction which at the time of the offences was costing him $200 per day. I note that there was a pre-sentence report dated 8 December 1998 before his Honour under the hand of Peter Lewis, Probation and Parole Officer, which states “he [the applicant] suggested the money he had obtained from the offences was spent on the purchase of drugs and gambling.” 
     
      
    12    Prior to the subject matters, the applicant had served a sentence by way of a fixed term of six months imprisonment in 1995 for stealing and a further fixed term of twelve months between October 1995 and October 1996 for larceny. 
     
      
    13    On 23 October 1995 the applicant was sentenced to a minimum term of eighteen months to commence on 23 October 1995 and an additional term of twelve months to commence on 23 April 1997 and to expire on 22 April 1998. This was with respect to a conviction at the Sydney District Court for break, enter and steal. 
     
      
    14    The applicant had been admitted to parole on 23 April 1997 and thus was on parole during the commission of the subject series of offences, with the exception of the last offence, which was committed on 28 April 1998. 
     
      
    15    His Honour described this series of offences as “an enormous criminal enterprise”. No challenge could be made to this description. 
     
      
    16    Dealing first with the matters in the Indictment. They all involved robbery in company of banks in the western suburbs of Sydney. 
     
      
    17    As to count 1 which occurred on 16 December 1997, the applicant was in company with three co-offenders, one of whom was armed with a 9mm pistol. Count 2 occurred on 30 September 1997 and there was one co-offender who was armed with a 9 mm pistol. Count 3 occurred on 4 November 1997. The applicant was with one co-offender but neither was armed. Count 4 occurred on 17 March 1998. There was one co-offender armed with a small calibre pistol. Count 5 occurred on 28 April 1998 when the applicant was in company with one co-offender who was armed with a knife. This was the most serious of the offences. 
     
      
    18    A total sum of $233,866 was taken and only a modest sum was recovered when the applicant was arrested. On all occasions the applicant and his co-offenders were disguised and members of the staff of the various banks were threatened. The money was generally shared equally, it would appear, between the co-offenders. The maximum stolen from one bank was $108,794 (count 1). 
     
      
    19    The four matters on Form 1 involved three robberies in company of post offices in the suburbs and one offence involved the robbery of a bank. With the exception of that last-mentioned matter, which occurred on 17 November 1997, either the applicant or his co-offender was armed. 
     
      
    20    It is important to note the following remarks on sentence by his Honour: 
     
      
       
        
        “I looked at the section 97(1) statistics myself and found that in eighty eight cases the overall sentence ranged from three years to eight years. Plainly, where I am dealing with nine offences, one would be heading towards the top of that range. There was only one case where the overall sentence was fourteen years, and in only two per cent of cases was the overall sentence twelve years. So that is some guide to me. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Dalton makes the point that the plea of guilty has a considerable value, and indeed it has.” 
        
       
       
      
    21    It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that given the historical range of sentencing for offences of this type, the overall sentence is too severe in circumstances where a plea of guilty had been entered, as here, at an early stage of the proceedings. 
     
      
    22    It was said that the sentencing statistics supported an argument that an overall sentence in this case exceeding eight years would be considered excessive. 
     
      
    23    It was argued that, allowing for a discount to the order of fifteen per cent for the pleas of guilty, his Honour should be taken to have started by fixing an appropriate penalty, reflecting the objective criminality of the offences, at about 11.5 years. A discount of about fifteen per cent would reduce this to an overall head sentence of ten years. In starting at a figure of this magnitude, therefore, his Honour started his calculations at too high a point and, finished up with an overall sentence which was outside that appropriate for the offences committed, given the historical pattern of sentencing. 
     
      
    24    It was argued that “very serious though the offences were they did not fit into the worst category of case,” and an appropriate head sentence should not have exceeded seven years. 
     
      
    25    In support of the argument that these offences did not fall into a worst category of case, emphasis was placed (inter alia) upon the speed with which the robberies were carried out, and allegedly without infliction of extreme violence on staff and physical terror over a sustained period of time. 
     
      
    26    It is true that the offences were apparently in each case carried out with expedition but this may be accounted for by the professional manner in which they were executed and the understandable reluctance of members of the banks’ staff to resist the demands which were made upon them. In three cases a pistol was involved and, in the fourth, a knife described as a Rambo style knife with a blade about 15 to 20 cm in length with a serrated edge. 
     
      
    27    In my view these offences clearly fell within “a worst category of cases” and the fact that no staff member was physically injured does not exclude, by any means, the possibility of a severe psychological reaction to some of them. 
     
      
    28    It is now well known that the major banks are required to have counsellors available at all times to assist bank staff who have been traumatised by armed robberies or robberies in company or (as in this case) a combination of both. 
     
      
    29    It is well established that sentencing for offences of this nature involves a significant deterrent factor. 
     
      
    30    A number of significant factors were also relied upon by the applicant including the fact that he co-operated with the investigating police after his arrest but not to the extent, perhaps understandably, of revealing the identities of his co-offenders. 
     
      
    31    It is not necessary to refer to the detail of the subjective material, although I do note that there was evidence that by reason of the applicant’s physical and emotional health he will have difficulty in adapting to a long period of incarceration. The subjective aspects of the case were carefully considered by his Honour. 
     
      
    32    No dispute, as I have indicated, arises in so far as the three year period of supervision allowed by his Honour. However, it was contended that his Honour erred because it would appear that, having resolved that a three years supervision period was necessary, his Honour increased the head sentence in order to accommodate that need. 
     
      
    33    Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that his Honour should have fixed an effective head sentence of seven years, with a minimum term of four years and an additional term of three years. 
     
      
    34    A significant matter is that the applicant was on parole at the time he committed (with one exception) this serious regime of offences. It is now well established that the sentencing regime should mark the gravity of the applicant’s conduct in abusing his parole: see, for example, R v Tran (1999) NSWCCA 109, para 15. 
     
      
    35    The applicant also suffers from the disadvantage of a history of prior serious criminal conduct. 
     
      
    36    Prior to counsel being retained for the applicant written submissions were filed by him with the Court. 
     
      
    37    I have given careful consideration to those submissions and the responses by the Crown to them. 
     
      
    38    In so far as the sentencing statistics are concerned, they really provide, at the most, marginal assistance in a case of this nature. The number of significant elements put the applicant in a very restricted class indeed. Firstly, there is the large number of subject offences, secondly, the fact that he has committed prior offences, thirdly, that (with one exception) he was on parole at the time of the commission of the subject offences and finally his age and the fact that he pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    39    The sentences were imposed prior to the judgment of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and, accordingly, the sentences were structured on the basis of the principle of totality. 
     
      
    40    I have little doubt that if his Honour had structured the sentences in accordance with the principles enunciated in Pearce that he would have achieved the same overall effect. 
     
      
    41    With regard to the paragraph in his Honour’s remarks on sentence which I have quoted in paragraph 19 above, I do not think that what his Honour there said has the effect of impugning the overall sentence and minimum term which he imposed. 
     
      
    42    The statistics to which his Honour was referring related to a far broader class of cases than the subject case but, in any event, I cannot accept that his Honour was, in that paragraph, committing himself to an overall sentence (prior to applying a discount for the pleas of guilty) to the order of eight years. 
     
      
    43    Despite the forceful arguments by Mr G Nicholson QC for the applicant I am unable to discern any error in his Honour’s reasoning. Further, I am unable to conclude, after balancing the objective and subjective circumstances, that the sentences were outside the discretion available to his Honour. 
     
      
    44    It is unnecessary to repeat that the offence of robbery, particularly in company and, or, with arms, is an offence of the utmost gravity: see R v Valentini (1989) 46 A Crim R 23. 
     
      
    45    I would propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted bearing in mind the length of the sentences imposed, but that the appeal be dismissed.

     DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS v FARR 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
    1   The Director of Public Prosecutions seeks an order pursuant to s.109(a) of the Justices Act 1902 quashing the order of a magistrate dismissing the informations laid against Karen Gail Farr for the offences of goods in custody, cultivate prohibited plants, supply prohibited drug and possess prohibited drug. The Director challenges two decisions of the magistrate, namely his ruling that certain admissions made by the defendant were inadmissible for not having been recorded in accordance with the provisions of s.424A of the Crimes Act 1900 and his further ruling that in the exercise of his discretion he would not admit certain evidence pursuant to s.138 of the Evidence Act 1995. The Director seeks to have the matters remitted to the magistrate for further hearing. 
    2   The prosecutions arose in the following way. According to the police Mrs Farr was driving along Anne Street Moree when her vehicle was stopped near Balo Street for the purpose of a random breath test. The vehicle was heavily loaded with large bags of onions, carrots and potatoes. After administering the breath test which was clear, Snr Const. Anderson asked what was the score with the vegetables and in reply ascertained that she had driven down from Gratton that day and was staying at a local motel with her boyfriend. Snr Const Fitzsimons went and used the police radio. Snr Const Anderson asked Mrs Farr to get out of the car although there is a dispute as to the point at which this happened. He saw that her pupils were enlarged and that her eyes were bloodshot and glazed. He said ""Have you taken any drugs, smoked anything?"" She replied ""No"" After telling her that he wanted to smell her breath, he leant forward and smelt her breath/face area. He smelt the distinct odour of cannabis smoke. Const. Anderson formed the opinion that Mrs Farr was mildly affected and showed the symptoms of cannabis use. He said ""You have smoked cannabis, I can smell it"". She replied ""No"". 
    3   After Const. Fitzsimons spoke to him Const Anderson said, amongst other things, ""… there are two drug related intelligence reports on you. Have you any drugs in the car?"" She said ""No"". Const Anderson said ""John, look at her, she has smoked some yarnie. I have reasonable cause to search the car for drugs and I intend to search it"". He asked her to stand in front of the car and ascertained that her boyfriend owned the car. 
    4   After verifying that the black carry bag on the front passenger side floor was that of Mrs Farr, the bag was placed on the roadway in front of her. Within the bag there were two plastic resealable bags containing green vegetable matter, a set of electronic scales and a large amount of cash in wads of twenty dollar notes and fifty dollar notes. Snr Const Anderson then arrested Mrs Farr for possession of prohibited drugs.  
    5   She was cautioned. Whilst holding a plastic resealable bag containing green vegetable matter this conversation allegedly occurred: 
     
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ""Anderson: Do you agree that this is cannabis? 
          
          Farr: Yeah 
          
         
        
        Anderson: How many grams? 
        
        Farr: Sixty. 
        
        
        Anderson: How much cash? 
        
        Farr: Around $2200 
        
        
        Anderson: You did smoke some cannabis didn't you? 
        
        Farr: Yeah, I had a smoke at a friend's place. 
        
        
        Anderson: Is this cannabis yours? 
        
        Farr: Yes 
        
        
        Anderson: Are these scales yours? 
        
        Farr: Yes."" 
       
      
    6   Mrs Farr was taken to the police station. On the way there in a police vehicle Snr Const Anderson confirmed with her that she understood that she was under arrest and that she understood her rights. He asked her ""Do you smoke much?"" She replied ""Yes, I'd rather smoke than drink or take powders, it is much less damaging"". There was other conversation of no consequence. She thought that ""speed was the real danger"". At the station the cash was counted and totalled $2750.7   Mrs Farr was interviewed by the police at the station and that interview was recorded. She agreed that about 9.50 pm she was driving a vehicle when she was stopped by police. She agreed that on the passenger side floor was a black bag owned by her. She was asked (Q39) ""Do you agree that this bag was searched and a quantity of cannabis was located in this bag … Do you agree that those two satchels (shown to her) of cannabis is the cannabis that was located in that black bag."" She replied ""Yes"". She said that she owned the cannabis. She also agreed that in the black bag was a large quantity of $20 and $50 notes totalling $1700. This passage appears:  
     
      
       
        
         
         ""Q44 Do you agree that when the officer spoke to you about the cannabis you told him there was about 60 grams there? 
         
        
        A Yes. 
        
        
        Q45 Is that right?  
        
        A Yes 
        
        
        Q46 Do you agree that when this officer spoke to you and he asked you how much cash was there you said about around $2,200? 
        
        A Yes. 
       
      
      
      
      Q47 Is that right? 
      
      A. Yes."" 
      
      
      
     A little later this passage appears: 
      
      
       
         
       ""Q56 Also in the bag was a set of scales, a T-A-N-I-T-A brand scales. Can you tell me who owns those? 
        
        A I do. 
        
        
        Q57 Do you agree that they were in the bag amongst the cash and the cannabis? 
        
        A They were in the bag in the sock in the same bag that the cannabis and the.---"" 
        
       
      
    8   She told the police that the cannabis was hers and that she had grown one plant in the mountains in Forestry property. She planted it using fertiliser and watered it about once per month. She picked it in about June or July 1998. She said that she obtained about 9 ounces of cannabis and sold some of it for $250. 
    9   As to the cash she said that she travelled with about $1000. This was for emergencies in case of a breakdown. She said that the rest of the cash was from selling marijuana. She declined to answer questions as to when she sold it and whether she sold it to people in Moree. She stated that she carried the scales with her all the time and used them for weighing up gemstones. She also used them for weighing up marijuana and had last done so on the previous day. She had sold more than 2 ounces which she had weighed and sold it for $250. 
    10   She said that the value of an ounce of marijuana ranged from $150 to $400, that there was around 60 grams in the two separate bags worth about $500. She said that she had weighed up about 7 ounces on the previous day and sold them that night in Moree for about $1750. The cannabis was packaged in small Glad bags. She had intended to keep the remaining 2 ounces. Thus of $2750, $1000 was her money and $1750 was from the sale of cannabis. Her mother had given her $1000. This passage appears: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""Q161 Did you come to Moree for the purpose of selling drugs? 
         
        
        A No, yes. 
        
        
        Q162 Are there any drugs in your motel room? 
        
         
          A. No"". 
         
        
       
      
    11   She was advised that the police intended to make application for a search warrant to search her hotel room. When asked if she had any objections to the police searching her room at the motel, she replied ""No""  
    12   This passage appears in her record of interview (Q-A 204-206). 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""Q204 Do you agree you came here to sell some drugs? 
         
        
        A. If I could. 
       
      
      
      Q205 Did you plan to sell drugs in Moree tonight? 
      
      A. If I could. 
      
     Q206 Do you agree that 7 ounces of cannabis is a fair bit of, substantial amount of cannabis? 
     
      A. Yes"". 
      
      
    13   Possessed of a search warrant the police attended at Mrs Farr's room at the motel. A male was lying on a single bed. A search was carried out. There were two plastic resealable bags containing cannabis underneath the double bed. In a carton on the floor between the two beds was a 30 resealable Glad bag box which was unopened. Under the double bed there was an open white shopping bag containing a large quantity of cannabis. In a suitcase resting on the double bed there were a further five resealable plastic bags. In the pocket of a work shirt which was of a size to fit Mrs Farr there was a half smoked joint containing cannabis and a small quantity of cannabis in another plastic resealable bag. A shoulder bag on the double bed contained numerous papers in Mrs Farr's name. 
    14   The police returned to the police station and advised Mrs Farr that they had executed a search warrant on her room and found further cannabis under her bed. With her consent they weighed the cannabis in front of her. The two bags weighed 34.6 and 34.1 grams gross respectively. The smaller size bag found in the shirt pocket weighed 4.6 grams gross. The large white shopping bag of cannabis weighed 219.2 grams gross. Mrs Farr insisted that the cannabis under the bed was hers. 
    15   Mrs Farr then commenced to take part in a further record of interview. She appeared upset and declined to answer any questions so the interview was terminated. 
    16   Some of the police evidence was challenged in cross-examination. Mrs Farr also gave evidence on the voir dire. It will be convenient to deal with further aspects of the evidence when dealing with the particular issues raised. 
    17   The Charges 
     
      
     It was common ground that the charge of goods in custody, ie $2750 reasonably suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained, could be dealt with summarily. The charge of cultivating a prohibited plant was a Table 2 offence under the  
     Criminal Procedure Act  
     1986 because of the small quantity involved. It was an indictable offence to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecuting authority elects otherwise. It had not so elected. The charge of having in her possession a prohibited drug, to wit, cannabis, was a summary offence. The charge of supplying a prohibited drug namely cannabis, is classified under Part 6 of Table 1 as an indictable offence to be dealt with summarily unless either the prosecuting authority or the person charged elects otherwise. It was common ground that s 424A of the  
     Crimes Act 
      1900 applied to the supply charge (see s 424A(4)(c)). 
      
    18   Mrs Farr challenged the admissibility of evidence of the police under s 424A of the Crimes Act 1900 insofar as it was not the subject of an electronically recorded interview. Thus she sought to exclude most of the terms of the oral interviews or conversations between the police and herself prior to the recorded interview. One difficulty which the police faced was that one of the police officers who stopped Mrs Farr had an audio recording machine (described as a belt clip tape recorder) but did not use it. That officer said: ""It's not a thing I frequently use at Moree and it's something that I may have neglected, looking back in hindsight"".

       (1) This section applies in relation to evidence of an admission within the meaning of this section. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) Evidence of an admission is not admissible unless: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) there is available to the court a tape recording made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the admission was made, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) if the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in paragraph (a) could not be made, there is available to the court a tape recording of an interview with the person who made the admission about the making and terms of the admission in the course of which the person states that he or she made an admission in those terms, or

       (5) This section does not apply to an admission made before the commencement of this section. 
       
      
    20   In R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426 Wood CJ at CL with whom Sully and Ireland JJ agreed held that in ascertaining the meaning of the word ""admission"" in s 424A of the Crimes Act 1900 it was necessary to have regard to the meaning of the word in the dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995. It includes ""any form of representation, whether by conduct or by oral or written statement, so long as it is 'adverse to the (maker's) interest in the outcome of the proceedings.'"" (437G) Horton was applied in R v Reid (1999) NSWCCA 258. Untrue exculpatory statements relied upon as evidencing a consciousness of guilt are capable of being implied admissions. 
    21   At the hearing before the magistrate Mrs Farr based her objections to the admissibility of the evidence upon the failure of the police to comply to comply with s 424A(1)(b), that is the failure during the recorded interview to confirm what had been earlier said by her in response to the police questions. The reason for this was that at the time of the roadside conversation there was only a small quantity of cannabis, namely, about 60 grams and the arrest was for possession of cannabis and it was not until the recorded interview that the matters of supply and cultivation emerged. Reliance does not appear to have been placed upon s 424A(1)(a). 
    22   The Magistrate's Ruling 
     
      
     The magistrate found that Snr Const Fitzsimons forgot to turn on the tape recording device and that having occurred the correct procedure was for the police to have put to Mrs Farr in the recorded interview at the police station what they alleged had been earlier said by her in response to the police questions. That had not happened except in a few instances where no objection was taken to the admissibility of the conversation which had been put to Mrs Farr in the recorded interview. Further, there was no reasonable excuse why a tape recording covering these matters had not been made. For these reasons the magistrate determined that the parts of the conversation prior to the recorded interview which constituted admissions and which Mrs Farr had not been asked to confirm in that interview should not be admitted. 
      
    23   The four charges were heard together. From the record of the argument in the transcript it seems that not a great deal of attention was given to admitting the conversations on the goods in custody, cultivation and possession charges and not on the supply charge. An all or nothing approach seems to have been taken. 
    24   The magistrate declined to admit the following parts of the statement of Snr Const Anderson, a copy of which is set forth in the First Schedule, namely: 
     
      
       
       Para 6 
       
      
      
       
       ""I said: You have smoked cannabis. I can smell it. 
       
      
      She said: No. 
      
      
      I said: Well I have been around a bit; I think you have."" 
      
      
      (It was the police contention that Mrs Farr's answers were deliberately untruthful) 
      
      
      
       
     Para  
     7 
      
      
      The whole, except the four lines at the top of page 4 of his statement. The magistrate noted that the police relied on the parts specified in paras 6 and 7 to justify their search. 
      
      
      
       
     Para 8 
      
      
      ""I said: You did smoke some cannabis, didn't you? 
      
      She said: Yeah, I had a smoke at a friend's place. 
      
      
      I said: Who was that? 
      
      She said: I'd rather not say. 
      
      
      I said: Fair enough. 
      
      
      I said: Is this cannabis yours? 
      
      She said: Yes. 
      
      
      I said: Are these scales yours? 
      
      She said: Yes. 
      
      I said: Are you a drug dealer? It certainly looks that way. 
      
      She made no reply. 
      
      
      I said: We will take your car back to the station for a more thorough search, is there any more drugs in the car? 
      
      She said: No, that's it."" 
      
      
    25   A copy of the statement of Snr Const Fitzsimons is set forth in the Second Schedule. The magistrate declined to admit those parts of his statement which corresponded with the rejected parts of the statement of Snr Const Anderson. He did, however, admit the words in para.8. 
     
      
       
       ""Senior Constable Anderson said: Are the scales yours? 
       
      
      She said: Yes"". 
      
    26   This was upon the basis that this matter was sufficiently covered in Question 56 of the recorded interview when regard was had to the earlier questions and answers. That ruling should result in a modification of the earlier ruling as to para 8 of Const Anderson's statement. The magistrate probably intended that. The markings on the statements of Const Anderson and Const Fitzsimons should be ignored. 
    27   The Crown Arguments 
     
      
     The Crown correctly submitted that the admissions made at the roadside related to the summary offences of possession of cannabis (about 60 grams) and goods in custody. The admissions made there did not relate to the charge of supply cannabis or that of cultivate cannabis. Those matters emerged later. The Crown made these further points: 
      
      
       
       (a) Parliament has attached the qualification that the section only relates to an indictable offence (other than one that may be dealt with summarily without the consent of the accused) to the definition of ""admission"". The qualification was not attached to the proceedings or the nature of the proceedings, for example, by inserting words such as ""except in summary proceedings"" in 424A(2). 
       
      
      
       
       (b) Parliament has selected as the critical time for the applications of s 424A of the Crimes Act the time when the admission was made. That is the time at which the defendant was, or ought reasonably to have been suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence. A police officer is an investigating official. In other words the sequence envisaged is that the police officer forms his suspicion that the defendant has committed an offence, asks the relevant questions and the defendant makes admissions. 
       
      
      
       
       (c) The police officer has to make an on the spot decision whether to record the conversation or admission. He has to decide what offences he suspects. If they are not indictable offences (subject to the exception mentioned earlier) the conversations or admissions do not have to be recorded. It is unlikely that Parliament intended that a police officer making on-the-spot decisions would have to look at incidental effects and what may subsequently eventuate. In the present case the police officer did not use a tape recorder as the offences were obviously summary offences. 
       
      
      
       
       (d) Parliament must be taken to be aware of the course of criminal proceedings. Frequently a number of charges are heard together as a matter of convenience and with the consent of the magistrate, the prosecution and the defence. (That happened in the present case). A magistrate is well able and capable of admitting evidence as to one charge and not as to another. When dealing with the supply charge the magistrate would put out of his mind the admissions made on the summary offences at the roadside. 
       
      
      
       
       (e) Parliament does not require a recording to be made in respect of admissions when what is charged is a summary offence. 
       
      
    28   During discussion with counsel for the DPP I enquired as to the weight to be given to the words ""that relates to an indictable offence"" in the definition of an ""admission"" in s 424A(4)(c). Counsel replied that the key was to be found in the fact that the relevant time was when the admission was made. In other words, the admission had to relate to an indictable offence at the time it was made. It was not to the point that at a later point in time the admission could be seen to relate to an indictable offence. 
    29   Counsel for the Crown submitted that on a trial for an indictable offence, for example supply cannabis, the roadside admissions could be used by the Crown as,  
     
     at the time they were made, they were in respect of summary offences. It did not matter that they could be useful, if not cogent, in the Crown proving the indictable offence. Counsel drew attention to the various discretions in the  
     Evidence Act 
      1995 which the Court could exercise to prevent the use or admission of evidence which would operate unfairly. 
      
      
     The Defence Arguments 
      
      
     (a) The offence which called s 424A of the  
     Crimes Act 
      1995 into operation was the supply of 210 grams of cannabis (the quantity under the bed). That matter may be dealt with summarily in the absence of an election by either party. Neither party elected to have the matter dealt with on indictment in the District Court. 
      
      
     (b) If the statutory pre-conditions are met and s424A applies then the admissions must be excluded. In the events which happened the admissions made related to and could be used to prove an indictable offence. 
      
      
     (c) It was impossible as a practical matter in the present the present case for evidence to be admitted on just the offences of goods in custody and possession when all the charges were being heard together. This raised the undesirable possibility of inconsistent credibility findings or inconsistent factual findings. 
      
      
     (d) The amount of cannabis found in the bag in the car and in the motel totalled 323 grams. This is in excess of the trafficable quantity. There was an indictable offence. The correct approach was to look at the total quantities. It was all uncovered by the police within a few hours consequent upon the arrest on the possession charge. 
      
      
     (e)  
     The Court should not allow the effect of s 424A to be avoided by permitting the Crown to charge a series of summary offences and deal with them separately when it was apparent on the materials held by the Crown that an indictable offence had been committed. 
      
      
     (f)  
     Section 424A is protective legislation, that is protective of an accused when he is confronted by a number of police and designed to ensure the integrity of the police evidence and to avoid disputes as to what was said. The present case was a bad example, in that the officer had a tape recorder but did not switch it on. 
      
      
     (g) In the definition of admission in s424A(4)(a) the words used are ""an offence"" and in s 424A(4)(c) ""an indictable offence"". In the present case the admission related to an indictable offence. 
      
    30   The Second Reading Speech of the Attorney General, Hansard, Legislative Council, 24 May 1995 at 117 contains the passage: 
     
      
      ""It [Evidence (consequential And Other Provisions) Bill] also makes an amendment to the Crimes Act 1900, making the tape recording of admissions to police compulsory where an accused person is suspected of an indictable offence that may not be tried summarily without the defendant's consent"". 
      
    31   The question of the application of s 424A of the Crimes Act 1900 can arise in a variety of circumstances. In some cases the summary offences come first and indictable offences arise at a later stage. These may or may not be connected with the original summary offences or be a progression from them. The summary offences may come to the notice of the police after action has been taken in relation to the indictable offence. 
    32   Section 424A(4) covers not only an admission made by a defendant who at the time when the admission was made was suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence and that admission relates to an indictable offence but also an admission made by a defendant who, at the time when the admission was made, ought reasonably to have been suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence and that admission relates to an indictable offence. 
    33   The words ""ought reasonably to have been suspected"" are significant. If at the time the admission was made the investigating official ought reasonably to have suspected that the defendant had committed an offence and that admission relates to an indictable offence then the admission is not admissible unless tape recorded or the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why the tape recording could not be made. This covers the situation where the investigating official did not in fact suspect that the defendant had committed an offence but should have done so and it was an admission relating to an indictable offence. Without such a provision there would be a serious gap in the legislation and the accused would not receive the protection which was intended. 
    34   Section 424A(4) draws a distinction between summary offences and indictable offences. Admissions which do not relate to an indictable offence do not have to be tape recorded. In other words admissions as to the commission of summary offences do not have to be tape recorded. What do the words ""relates to"" mean in the context? What work do they do? 
    35   Section 424A operates in these situations. Subject to s424A(2)(c) the section precludes evidence being led of an admission of facts constituting an indictable offence or of the offence itself unless the requisite tape recording has been made. However, the section has a wider reach because of the words, ""relates to an indictable offence."" On trials of indictable offences the section prohibits the reception of admissions made as to other offences (usually related) whether indictable or summary if no tape recording was made even though such admissions would have probative value at such trial. This case is a good example. The admissions made as to the goods in custody and possession of cannabis would have significant probative value on the trial of the charge of supply. 
    36   Section 424A does not prohibit the reception of admissions which have not been the subject of a tape recordings on the hearing of the summary offence proceedings where such admissions go to the commission of the summary offence charged. 
    37   The purpose of s 424A is to prohibit the reception of admissions relating to indictable offences but not those relating to summary offences when a tape recording has not been made. In some instances the initial arrest will be in respect of a summary offence and it will only be later that it will become apparent that an indictable offence has been committed. The police officer has to make a decision as to recording an admission at the time it was made (or, perhaps, immediately beforehand) and when he or she suspects that a summary offence (and no more) has been committed. It was not intended by the legislature that admissions as to summary offences (usually the less serious ones) had to be recorded before they could be received into evidence. 
    38   The roadside admissions were admissible on the charges of goods in custody and possession and cultivation but not on the supply charges. The matter will have to be remitted to the magistrate with this expression of opinion. 
     
      
     Section 138 of Evidence Act 
      
    39   Mrs Farr challenged the legality of the search carried out by the police after they stopped the car and carried out a random breath test. There was a contest as to what was said and whether Snr Const Anderson could, as he claimed, smell smoked cannabis on her breath and clothes. 
    40   To justify the search Snr Const Anderson asserted that he did so because of the smell of smoked cannabis upon her clothing and upon her breath. He described the smell as quite strong and distinct. He said that he was interested in her undergoing an assessment under s 5AA of the Traffic Act, that is, whether her driving ability was impaired by the use of cannabis. He did not require her to undergo any testing because he did not see her drive in an abnormal way and she was not overly affected by the drug. Accordingly, he did not cause blood and urine samples to be taken. He believed that tests of her would not come back with a high enough cannabis impairment. The constable was aware that a pharmacologist could ascertain easily the approximate time of the last smoking of cannabis. He explained that in the past when samples had been taken there had been a delay of 5 months in receiving the results back from the pharmacologist and the police doctor, Dr J Perl. She had thought that the impairment was not high enough to support a charge. He was not satisfied, in the present case, that Mrs Farr's impairment was high enough to warrant the taking of samples under s 5AA of the Traffic Act. 
    41   Const Anderson agreed that at night people's pupils expand. He also agreed that eyes being bloodshot and glazed were symptoms of tiredness. It was 9.50pm at night. He said (T13) 
     
      
       
       ""… I was certain that that smell and I've smelt the cannabis smoke before on people in the air and I've got no doubt that was the smell, that distinct smell I smelt."" 
       
      
    42   Const Anderson agreed that during the recorded interview he did not put to Mrs Farr that in answer to his question, you did smoke some cannabis didn't you?, she replied ""Yeah, I had a smoke at a friend's place."" 
    43   Const Anderson believed that the symptoms which he saw and smelled were sufficient for a search. He also relied on what Const Fitzsimons told him in relation to two drug intelligence reports, one relating to heroin and one relating to cannabis. He said that they compounded his reasons for searching. He did not ask for details, for example when, where or what. 
    44   It was put to Const Anderson that there was no distinct odour of cannabis on Mrs Farr's breath but he asserted that there most certainly was. 
    45   This passage appears in his cross examination (T 22 of 8/6199): 
     
      
       
       Q. You see what I'm suggesting to you is that rather than there having been a situation of you saying to her ""Well I want to smell your breath"" and so on that basically you just searched it. There was no question about it. No explanation given? 
       
       
        A. No I made it extremely clear the reason for the search and I did ask her questions in relation to her use of the drug and I believe she was left in no doubt as to the reason why we searched the car and her. 
       
      
      
       
        Q. There's nothing abut any of this conversation or any reason for a search at all in the notebook is there?  
        
        A. No that's correct. 
        
        
        Q. There's no reference to it in the facts sheet is there? 
        
        A. Constable Beattie prepared the facts sheet and I haven't read it since the day so I can't tell you exactly what's in it. 
        
        
        Q. You briefed him did you not? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        
        Q. You see what I'd suggest to you the facts sheet says is 'About 9.50pm Wednesday, 19 August police stopped the defendant driving NKA 613 at the corner of Anne and Auburn Street, Moree regarding an RBT. A search of the vehicle was subsequently made'. Full stop? 
        
        A. And I'd have to agree with you that if I did the facts I would've definitely included, for the court's information and yours as well sir, that the reason for search. Unfortunately, Constable Beattie didn't include that, perhaps due to all the other matters involved and making the facts shorter, quicker. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Again in relation to the COPS entry the COPS entry is virtually in the same terms. Are you aware of that? 
       
      
      A. Once again I'll accept what you're saying there, as it's in front of you. I can't recall the wording of that now."" 
      
    46   The cross examination continued (T23): 
     
      
       
       ""Q. None of this alleged conversation with the defendant is recorded anywhere until you made, your statement on 21 August. Correct? 
       
      
      A. I'd agree with that then."" 
      
    47   Const Fitzsimons said that Mrs Farr appeared to be sedated, relaxed and calm. There was nothing unusual or out of the ordinary. It was the decision of Const Anderson, the senior officer, to search. Const Fitzsimons did not notice the vehicle driven by Mrs Farr swerve before the police stopped it. 
    48   Const Fitzsimons said that he assisted in the search because of the stated observations of Const Anderson and the intelligence data relayed over the police radio. Const Fitzsimons agreed that he did not record in his notebook much of the conversation which allegedly took place at the roadside stop. He was unaware of the conversation alleged to have taken place between Const Anderson and Mrs Farr in the police vehicle on the way to the police station. Const Fitzsimons drove her vehicle back to the police station. 
    49   In response to the suggestion that there had been no conversation at the roadside between Const Anderson and Mrs Farr as to the reason for the search Const Fitzsimons said (T34 of 8/6/99): 
     
      
       
       ""He [Anderson] did inform the defendant that he had spoken to her whilst I was away. He had told me that she had smoked yarni [cannabis] and he could smell it and he intended to search it [the car] once he found out what I had told him."" 
       
      
    50   Mrs Farr said that as she was driving her motor vehicle in Moree a police officer instructed her to ""pull over"". He said that he asked her to do so because her vehicle had swerved. He asked her to do a random breath test and if she had had any intoxicating substances. She replied in the negative. She took and passed the test, sitting in the driver's seat. Const Anderson asked to search her coat. She handed it to him, he did so and handed it back. 
    51   Const Anderson asked about the contents of an esky. It contained fish. He went around to the passenger side of the car, opened the door and picked up the black bag. He verified with Mrs Farr that she owned it. He emptied the bag on the road near the driver's side door. Const Anderson then questioned her about the marihuana and the scales. Mrs Farr explained that her pupils were enlarged because it was night-time and that she was tired from driving a long distance. That would explain her eyes appearing bloodshot and glazed. Mrs Farr denied that Const Anderson said that he wanted to smell her breath. 
    52   Const Anderson told her that her car was going to be searched. She was given no say in this. She said that her answer in the recorded interview that she had last smoked cannabis that afternoon was correct. It was about 1 or 2pm. She had sandwiches for lunch and probably drank some coca-cola during the afternoon. She said that she also smoked tobacco regularly. She denied that her breath smelt of cannabis smoke at 9.50pm. She had not had a recent smoke. Nor did her clothes smell of cannabis. She asserted that the police officer had not smelt her breath. She denied that she had lied to the police when the officer asked her ""Have you had any drugs, smoked anything?"" and she replied ""No"". She explained that she had not had a recent smoke at the time the question was asked nor was she under the influence of drugs. She confirmed the answer given in the record of interview that she smoked cannabis daily. She said that she was having 2 joints daily prior to 19 August 1998 as she was stressed. On that day she had about half a joint at lunch time. She rejected the suggestion that she may not be aware of the smell of cannabis on her body. She gave evidence of having a cup of coffee on arrival at the motel earlier in the evening and a cup of tea with a friend at the Mehi Aboriginal Reserve. 
    53   Mrs Farr agreed that the police officer remarked on being able to smell cannabis on her. She said that he was lying, re-iterating that he neither asked to smell her breath nor leant over to do so. She said that Const Anderson did not ask if he could search her bag. He opened the car door, took the bag out and searched it. She allowed him to look in the bag. She said that he made no reference to being able to smell cannabis and that therefore he was going to search the car. He did not ask to search the car she was driving but she allowed him to do so in that she did not stop him. She agreed that Const Anderson asked her what she used the scales for? She said that she replied ""To weigh my sapphires up."" She said that she was a fossicker and bought and sold sapphires. 
     
      
     Powers of Search and Detention 
    54   Section 37(4) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 provides: 
     
      
       
       ""(4) A member of the police force may stop, search and detain - 
       
      
      
       
        (a) any person in whose possession or under whose control the member reasonably suspects there is, in contravention of this Act, any prohibited plant or prohibited drug; or 
       
      
      
       
        (b) any vehicle in which the member reasonably suspects there is any prohibited plant or prohibited drug which is, in contravention of this Act, in the possession or under the control of any person. 
       
      
    55   There will be circumstances where the member of the police force reasonably suspects that a person has in his or her possession or under his or her control a prohibited drug and that in the vehicle in which the person is travelling there is a prohibited drug in the possession or under the control of that person or another person. Thus a search of the person and a search of the vehicle may be warranted and permitted. 
     
      
     The Magistrates Decision 
    56   In the course of his extensive reasons the magistrate, after summarising the evidence, stated: 
     
      
       
       ""It is up to the prosecution to prove that the search was legal."" 
       
      
    57   The Magistrate set out the terms of s 37(4) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and analysed the evidence in terms of whether it was capable of giving rise to a reasonable suspicion on the part of Const Anderson. The magistrate noted that Const Anderson has been a police officer for 13 years and had worked on the highway patrol for 10 years. 
    58   The magistrate took into account the reasons advanced by the constable for not arresting Mrs Farr immediately upon smelling her breath and person and noticing the symptoms mentioned as to her eyes and taking her to Moree Hospital or some other suitable place for the purposes of testing for drugs under section 5AA of the Traffic Act. Const Anderson had referred to the difficulties he had experienced in the past and his view that she was not affected enough to cause him to arrest her. The magistrate found: 
     
      
       
       ""I have inordinate difficulty in accepting that that was the reason that Miss Farr wasn't arrested then and there, and for the purposes of 5AA taken to the Moree Hospital or some other place for the purpose of doing that testing."" 
       
      
    59   As the parties did not canvass this finding I will not do so. However, ss 5AA(2) and (3) require certain conditions to be met and there is room for debate as to whether they were satisfied. The magistrate explained that one reason for his conclusion was that nothing was mentioned in the Fact Sheet as to why the vehicle was searched. He was also influenced by the absence of any relevant note in the constable's notebook. The magistrate said: 
     
      
       
       ""… if one is to accept that these events occurred first then … Anderson would have made some mention in some shorthand of some way of that fact in his notebook. It didn't have to be in detail. It didn't have to be anything other than the words ""smelt cannabis on breath, smelt cannabis on hair, smelt cannabis on whatever."" Intel reports. There is no mention … in … Anderson's notebook … of his observations, of his assessment, of him exercising his power to search or the reason why he merely records vehicle - brief search. Bag front passenger side."" 
       
      
    60   The magistrate referred to the conflict in the evidence between the police and Mrs Farr. She denied that she smelt of cannabis, that her breath in fact smelt and that she was out of the car when the random breath test was administered. She passed her jacket out while she was in the car. She explained why her pupils were enlarged and her eyes were bloodshot and glazed. He thought that the evidence had to be scrutinised carefully. The magistrate was obviously concerned about the lack of acceptable evidence (probably expert evidence) that cannabis does smell and that its consumption causes enlargement of the pupils and the eyes to become bloodshot and glazed. The magistrate said ""… there is no evidence before me … that cannabis does smell"" and causes the symptoms mentioned. Technically, there was evidence to that effect from Const Anderson but it is a fair inference that the magistrate did not accept that evidence. It seemed to be based largely on assertions. The magistrate said: 
     
      
       
       ""… there is no evidence of either of those two things as far as I can see, but because the case is being fought on different grounds, I'm not going to base any decision on that aspect."" 
       
      
    61   The magistrate declined to accept that because Mrs Farr had consumed half a joint at lunch time there would be a smell to her breath many hours later. The magistrate was of the view that there should have been some acceptable evidence of the effects of smoking cannabis especially as to smell and symptoms and that the matters should not be regarded as common knowledge. He remarked that it was up to the prosecution to prove these matters. 
    62   However, the magistrate did not decide the case on the basis of the lack of evidence as to smell and symptoms. He said: 
     
      
       
       "" 
       However, turning back to the essence of what … I was saying earlier … if those things had occurred … they rated a mention somewhere and they're not mentioned in the notebook … they're not mentioned in the record of interview …"" 
       
      
      
     and 
      
      
       
       ""… when the onus falls upon the prosecution to establish the admissibility of the evidence it has been hampered in essence by the failure to mention anywhere either in the record of interview or in the notebook, or in some other way such as on the COPS report …"" 
       
      
    63   He concluded: 
     
      
       
       ""… unless the criteria in s. 37(4) are met, the search is illegal … because of the reasons that I've addressed … there was no reasonable ground … for Anderson to form the opinion that he did and therefore to search the vehicle in the manner that he did … the existence of the intelligence reports could not … in the form … that they were conveyed to … Anderson could not form in any legitimate way … part of his reasons for coming to the conclusions that he did."" 
       
      
      
     and 
      
      
       
       ""… it is not sufficient to leap to a substantial conclusion on the basis of a couple of drug intel reports, one heroin, one cannabis, and thereafter ground an invasion of a person's liberty on that basis. The fact that the intel reports weren't mentioned and the fact that the observations and smell weren't mentioned … in the notebook or … in the record of interview, and given the fact that the statements came into existence two days or so after the record of interview, … leads me to the conclusion that the onus cast on the prosecution has not been discharged by the prosecution, and consequently I'm satisfied that the search was one which attracts the terminology in section 138 of the Evidence Act, and it is evidence that was obtained … improperly at the lowest end, it may be in contravention of an Australian law but I don't need to go that far."" 
       
      
    64   The magistrate noted that s 138 provides that evidence obtained improperly is not to be admitted unless the desirability of doing so outweighs the undesirability of admitting the evidence. The magistrate found that the bag was taken out of the car without permission and searched on grounds that were not reasonable. The magistrate appears to have reached this conclusion even if Const Anderson had made the observations he deposed to and relied upon the summary of the intelligence reports conveyed to him by Const Fitzsimons. The magistrate held that the searching of the bag was improper as it flowed from the unreasonable conclusions of Snr Const Anderson. 
    65   The Magistrate had regard to the relevant matters listed in s 138(3) of the Evidence Act 1995, namely, the probative value of the evidence, the importance of the evidence in the proceedings, the nature of the relevant offence, the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless and the difficulty of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law. 
    66   The magistrate held that the probative value of the evidence was ""without question,"" that the evidence was important in the proceedings and that the charge of supply a prohibited drug was a serious one. The magistrate held that there was no difficulty in obtaining the evidence without impropriety and that the police officer had not even asked Ms Farr the question ""Do you have any objection if I search this bag?"" The magistrate stated that the crucial point in deciding whether to admit the evidence was the gravity of the impropriety and whether it was deliberate or reckless. 
    67   The magistrate stressed the importance of the rights of the citizen to be able to go about his or her business without arbitrary interference by the State by way of search or arrest or other arbitrary intervention by any agent of the state unless good grounds exist. The magistrate held that the impropriety involved in the arbitrary search of the black bag and the car was a grave one as there was a deliberate interference with the right of Mrs Farr to go about Moree. The magistrate further held that while the impropriety may not have been deliberate it was reckless. This was because there was no critical analysis of the intel reports, there was a failure to make the basic enquiries about them, the details involved and their true effect, there was no recording of the reasons for or the genesis of the search by Snr Const Anderson and no addressing of such issues by the police (Anderson and Detective Snr Const Beattie) during the recorded interview. 
    68   The magistrate found that Snr Const Anderson ""was prepared to act on the receipt of two ambiguous minimalist pieces of information as well as the observations that he says he made that I find have, for the reasons already indicated, he was not entitled to rely upon to form the opinions that he did."" 
    69   The magistrate concluded: 
     
      
       
       ""So therefore the desirability of admitting the evidence is outweighed by the undesirability of admitting the evidence … so the evidence is rejected or not admitted basically."" 
       
      
    70   Consequent upon the magistrate's rulings the police prosecutor submitted that the charges of supply a prohibited drug and cultivate a prohibited plant could and did stand independently of the alleged illegal search. Similar considerations applied to the large quantities of cannabis found in the motel room and the subject of the possession charge. The police sought to have the magistrate admit those parts of the recorded interview which dealt with these matters as they contended that these were discrete and severable parts of the interview. 
    71   The magistrate ruled: 
     
      
       
       ""… the proper question to be asked is how was it that Miss Farr was interviewed in the first place."" 
       
      
      
     and 
      
      
       
       ""Miss Farr only came to be at the station under arrest because of the illegal search of her car. It seems to me to be artificial then in these circumstances to be able to cut away or pick the eyes out of a record of interview and say these matters had nothing to do with the illegal search …"" 
       
      
    72   The magistrate concluded: 
     
      
       
       ""Essentially, if it was not for the illegal search, Miss Farr would have wended her merry way on somewhere else. There would have been no record of interview. There would have been no information garnered from that, the information being against self interest, information and admissions and the admissions certainly against self interests. There would have been no logical basis then to contact the after hours justice for the issuance of a search warrant. There would have been no legitimate basis for the search warrant to be granted and there would have been no legitimate basis for the execution of that search warrant on a room at the Winchester Motel. 
       
      
      
       
       All of those things were as a consequence of the illegal search of Miss Farr's motor vehicle. I cannot see logically how they can be surgically removed from that illegal search and given life of their own to stand independently. 
       
      
      
       
       In those circumstances in my opinion they must therefore fall into the same basket as the evidence excluded previously and I proposed not to admit the record of interview or anything that flowed from it, that being the application for a search warrant and the search of the room at the Winchester Motel."" 
       
      
    73   The Magistrate then endorsed the court papers: 
     
      
       
       ""Due to Exclusion of Evidence No Prima Facie Case."" 
       
      
      
     The Crown Argument 
      
    74   The Crown submitted that the magistrate had placed the onus on it under s 138 and that this was incorrect. The Crown relied on this passage in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in Coulstock (1998) 99 A Crim R 143 at 146-147: 
     
      
       
       ""The High Court has recently discussed the close relationship between s 138 and the common law in 
        Swaffield and Pavic 
        (1997) 96 A Crim R 96. It is clear that the onus still lies on the accused to establish the impropriety or illegality before any onus is place upon the Crown to persuade the trial judge that the evidence should nevertheless be admitted: ALRC 26 Vol 1, para 964; C (1997) 93 A Crim R 81 at 95;  
       Salem 
        (1997) 96 A Crim R 421 at 429-430. The discretion is therefore to admit the evidence notwithstanding the impropriety or illegality."" 
       
      
    75   Thus the onus lies on the accused to establish the impropriety or illegality but once established the onus is on the Crown to satisfy the court that it should exercise its discretion to admit the evidence. In view of the authorities Mrs Farr did not argue to the contrary. 
    76   The magistrate was under the mistaken impression that the prosecution had to prove that the search was legal. As earlier noted he said, ""It is up to the prosecution to prove that the search was legal."" He also said, ""the onus cast on the prosecution has not been discharged by the prosecution and consequently I'm satisfied that the search was one which attracts the terminology in section 138 of the Evidence Act."" 
    77   In his submissions (which could have been clearer) counsel for Mrs Farr addressed the Local Court on the basis that there was in effect, a two stage process. Firstly, it had to be established that there was an unlawfulness or impropriety. Secondly, the prosecution must then show that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting the impugned evidence. The magistrate appears to have elided the distinction between the two stages and treated the Crown as bearing an overall onus. 
    78   The Crown next submitted that the magistrate before considering and acting under s 138 of the Act, should have made a determination under s 90. That reads: 
     
      
       
       ""In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if 
       
      
      
       
       (a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and 
       
      
      
       
       (b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence."" 
       
      
    79   The Crown submitted that the magistrate should not have gone to s 138 which raises a public policy issue before making a ruling under s 90 which raises an individual unfairness issue. This was because a determination favourable to the prosecution under s 90 to the effect that the admissions were given freely and voluntarily under s 90 would be a relevant factor in the exercise of the discretion under s138. The Crown relied on Nabalarua, CCA, unreported, 19 December 1997. McInerney J, with whom Sully and Abadee JJ agreed held that s 90 had not affected the common law principle that the burden of establishing that it would be unfair to admit the admissions made to the police during an interview was on the accused: McPherson (1981) 147 CLR 512 at 519-520. 
    80   In Van den Meer (1987) 35 A Crim R 232 at 248 Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ said: 
     
      
       
       ""In considering whether a confessional statement should be excluded, the question is not whether the police have acted unfairly; the question is whether it would be unfair to the accused to use his statement against him. Unfairness, in this sense is concerned with the accused's right to a fair trial, a right which may be jeopardised if a statement is obtained in circumstances which affect the reliability of the statement."" 
       
      
    81   In Pollard v The Queen (1993) 67 ALJR 193 at 206 Deane J said: 
     
      
       
       "" 
       Cleland v The Queen 
        established that, in a case where a voluntary incriminating statement has been procured by unlawful conduct on the part of the police, a trial judge should, if objection to its reception it taken on behalf of the accused consider whether evidence of the statement should be excluded on either of two discretionary grounds. The first of those grounds is that reception of the evidence would be unfair to the accused. The second is that considerations of public policy require that it be excluded. The considerations relevant to the exercise of the two discretions overlap: the unlawfulness of the police conduct will be relevant to the question of unfairness to the accused and, since it is the policy of the law that a criminal trial be fair, considerations of actual or possible unfairness to the accused are likely to be relevant to the question of public policy. Ordinarily, it will be convenient for the question whether the evidence should be excluded on either ground to be dealt with on a single voire dire hearing since any evidentiary material will commonly be relevant to both grounds. Nonetheless, the two discretions are distinct and independent."" 
       
      
    82   At 207 Deane J quoted this passage from the judgment of Stephen and Aickin JJ in Bunning v Cross (1978) 141 CLR 54 at 69: 
     
      
       
       ""What Ireland involves is no simple question of ensuring fairness to an accused but instead the weighing against each other of two competing requirements of public policy, thereby seeking to resolve the apparent conflict between the desirable goal of bringing to conviction the wrongdoer and the undesirable effect of curial approval, or even encouragement, being given to the unlawful conduct of those whose task it is to enforce the law. This being the aim of the discretionary process called for by Ireland it follows that it by no means takes as its central point the question of unfairness to the accused. It is, on the contrary, concerned with broader questions of high public policy, unfairness to the accused being only one factor which, if present, will play its part in the whole process of consideration."" 
       
      
    83   Later at 207-208 Deane J continued: 
     
      
       
       ""Ultimately, the question whether evidence of an incriminating statement procured by unlawful conduct on the part of investigating police should be excluded on grounds of public policy must be resolved by a balancing process. In that balancing of policy considerations, the relevance and importance of fairness or unfairness to the particular accused will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case."" 
       
      
    84   At 208 he observed: 
     
      
       
       ""The weight to be given to the principal considerations of public policy favouring the exclusion of the evidence will vary according to other factors of which the most important will ordinarily be the nature and the seriousness of the unlawful conduct engaged in by the law enforcement officers. In that regard, a clear distinction should be drawn between two extreme categories of case. At one extreme are cases in which what is involved is an ""isolated and merely accidental non-compliance"" with the law or some applicable judicially recognised standard of propriety. In such cases, particularly if the alleged offence is a serious one, it would ordinarily be quite inappropriate to exclude evidence of a voluntary confessional statement on public policy grounds. The critical question in those cases will be whether the evidence should or should not be excluded on the ground that its reception would be unfair to the accused. At the opposite extreme are cases where the incriminating statement has been procured by a course of conduct on the part of the law enforcement officers which involved deliberate or reckless breach of a statutory requirement imposed by the legislature to regulate police conduct in the interests of the protection of the individual and the advancement of the due administration of criminal justice. Such cases manifest ""the real evil"" at which the discretion to exclude unlawfully obtained evidence is directed, namely, ""deliberate or reckless disregard of the law by those whose duty it is to enforce it."" In such cases, the principal considerations of public policy favouring exclusion are at their strongest and will ordinarily dictate that the judicial discretion be exercised to exclude the evidence."" 
       
      
    85   In s 138(3)(e) with the reference to whether the impropriety was deliberate or reckless there is almost an echo of the considerations discussed by Deane J in Pollard. 
    86   Sections 90 and 138 cover the two discretions which existed at common law to reject evidence on the unfairness and public policy grounds, although s 138 would seem to go further than the common law. Although unfairness to the accused is not listed in s 138(3) as one of the factors to be taken into account that does not mean it should not be taken into account. The introductory words of s 138(3) make it clear that the list in that sub-section is not exhaustive. In Pollard, Deane J indicated the approach which should usually be taken to the exercise of the public policy discretion. 
    87   In the present case the police did not submit to the magistrate that a determination under s 90 should be made before exercising the discretion under s 138. At no stage did the appellant contest that the bag in the front passenger seat area of the car belonged to her. She conceded it. Nor did she dispute that drugs, and a substantial sum of money belonged to her. Questions of the unreliability of the evidence and unfairness did not arise. The defence case was simply that the court should prefer her evidence to that of the police as to what occurred and hold that the search was illegal. On the defence case Const Anderson had no reasonable grounds to form the suspicion which he alleged he had. He acted on a hunch and not on a suspicion formed on reasonable grounds. The Local Court focussed on whether the impropriety in going ahead and making the search was deliberate or reckless. In the circumstances of the present cast the magistrate did not err in confining his attention to s 138 which was the issue which the parties chose to litigate. If the magistrate preferred the evidence of Mrs Farr, it was open to him to hold that the search was illegal, that the impropriety which occurred was reckless and that the desirability of admitting the evidence did not outweigh the undesirability of admitting the evidence. 
    88   The Crown submitted that the magistrate erred in holding that there was no evidence that smoked cannabis smells and that it causes enlargement of the pupils of the eyes and the eyes becoming bloodshot and glazed. Const Anderson gave evidence that smoked cannabis had a distinctive smell and that this smell came from the breath and clothes of Mrs Farr. He also relied on the condition of her eyes. Const Anderson relied on his experience. 
    89   I am a little surprised by the magistrate holding that there was no evidence of these matters as he had earlier in his reasons (p2, lines 15-24) summarised Const's Anderson's evidence including that he had leant forward and smelt the distinct odour of cannabis smoke. From the tenor of his reasons, it seems likely that the magistrate did not accept the evidence of Const Anderson and preferred that of Mrs Farr. However, he did hold that there was no evidence of the matters in question and that was incorrect. 
     
      
     The Defence Arguments 
    90   Mrs Farr submitted that she was originally stopped for the purpose of a random breath test for alcohol. On this showing that she was not affected by alcohol the police conducted a general investigation. That included an arbitrary search conducted without sufficient and reasonable grounds and on the hunch of Const Anderson. She said that the RBT was administered while she was still sitting in the car. That is the usual practice. At the hearing before the magistrate the primary issue was a factual one. Should her evidence be preferred to that of the police as to the circumstances in which the search took place? She submitted that the magistrate answered that question in the affirmative. 
    91   The magistrate was troubled by these factors: 
     
      
     (a) The failure to arrest Mrs Farr and have the tests in s 5AA of the  
     Motor  
       
     Traffic Act  
     carried out to establish whether she was affected and, if so, sufficiently affected by the ingestion of drugs; 
      
      
     (b) the absence from the Fact Sheet, Const Anderson's notebook and the Cops Entry of any reference to the smell of smoked cannabis on Mrs Farr or her breath and his observations as to her eyes and of him exercising the power to search; 
      
      
     (c) her evidence which contradicted that of the police officers in significant respects and her explanation of why her eyes may have been affected; 
      
      
     (d) the absence of evidence - I think that the magistrate meant the absence of acceptable evidence - as to the distinct smell of smoked cannabis and its effect on the eyes. 
      
    92   Ultimately, the magistrate concluded that ""there was no reasonable ground for Snr Const Anderson to form the opinion that he did and therefore to search the vehicle in the manner that he did."" The magistrate further concluded that the sketchy information conveyed by Const Fitzsimons to Const Anderson could not form any legitimate part of his reasons for deciding to search the car and its contents. 
    93   The argument advanced on behalf of Mrs Farr has considerable weight. However, in a number of places during his reasons, the magistrate during or after referring to the unsatisfactory features of the police evidence states that the onus was on the prosecution, meaning that the onus was on the prosecution to prove the legality of the search. There was also the mis-statements that there was no evidence that smoked cannabis had a distinctive smell. These considerations lead to the conclusion that the matter should be remitted to the magistrate to be further heard. 
    94   The magistrate should proceed on the basis that the onus rests on Mrs Farr to establish that the search was illegal. If he takes the view that her evidence should be preferred to that of the police as to the circumstances of the search (and there are good reasons for doing so as the magistrate's judgment reveals) then the magistrate would be entitled to hold that the evidence as to the search and consequent upon it should be rejected. As to the smell and the condition of the eyes the magistrate will again have to decide whether he prefers the evidence of Mrs Farr or the police on the balance of probabilities. If he prefers the evidence of Mrs Farr that there was no such smell and he accepts her explanation as to the condition of her eyes that will be an end of these issues. It will be a matter for the magistrate to decide whether he accepts the police evidence that cannabis has a distinctive smell and causes the eyes to be affected as testified to by Const Anderson. 
    95   Depending on the magistrate's view of the critical facts it may well be that the questions raised as to section 138 of the Evidence Act 1995, the question of onus and the mis-statement of the position as to the evidence are of academic interest only. 
    96   The magistrate and the parties in the Local Court worked under considerable difficulties. The questions involved were of some complexity and the court with the concurrence of the parties sat late on the hearing dates to complete the matter. The defendant and her counsel had travelled considerable distances and expense was obviously a factor. This was a case where the bench, counsel and the police prosecutor laboured hard. It is possible that the mistakes I have indicated as to s 138 are slips in expression but the transcript does not entitle me to proceed on that basis. It is with regret that I have felt obliged to remit the matter for further hearing. I gratefully acknowledge the assistance which I received from both counsel on the hearing of this application. 
    97   I order that the order of the magistrate dismissing the informations laid against Karen Gail Farr for the offences of goods in custody, cultivate prohibited plant, supply prohibited drug and possess prohibited drug be removed into this court and quashed and that the matters be remitted to the magistrate to be further heard in accordance with these reasons and according to law. 
    98   My provisional inclination is to make no order as to costs because of the different ways the Crown case was presented to the magistrate and this court. I am however, prepared to hear argument on the question of costs. There may also be a question whether a certificate should issue in respect of Mrs Farr's costs. Liberty is given to both parties to list the matter for hearing on the question of costs by arrangement with my Associate.

     JUDGMENT - On admissibility of evidence; see page 228 of transcript 
    1     HIS HONOUR: The Crown proposes to call Mr Matri, who would give evidence that on 26 April 1991 he sold a boat to a man who represented himself to be Mustafa Mahamad. It is the Crown case that that man was in fact one Fred Massih, an associate of the accused, and that it was the accused who had Mr Massih purchase the boat for the purpose of disposing of the body of Mr Mitris. 
     
      
       
      
    2     Mr Matri would say that on 1 August 1991, a little over three months after this transaction, he identified the purchaser from a series of photographs shown to him by police. I understand that Mr Matri now has no independent recollection of the appearance of that person, or of the photograph he selected. However, he did at the time sign the rear of the photograph which he selected.  
     
      
       
      
    3     Other evidence will establish that that photograph was indeed a photograph of Mr Massih. 
     
      
       
      
    4     Objection is taken to this evidence on the basis that it is inadmissible under the Evidence Act, 1995 because it is hearsay evidence which does not fall within any exception created by the Act and, in any event, because to admit it would be unfairly prejudicial to the accused within the meaning of s137 of the Act. 
     
      
       
      
    5     Dealing with the hearsay point first, my attention has been drawn to the recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Barbaro (2000) 112 ACrim R 551. In that case the leading judgment was given by Grove J, with whom the Chief Justice and the Chief Judge at Common Law agreed. It is sufficient to say that it appears to be the effect of Grove J’s reasoning that evidence of an act of identification made prior to trial is hearsay evidence within the meaning of the Evidence Act, and is admissible only if it fulfils the requirements of s66 of the Act. His Honour’s reasoning would appear to apply to evidence of the act of identification by the identifying witness himself as much as evidence of a person present at the time who observed the act of identification. 
     
      
       
      
    6     I must say there is some uncertainty about that in the light of what fell from his Honour at par 43 of the judgment but, reading that section of the judgment as a whole, that conclusion appears to me to be inescapable. That being so, it seems that evidence of an act of identification, by whomever it is given, is admissible only if the identification took place when the event in which the witness was involved was fresh in the witness’ memory: see Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606. 
     
      
       
      
    7     For present purposes, the event was the sale of the boat by the witness to the man said to be Mr Massih late in April 1991. The act of identification did not occur until 1 August 1991. On any view, the witness’ memory of the event could not be described as “fresh” within the meaning of s66 of the Evidence Act. That being so, it appears to me that the evidence is inadmissible. 
     
      
       
      
    8     I should add that, in any event, I would reject the evidence in the exercise of the balancing process required by s137 of the Evidence Act for this reason: Quite apart from a number of factors bearing upon the weight of the identification evidence, it seems that of the array of photographs shown to Mr Matri, only three survive. The rest have been lost, perhaps not all that surprisingly in the almost ten years that have ensued. It is not known now how many there were in the photographic array but clearly there were more than three. This would put the accused’s representatives at some disadvantage in testing the reliability of Mr Matri’s identification because the fairness of the photographic array could not be examined. For that reason alone, I would have been inclined in any event to reject the evidence.

     70033/98 - REGINA v JAMES TAOUSANIS 
    JUDGMENT - On admissibility of evidence. See page 302 of the transcript. 
     
      
       
      
    1     HIS HONOUR: Objection is taken by counsel for the accused to the evidence by the witness Mr Matri and the witness Mr Tyrrell that on 1 August 1991 they were shown photographs of a boat which police found in premises at Marrickville occupied by an associate of the accused. Both witnesses told police that they recognised that boat, with which they were well familiar. This is the boat which Mr Matri says he sold to a man who represented himself as Mustafa Mahamad and the boat which the Crown says was used by the accused to dispose of Mr Mitris’ body. 
     
      
       
      
    2     Mr Stratton, for the accused, objects to the evidence of recognition of the boat on two bases. Firstly, he submitted that evidence about the boat is irrelevant.  
     
      
       
      
    3     I have before me some statements admitted by consent from which it can be said that forensic and scientific examination of the boat disclosed nothing to link it with the death of Mr Mitris. Nevertheless, there is already evidence from Mr Kouroumalos that the accused bought a boat sometime after the disappearance of Mr Mitris and at a later stage was trying to sell it. Mr Kouroumalos said he himself had seen a boat at the premises at Marrickville. 
     
      
       
      
    4     The Crown anticipates that there will be further evidence tending to link the boat seen at the Marrickville premises with that sold by Mr Matri. I think that this evidence of the accused's association with the boat around that time is relevant. What weight is to be afforded to it is a matter to be assessed in due course. 
     
      
       
      
    5     Mr Stratton objects to the evidence of recognition of the boat in photographs on another basis arising from the provisions of the Evidence Act and, in particular, that part of the Act dealing with hearsay evidence. I have already referred to that matter in dealing with the related question of Mr Matri’s identification of the photograph of Mr Massih. I dealt with that matter this morning in a separate judgment. 
     
      
       
      
    6     It is sufficient to say that I consider this evidence to be evidence of recognition, rather than identification evidence in the sense in which that term is ordinarily used in the criminal law. That distinction was recognised by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Mundarra Smith (1999) 47 NSWLR 419. I mention in passing that I am aware that the High Court has granted special leave to appeal against the Court's decision in that case. The distinction was also affirmed in the more recent decision of the Court in R v Gee [2000] NSWCCA 198.  
     
      
       
      
    7     In the light of what was said by Grove J in Gee at pars 8 to 10, and in the light of the Court's more recent decision in Barbaro (2000) 112 ACrim R 551, it seems to me that evidence of a witness on a prior occasion recognising someone or something in a photograph is admissible by virtue of s66 of the Evidence Act. That is because, as Grove J said in Gee, at the time of recognition the witness’ continuing familiarity with the features of the person or object recognised was fresh in the witness’ memory. I must say that was not my own view in Gee, as I was a member of that Court, but I think I must accept that it is the view to which other members of the Court are now inclined and it would appear to be the proper analysis of the basis of admissibility of evidence of that kind. 
     
      
       
      
    8     Accordingly, the evidence will be admitted.

    Reasons for Verdict1     HIS HONOUR: On 17 April 1991 Peter Mitris, an architect who lived with his wife in the Sydney suburb of Stanmore, disappeared. Despite extensive inquiries over the years which have since passed, he has not been located. There is reliable evidence that on the morning of 17 April 1991 he was at Kings Cross, attending to his business affairs. It is the Crown case that in the late afternoon of that day he met his cousin, Peter Konomos, the accused, James Taousanis and a man named Steven Kouroumalos. It is alleged that he was driven to a house at Petersham, where he was subjected to a severe beating by the accused and Mr Konomos, from which he died then or at some time thereafter. It is further alleged that his body was deposited into the ocean near Sydney. 
     
      
       
      
    2     Accordingly, the accused has been tried upon an indictment charging that on or about 17 April 1991 at Petersham, New South Wales he murdered Peter Mitris. The trial has proceeded before me without a jury, in accordance with s16 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Mr Konomos left this country some years ago and, as I understand it, his present whereabouts are unknown.  
     
      
       
      
    3     There is evidence to suggest that in the early months of 1991 Mr Mitris was under considerable personal and financial pressure, such that he might have been motivated to sever his connections with his family and associates and to find a new identity elsewhere. There is also some evidence, albeit far from satisfactory, that a man other than the accused and Mr Konomos might have wished to do him harm. However, these are not matters which I could or should determine. The issues in this trial are simple. The accused is entitled to be acquitted unless the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt that on the day in question he participated in an assault upon Mr Mitris, intending to kill him or, at least, to inflict upon him really serious bodily injury, and that Mr Mitris died as a result of that assault. The trial has focussed upon the question whether, if Mr Mitris is deceased, the accused had a hand in his death. 
     
      
       
      
    4     Given the conclusion I have reached about the matter, it is neither necessary nor desirable that these reasons be lengthy or detailed. This is in no way to fail to recognise the seriousness of the case or to acknowledge the tragic loss suffered by the loved ones of Mr Mitris.  
     
      
       
      
    5     There is evidence that the accused had a criminal association with Mr Mitris, Mr Konomos, Mr Kouroumalos and another man, Nicholas Constantin. It is common ground that they were involved together in armed robberies. There is also evidence, which is challenged, that he was engaged with those men in drug trafficking. This, again, is a matter which I find it unnecessary to resolve.  
     
      
       
      
    6     I am satisfied on the evidence that, in the weeks leading up to his disappearance, Mr Mitris was expecting to receive through the mail a package containing a considerable quantity of cocaine. The cocaine was to be impregnated in paper, the package being prepared in such a way as to make it appear that it contained magazines. Mr Mitris had not received it. In fact, unknown to him, his wife had received the package and opened it, believing it to be addressed to her. Having no idea of the significance of its contents, she threw it out.  
     
      
       
      
    7     Mr Mitris feared reprisals by his associates in that criminal enterprise, to whom the package was to be delivered. It is the Crown case that those associates were the accused and Mr Konomos, and that they had previously used this method of transmission of drugs. This is said to be the motive for the beating. In addition, it is said that the accused and Mr Konomos bore Mr Mitris ill-will because, as a result of unreliable information he had supplied, an armed robbery of what was believed to be comic books worth a great deal of money proved to be fruitless. 
     
      
       
      
    8     The only direct evidence of the accused’s involvement in the death of Mr Mitris is that of Mr Kouroumalos, who claims to have witnessed the beating, and Mr Constantin and another man whose name has been suppressed, who claim that the accused admitted it in conversations with them. I shall refer to that last man as Mr “X”. As will be seen, the evidence of all three witnesses is of a kind which could be unreliable and it requires cautious assessment: see s165 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
       
      
    9     The testimony of Mr Kouroumalos is the centrepiece of the Crown case. According to him, in the late afternoon of 17 April 1991 he was driven by Mr Konomos to a property at Kings Cross Road which was being purchased by a company set up by Mr Konomos, Mr Mitris and the accused. There he was told to wait and Mr Konomos drove off. In due course he returned and Mr Mitris and the accused were in the car. Mr Kouroumalos joined them and the four of them set off towards the inner west, with Mr Konomos driving. At this stage Mr Kouroumalos did not know where they were going or for what purpose.  
     
      
       
      
    10     He said that the car stopped in the Surry Hills area and the occupants changed positions, so that the accused was seated in the back with Mr Mitris. The accused produced a Glock pistol, which Mr Kouroumalos had previously seen in his possession, and beat Mr Mitris about the head with it, saying, “You ripped us off on a package that was worth a lot of money.” Mr Mitris denied having done so. At that stage, or later at the house at Petersham, the accused also remonstrated with Mr Mitris for having “fucked up” a robbery. Tape was produced from the glove box of the car and was used to seal Mr Mitris’ mouth, and his hands were tied behind him with plastic electrical cord. The accused said that what was happening should be “a lesson” to anyone who “fucks me around” or “steals off me”. 
     
      
       
      
    11     It was dark by the time the car arrived at the house at Petersham. According to Mr Kouroumalos, Mr Mitris was escorted to the house and taken to an unlit room, the walls and floor of which were covered in clear plastic and the window of which was covered with paper. It was bare except for a chair, upon which he was seated. The accused put on knuckle dusters, which Mr Kouroumalos had previously seen at his home. He beat Mr Mitris about the head and body, saying that this was what happened to anyone who robbed him. Mr Konomos asked for the knuckle dusters and also beat Mr Mitris. 
     
      
       
      
    12     Mr Kouroumalos said that he left the room at one stage but was called back, he thought, by the accused. The accused asked him if he also wished to hit Mr Mitris but he declined, saying that he wanted nothing to do with it. The accused said to Mr Konomos, “Did you see the way I broke his neck?” Mr Mitris was covered in blood and appeared to be unconscious. 
     
      
       
      
    13     Concluding the narrative, Mr Kouroumalos said that they departed, leaving Mr Mitris in the room. The accused drove the car a short distance and Mr Konomos alighted to walk to his home, which was in the near vicinity. Mr Kouroumalos was dropped off in the Marrickville area, where he caught a taxi home. In the car the accused again alleged that Mr Mitris had stolen a valuable package and warned Mr Kouroumalos that, if he ever did the wrong thing by him, he would receive the same treatment. 
     
      
       
      
    14     Mr Kouroumalos gave further evidence that the accused later told him that he had had an associate of his buy a boat under a false name. He had taken the body of Mr Mitris by truck to the boat and, having put weights on it, dumped the body into the ocean. He expressed confidence that the body would never be found. 
     
      
       
      
    15     A number of circumstances surrounding Mr Kouroumalos’ account are either unchallenged or confirmed by other evidence. It appears not to be in dispute that the accused had an association with the building at Kings Cross and the house at Petersham. His evidence that the accused possessed a Glock pistol was not challenged: nor was evidence of various police officers that, in the course of a search of the accused’s home for the purpose of an armed robbery inquiry in 1991, two sets of knuckle dusters were found. As I have said, I am satisfied that Mr Mitris was engaged in the receipt of drugs through the mail and that one such package went missing. Equally, there was a bungled comic book robbery in which, it should be noted, Mr Kouroumalos himself was involved. 
     
      
       
      
    16     There is no issue with the evidence of Mr Mounir Matri that on 26 April 1991 he sold a boat to a man who gave an address which does not exist and that, around the same time, that boat found its way into the possession of an associate of the accused, Con Vardakis. The boat was later recovered by police from outside Mr Vardakis’ home. Scientific examination of it and of the knuckledusters earlier found at the accused’s home disclosed nothing of any significance.  
     
      
       
      
    17     Mr Constantin gave evidence, which is challenged, that not long before the disappearance of Mr Mitris he was asked by the accused to go to Mr Mitris’ home at Stanmore and pick up a parcel which was to arrive by post. He was not told what it contained but he suspected that it was drugs. He did so, but left before the post arrived. The accused asked him to go back the following day but he declined. Mr Kouroumalos gave evidence that both he and Mr Vardakis attempted to sell the boat on behalf of the accused.  
     
      
       
      
    18     Let me assume, without deciding, that the accused was involved in the transmission of the package of cocaine through the post and that he did arrange for a boat to be purchased on his behalf for some unlawful purpose. Those matters, together with the other matters to which I have referred, do lend some support to Mr Kouroumalos’ evidence. Equally, however, they provide a framework around which he could weave a false account of the accused’s involvement in the killing of Mr Mitris, giving that account the appearance of plausibility. At the end of the day, they do not assist me to resolve the crucial issue in this case. I could not find the accused guilty unless I were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Kouroumalos’ evidence of the events of the evening of 17 April 1991 is truthful. 
     
      
       
      
    19     I have the gravest reservations about his evidence. Cross-examination exposed a number of inconsistencies between his evidence in this Court and the evidence he gave at the committal proceedings and at a previous trial of this matter, as well as his answers to questions by police in a lengthy recorded interview on 1 July 1996. Some of those inconsistencies are such as one would expect, given the notorious frailty of human memory. Others, however, lead one to wonder whether he was truly recounting events which he had witnessed.  
     
      
       
      
    20     More importantly, he admitted that in early interviews with police in 1991 he did not suggest that he was present at the beating but falsely claimed that the accused had admitted to him that he had killed Mr Mitris. These acknowledged lies were embroidered in such a way as to lend them a spurious plausibility. He also admitted that he had once given false information to police about a friend of his, suggesting that that man had committed two armed robberies of which, in fact, he was entirely innocent. Such explanation as he provided for having done so serves only to confirm my impression that Mr Kouroumalos is prepared to say whatever he perceives to be in his interests at any given time, without regard to the truth.  
     
      
       
      
    21     It was not until July 1996 that he first provided police with the account which he maintained in this Court. At that time he had been extradited from Queensland, where he had been serving a sentence of imprisonment, to face armed robbery charges in this State. He was also then aware that the accused was providing information to authorities, in particular, the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Force, which might implicate him, rightly or wrongly, in other criminal activities. He maintained that, prior to July 1996, he was not prepared to tell police what really happened on 17 April 1991 because he was awaiting assurance that he had an immunity from prosecution in respect of his revelations. This, in my view, does little to restore his credit. Mr Kouroumalos could be telling the truth on this occasion, but how could one be confident of it? 
     
      
       
      
    22     That brings me, then, to the evidence of admissions said to have been made by the accused to Mr Constantin and Mr “X”. Mr Constantin had known the accused since the late 1980s through their involvement in the Army and the security industry, quite apart from their participation together in armed robberies. According to him, after he became aware of a police investigation into the disappearance of Mr Mitris, the accused told him that he had killed Mr Mitris and had “done a boat job” on him because he had “ripped them off, done the dirty on them”. The accused asked Mr Constantin whether the police had approached him about the matter and enjoined him to say nothing about it.  
     
      
       
      
    23     Apart from saying that this occurred in the accused’s car, Mr Constantin could remember nothing about the occasion on which the conversation occurred. It was over three years before he provided this information to police. In the meantime, the accused had made a statement to police implicating him in a serious assault carried out by him and others on behalf of the late Leonard McPherson, and had given evidence against him and the others at committal proceedings. He pleaded guilty to that offence in the District Court and was sentenced towards the end of 1994. He had also become aware that the accused was giving information to the National Crime Authority about a variety of criminal activities and, like Mr Kouroumalos, he was concerned about what might be said about him. 
     
      
       
      
    24     Mr Constantin did not impress me as a witness. He had every reason to dislike the accused and, in any event, had a motive to discredit him. In addition, he had his own interests to serve. In 1995 he had his solicitor negotiate with the Director of Public Prosecutions to refrain from laying further serious charges arising from an armed robbery in which he was involved, threatening otherwise to refuse to give evidence against the accused. To have fabricated his evidence of the accused’s admission would not have been a difficult matter. He acknowledged that in 1991 he was aware that the police were investigating the disappearance of Mr Mitris and that they had spoken to the accused and Mr Konomos about that matter. He also acknowledged that in Kings Cross it was rumoured that Mr Mitris had been the victim of a “boat job”. I could not responsibly rely upon his evidence.  
     
      
       
      
    25     I turn, finally, to the evidence of the man I have described as Mr “X”. The Crown prosecutor relies heavily upon this evidence, recognising the weaknesses inherent in the testimony of Mr Kouroumalos and Mr Constantin. This is evidence, he submits, which would persuade me to accept Mr Kouroumalos’ account. Mr “X” met the accused in 1986. Predictably enough, apart from social intercourse, he also committed armed robberies with the accused. In what was possibly an exhibition of disarming frankness, he testified that he had done so because he was “looking for a more reliable partner”. In February 1987 he was taken into custody in respect of an armed robbery (not involving the accused) in the course of which he shot a woman. In due course, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to penal servitude for life. 
     
      
       
      
    26     In 1995 he was confined at Berrima Gaol. There he was joined by the accused who, I gather, was serving a sentence and was on protection because of his assistance to the authorities. Mr “X” understood that, at that time, many of the relatively small prison population at Berrima were on protection either because they were former police officers or police informers. Indeed, he acknowledged that he and the accused knew that each of them was a police informer.  
     
      
       
      
    27     He agreed in cross-examination that there was in prison parlance an expression “case jumping”, which referred to the practice of learning sufficient about another prisoner’s pending trial to fabricate evidence that that prisoner had admitted to committing the crime with which he was charged. However, he denied that he had ever indulged in that practice or had heard of it occurring at Berrima. Nevertheless, he said that he sometimes kept notes of conversations he had with another prisoner if he felt that they might protect his interests in the event of “some sort of conflict” with that prisoner. He was concerned that the accused may have mistakenly believed that in earlier years he had given information about him to the police, and he claimed that it was for that reason he kept notes of some conversations which they had.  
     
      
       
      
    28     Five pages of handwritten notes, apparently spanning the period from 29 June to 8 October 1995, were admitted into evidence. In large part, they appear to record personal dealings between Mr “X” and the accused which are of no present consequence. However, they also purport to record conversations in September and October of that year in which the accused is said to have admitted that he and Mr Konomos bashed Mr Mitris to death (although it was not meant to go that far), that Mr Mitris’ body had been wrapped in plastic and wire and pierced with a knife “to let the air out”, and that it had been weighed down with something like an old stove and dumped at sea. Asked why this had happened, the accused is alleged to have said that Mr Mitris was a “pest big mouth” who, despite having made good earnings from business at Kings Cross, wanted to “climb the ladder” and to “run it all”. 
     
      
       
      
    29     Generally, the notes suggest that Mr “X” found these conversations bizarre and wondered whether the accused was mentally unhinged. In so far as the notes refer to events occurring at Berrima Gaol during that period, they appear to be consistent with certain prison records which are in evidence. Mr “X”’s oral evidence was rather bland and proceeded in a piecemeal fashion, with frequent reference to the notes apparently to refresh his memory about details. Certainly, at first blush, the notes have the appearance of a rough and ready diary: a more or less contemporaneous record of events. 
     
      
       
      
    30     That said, there are features of this evidence also which raise serious concerns about its veracity. I accept that offenders do not always behave rationally, and there is no doubt that some have rightly been found guilty on the basis of ill advised disclosures made to criminal associates whom they trusted. Nevertheless, I find it unlikely that the accused would admit his involvement in such a serious crime to a man whom he knew to be a police informer. Mr “X” said that he made the notes for no other reason than that he might need them in the event of conflict with the accused. Yet, on his account, he kept them for about two years after the accused had left Berrima Gaol and had ceased to pose any threat to him. 
     
      
       
      
    31     The notes were not produced to police until September of 1997. In the meantime, in April 1997, he saw a television news broadcast about the accused’s arrest in respect of this matter which provided sufficient details of the allegations to have enabled him to fabricate the admissions. Indeed, that broadcast could be seen as the framework around which they were fashioned. In September 1997, when the notes first came to light, Mr “X” was awaiting the result of his application for a redetermination of his life sentence. Judgment was given in March of the following year, and in his unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal in November 1998 police provided affidavit evidence of his assistance in their investigation of the present matter. 
     
      
       
      
    32     All this gives rise to the fear that the notes were in fact fabricated some time in 1997. If that be so, there is no doubt that they are a clever fabrication. It may be that they incorporated some notes which were made in 1995 relating to Mr “X”’s contact with the accused. It is a matter of notoriety that evidence of this kind has sometimes been concocted with considerable ingenuity. The dangers inherent in prisoner informer evidence were emphasised by the members of the High Court in Pollitt v The Queen (1991-1992) 174 CLR 558. McHugh J observed (at 615): 
     
      
       
        
         
         The prison-informer witness is often a skilful liar, with a shrewd knowledge of the criminal courts and their procedures, a quick intelligence well suited to the giving of evidence and withstanding cross-examination and a good demeanour and friendly personality. 
         
        
       
      
    33     Mr “X” also did not impress me as a witness and I could not rely upon his evidence. The High Court’s warnings in Pollitt apply with equal force to the evidence of Mr Constantin and, indeed, Mr Kouroumalos. Even in combination, I do not consider that the testimony of Mr “X” and Mr Constantin lends such support to that of Mr Kouroumalos as to persuade me to accept the latter beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
       
      
    34     The trial has proceeded to the close of the Crown case. Mr Stratton, who appears with Ms Yehia for the accused, submits that I should acquit his client now as the Crown evidence is insufficient to justify a finding of guilt. There is no doubt that I have the power to do so: see The Queen v Prasad (1979) 2 ACrim R 45, per King CJ at 47-8. The Crown prosecutor accepted as much, although he argued that the evidence was such that I should not take that course. For the reasons I have given, however, I think that Mr Stratton’s submission is sound. The accused is entitled to a verdict of not guilty at this stage. 
     
      
       
      
    35     Given the length of the trial and the volume of evidence I have received, these reasons are relatively brief. It is appropriate that they should be so. I respectfully agree with Greg James J that to provide detailed reasons for an acquittal could “suggest a reversal of the onus of proof”: see R v Schubert [2000] NSWSC 1127 at par 70. However, as his Honour added in that judgment (at par 71), it is necessary to say “sufficient to meet the parties’ right to expect that the arguments and evidence would be dealt with in such a way that it could be understood what had been accepted or rejected, and what process of reasoning had occurred … and it is also necessary that deficiencies in proof be exposed publicly for the public purpose of the judgment”. I trust that my reasons in this case meet those requirements. 
     
      
       
      
    36     I find the accused not guilty and enter judgment of acquittal.

      JUDGMENT 
     1    WOOD CJ AT CL: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Dunford J. I agree with his reasons and the orders he proposes. 
      
       
       ********* 
       
     2    DUNFORD J: This is an application for leave to appeal out of time by Paul Wayne Bailey against his conviction following a trial before his Honour Acting Judge Downs QC and a Jury in the District Court at Sydney on one count of dangerous driving causing death contrary to s 52A(1)(c) Crimes Act 1900, the particular allegation being that at the time he was driving his motorcycle in a manner which was dangerous to another person or persons. There is also an application for leave to appeal against the sentence of imprisonment for a minimum term of 3 years with an additional term of 1 year imposed on the applicant following such conviction. The Crown does not oppose the application for an extension of time to appeal against the conviction and on such appeal the appellant has appeared unrepresented, whilst on the application for leave to appeal against sentence he was represented by Mr S Odgers SC. 
     3    Two issues were fought at the trial: 
      
      1. Whether the appellant was the driver of the motorcycle at the relevant time, the appellant claiming that he was the pillion passenger and that the driver was his friend, David Rice, since deceased; and 
       
      2. Whether the Crown had established that the manner of driving at the time of the impact causing the death of the victim was dangerous to other persons. 
       
     4    At about 4 pm on Wednesday 22 March 1995 a motor cycle carrying the appellant and Rice came into collision with a pedestrian, Winifred Mary Collins, in Norfolk Road, North Epping as she crossed the roadway from west to east towards a pedestrian refuge in the middle of the road, thereby causing her death. At the time there were a number of cars, the motorcycle and a bus carrying schoolchildren, all heading in a generally northerly direction on the road. 
     5    Shortly after having rounded a bend in that road near Grigg Avenue, the motorcycle overtook a car driven by Mr David Garrett. Mr Garrett said that he was travelling at approximately 60 kph and the motorcycle was going 20 kph faster than him. After it passed him he looked in his rear vision mirror to see where a red car that had been following him was, and when he looked back his view was obscured by the bus which was several car lengths in front of him and was pulling out from the kerb at about 40 degrees with its yellow lights flashing. He then saw persons tumbling on the road near the pedestrian refuge. 
     6    His evidence of the speed of the motorcycle was somewhat confusing. Although he said that when it overtook him it was travelling 20 kph faster than him, he then said that after it passed him the motorcycle was doing about 20 kph and accelerated past him quite quickly at about 20 kph. His Honour was apparently concerned by this evidence and during the trial had an extract of that portion taken out and transcribed; his comments in the absence of the jury at p 128 of the transcript and his summary of the evidence at the foot of p 26 of his Summing Up indicate that his Honour understood the evidence as being that after it passed Mr Garrett's vehicle, the motorcycle was only travelling at 20 kph, but as I read the evidence in its context, Mr Garrett was saying that the motorcycle was travelling at 20 kph faster than he was, that is 80 kph and I believe the jury would have understood it in this sense.  
     7    Regarding the persons on the motorcycle, Mr Garrett said that when the motorcycle tucked in front of him after passing him he could only see the pillion passenger who was dressed in all dark clothing, long dark trousers and a long jacket down to his wrists with a dark head-covering of some kind and at the back of his neck he could see hair protruding. He said the passenger's pink hands were tucked behind his back and seemed to be gripping something at the back of the motorcycle and he had a very clear recollection of this because of the colour contrast between the hands and the dark jacket. He said that after he stopped he saw a man coming across the road from his right with a marine hair cut and a black t-shirt who was hobbling and went across in front of the bus and sat down on a low fence where he later saw he was wearing light coloured shorts. 
     8    There was an admission at the trial that the appellant was the taller of the two men, being 190 centimetres or 6 foot 3 to 6 foot 5 inches tall, whilst Rice was 173 centimetres or 5 foot 6 to 5 foot 8 inches. There was also no dispute that whereas the appellant was wearing a black t-shirt with the sleeves cut off, light coloured long baggy shorts (Kepper pants) and had a short spiky ""marine style"" hair do, Rice was wearing a black jacket, blue denim jeans and had long curly shoulder length hair; both were wearing black helmets. There was no evidence in the trial that either were wearing gloves and the appellant suffered an injury to his right knee as well as a number of grazes and abrasions as a result of the accident. The evidence of Mr Garrett therefore clearly identified Rice as the pillion passenger and thus implicated the appellant as the driver. 
     9    The bus driver, Nuuialaa Afele, said that he had stopped at the bus stop to let some school students off and was just doing 10 to 15 kph when he saw an elderly lady about 2 lamp posts in front of him just stepping onto the roadway. There was no other traffic on the roadway in front of him but the next thing he recalled was the motorcycle zooming past him, then he saw the motorcycle going towards the lady and as she hurried towards the refuge, the motorcycle veered away to the right. He said the motorcycle did not change speed and did not brake. He estimated the speed of the motorcycle at over 70 kph but from cross-examination it emerged that at the committal and at an earlier trial he was unable to say the motorcycle was exceeding the speed limit (which was 60 kph). 
     10    He said there were 2 persons on the motorcycle, the person driving had very short dark hair and the passenger was fair with shoulder length blonde hair but he could not remember whether either were wearing crash helmets. He said that the passenger came right away from the motorcycle but the one which was driving was still near the motorcycle after the collision. He could clearly see the 2 riders after the accident but not before. He agreed in cross-examination that he asked Rice who was driving and Rice told him, ""the other person"", and he said this confirmed what he already knew. He did not recall either wearing a leather jacket.  
     11    Miss Button was a wine consultant attending a drive-in liquor store about a kilometre south of where the accident took place and she recalled the 2 persons on the motorcycle coming to that liquor store shortly before the accident. She said the passenger was wearing a black leather jacket and had long hair which she saw when he took his helmet off when he came into the bottleshop. She said at the time the driver was still sitting on the motorcycle and was wearing a helmet, shorts and a dark coloured singlet. She said his shorts were also dark and the driver addressed the passenger as, ""Dave"". The driver got off the motorcycle at one stage to use the EFTPOS machine and after the passenger had purchased some beer and it was strapped to the motorcycle, they left. She was adamant that the person wearing the shorts and the dark coloured singlet (it was in fact a t-shirt with the sleeves cut out) was the driver and the person with the leather jacket and long fair hair was the passenger. 
     12    Penny Craig was a school girl travelling on the bus who said that she first saw the motorcycle as the bus was pulling into the bus stop but the bus did not fully stop and kept going. She said that by looking through the front window of the bus she saw the motorcycle hit the lady about 2 lengths in front of the bus, at which stage the lady was halfway across from the kerb to the refuge. She said there were 2 persons on the motorcycle, the passenger ended up in the gutter on the other side of the road and the driver ended up next to the motorcycle. She said the driver had long hair and they were both wearing black jackets and the driver had a black leather jacket on, the other person had short hair, as she discovered after he took his helmet off.  
     13    She said that before the accident she did not pay much attention to the person on the back of the motorcycle, but after the accident the person in the gutter on the other side of the road, whom she identified as the passenger, appeared to be injured and limped back across the road and sat on a small fence and drank a beer, at which stage she noticed he had short hair, but she could not say what clothing he was wearing. She agreed she did not notice anything about him before the accident but only afterwards. She described the driver as having long hair, wearing a leather jacket with a white t-shirt and she could see the hair blowing out from under his helmet. She said he landed about a metre from the motorcycle and checked the motorcycle and then the lady. She made a statement to police at the scene and later that evening made further notes of what she had seen. 
     14    David Rice was deceased before the trial and his evidence from the committal was read. He was the owner of the motorcycle but said that the appellant was the driver and he was the pillion passenger because he had been drinking whereas the appellant had not. He said that after the collision he ended up in about the middle of the south bound lane about a metre away from the double lines, while the motorcycle was pretty close to the double centre lines in the north bound lane, but he did not see where the appellant ended up. He was wearing blue jeans, black leather jacket with long sleeves and a t-shirt underneath, possibly a flannelette shirt as well, and he was wearing black sandshoes. He made no reference to wearing gloves. He said that after the accident the appellant told him that he, the appellant, could not afford to get into trouble and that Rice would have to ""take the wrap"", and that he would pay the fine and pay for a lawyer. He repeated this about 5 times, he also said that he would start drinking beer and that the police would not be able to prove anything.  
     15    As to the circumstances of the accident he said there was a really slow car in front of them probably doing less than 40 kph which turned into Grayson Street. He said that the appellant went down a gear, accelerating slightly and went round the left side of that vehicle, and when they came up to Valley View Crescent the bus had pulled up and was just indicating to pull out again. He said he told the appellant to ""knock it back a peg"" and he thought he went back to third gear, he didn't think they were speeding, they went around the outside of the bus and came very close to a traffic island and the next thing he knew, he was off the motorcycle. 
     16    The appellant gave sworn evidence and said that he was the passenger and Rice was the driver. He said that Rice was a regular drinker, he knew he had been drinking that day, but he had been on the back of the motorcycle with him before and he was normally drunk. He said that when they arrived at the bottle shop and Rice, who was the driver got off to go and buy the beer, he slid forward from the passenger seat to the driver's seat and later after using the EFTPOS machine he got back into the driver's seat and after starting the machine and Rice returned, he slid back to the passenger seat and Rice was driving when they actually left the bottle shop. He said he normally hangs on to the back of the rack when riding and that was what he was doing on this occasion. He was not sure where either of them landed on the roadway after the collision. 
     17    The appellant said that he was looking over Rice's shoulder from his position as pillion passenger and saw the lady stepping out a couple of feet onto the roadway just prior to the motorcycle reaching the bus, or when it was next to the bus that he saw her stop, turn, look at the motorcycle and then she appeared to sort of hurry a bit towards the pedestrian refuge whilst Rice veered the motorcycle and they hit something. He was not aware of the motorcycle slowing down but it did veer right to the centre of the roadway; he assumed that Rice was trying to go around the pedestrian. 
     18    Both the appellant and David Rice, when spoken to by police claimed that the other was the driver at the relevant time. Although an initial breath test at the scene showed Rice with a blood alcohol reading of 0.025, later testing showed that a more accurate reading was 0.165. There was no evidence that the appellant had been drinking prior to the accident. 
     19    Although the appellant was unrepresented on the appeal against conviction he has presented grounds of appeal and written submissions apparently prepared by someone with some legal knowledge.  
     20    The first ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in not directing the jury that witnesses, namely Miss Button and Mr Afele, gave evidence in this trial inconsistent with evidence they gave in the first trial, and that the jury must not substitute for evidence in the trial, evidence given on previous occasions such as at the committal or in a previous trial where the jury was unable to agree, and R v Oliva (1965) 49 Cr App R 298 was referred to.  
     21    The fact that there were some differences, not necessarily significant, in the evidence given by some of the witnesses in the trial compared with what they had said on previous occasions was the subject of intense cross-examination of each of those witnesses. This was a matter that was fairly and squarely before the jury in the assessment of the evidence having been referred to in defence counsel's address. His Honour dealt with this aspect at pp 8 and 9 of his Summing Up: 
      
       
        
        ""You have heard that some of the witnesses said something different at the committal hearing back in 1996. Each said something different in a trial that took place in March of this year, from what they said in the witness box here. You will have to satisfy yourself as to which of the evidence is more reliable. On the face of it you could say, well, recollections fade with time, therefore I accept what was said earlier. People when they are tested as to what their recollection is about an incident can, with time, come to believe that something is true which did not in fact happen. In other words, they can construct or reconstruct what happened and come to believe it."" 
        
       
       
     22    The jury should have been told, but were not, that they could act only on the evidence given in the trial, and not on evidence given on previous occasions, and that such earlier evidence could only be used for assessing the reliability of their evidence in the trial. But there was no application for any further direction, so Rule 4 applies. Apart from Mr Afele's evidence in the trial that the speed of the motorcycle was 70 kph whereas he had previously said he did not believe it was exceeding the speed limit, the differences were insignificant. The jury could have been under no illusion that it was the evidence in this trial that mattered and that the Crown was relying on the evidence given in the trial and not evidence given previously; and I would refuse leave to argue this ground. 
     23    The second ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in that he did not direct the jury appropriately on the elements of the offence, and in particular did not direct the jury that the offence was committed only if the vehicle was being driven in a manner dangerous to another person contemporaneously with the impact. 
     24    Although the offence of dangerous driving causing death requires a motor vehicle to have been driven in a dangerous manner at the time of the impact occasioning death, a preceding period of dangerous driving may be so nearly contemporaneous with the impact as to satisfy this element of the offence: Jiminez v the Queen (1992) 173 CLR 572 at 578. The interval of time between the driving which is in breach of the section and the impact may in all the factual circumstances of the case be so short that the offending driving can be regarded as proceeding to the moment of impact: R v Hain (1966) 85 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 7. 
     25    When the Summing Up is considered as a whole, I am satisfied his Honour has sufficiently described all the elements necessary to establish the offence. From the context of the Summing Up and the manner in which the trial was conducted, both by the prosecution and the defence, there can be no doubt that the jury was aware that the relevant time for them to consider the appellant's driving was the time of impact with the victim or so close as to be inseparable from it. His Honour directed the jury (pp 23-24) as follows: 
      
       
        
        "". . . you have to look at the driving and you have to look at two things. You have to look at firstly, the manner of the driving, or riding, and secondly the circumstances surrounding the riding. Then after considering the manner of the driving and the circumstances surrounding the driving you would then come to the (sic) consider if in those circumstances it was dangerous to another person. 
        
       
       
        
        This test is the objective test. The accused does not have to prove what he had been thinking in his mind at the time. The accused (sic) conduct must be judged according to the objective standards fixed in relation to all users of the road. It does not matter what might have been in the mind of the rider at the time. It is a standard that attaches to all users of public roads. And before you could find the person guilty of riding in a manner which was dangerous to another person, you would have to be satisfied that the breach, of what you consider to be proper control and management of a motor vehicle, was to be so serious, as to be in reality, a potential danger to other persons. You have to be satisfied that the circumstances of control and management of the motorcycle was, the breach of driving, was so serious as to bring in reality a potential danger to other persons."" 
        
       
       
      and later (at p 25): 
       
        
        ""So you have to look at all of the circumstances to decide if the driving be dangerous. And it would be wrong, very wrong indeed, if you said, oh well, there was an accident, there was an impact, a woman died from the injuries, it must have been dangerous driving. That is quite wrong. You must decide the manner of driving before you can decide if it was dangerous and fell far short of the proper management of a vehicle on a roadway, so short of the proper standard that in the circumstances it amounted to a crime."" 
        
       
       
     26    It was never an issue at the trial that any dangerous driving of the appellant was not sufficiently contemporaneous with the impact which caused the death of the deceased and accordingly it was not necessary to give any directions in relation to that issue. No application was made for any redirection, Rule 4 applies, the appellant has not been prejudiced in any way, and I would refuse leave. 
     27    The third ground of appeal is that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. This ground is more correctly expressed as being that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence: Fleming v R [1998] HCA 68, 197 CLR 250, R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53, 104 A Crim R 416, and requires the Court to make its own independent assessment of the evidence and ask itself whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty, bearing in mind that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility for determining guilt or innocence and has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-3. 
     28    The submission focused on the two issues fought at the trial, namely,  
      
      (a) whether the appellant was the driver of the motorcycle; and  
       
       
      (b) whether the manner of driving was dangerous to a member of the public. 
       
       
     29    The evidence of Mr Garrett, Mr Afele and Miss Button was clearly to the effect that the appellant, being the person wearing the singlet (or more correctly described as a t-shirt with the sleeves cut out) and the long shorts, was the driver of the motorcycle and Mr Rice, being the person in the dark coloured clothing, including a leather jacket, long trousers and with long fair hair protruding from the back of the crash helmet, was the passenger. There were some discrepancies in the evidence of these witnesses but they were comparatively minor. Mr Garrett said that he could see the pillion passenger's hands were tucked behind his back and he seemed to be gripping something at the back of the motorcycle, although Mr Rice in his evidence at the committal said that (at p 31): 
      
       
        
        ""Q. Do you hang on when you are on the back or how do you sit. Is there some sort of strap or bar -- 
        
       
       
        
        A. When Paul's riding I've got a rack behind me so no I don't have to hold on at all. I just sit there and feet on the pegs. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You are quite comfortable sitting there-- 
        
       
       
        
        A. Not holding on at all."" 
        
       
       
        
       
     30    This evidence was relied on to suggest that it must have been the appellant on the back of the motorcycle. But apart from the fact that it contradicted the appellant's evidence that Rice never rode pillion when the appellant was riding the motorcycle, Rice was not saying that he never held on, but only that he was comfortable not holding on. Moreover, Mr Garrett said that what struck him was the contrast between the dark coloured sleeves of the jacket that the pillion passenger was wearing and the pink hands protruding therefrom, and this was inconsistent with the fact that the appellant had no dark coloured sleeves and therefore no colour contrast between the sleeves of a jacket and his bare hands. 
     31    Miss Button was quite firm and clear that the appellant whom she identified by his clothes was the driver of the motorcycle. She saw the motorcycle arrive at the bottle shop with him as the driver and she saw it leave the bottle shop with him as the driver, and her evidence was quite inconsistent with the appellant's evidence that he moved from the pillion seat onto the driver's seat and then after using the EFTPOS machine resumed the driver's seat, started the motorcycle and then moved back to the pillion seat.  
     32    Mr Afele's evidence was not as strong because, although he was very firm in his evidence that the appellant was the driver, he did not recall either of the persons on the motorcycle wearing a leather jacket or helmet and he saw nothing to identify the respective positions of the riders before the accident. His evidence seems to be based mainly on the position of the persons on the roadway after the accident which places the appellant closer to the motorcycle, although some of the other evidence, by no means conclusive, tends to suggest that the appellant may have finished furthest from the motorcycle after the accident. Mr Afele's evidence may have contained an element of reconstruction in it, and standing alone I would not regard it as particularly strong but the evidence of Mr Garrett and Miss Button is much stronger.  
     33    On the other hand, there is the evidence of Miss Craig which clearly identified the appellant as the passenger and not the driver, although she also said that she did not notice anything about the passenger before the collision; and there may be an element of reconstruction in her evidence also, based on her recollection of where the two persons finished up after the accident.  
     34    There was also the evidence that as he was clearly intoxicated at the time, Rice had good reasons for not driving. At the time the appellant was sober and there was also the evidence of Rice of what he claimed was said to him by the appellant (which the appellant denied) to the effect that he wanted him to ""take the wrap"" and would pay his fines and legal expenses on his behalf.  
     35    Although there was a conflict in the evidence, the jury had the opportunity of seeing and hearing all the witnesses, except Rice (in respect of whom they were given appropriate warnings) and it was a matter for the jury to determine which witnesses they accepted and which witnesses they rejected, in whole, or in part. There was in my view, ample evidence to support the Crown allegation that the appellant was the driver. It was a question of fact and therefore a matter for the jury and it cannot be said that they acted unreasonably in finding the appellant was the driver or that the verdict cannot be supported. 
     36    I am also satisfied that there was ample evidence to support the jury's finding that the motorcycle was driven in a manner which was dangerous to a member of the public. It was a flat, straight, open, bitumen road on a clear, sunny afternoon. The evidence suggests, although not conclusively, that the driver of the motorcycle was exceeding the speed limit and he clearly overtook a bus as it was slowly pulling out from the kerb. However, the pedestrian was crossing the road some fair distance past where the motorcycle overtook the bus and there was no traffic between the motorcycle and the pedestrian to obscure the driver's view of the pedestrian once he overtook the bus.  
     37    The evidence, including the evidence of the appellant, that after starting to cross the road, the pedestrian stopped, then hurried towards the refuge, and at the same time the motorcycle veered to the right, leads to a very strong inference that the driver of the motorcycle was not keeping a proper lookout, and when he saw the pedestrian crossing the road, instead of braking, he attempted to go around her to the point of the pedestrian refuge. The failure to keep a proper lookout until it was too late, the failure to brake and at the same time to veer to the right, in my view clearly justified a finding that at the time the appellant was driving in a manner dangerous to a member of the public. The driver of a motorcycle or any other vehicle overtaking a bus pulling out from the kerb must do so at such speed and with such attention that he or she will be able to cope with pedestrians or any other emergency which may be present on the roadway in front of the bus. 
     38    Notwithstanding this, I am concerned that his Honour did not in his Summing Up spell out in specific terms the particular manner in which the Crown alleged that the appellant's driving was in a manner dangerous to a member of the public. A Summing Up should not only give directions as to the ingredients of the offence, and contain an explanation as to how the law may be applied to the facts of the particular case, including a brief resume of the evidence relating to those ingredients, but should include a succinct and accurate summary of the issues and a concise summary of the arguments of both sides: Alford v Magee (1952) 85 CLR 437 at 466, R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105, R v Tillott (1991) 53 A Crim R 46 at 51. 
     39    It was incumbent on his Honour in a case such as the present, to not only describe to the jury the elements of driving in a manner dangerous, but to spell out in unambiguous terms the particular manner of driving which the Crown alleged in this case constituted a manner dangerous to the public, together with the arguments in support thereof and the defence arguments to the contrary, all in summary form, but this his Honour failed to do. 
     40    After giving general directions as to the onus of proof, assessment of witnesses etc, his Honour identified the two issues fought at the trial, gave a warning about identification evidence and then summarised the evidence of the various witnesses in relation to the issue of identification. Then, having properly emphasised to the jury that they only came to the question of manner of driving if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the driver, his Honour gave general directions as to what constituted driving in a manner dangerous to a member of the public, warned them that they must not reason that because there was an accident and a woman died there must have been dangerous driving and summarised the evidence of the various witnesses relating to the manner of driving. He then summarised the submissions of the Crown and the defence in relation to the identity of the driver and concluded the Summing Up with a few formal matters; but at no stage did he spell out what the particular factors in the appellant's driving the Crown alleged were dangerous to the members of the public, nor did he summarise the arguments of both counsel in relation to those allegations.  
     41    The closest his Honour came to identifying the relevant issues relating to the appellant's driving was at p 24 where he said: 
      
       
        
        ""When considering the manner of driving, you would, or may consider many things. As in this case you would consider the evidence of speed. You may have to consider the alertness of a person. You would consider if the person who was riding the motorcycle kept a proper lookout. You would consider the direction in which the bike was controlled. You would consider acceleration or braking."" 
        
       
       
      These were relevant considerations, but it was not sufficient to make clear to the jury precisely what the Crown was alleging in this regard and what the appellant's response to it was. 
       
     42    I have sought a transcript of counsels' final addresses to ascertain what was said in relation to these matters as the issues may have become clearer from such addresses, but such transcript is unavailable; and in any event these matters should have been canvassed in the Summing Up, as I have said.  
     43    I have therefore considered whether this defect in the Summing Up, although not taken as a ground of appeal, should give rise to an order for a new trial; but having regard to the whole of the evidence to which I have already referred and the circumstances of the plaintiff hitting the pedestrian on an open road in broad daylight where there was an element of speed and after overtaking a bus, where there must have been a failure to keep a proper lookout, and where the evidence discloses that no attempt was made to brake, I consider there is no possibility that the appellant has lost an opportunity of an acquittal which was reasonably open to him, and I would apply the proviso.  
     44    For these reasons I propose that the application for leave to appeal against the conviction out of time be allowed, but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     45    In relation to the appeal against sentence, the applicant is aged 31 years and has a criminal record extending back to 1986. The Pre-Sentence Report described him as being one of three children and having an unhappy childhood fraught with difficulties including a family environment characterised by alcohol abuse and argument. It appears that he displayed behavioural difficulties within the family from an early age and his parents separated when he was 16 years old. Shortly after that in 1986-7 he had a number of offences, including one of driving in a manner dangerous, dealt with in the Children's Court and he was admitted to an institution for a time.  
     46    In 1988 he was convicted of maliciously inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse and sexual intercourse without consent with a person under 16 years, for which he was sentenced to penal servitude for 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. The victim of such assault was his younger sister. Following his release from custody he had a number of other convictions, including malicious damage, larceny, receiving, dishonestly obtain benefit by deception, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and resist arrest. Some of these were dealt with by way of fine, recognizance or an order for community service, and he also served a sentence of 3 months imprisonment in 1992. After being charged with this offence in 1995 he moved to Melbourne where he was subsequently convicted in 1997 of 2 counts of armed robbery, and other offences, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, including 379 days by way of pre-sentence detention. Following his release from prison in Victoria on 27 March 1999 he returned to New South Wales and has been in custody on the current charge since 18 August 1999, the date of the jury's verdict, a period in excess of 15 months.  
     47    He also has an appalling driving record. At the date of the offence, he had 5 entries for speeding and 2 for negligent driving, since then he has a further entry for exceeding the speed limit.  
     48    He has been in a defacto relationship since 1994, and there are two children of the union, but the relationship has involved arguments and separations. He has in the past worked as an apprentice carpenter after having left school in Year 10. Whilst in prison he has studied for the Higher School Certificate but has not yet completed same. Over the years he has used and abused a number of drugs, including cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine and heroin, and at the time of sentence he was on a methadone program prescribed by the Correctional Health Service, but he now claims to be drug free. He is a diabetic, receiving 2 or 3 insulin injections a day and will be required to serve his sentence in protective custody because of the prior sexual offence convictions.  
     49    In R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 231, the Court of Criminal Appeal promulgated guidelines for offences under s 52A(1), including that where there is a plea of guilty, and there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than 3 years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) should be exceptional. Aggravating factors include matters such as the degree of speed, intoxication, erratic driving, competitive driving, ignoring warnings and escaping police pursuit, none of which were present in this case. 50    There was evidence of a speed in excess of the limit, but it was not grossly excessive over the limit in terms of the guideline judgment, and the main features of the dangerous driving appear to have been overtaking the bus as it was pulling out, failing to keep a proper lookout, and a failure to brake in time. I would not regard these as matters of aggravation such as to indicate that the applicant had abandoned responsibility for his manner of driving. Jurisic was a case involving a plea of guilty and balancing the lack of a plea of guilty here with the lack of aggravating factors, I consider that Jurisic provides a useful guide in the present case. It is also appropriate to take into account that this sentence is to be served in protective custody and follows a lengthy period in prison as a result of the Victorian convictions for armed robbery. In these circumstances, considerations of totality and proportionality become relevant. 
     51    His Honour in his Remarks on Sentence referred to R v Jurisic and purported to apply it; but he failed to identify the circumstances of aggravation in the manner of driving which indicated that the applicant had abandoned responsibility for his conduct and were relevant to such guidelines; and I have already expressed my view that such aggravating facts were not present in the instant case: R v Howland [1999] NSWCCA 10, 104 A Crim R 273. In addition, his Honour appears to have been under the misapprehension that the armed robberies and other offences in Melbourne had been committed prior to this offence; and in these respects his Honour fell into error. 
     52    Having regard to all these matters I consider that the sentence, both as to its total term and its minimum term was excessive and that this Court should intervene. In doing so it must apply the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; R v Carrion [2000] NSWCCA 191, 49 NSWLR 149, so that the Court must set a head sentence and a non-parole period which must be not less than ¾ of the sentence unless there are special circumstances: s 44(2). I consider that the appropriate sentence is 3 years, but in view of the need for the applicant to serve the sentence in protective custody and, having regard to the almost continuous periods he will have served in gaol as a result of the Victorian convictions and this one, the need for a lengthy period under supervision on his release, I am satisfied that special circumstances exist.  
     53    I therefore propose that leave to appeal against the sentence be granted, the appeal allowed, the sentence imposed by Acting Judge Downs be quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years, to date from the 18 August 1999 with a non-parole period of 2 years. The earliest date on which the applicant will therefore be eligible for release on parole will be 17 August 2001 and I would order that on that date he be released on parole subject to the conditions imposed by the Regulations and the further condition that he be subject to the supervision of Probation and Parole Service and obey all reasonable directions of such Service.  
      
       
       ********** 
       
     54    CARRUTHERS AJ: In this matter I have the advantage of reading in draft form the judgment of Dunford J and I gratefully adopt his summation of the facts both in relation to the conviction appeal and the sentence appeal. I note that Wood CJ at CL has expressed his concurrence with the reasons of Dunford J and the orders which he proposes.  
     55    I agree that the conviction appeal should be dismissed. 
     56    As to the sentence appeal, I agree with the submission of Mr Dawe QC, counsel for the respondent Crown, that the appellant’s driving which caused the death of Winifred Mary Collins, was a flagrant example of disregard for the safety of the members of the public who might be expected to be using the roadway in that area. The overtaking of a bus which is drawing away from a bus stop is an inherently dangerous manoeuvre which could put a number of other persons at considerable risk. 
     57    In this case the risk was exacerbated because, to the knowledge of the applicant, his vehicle was approaching a pedestrian refuge. It must be borne in mind that this occurred during the afternoon of a weekday when it would be likely for pedestrians to be in the vicinity of the refuge.  
     58    During the course of his remarks on sentence, Downs DCJ stated that he had the benefit of being reminded by counsel for the applicant of the judgments of this Court in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. His Honour made no further reference to this authority.  
     59    I agree with Mr Dawe QC that in the instant case little assistance can be gained by a consideration of Jurisic. It is of interest to note in this context the following remarks by Spigelman CJ in Jurisic (at 231): - 
      
       
        
        “In my opinion this Court should promulgate the following guidelines: 
        
       
       
        
        1. A non-custodial sentence for an offence against s 52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or mis-judgment. 
        
       
       
        
        2. With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional. 
        
       
       
        
        I realise that the formulation I propose - does the relevant aggravating manifest, in the circumstances of the case, that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct - introduces an element of judgment on which reasonable minds may differ. Nevertheless the formulation of the issue in such a way will serve the objective of consistency of sentencing with respect to conduct that the community has indicated plainly that it wishes to deter and condemn. 
        
       
       
        
        The period of three or two years, once the threshold of abandoning responsibility has been reached, is a starting point. The presence of additional aggravating factors, or their increased intensity, will determine the actual sentence. This is also the approach in the English guideline judgment on rape:  
        R v Billam  
        [1986] 1 WLR 349; [1986] 1 All ER 985.” 
        
       
       
     60    However, it must immediately be noted that the Chief Justice was there concerned with a case involving a plea of guilty. A plea of guilty generally carries with it an element of contrition. The present applicant has, however, never conceded any responsibility for his conduct or demonstrated in any other way a sense of contrition.  
     61    The obvious point must also be made that subjective circumstances vary, often markedly, from case to case. I shall refer in a little more detail to that aspect shortly.  
     62    In so far as the objective circumstances are concerned, the Chief Justice referred in his judgment (at 231) to nine discrete mitigating and aggravating factors relevant to the appropriate penalty for an offence against s 52A. Four of those factors are relevant in this case. They are: - 
      
       
        
        “(i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. 
        
       
       
        
         (ii) Number of people put at risk. 
        
       
       
        
         (iii) Degree of speed. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         (v) Erratic driving.” 
        
       
       
     63    In the instant case, a death was involved which was of course a necessary element to found the conviction under s 52A(1)(c). As was pointed out in R v MacIntyre (1988) 38 A Crim. R 135 at 139, the real substance of the subject offence is not just the dangerous driving; it is the dangerous driving in association with the taking of a human life. There was also excessive speed by reference to the conditions which prevailed at the time and the place of the accident. In so far as the manner of driving is concerned, I have already referred to the inherently dangerous manoeuvre undertaken by the applicant and the number of people it potentially put at risk. These are three aggravating factors in accordance with the criteria identified by the Chief Justice.  
     64    In Jurisic the Chief Justice considered an appropriate test of aggravation was whether the offender had, by reference to the various criteria which he cited, abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. 
     65    However, the Chief Justice acknowledged that the question whether an offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her conduct introduces an element of judgment on which reasonable minds may differ. Thus, if I may respectfully say so, I do not think that his Honour intended that this phrase should have some talismanic status.  
     66    Indeed, as the Chief Justice was careful to point out, guideline judgments are intended to be indicative only.  
      
       
        
        “They are not intended to be applied to every case as if they were rules binding on sentencing Judges” 
        (at 220) 
         
        
       
     67    Having expressed these qualifications, I would, nevertheless, accept that a sentencing Judge could conclude that the manner of driving by the present applicant leading to the fatal impact could be categorised as an abandonment by him of responsibility for his conduct, particularly bearing in mind that he was driving a motor cycle and carrying a pillion passenger.  
     68    As to subjective circumstances the appellant has a bad criminal record and, in particular, an appalling driving record.  
     69    There are, on the other hand, clearly certain mitigating subjective factors, such as his diabetes, depression and the need to serve his sentence in protective custody which required (and received) consideration by the sentencing Judge.  
     70    His Honour seems to have been under the apprehension that the Victorian Armed Robbery offences were committed prior to the subject offence.  
     71    However, Mr Odgers, counsel for the applicant informed this Court that his instructions were to the contrary. There is however nothing in his Honour’s remarks on sentence to indicate that his misapprehension had any real bearing on the ultimate sentence. 
     72    In Jurisic the Chief Justice observed (at 223): - 
      
       
        
        “As in England, it appears that trial judges in New South Wales have not reflected in their sentences the seriousness with which society regards the offence of occasioning death or serious injury by dangerous driving. The existence of such disparity constitutes an appropriate occasion for the promulgation of a guideline judgment by a Court of Criminal Appeal. That is what occurred in England with respect to offences cognate with that in the instant case. 
        
       
     73    In the light of these remarks, it is interesting to note the Judicial Commission statistics relating to sentences imposed for the subject offence in Higher Courts.  
     74    The statistics for Full Terms All Offenders before Jurisic for the period December 1994 to October 1998 (a total of 25 cases) demonstrate that forty per cent of offenders (including both pleas of guilty and not guilty) received sentences of four years or more, by way of a full term. The comparable statistics after Jurisic from October 1998 to March 2000 (a total of 28 cases which would include the present case) demonstrate that only thirty per cent received sentences of four years or more by way of a full term. 
     75    Taking the same criteria for Minimum/Fixed Terms the statistics demonstrate that before Jurisic (a total of 25 cases), twenty per cent of offenders received a minimum or fixed term of three years or more. Post Jurisic (a total of 27 cases which would include the present case) only eleven per cent received a sentence of three years or more.  
     76    Making full allowance for the caution with which one must approach statistics the question must arise as to whether the perceived leniency in pre-Jurisic sentencing for offences of this nature has been influenced by the guideline judgment to the extent that one may reasonably have anticipated. In one aspect there is a clear sign of the impact of Jurisic. Thus, pre-Jurisic (a total of 75 cases) thirty three per cent of offenders were sentenced to imprisonment, whereas post-Jurisic (a total of 43 cases), sixty five per cent received sentences of imprisonment.  
     77    Nevertheless, one is left with the impression that sentencing Judges may still be failing to recognise the strong element of deterrence in sentencing for the offence of Dangerous Driving Causing Death, particularly bearing in mind the grave public concern at the rate at which fatalities occur on New South Wales roads.  
     78    For these reasons I am of the view that the head sentence was within the sentencing discretion available to his Honour.  
     79    In so far as the minimum term is concerned, his Honour concluded that there were no special circumstances. His Honour said: -  
      
       
        
        “…while supervision might help him I do not consider that it amounts to special circumstances within the meaning of the section.” 
        
       
     80    It would have been open to his Honour to have concluded that, as there was a period of only four and a half months between the expiry of the Victorian sentences and the commencement date of his Honour’s sentence, special circumstances existed. 
     81    I am unable to conclude, however, that his Honour erred in law in not coming to this conclusion. Thus in my view the minimum term fixed by his Honour was within the sentencing discretion available to him. 
     82    For these reasons I would propose that the Application for Leave to Appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.

     1    GROVE J : Jason Lee Rees was convicted of manslaughter following a trial before Bell J and a jury in the Supreme Court sitting at Wollongong. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a total term of four years and three months. There are appeals before the Court by the Crown seeking increase in sentence and by Rees against the conviction. Although he is respondent to the Crown appeal, it will be convenient to refer to him throughout as the appellant. 
      
       
        
       
     2    Some background facts and circumstances touching the course of proceedings should be sketched. 
      
       
        
       
     3    The victim was described as a small time drug dealer who lived alone in a unit dwelling in a Wollongong suburb. On the morning of 18 November 1997 he was found in that unit by a neighbour. He was beaten and bleeding and taken therefrom to hospital. He died on the next day. He was discovered to have multiple injuries but the direct cause of death was blunt force head injury. 
      
       
        
       
     4    Following investigation, the appellant and another, Mark Chipperfield, were charged with murder. Trial was scheduled to commence before Carruthers AJ on 15 June 1999. After the court assembled his Honour was informed by the Crown Prosecutor that an indictment would be presented against Chipperfield containing two counts respectively charging murder and robbery in company; that it was anticipated that Chipperfield would plead not guilty to murder but guilty to robbery and further, that, in that circumstance, the Crown would accept the latter plea in full discharge of the indictment: Maxwell v The Queen 1996 184 CLR 501. Upon Chipperfield being arraigned, the anticipation was fulfilled. His Honour was informed that it was proposed that Chipperfield be called by the Crown in the appellant’s trial. His Honour proceeded to sentence and ultimately Chipperfield was sentenced to a total of five years penal servitude with a minimum term component of three years and three months. Chipperfield did not receive discount from his sentence on account of anticipated assistance to the Crown in his evidence against the appellant. As he had been in custody since arrest on 19 November 1997, his parole eligibility date was specified as 18 February 2001.  
      
       
        
       
     5    After Chipperfield was sentenced the appellant was presented for trial upon an indictment containing a single count charging murder. At the conclusion of the trial the jury, being unable to reach agreement, were discharged without verdict. Carruthers AJ remanded the appellant for new trial, which took place before Bell J and jury and as I have already recorded, resulted in conviction for manslaughter. Bell J sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for four years and three months with a non parole period of three years and three months, and, noting the appellant’s custody since his arrest on 18 November 1997, specified a release eligibility date of 17 February 2001. 
      
       
        
       
     6    Bell J imposed sentence on the appellant on 1 September 2000. The Crown appeal alleging inadequacy was signed and lodged on 5 October and a letter of notification sent to the appellant on that day. He was formally served with the notice of appeal on 24 October. On 16 October the Criminal Appeal registry received a notice of appeal and application for leave to appeal (Criminal Appeal Rules Form IV) signed by the appellant and dated 5 October. No grounds were endorsed upon that notice and I note in passing the absence of any formal application to extend time. While the appeal was adjourned part heard this was lodged and in the circumstances, I would grant to the appellant any necessary extension to regularize the pursuit of his appeal against conviction.  
      
       
        
       
     7    On 11 December 2000, the appeals were given a hearing date for 8 February 2001. On that day (11 December) solicitors for the appellant filed a notice setting out a single ground of appeal. On 31 January 2001, those solicitors filed a further 10 grounds of appeal. I understand it to be common ground that the legal representatives of the appellant opposed the scheduling of the hearing of the appeal but that the fixture was given in response to Crown submissions focussed upon the impending eligibility for release of the appellant. Given the lastmentioned matter in particular, it is desirable that the appeals be heard and determined expeditiously. 
      
       
        
       
     8    The Crown case against the appellant was largely circumstantial. Police executing a search warrant at the appellant’s premises on 18 November 1997 noticed a Nintendo game unit which they did not at that time seize. They obviously did not appreciate its potential significance then. Two days later they returned but the unit had been sold by the appellant’s de facto wife. It was later recovered from a secondhand goods dealer and identified by a witness as that given by him to the deceased victim. There was evidence of matching DNA profile in a sample of blood taken from the victim and stain on a sports shoe belonging to the appellant. From the appellant’s garage was retrieved an orange plastic container within which was a table leg which was stained with blood of a DNA profile matching that of the deceased. This item was alleged to be the source of the blunt force injury which directly caused the death. The appellant’s motorcycle was also in the garage. There was a considerable body of evidence relating to the presence of a motorcycle in the vicinity of the victim’s premises at times pertinent to the attack upon him. There was evidence of the detection of a recently created motorcycle tyre mark nearby to the premises. Two motorcycles were described as connected with the appellant’s house, but it is unnecessary to trace all the detail of this and it suffices to observe that witnesses saw a motorcycle with two occupants at a relevant time. Attention had been drawn to it by it being involved in types of accident. The occupants were dislodged and there was a minor collision with a barrier. The occupants of the cycle were seen to have with them a piece of timber being capable of being found to be the table leg which I have mentioned was used as a weapon. 
      
       
        
       
     9    Chipperfield was called by the Crown. Leave to cross examine him was granted to the Crown Prosecutor pursuant to s38 of the Evidence Act. Otherwise unreferenced section numbers relate to that statute. Chipperfield claimed to have no memory of the events of 18 November 1997, no memory of going to the victim’s unit, of being on a motorcycle with the appellant, or intending to commit a robbery. He was shown a video recording of a police interview of him on 19 November 1997 but claimed that this did not refresh or stimulate any memory. The recording was admitted into evidence. Therein Chipperfield admitted that he went to the victim’s premises in company with the appellant; that they had travelled together on the appellant’s motorcycle; and that there had been an incident near a service station when the cycle “slipped”. He asserted that at the premises he had sought to obtain some drug from the victim (“part with your pot”) and asserted that the appellant attacked the victim with a piece of wood and it was also the appellant who took the Nintendo game from the apartment.  
      
       
        
       
     10    The appellant gave evidence. He denied being at the victim’s unit on 18 November at all, although he acknowledged that he had been there twice on the previous day, on both occasions sharing a bong of marijuana with the victim. He was in the company of Chipperfield for a time on 18 November and he described incidents concerning the motorcycle which were broadly consistent with some observations made by various witnesses, but he said that he noticed that Chipperfield at one point of time had a table leg in his possession. The appellant denied that he ever had possession of that item.  
      
       
        
       
     11    A provisional view on a matter of challenge to her Honour’s directions to the jury was indicated to the parties, however as there is an issue as to whether a new trial should be ordered it is requisite to deal with the other grounds. 
      
       
        
       
     12    I turn to the grounds of appeal lodged by the appellant. I shall set them out as expressed and where they appear to be allied it will be convenient to deal with them together.  
      
       
        
         
        GROUND 1 
         
         
          
          1. The learned trial judge erred in granting the Crown leave to cross examine the witness Mark Chipperfield pursuant to the provisions of section 38 of the Evidence Act 1995: R v Adam (1999 47 NSWLR 267). 
          
         
         
        GROUND 6 
         
         
          
          6. (i) Her Honour erred in law in admitting the ERISP of Chipperfield (ex BB) and the transcript of the ERISP (ex CC); 
          
         
         
          
           (ii) if admissible Her Honour failed to direct the jury properly or adequately as to the use to be made of this evidence. 
          
         
        
       
     13    I record that a written submission on behalf of the appellant contended that the ground raised an issue identical to one decided in R v Adam  1999 47 NSWLR 267 in respect of which, pursuant to grant of special leave, further argument in the High Court of Australia is scheduled for 30 March next. It was submitted that this appeal should be adjourned until after judgment in that case. Nevertheless the ground was addressed in the appellant’s submissions. I interpolate that counsel appearing for the appellant at trial (who did not appear in the appeal) pointed out that in the absence of prior inconsistent statement, the instant case was different from Adam (T252). However, a comment by her Honour that it was somewhat like Adam in that the Crown was seeking to call Chipperfield in order to place some of the content of his police evidence before the jury elicited an affirmation from the Crown Prosecutor. I note that the particular Crown Prosecutor had not prosecuted the inconclusive trial before Carruthers AJ nor did she appear in the appeal.  
      
       
        
       
     14    Following intimation of the Crown’s intention to call Chipperfield he was required to give evidence in a voir dire hearing conducted by her Honour. His evidence followed the pattern of that which I have recorded him as giving at the trial, in short, total memory loss for any relevant events. It appears as common ground that his testimony, such as it was, was to similar effect when he was called in the trial presided over by Carruthers AJ.  
      
       
        
       
     15    Bell J ruled against applications by the appellant that Chipperfield’s evidence be excluded either as an abuse of process or in the exercise of her discretion. She foreshadowed that, in the event that the circumstances reached the appropriate point, she would grant leave to the Crown to cross examine Chipperfield. Later she published written reasons for her rulings.  
      
       
        
       
     16    Two findings by her Honour should be noted. First, that Chipperfield’s claim of memory loss was unworthy of belief and second, that his statements to the police at interview within less than a day and a half of the killing were fresh in his memory in the sense of s66(2): Graham v The Queen 1998 195 CLR 606. 
      
       
        
       
     17    In support of ground 1 counsel for the appellant repeated, with some elaboration, the arguments rejected by this Court in Adam noting that, pursuant to the grant of special leave the challenge was currently before the High Court. Given the particular circumstances of the Crown appeal asserting inadequacy of sentence subject to which the appellant is due for release within days, adjournment would be undesirable. Insofar as it was held in Adam that the credibility provisions of Part 3.7 of the Evidence Act were not pertinent to the grant of leave to cross examine an unfavourable witness pursuant to s38, the previous decision of this Court in R v GAC unreported 1 April 1997 was then applied and has continued to be applied in subsequent cases: R v Fowler (2000) NSWCCA 142; R v Gee (2000) NSWCCA 198; R v Glasby (2000) NSWCCA 83. 
      
       
        
       
     18    In any event it can be noted that her Honour’s express finding that the prior representations by Chipperfield were fresh in his memory at the time of their being made is distinguishable from the factual matrix in Adam. Further, I perceive no error in her Honour’s acceptance of the Crown purpose in the tender of the prior inconsistent (in the sense that he now claimed a memory extinction) statement of Chipperfield was relevant not only to his credibility but also as evidence of the facts asserted. The latter is not a hearsay purpose. 
      
       
        
       
     19    Counsel referred to Lee v The Queen 1998 195 CLR 594 which held that an out of court statement which was itself a report of what another had said in proof of the truth of the content of the report was not authorized by s60. In the present case Chipperfield’s representations to the interrogating police upon which reliance was placed by the prosecution described original observations of activity by the appellant (and himself) and did not consist of mere reportage of what the appellant had told him. The stated object of a major change to previous law in permitting prior (consistent or inconsistent) statements to be available as evidence of the matters therein (Australian Law Reform Commission Report No 26) has been achieved by the legislation.  
      
       
        
       
     20    However it was further argued that the concession by Chipperfield that he had in fact been interviewed resulted in the non fulfilment of a requirement of s43(2) and it was therefore erroneous to give leave pursuant to s38. For at least two reasons the submission must be rejected. Chipperfield conceded that he had made a statement by his acknowledgment that he had been interviewed but s43(2) refers to refusal to admit the making of an inconsistent statement. The claim of total memory loss does not constitute an admission of making such a prior inconsistent statement. It is necessary for the statement to have quality. Second, subsections 1(a) (b) and (c) of s38 are disjunctively expressed and it is only s38(1)(c) which refers in terms to a prior inconsistent statement.  
      
       
        
       
     21    Her Honour did not err in permitting cross examination of Chipperfield. Nor did she err in admitting the video recording of the police interview and subject to the requisite caution (Butera v D.P.P. (Vic)  1987 164 CLR 180) the transcript of the sound track. In confirmation of the distinction between the present case and the facts in Lee, her Honour directed the jury that the Crown relied upon two matters articulated in Chipperfield’s interview: the presence of the appellant at the victim’s premises and their both being mounted on the motorcycle during a journey between a service station and those premises. Her Honour’s instructions to the jury were both proper and adequate.  
      
       
        
         
         
         
        GROUNDS 2 to 5 
         
         
        2. Her Honour the trial judge erred in law in leaving and putting manslaughter to the jury. 
         
         
        3. Her Honour erred in law in directing and failing to direct the jury as to armed robbery. 
         
         
        4. Her Honour erred in law in directing and failing to direct the jury as to the joint enterprise and/or common purpose. 
         
         
        5. Her Honour erred in law in directing and failing to direct the jury as to manslaughter. 
         
        
       
     22    The Crown case, as is manifest in the indictment, alleged that the appellant was guilty of murder. Of that he stands acquitted and it is important to focus directly upon the crime of manslaughter for which he was convicted. It was complained that neither the Crown nor counsel for the defence at trial sought that the possibility of conviction for manslaughter be left to the jury. However it is well established that the course taken by the defence does not relieve a judge from putting any matters upon which they might find for an accused: Pemble v The Queen 1971 124 CLR 107. The principle extends to the possibility of finding an accused guilty of a lesser crime which is an available alternative to that charged in an indictment. 
      
       
        
       
     23    The directions to the jury by Bell J were, of course, initially directed to the charge of murder and her oral charge was supplemented by written instruction. It is convenient to extract these instructions in which the basis upon which consideration of manslaughter was invited can be discerned. 
      
       
        
       
     24    The direction was in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “The Crown will prove the accused guilty of murder if and only if it proves the following beyond reasonable doubt: 
          
         
         
          
          1. David Palin died as a result of injuries inflicted on him at his home on the morning of 18 November 1997; and 
          
         
         
          
          2. The accused was a party to a joint criminal enterprise with Mark Chipperfield to rob David Palin while they were armed with a wooden table leg; and 
          
         
         
          
          3. The accused was present when the injuries were inflicted upon David Palin; and either 
          
         
         
          
          4. The accused struck David Palin intending to kill him or to do him grievous bodily harm (grievous bodily harm means really serious bodily injury); or 
          
         
         
          
          5. Mark Chipperfield struck David Palin intending to kill him or to do him grievous bodily harm and that the accused realised that it was possible that in the course of carrying out the robbery Chipperfield might intentionally inflict grievous bodily harm on David Palin. 
          
         
         
          
          In the event that the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt the above elements the accused is guilty of murder. 
          
         
         
          
          If the Crown fails to prove beyond reasonable doubt the matters set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 the accused is not guilty of murder. You go no further. 
          
         
         
          
          If the Crown proves each of the matters set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 but fails to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt either that the accused struck the deceased intending to do him grievous bodily harm (paragraph 4) or that he realised that as a possible incident of carrying out the joint criminal enterprise grievous bodily harm might be intentionally inflicted (paragraph 5), you would go on to consider the alternative charge of manslaughter. 
          
         
         
          
          In such a case you must consider whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused realised that a possible incident of carrying out the armed robbery was that some harm might be occasioned to David Palin being something more than trivial harm although less than really serious bodily injury. In the event that you were so satisfied (and only provided you were satisfied that the Crown had proved each of the matters set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 and that either the accused or Mark Chipperfield struck the deceased causing the injuries) the accused is guilty of manslaughter. If the Crown fails to so satisfy you the accused is not guilty. 
          
         
         
          
          In the event that the Crown fails to satisfy you that the injuries were inflicted on the deceased by a person who thereby intended to kill or to do grievous bodily harm to him the accused is not guilty of murder. In this case you go on to consider whether he is guilty of manslaughter. In such a case if the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused realised that it was possible that some harm might be occasioned to David Palin being something more than trivial harm (and only provided you were satisfied that the Crown had proved each of the matters set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 and that either the accused or Mark Chipperfield struck the deceased causing the injuries) the accused is guilty of manslaughter. If the Crown fails to so satisfy you the accused is not guilty.” 
          
         
        
       
     25    It can be concluded that the jury made the essential finding that the appellant was a party to a joint criminal enterprise with Chipperfield to commit robbery whilst armed with the table leg. Assuming the killing to be felonious, that crime was incidental to the common purpose and if the jury were not satisfied that the appellant was the actual assailant and unable to be satisfied as to which of the appellant and Chipperfield was the assailant, the appellant’s liability arose out of the commission of this incidental crime to the enterprise of robbery conveniently categorized in cases such as R v Tangye 1997 92 A Crim R 546 and R v Chai (2000) NSWCCA 320 as participation in an “extended joint criminal enterprise”. It was therefore not inappropriate for the jury to be directed to approach the matter in accordance with developed principles relevant to common purpose: contrast R v Clough 1992 28 NSWLR 396.  
      
       
        
       
     26    At the hearing of the appeal investigation was directed to consideration of whether there was error in leaving to the jury the possibility of conviction for manslaughter on the basis that the knowledge of the appellant was no more than a realization that in carrying out the armed robbery some harm might be occasioned to the victim, being something more than trivial but less than really serious bodily injury.  
      
       
        
       
     27    The contemplation of these directions was raised in discussion with counsel after the close of the evidence but before her Honour’s summing up. The exchange was relatively short and, as transcribed, was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “HER HONOUR: Can I take up the further directions because it seems to me that I must also direct them that in the event that the Crown failed to satisfy the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused realised that as a possible incident of carrying out the common purpose grievous bodily harm might intentionally be inflicted they would need to consider the alternative charge of manslaughter and in that case if the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused realised that a possible incident of carrying out the armed robbery was that some harm might be occasioned to David Palin being something more than trivial harm although less than really serious bodily injury and in the event that they were satisfied as to the existence of the common purpose the presence of the accused at the scene then they might return a verdict of manslaughter. 
          
         
         
          
          Similarly it seems to me if the Crown failed to satisfy them that any of the blows inflicted on Mr Palin were inflicted by either man with an intention to do grievous bodily harm then provided the Crown had proved the other ingredients, the common purpose, the presence of the accused at the scene and the striking by one or other of them, and provided that the accused realised that it was possible that some harm might be occasioned to Mr Palin being something more than trivial harm then again he would be guilty of manslaughter. 
          
         
         
          
          SPENCER: I need to take that in your Honour. I must say I hadn’t given manslaughter a lot of thought. I know you have to put it. My case is obviously not of manslaughter. 
          
         
         
          
          HER HONOUR: I understand that, Mr Spencer, but it does seem to me that it should be in both instances put. Madam Crown, do you wish to be heard on that? 
          
         
         
          
          CROWN PROSECUTOR: I don’t wish to be heard. It is very difficult. I don’t think I could argue against it at all your Honour. 
          
         
         
          
          HER HONOUR: Yes. It seems to me that it is a conceivable view of the evidence. Certainly the first alternative that I would put, namely, that the accused had not realised the possibility of the deliberate or the intentional infliction of GBH. In the light of the extensive nature of the injuries suffered it might be thought rather less available for a jury to consider manslaughter on the basis of a lack of satisfaction of the intentional infliction of GBH by either, but it seems to me wise to leave it. Are there any other matters then? You are ready, Madam Crown?” 
          
         
        
       
     28    Thereafter, as I have recorded, the charge to the jury was supplemented by the written direction. No objection to this direction was taken and specifically no objection was taken to the direction concerning the level of knowledge to be possessed by the appellant in order to found his liability for manslaughter.  
      
       
        
       
     29    Counsel for the appellant in this Court commented that, given the evidence of the extent of the victim’s injuries, it could not realistically be argued that the perpetrator other than intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. The comment was justified. It follows that the jury were not satisfied that the appellant was the perpetrator because, if they were, conviction for murder would have been inevitable. The remaining issue therefore is, it not being established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the perpetrator, whether he is liable for manslaughter because being a participant in a joint enterprise to rob, someone committed an incidental criminal killing, he having anticipated, not the grievous bodily harm which in fact was inflicted, but some harm less than that but more than trivial. 
      
       
        
       
     30    The expression of the standard of knowledge so limited is consistent with language affirmed in England in Director of Public Prosecutions v Newbury 1977 AC 500 in relation to liability for manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. However in Newbury the House of Lords maintained an objective test, namely whether sober and reasonable people would recognize an act as dangerous in the sense of carrying with it the risk of some harm whether or not the accused recognized its danger. That standard was rejected in Australia by the majority judgment in Wilson v The Queen 1992 174 CLR 313, and a test of an appreciable risk of serious injury was laid down. The doctrine which supported the category which had come to be known as battery manslaughter was also disapproved. In dealing with it their Honours remarked that that idea did nothing to advance the law in what is, in any event, a somewhat clouded area. The current issues offer endorsement of the latter observation. 
      
       
        
       
     31    The question arises whether it was correct to invite a test requiring a different and lesser standard from Wilson giving rise to a liability for manslaughter (recognizing that the liability is not alleged to derive from the appellant himself engaging in an unlawful and dangerous act by striking the victim). Second, if such a test is appropriate, can it be applied subjectively as her Honour’s written direction to the jury invited. 
      
       
        
       
     32    I consider that the first question should be answered in the negative. No authority directly in point has been cited but I am unable to discern any reason for application of a standard in these circumstances different from that authorized by Wilson.  
      
       
        
       
     33    The aptness of the Wilson test to the present circumstances was tacitly acknowledged in written submissions by the Crown which included: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “28. Her Honour directed the jury that the contemplated harm must be ‘something more than trivial harm although less than really serious bodily harm’. The Crown submits that the direction met the test referred to in  
          Wilson v The Queen 
           (1992) 174 CLR 313 that the contemplated act carries with it an appreciable risk of serious injury. The direction given by her Honour clearly conveyed that to the jury.” 
          
         
         
        I regret that I am unable to assess the expressions as interchangeable. 
         
        
       
     34    I recognize that Wilson dealt with involuntary manslaughter and laid down that it was limited to the categories of unlawful and dangerous act on the one hand and criminal negligence on the other. In my opinion, criminal liability for the same crime deriving from participation in an extended joint criminal enterprise cannot be based upon a different and lower standard. 
      
       
        
       
     35    The answer to the second question which I have posed will require analysis of complex matters touching upon not only an objective standard for liability but the requirement of proof by the Crown of the extent of knowledge of the participant in a joint enterprise and the relationship between those two matters. As I have said when setting out the history of the trials of the appellant there are compelling circumstances requiring that this appeal be determined without further delay. Given the view which I have formed of the failure to leave the issue of manslaughter to the jury in accordance with the Wilson test it is unnecessary to decide the second question and I would reserve my opinion upon it. 
      
       
        
         
        GROUND 7 
         
         
          
          Her Honour erred in law in directing and failing to direct as to lies. 
          
         
        
       
     36    Insofar as this ground asserts her Honour failed to give a direction concerning lies it is a mis-statement and her directions on the subject are revealed in the transcription of her charge to the jury. At trial, her Honour’s intention to give the jury directions concerning the telling of lies by the appellant was canvassed prior to commencing her summing up and after the directions were in fact given, no redirections were sought by trial counsel who was clearly alert to protect the appellant’s interests in this regard.  
      
       
        
       
     37    It is unnecessary to reproduce her Honour’s directions in this regard. It suffices to say that she correctly directed the jury on the pre-conditions which needed to be met. Some submissions have been made as to the capacity of lies on two aspects being material issues. These are the lies told by the applicant in relation to the false alibi and the presence of the appellant upon his motorcycle in particular circumstances on the morning of 18 November. I would reject the submissions that her Honour erred in either of these regards.  
      
       
        
       
     38    A submission was made that her Honour had reversed the onus of proof in respect of the second matter which I have mentioned when she said: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “Again, you may think there is some difficulty in concluding they related to a material issue. With respect to the account that it was Chipperfield who had the bike that morning the accused in his evidence says he wanted to distance himself from any trouble arising out of the incident at the Ampol Service Station and that is why he told a lie to the police. If you accept that then, plainly enough, it would not be evidence of its (of) his consciousness of guilt with the offence with which he is charged.” 
          
         
        
       
     39    The Crown has pointed out that the use of the introductory word “again” is difficult to place in context but this does not seem to be any consequence. Her Honour had emphatically directed the jury, on more than one occasion, that it was the Crown who had to prove the matters upon which it relied and in the absence of any complaint from counsel at trial I am unprepared to extract the few words out of the context and conclude that the jury might have understood that it was the accused who had to sustain his explanation as to why he told a lie to police.  
      
       
        
         
        GROUND 8 
         
          
           
          Her Honour erred in law in directing and failing to direct the jury as to the evidence of Chipperfield as to unreliability and as an accomplice. 
          
         
        
       
     40    Her Honour gave warnings to the jury about the evidence of Chipperfield in accordance with s165. She expressly warned the jury that his evidence may be unreliable and that they should scrutinize it with care. She explained to the jury that the warning was given because he was a person who might reasonably be supposed to have been involved in the fatal attack upon the deceased. Insofar as the matters are also sought to be raised, it can be observed that her Honour added to the warnings reference to the contents of the interview of Chipperfield being hearsay and not subjected to cross examination. 
      
       
        
       
     41    Trial counsel sought no redirections or supplementary directions.  
      
       
        
         
        GROUND 9 
         
         
          
          Her Honour erred in law in admitting the evidence of the ERISP of the appellant. 
          
         
        
       
     42    Objection was taken at trial to the admission of this material on the basis that the appellant was affected by drugs which he had ingested and, second, on the basis that the police had acted improperly in persisting to interview him after he had indicated that he did not wish to speak further.  
      
       
        
       
     43    On this issue her Honour had taken evidence on voir dire and it was her finding that in fact the ingestion of drugs by the appellant was such that it was unlikely that the truth of any admissions was adversely affected. That finding has not been shown to be wrong. The admissions were not of course confessional but related to statements made by the appellant which were relied upon by the Crown because in part it betrayed a detailed knowledge of the circumstances of the offence and otherwise he sought to raise an alibi which the Crown was seeking to demonstrate was false.  
      
       
        
       
     44    It was a finding of her Honour that the continuation of questioning after the appellant indicated that he wished to see a solicitor was not, in the circumstances, unfair. Her Honour did not find that there was intimidation, importuning or sustained or undue pressure. Her finding has not been demonstrated to be wrong.  
      
       
        
         
        GROUNDS 10 and 11 
         
         
          
          Her Honour erred in law in not putting the accused’s case as an entity (entirety?) and failing to put the facts adequately or properly as to the elements of the offence of armed robbery and/or manslaughter. 
          
         
         
          
          There has been a miscarriage of justice in that, the verdict of the jury is unsafe and unsatisfactory as it was not, upon the whole of the evidence, open for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. 
          
         
        
       
     45    There was abundant evidence to sustain the finding that the appellant was a participant in a joint enterprise to rob the victim, in the course of which he was fatally beaten. The appellant’s case was that he was not there at all. The complaint that her Honour failed to adequately put his case cannot be sustained. Save the direction relating to the elements of manslaughter, I am unpersuaded that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.  
      
       
        
       
     46    This leads to determination of the outcome of the appeal. I have already set out the details of the seemingly incongruous position in which the Crown found itself having given Chipperfield the opportunity to plead guilty to robbery in discharge of an indictment for murder and then conducting a case against his alleged co-offender on the basis that either that co-offender or Chipperfield was the perpetrator of the killing. Both the appellant and Chipperfield had significant prior records and I have observed that Chipperfield received a longer overall sentence for robbery than the appellant received for manslaughter, although the minimum term/non parole specifications in each case for the respective crimes was identical. They are eligible for release on succeeding days. In a broad sense of distributive justice it could be argued to be appropriate that substantially equivalent terms be served by both of them. However, dismissal of the appeal by the appellant would result in there remaining upon his record conviction for manslaughter and although the evidence of his participation in the robbery is overwhelming there is no power to substitute a conviction for robbery (similar to that imposed upon Chipperfield) in this Court. The misdirection related to a matter of substance and although no point was taken at trial, it would be inappropriate to apply Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. Regrettable though I consider it is in the whole of the circumstances, I conclude that the appeal should be allowed.  
      
       
        
       
     47    A submission was received that, in the event of the appeal being allowed, a verdict and judgment of acquittal should be entered. It was argued that there was no basis upon which manslaughter could be left to the jury at all and a number of postulations were offered about what might have been the situation given the jury’s findings. I reject the contention that the only available alternatives were conviction of murder or acquittal. 
      
       
        
       
     48    The ground upon which the appellant will succeed relates to misdirection, following the subject being expressly raised by the learned trial judge and upon which it appears that trial counsel were content. I am conscious that, if it is ultimately determined to be held, it would be a third trial of the appellant, however in all the circumstances I would exercise discretion to make the order. 
      
       
        
       
     49    The consequence of allowing the appeal is that the Crown appeal asserting inadequacy of sentence becomes technically otiose. It must therefore be dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
       
     1    GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed upon the applicant by the Chief Judge of the District Court. On 31 March 2000 the applicant appeared before his Honour and pleaded guilty to one count of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to ss25 and 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Such an offence exposed him to a potential maximum penalty of fifteen years imprisonment together with a pecuniary penalty. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of two years divided into minimum and additional terms of eighteen and six months respectively. 
      
       
        
       
     2    The applicant is a comparatively young man born on 30 January 1979. When he appeared for sentence before his Honour, however, he was not without significant prior record; significant in the sense there was on his record a conviction for armed robbery. This robbery took place five days before the applicant attained his eighteenth birthday. When dealt with he was sentenced to a period of two years penal servitude but was permitted to serve that by way of periodic detention. 
      
       
        
       
     3    For the purpose of this application there has been put before the Court a schedule of the attendances of the applicant in that periodic detention. It shows that he commenced serving detention on 5 September 1997 but that by 22 January 1999 there had been six unauthorised absences from attendance. The schedule also shows that subsequent to those six, which I have mentioned, there were two further absences unauthorised. The record also shows, however, that in the immediate weeks prior to his arrest and being placed in custody in respect of the current matter he had attended. 
      
       
        
       
     4    The facts of the current offence are relatively unremarkable. The applicant was seen in a motor vehicle, he was stopped by police, it is mentioned that the vehicle itself was given an infringement notice for defective tyres, but in the course of investigation the police sought to search the applicant and whilst removing his underpants a white sock fell on the floor, it was seen to contain a white power. There have been some disputes between the applicant and the police as to what he said on this occasion and that matter was canvassed by the learned sentencing Judge. It does not seem to me to be important to investigate, bearing in mind the plea of guilty entered by the applicant was specifically to supplying a prohibited drug, namely, cocaine. 
      
       
        
       
     5    Two matters have been canvassed specifically in support of the application. In the course of his remarks on sentence, his Honour made reference to the offence of armed robbery on the applicant's record to which I have made earlier reference, and he said this: ""He was born in 1979 and the offences that he got the periodic detention for were offences of robbery which were committed by the look of it just after he had turned eighteen"". As I have already mentioned, the offence in fact took place five days before the applicant turned eighteen. What his Honour said was, therefore, not precisely accurate but in so far as it amounts to an inaccuracy it is, in my view, entirely immaterial to the outcome of the sentencing proceedings. 
      
       
        
       
     6    The second matter which was canvassed on behalf of the applicant related to another part of his Honour's remarks on sentence, this time with reference to the attendances for periodic detention. What his Honour had said was: ""It can be seen that at about the time of the commission of this offence he was not living up to the expectations the Court had placed upon him in respect to his periodic detention sentence and indeed he became involved in the commission of a very serious offence"". It is argued that that statement is, to say the least, ambiguous in the sense that the record shows that at the actual time of this offence the applicant had attended at least on the last five occasions that he had been required to attend for periodic detention. I would not understand his Honour to be making precise reference to that circumstance. Indeed, as has been pointed out in submissions put before the Court by the Crown, the cancellation of the periodic detention order was not due to non-attendance immediately before his arrest but for the non-attendance on the accumulation of other occasions which I have already scheduled. 
      
       
        
       
     7    The issue before this Court is whether or not his Honour has made an error in law or whether or not there is some factual error which requires the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court. The sentence imposed upon the applicant, given the circumstances and his background, seems to me to be well within the range of his Honour's discretionary judgment. I am unpersuaded he has made any error. It needs to be remembered that the jurisdiction of this Court is to substitute another sentence which it thinks would be appropriate in all the circumstances - I refer to s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. It seems to me in terms of that Act that no other sentence other than that imposed by his Honour was appropriate. 
      
       
        
       
     8    I would grant the application for leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
        
       
     9    HULME J: I agree with the order proposed and with his Honour's reasons. 
      
       
        
       
     10    GROVE J: The order of the Court will be as I proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
       
     1    GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed in the Sydney District Court by Howie DCJ (as he then was). 
      
       
        
       
     2    The applicant had appeared for trial before his Honour and a jury charged with the offence of robbery in company whilst armed with a dangerous weapon and larceny of a motor vehicle. Pursuant to directions by his Honour the applicant was found not guilty on the first count but was convicted by the jury of the available alternative of robbery in company. It can be seen that the distinction was that the aggravating circumstance of being armed with a dangerous weapon was omitted from the offence of which the applicant was ultimately convicted. 
      
       
        
       
     3    After conviction his Honour was asked to take into account on a Form 1 under the Criminal Procedure Act a comparatively minor offence of driving whilst disqualified. Whilst the offence itself was comparatively minor it bore some relevance to the facts and circumstances of this crime. 
      
       
        
       
     4    The crime itself was serious to a very high degree; it was obviously planned. A number of men in a stolen vehicle approached the jewellery store of Percy Marks Jewellers at about 9.30am on the morning of 23 September 1996. At least one of the men was equipped with a sledge hammer. There was a forced entry into the store and, as the learned sentencing Judge observed, it is apparent that the participants were aware of the necessity to have equipment enabling entry into the more secured areas of the store. This was achieved and jewellery valued at more than half a million dollars was taken from the store. It is true that access to a safe was not ultimately gained but, as I have indicated, there was a considerable amount of loot taken. The robbers escaped in the stolen vehicle. 
      
       
        
       
     5    Police who were nearby for an unassociated reason came to the scene and shots were fired. The applicant who was, whilst disqualified, driving the car was wounded. It is not necessary for present purposes to detail all the circumstances so it suffices to observe that these were related by the sentencing Judge and I would adopt what he has said about it. It appears that the wound to the applicant may have resulted from the shattering of glass when a bullet struck the vehicle which was later abandoned. Even the few words that I have used to describe it, confirm that the offence was an audacious exercise. 
      
       
        
       
     6    At the time the applicant appeared before Howie DCJ his Honour recorded the situation that it was only the applicant who had been arrested and charged, although obviously there were other offenders involved. 
      
       
        
       
     7    The applicant, who is a comparatively young man, is now aged twenty six years. He was born on 2 December 1974. He is an Aboriginal Australian and it is appropriate for any sentencing court to take that circumstance into account. The circumstance is ordinarily taken into account and should be taken into account in favour of leniency being extended to the applicant. The extent of leniency, however, must vary in accordance with the seriousness of the crime and other relevant circumstances. The conclusion his Honour reached was, on the charge of robbery in company, the applicant should be sentenced to a total term of seven years and one month divided into a minimum term of four years and one month and an additional term of three years, during which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole. 
      
       
        
       
     8    His Honour explained the apparently awkward figures as deriving from his giving credit to the applicant for the period in custody. From time to time after arrest and charge he was refused bail, released on bail and for a time was taken into custody in respect of another offence. It is not necessary presently to schedule what I might describe as the ins and outs of the applicant to custody. Suffice it to say that his Honour took this matter properly into account. On the charge of stealing the motor vehicle the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of twelve months penal servitude, which has already been served and is expired. His Honour took into account the charge of driving whilst disqualified, mentioned on the Form 1 in respect of the first count. 
      
       
        
       
     9    The applicant appeared for himself in the application before the Court. He has tendered to the Court a moving document which sets out the difficulty which he is encountering in his current custody. He has pointed out he is in maximum security and remains in maximum security although there is only a little over two years until he is eligible for consideration of parole. He has also mentioned matters of tension, hatred and violence which particularly effects him in Goulburn where he is being held; these matters he perceives as related to his Aboriginality. 
      
       
        
       
     10    The circumstances in which he is held and the difficulty which he is encountering are not matters which can be considered by this court on appeal unless a basis is shown for this court intervening and imposing sentence itself. For my part I have sympathy with the applicant in the problems which he is encountering but it must be understood that this is not a court of general review but a court of error. Our jurisdiction can only be exercised if there has been some miscarriage in the court below. It is not suggested that the learned sentencing Judge made any error of law nor misapprehended any fact that was put before him. The sentence itself, given the high level of seriousness of the circumstances and the applicant's own background, makes the imposition well within the range of the sound exercise of his Honour's discretion. Indeed, viewed objectively many people would think that any error in the sentence would be on the side of leniency. I am unable to come to the conclusion that we should intervene as invited by the applicant. 
      
       
        
       
     11    As I have said, he substantially asks this Court to review the sentence but that is not the function of this Court neither is it our jurisdiction. 
      
       
        
       
     12    In all the circumstances, therefore, given the length of sentence I would grant the application for leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
        
       
     13    HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed and in substance with his Honour's reasons. I would add only this; the applicant did ask that the Court look at the whole matter. Having done so, I take the view that the applicant was probably fortunate in not receiving a heavier sentence. Serious offences have to be met by serious penalties. A robbery such as occurred in this case involving half a million dollars or more has to be regarded as a very serious offence. The maximum which could have been imposed under the section is twenty years, although it may well be that in practical terms because this was only a robbery in company rather than one involving dangerous weapons, the maximum should be regarded as somewhat less but compared against either the twenty years or that lesser figure for a half million dollar robbery, eight and a half years is by no means excessive. 
      
       
        
       
     14    The applicant has an appalling record and unless after this sentence he reforms, he is going to have to spend probably most of the rest of his life in gaol. The hardship he has referred to in his submissions is something which he should try to remove for the future by not committing offences again. 
      
       
        
       
     15    GROVE J: The order of the Court is that the application for leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

      REGINA v Ronald Albert MILLS 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1   HEYDON JA: I agree with Barr J. 
      
       
     2   BARR J: The appellant Ronald Albert Mills appeals against convictions and sentences entered in the District Court. He was arraigned before a jury on three charges of having had sexual intercourse with the complainant, whom I will call S, without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting, she then being under the age of sixteen years. Each offence was charged as having taken place at the same time, which was a day between 1 January and 9 October 1982. The appellant was also arraigned on a charge that at the same time and place he indecently assaulted S. He pleaded guilty to that charge. In due course the jury convicted him of two of the three charges of having sexual intercourse without consent and acquitted him of the third. 
      
       
     3   On the two counts of sexual intercourse without consent Freeman DCJ sentenced the appellant to concurrent terms each of three years’ imprisonment, comprising a minimum term of one year nine months and an additional term of one year three months. For the offence of indecent assault his Honour sentenced the appellant to a concurrent fixed term of six months. 
      
       
     4   During 1982 S was living with her parents and other family in a place it is not necessary to identify. Her family attended the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints and she also participated in Church services and activities. She attended youth groups, working bees and the like, as did members of her family. The appellant, who was then aged about fifty-two years, attended the Church as well and occupied a position of some seniority in the congregation. 
      
       
     5   One day there was a working bee and S and her sister L, who was a year older than she, attended as well. There was a room called the Youth Group Room which was going to be painted, and the children were removing furniture in preparation. During the performance of this task S re-entered the room in order to take out a table. Whilst she was in the room she heard the door shut, looked up and saw the appellant. He locked the door by depressing a button on the handle. As a result, the door could be opened from the inside but not from the outside. S was in the centre of the room and the appellant approached her. He undid his trousers and belt and put down his underpants. His erect penis was exposed. He told her to touch his penis. She said that she would not and he took her hand and put it on his penis, rubbing it up and down. He told her to go over to the table. She said that she would not and he replied, “Do it”. She obeyed and he told her to “wank him”. She did not understand and said so, and he forced his hand on hers on his penis. As that happened he lifted her dress, pulled down her underpants and put his fingers in her vagina. It hurt. Then he told her to put her mouth on his penis and she did so. He put his hand on her head and pushed it whilst his penis was in her mouth. All the while he was touching her sexually in other ways. After that he knelt on the floor in front of her as she stood and put his tongue inside her vagina. He required her then to put her mouth on his penis and again inserted a hand into her vagina. The episode came to an end when she struck him in the groin with her knee, pulled up her pants and left the room. 
      
       
     6   S spoke to nobody about this until she told her mother six months later that the appellant had locked her in a room, put his fingers in her vagina and made her do things. That was S’s version. Her mother told the jury that S had told her that the appellant had locked her in the room and put his hand down her pants. 
      
       
     7   When S’s mother learned of the appellant’s misconduct she reported the matter to the church authorities and a formal meeting, called an Elders’ Court, was held. A record of the meeting came into evidence. It includes this passage - 
      
       
        
         
         Bro Mills said that approx 6 months ago, during some maintenance work at …, he chastened some young children who were making quite a disturbance in one of the rooms. He said that he then felt upset at being hard on them. One of the young girls was still in the room and so he began to console her by a simple embrace. He said that this action led to his fondling her (beneath her clothing) where he ought not to (pelvic region). 
         
        
       
     8   The appellant gave evidence and denied that any of the acts described by S took place. Explaining his plea of guilty to the fourth charge, he said that he had been at the Church one day and had heard children making a lot of noise. He had gone into the room from which the noise was coming in order to ask those responsible to be quiet. He had seen S and L and in an effort to maintain such friendliness as was proper had put his arms around both of them, so that one was on either side of him. He had spoken to them for a minute or so and L had left the room. S was upset, apparently at the reproof, and kept hugging him. His evidence continued - 
      
       
        
         
         For some unknown reason I don’t know why and I’ve never really forgiven myself, I placed my hand under her dress and while cuddling her fondled her in the pelvic (sic) region. 
         
        
       
     9   The appellant’s evidence in chief was thus consistent with what he had told the Elders’ Court. 
      
       
     10   When cross-examined at the trial the appellant said that he had touched S on the pubic region, which he defined as the region below the navel and in front of the lower part of the abdomen and between the tops of the thighs, and above the vagina. It was on the outside of her underpants. He explained that when he told the Elders’ Court that he had fondled S beneath her clothing, he had meant under her dress. 
      
       
     11   L gave evidence denying that the appellant had ever held her and S in the embrace he described in his evidence. 
      
       
     12   For the first count the Crown relied on the insertion of the appellant’s penis into S’s mouth, for the second on the insertion of the fingers into her vagina and for the third on his putting his tongue into her vagina. 
      
       
     13   The first two grounds of appeal are that the verdicts are inconsistent and that the guilty verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. A single complaint is raised, namely that the only evidence capable of convicting the appellant was that of S herself, that it was denied on oath by the appellant, that the jury had a reasonable doubt about S’s evidence on the third count and that accordingly they were bound to entertain the same doubt on the other counts. Reference was made to the judgment of the majority of the Justices of the High Court of Australia in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439. It was submitted that there was nothing in S’s evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gave any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to the first and second counts than it was in relation to the third: Jones v The Queen per Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ at 453. 
      
       
     14   The courts have repeatedly expressed reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent, such is the respect that must be accorded to the functions which the law assigns to juries and to the advantage juries have in assessing the reliability of witnesses at first hand. If there is a proper way by which an appellate court may reconcile verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their function as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. McKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348. If the party contending for it establishes an apparent inconsistency of verdicts, therefore, the duty of the Court is to enquire whether the verdicts may properly be reconciled. 
      
       
     15   Even if it is not possible to point to circumstances which justify the jury’s discrimination between counts, however, it may not be necessary to set aside a verdict of guilty on one count because it may appear that the jury has returned a merciful verdict of not guilty on another, though satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. The right of juries to return such verdicts is not doubted: McKenzie v The Queen per Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ at 367, approving the judgment of King CJ in R v Kirkman (1987) 44 SASR 591 at 593. See also R v Crisologo (1997) 99 A Crim R 178 per Simpson J at 184. 
      
       
     16   It was submitted by the Crown that the verdicts were not inconsistent, or at least not inconsistent to the degree that made it necessary for this Court to intervene. Because S’s evidence on the first two counts was far more detailed than that on the third count, it was submitted, the jury might have given the appellant the benefit of the doubt on that count. 
      
       
     17   The transcript shows that there was an extended description of what the appellant did before he penetrated S with his finger. Then followed a detailed description of the first and second acts of digital penetration and the first and second acts of fellatio, interspersed with descriptions of other sexual contact and statements about S’s pain, disgust and desire to vomit. The circumstances of the single act of cunnilingus was related thus - 
      
       
     18   In chief - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. What happened after that? 
          
         A. He pulled away. Knelt down on the ground. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Where was he in relation to your body when he leant down? 
          
         A. In front of me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did his hands make contact with your body at that stage or anything on your body? 
          
         (No verbal reply) 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did he actually do? 
          
         A. He put his tongue inside my vagina. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How was it that he was able to do that? 
          
         A. Kneeling down. I was standing up and he was kneeling down. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was any adjustment made to your clothing by either one of you? 
          
         A. Well my dress was up and my pants were down. 
         
        
       
     19   In cross-examination - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. What was the next thing that was done or said? 
          
         A. He pushed me away and then he told me to kneel down. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He told you to kneel down? 
          
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you knelt down is that right? 
          
         A. No sorry, sorry start again? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes certainly? 
          
         A. When he did that-- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When he did what? 
          
         A. When I put - had his thing in my mouth, well he moved away and then he did that to me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He did what to you? 
          
         A. He put his tongue in my vagina. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Just going back a fraction, when you say that you had your mouth on his penis, both of you were standing and you were leaning over is that right? 
          
         (No verbal reply) 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say that he put his mouth (sic) in your vagina is that right? 
          
         A. Mm mm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did he remain standing? 
          
         A. No. He kneeled. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He kneeled? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He was right in front of you when it was happening I take it? 
          
         A. In front. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And then I think you said that while you were standing and he was kneeling, that he put his tongue in your vagina? 
          
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I take it you had your legs together at that time? 
          
         A. At that time I was just standing. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But your legs weren’t deliberately apart? 
          
         A. No they weren’t no. 
         
        
       
     20   It seems to me that whilst the evidence of S on the third count was given more economically than that on the other counts, not being accompanied by understandable statements about how she felt and the like, it was unambiguous and sufficient if believed to sustain a conviction. I do not think that such a comparison explains the differential verdicts. 
      
       
     21   The Crown’s second submission was that the jury might be taken to have extended a degree of mercy towards the appellant. They may have considered that in view of his advanced age (sixty-nine years at the time of trial), the fact that he had already been punished by his Church, that there was only one occasion of criminal behaviour and that the events happened many years ago, it would be sufficient if he were convicted of only three of the four offences charged. 
      
       
     22   I do not agree with that submission. In view of the fact that the appellant did not raise his good character, that he admitted an indecent assault and in view of the gross violations of a girl of the age of twelve or thirteen years I think it unlikely that the jury would have wished to extend mercy in the manner contended for. Moreover, the act forming the basis of the third count was in every way as serious as the others. 
      
       
     23   There is one part of the evidence which might possibly explain why the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the third count. During the cross-examination of S there were these questions and answers - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Now at the time he lifted your dress up, your underpants around your ankles is that right? 
          
         A. He put my underpants, he put my underpants down and he lifted my dress up. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did your dress stay up? 
          
         A. It’s a boob tube thing. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did the bottom part of it stay up? 
          
         A. Just did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you got onto the desk how did your dress stay up around your waist then. When you got onto the desk? 
          
         A. I was just sitting on the desk and it was up. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You’d been standing hadn’t you? 
          
         A. Mm mm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you were standing, how was your dress up, what held it up? 
          
         A. It’s a terry-towelling, like a towelling dress it’s a tight thing, just - I don’t know I never touched it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You never touched it? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say that at some stage your dress had been pulled up by Mr Mills is that right? 
          
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But he didn’t continue to hold it there did he? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you didn’t hold it? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you’re not sure really whether your dress was still up, are you, when you were standing near the desk? 
          
         A. Yes it was up. 
         
        
       
     24   The Court has not been furnished with a transcript of counsels’ closing addresses, but during his remarks on sentence his Honour said this - 
      
       
        
         
         … perhaps they were taken by the strongly and often repeated point taken in the trial, that there was really no explanation as to how the child’s dress had remained up so as to allow this positioning by the prisoner of his tongue. Although she claimed it was up, she was unable to explain how it was. It may be that the jury had some doubt about that practical matter. 
         
        
       
     25   It seems to me that the most likely reason why the jury entertained a reasonable doubt on the third count was that, having considered counsel’s arguments, they doubted whether the appellant inserted his tongue into S’s vagina. (Because the Crown case was that there was nothing less than penetration, nothing turns on the fact that the Crown did not need to prove penetration in order to succeed.) 
      
       
     26   S was a thirty year old woman giving evidence of events that had happened seventeen years earlier and the jury were entitled to make full allowance for deficiencies of memory of detail and for the fact that, given her description of the relative positions of herself and the appellant, she might not have been able to see everything that he was doing. Even so, if the appellant penetrated her she must have felt it. It is not the sort of matter about which she is likely to have made an honest mistake. 
      
       
     27   In the circumstances it seems to me that a doubt about S’s reliability on the third count was bound to raise in the minds of the jury a doubt about her reliability on the other counts. Accordingly, I think that the appellant’s challenge to the verdicts on the first and second counts has been made good. I would allow the appeal, quash the convictions and sentences on the first and second counts and direct the entry of a verdict of not guilty on each of those counts. 
      
       
     28   Other grounds of appeal were raised, but none if successful would have entitled the appellant to an acquittal. It is not therefore necessary to consider them. 
      
       
     29   SMART AJ: The background, the facts and the contentions of the parties are set out in the judgment of Barr J. The materials establish that in 1982 at the premises of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints, Orange, an incident occurred in which the complainant, then a 12-13 year old girl was assaulted. It was undoubtedly an indecent assault. Was there also a sexual assault? The question is what was the extent of the assaultor assaults and the incident? 
      
       
     30   On becoming aware of the incident the Church took disciplinary action against the applicant, a Church Court being convened. That Court’s record states, amongst other things: 
      
       
        
         
         “Bro. Mills said that approx 6 months ago, during some maintenance work at the Orange Chapel, he chastised some young children who were making a disturbance in one of the rooms. He said that he then felt upset at being hard on them. One of the young girls was still in the room and so he began to console her by a simple embrace. He said that this action led to his fondling her (beneath her clothing) where he ought not to (pelvic region). 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Bro Mills said that he had felt very bad for the past 6 months but was now relieved that all was in the open”. 
         
        
       
     31   In his evidence the applicant said that the incident did not occur during a working bee as alleged by the complainant but on a day when Church services and classes were being held (T117-118), that is, on a Sunday. 
      
       
     32   In his evidence in chief the applicant said that when he went into the room there were two ladies in it, namely the complainant and her elder sister. He told them to cut out the noise. He put his arms around both girls. They were on either side. After a short conversation the elder girl left the room. The complainant kept hugging him. He added: 
      
       
        
         
         “For some unknown reason … I placed my hand under her dress and while cuddling her fondled her in the pelvic region.” 
         
        
       
     33   He estimated that the whole incident lasted five minutes. 
      
       
     34   He denied her allegations that he took her hand and placed it on his penis, that he placed the fingers of his hand in her vagina, that he ordered her to suck his penis and that she did so and that he placed his tongue in her vagina. He denied the other amorous improper conduct which she alleged. 
      
       
     35   The elder sister denied that there was any double cuddling as suggested by the applicant. 
      
       
     36   In cross-examination the applicant stated that he did not touch the complainant on the vagina but above it. When asked whether that was on top of or underneath her underpants he replied “My recollection is it was outside her underpants”.  
      
       
     37   When it was put to him that he had said different things about touching her on different occasions the applicant replied that the incident had occurred in 1982. The applicant agreed that on three occasions he had given deceptive answers to the Church officials when asked if he was leading a moral life. He insisted that he was not deceptive when he appeared before the Church Court. 
      
       
     38   Mr C A Schiaffi gave evidence that in about August 1996 he interviewed the applicant at the Church and asked him about the allegations. Basically the applicant stated that the complainant was “ushered into a room and he touched her, he fondled her, he put his hands down her underclothes, underpants and then she ran out.” Mr Schiaffi stated that he did not record the conversation. The applicant denied that he had told Mr Schiaffi that he (the applicant) had put his hands in the complainant’s underpants. 
      
       
     39   The evidence as to what the applicant said, if accepted, and the complainant’s evidence entitled the jury to hold that the applicant had inserted his fingers in her vagina. That was the subject of the first count. That count stands in a position different from that of the other counts because of the supporting evidence as to what the applicant said. 
      
       
     40   I should add that the complainant said that the applicant had ordered her to go over to the table in the room. While she was standing there he lifted her dress up, put her underpants down and inserted his fingers in her vagina. 
      
       
     41   In her evidence the complainant, after stating that after the applicant stopped putting his fingers in her vagina and kissing her, alleged that he told her to put her mouth on his penis. She said that she did so because she was frightened. She leant over. Further, he had his hand on her head pushing it. He was making backwards and forwards movements with his body and his penis was moving within her mouth. This continued for a little while. 
      
       
     42   She said that after that he pulled away and knelt down upon the ground and put his tongue in her vagina. She said that her dress was up and her pants were down. He was in front of her. She was just standing. This passage appears: 
      
       
        
         
       “Q. But your legs weren’t deliberately apart? 
        
         
          A. No they weren’t no” 
         
        
       
     43   He then told her to sit on the table. The complainant was cross-examined at length about her dress being pulled up and how it remained up. She agreed that neither he nor she held the dress up. The underlying theme of that part of the cross-examination was that the dress would not have stayed up and that it was unlikely that the conduct alleged occurred. This applied with particular force to the third count (tongue in vagina). It would not have mattered so much as to the second count (fellatio). 
      
       
     44   We do not have the final addresses of counsel and I must confess a reluctance to decide the case without them. However, from the summing-up (p27) and the remarks on sentence it does seem that counsel for the applicant made a great deal of the dress allegedly remaining up by suggesting that this and consequently the tongue in the vagina were unlikely. 
      
       
     45   The applicant was not charged in the alternative with attempted sexual intercourse without consent. The jury may have taken the view that the circumstances surrounding count 3 (tongue in vagina) were less compelling than those surrounding count 2. While the applicant had his mouth up near the vagina it was a reasonable possibility that contact may not have been made between the tongue and the vagina. The contact which was made might have been at a different point. The complainant was standing, the applicant was kneeling and she did not have her legs deliberately apart. In my opinion the acquittal on count 3 does not impact upon the complainant’s credibility on counts 1 and 2. Of course, on count 1 there was the supporting evidence earlier mentioned. 
      
       
     46   It must be remembered that at the time of these extraordinary events the complainant was aged but 12-13. The aberrant conduct to which she was exposed would not be expected in Church premises and mistakes in recollection and as to the detail of what happened are to be expected. 
      
       
     47   Other grounds of appeal were raised but there is no point in my dealing with them as the majority is of the opinion that the appeal on counts 1 and 2 should be allowed and acquittals entered. I would reject the challenge to the verdicts on counts 1 and 2 based on the acquittal on count 3.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 60779/98 HEYDON JA BARR J SMART AJ Wednesday, 28 February 2001 REGINA v Blinder Kumar MANKOTIA JUDGMENT1    HEYDON JA: On 1 August 1998, after a trial before Sperling J and a jury, the appellant was convicted of murdering Helena Pishova. On 27 November 1998 he was sentenced to a minimum term of twelve years' penal servitude to commence on 25 March 1997 and to expire on 24 March 2009, and an additional term of four years to commence on 25 March 2009 and to expire on 24 March 2013. 
      
       
     2    The appellant appeals against both conviction and sentence. However, no submissions were advanced in relation to the sentence, and the appeal must be dismissed so far as that ground is concerned. 
      
       
     3    The one ground of appeal in relation to conviction was: 
      
       
        
         
         ""His Honour erred in directing the jury that in considering the objective test of provocation under section 23(2)(b) of the  
         Crimes Act 
          (NSW) that the personal characteristics of the accused to be attributed to the ordinary person do not include the accused's ethnic or cultural background."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     4    The factual background is that the appellant was born in a village in India on 15 March 1970. The trial Judge said that the culture from which he came was ""a very rigid one"". The custom of arranged marriages prevailed. The appellant never had a girlfriend before coming to Australia in 1996 and meeting the deceased in late 1996 or early 1997. They began to go out together. The appellant fell deeply in love with the deceased. However, on 23 March 1997, the deceased telephoned the appellant without prior warning and said the relationship was over. This greatly shocked the appellant. On the evening of 25 March 1997 the appellant went to the deceased's flat. She persisted in her refusal to continue the relationship. The appellant became enraged and attacked her with a knife in a fit of fury. 
      
       
     5    Section 23(1) and (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) provide: 
      
       
        
         
         ""1(1) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that an act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation and, but for this sub-section and the provocation, the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury shall acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter. 
         
        
        
         
          (2) For the purpose of sub-section (1), an act or omission causing death is an act done or omitted under provocation where: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the accused; and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm, upon the deceased: 
           
          
          
         whether that conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act or omission causing death or at any previous time."" 
         
        
       
     6    The appellant's written submissions contain the following passage: 
      
       
        
         
         ""It is accepted that his Honour's directions to the jury both in written and oral form (pages 17 to 25 of the summing-up) are in conformity with the decision of the High Court in  
         Stingel v The Queen 
          (1990) 171 CLR 312 confirmed in  
         Masciantonio v The Queen 
          (1995) 183 CLR 58 and  
         R v Green 
          (1997) 191 CLR 334. 
         
        
        
         
         Whilst the decision in  
         Stingel 
          applied to section 160 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code, it is acknowledged that that decision has application to the consideration on the operation of section 23(2)(b) of the NSW Crimes Act. It is further acknowledged that his Honour was bound as is this Court by these decisions of the High Court."" 
         
        
       
     7    In Stingel v R (1990) 171 CLR 312 the court of seven Justices (including McHugh J) held that in applying the Tasmanian equivalent to section 23(2)(a) it is necessary to take into account all the characteristics of the particular accused person. They said (at 326): 
      
       
        
         
         ""Even more important the content and extent of the provocative conduct must be assessed from the viewpoint of the particular accused. Were it otherwise it would be quite impossible to identify the gravity of the particular provocation. In that regard, none of the attributes or characteristics of a particular accused will be necessarily irrelevant to an assessment of the content and extent of the provocation involved in the relevant conduct. For example, any one or more of the accused's age, sex, race, physical features, personal attributes, personal relationships and past history may be relevant to an objective assessment of the gravity of a particular wrongful act or insult. Indeed, even mental instability or weakness of an accused could, in some circumstances, itself be a relevant consideration to be taken into account in the determination of the content and implications of particular conduct."" 
         
        
       
     8    However, the Justices also held in relation to the Tasmanian equivalent to section 23(2)(b) that the ordinary person is not to be invested with any characteristic of the accused other than age. At 331 they said that the effect of the legislation: 
      
       
        
         
         ""is to pose for the jury the question whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the wrongful act or insult, with its implications and gravity identified and assessed in the manner we have indicated, was of such a nature that it could or might cause an ordinary person (or, when appropriate, an ordinary person of the age of the accused), that is to say, a hypothetical or imaginary person with powers of self-control within the limits of what is ordinary (for a person of that age), to do what the accused did."" 
         
        
       
     9    In Masciantonio v R (1995) 183 CLR 50A at 66-70 four Justices comprising the majority did not depart from the law as stated in Stingel v R. McHugh J, however, considered that in relation to section 23(2)(b) the test stated in Stingel v R should be departed from. The 'ordinary person's standard' should incorporate 'the general characteristics of an ordinary person of the same age, race, culture and background as the accused on the self-control issue' (at 73). 
      
       
     10    In Green v R (1997) 191 CLR 334 McHugh J repeated at 368 the position he had stated in Masciantonio v R but this position continued to attract no support from any other Justice. 
      
       
     11    Sperling J directed the jury in accordance with the majority High Court view, and abstained from directing the jury conformably to the view of McHugh J. 
      
       
     12    In the circumstances the appellant's concession that this Court is bound by a construction of section 23(2)(b) which is adverse to the success of the appeal is sound. It would have been wrong for Sperling J to have directed the jury differently and it would be wrong for this Court to allow the appeal. Any other approach would be completely subversive of order in the law. The only avenue available to the appellant is an application to the High Court for special leave to appeal, coupled with an application to that court for leave to re-argue the correctness of the authorities in that court which binds other courts. 
      
       
     13    In the circumstances there is no point in examining the detailed factual analysis advanced on behalf of the appellant in an endeavour to demonstrate that the application of the test propounded by McHugh J might have led to acquittal. 
      
       
     14    I propose that the appeal against both conviction and sentence be dismissed. 
      
       
     15    BARR J: I agree. 
      
       
     16    SMART AJ: The appellant seeks to have this Court follow the judgments of McHugh J in Masciantonio v The Queen 183 CLR 58 at 72-74 and Green v The Queen 191 CLR 334 at 368 and hold that when a jury is considering whether the provocation was capable of causing an ordinary person in the position of the accused to lose self-control it should take into account the ethnic or cultural background of the accused. 
      
       
     17    That is not an approach which is open to this Court in view of the decisions of the High Court in Stingel v The Queen 171 CLR 312, Masciantonio and Green. Any review of those decisions must be undertaken by the High Court. Central to any review are the terms of section 23(2)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
      
       
     18    In practice the gravity of provocation/self-control distinction has proved hard to explain to a jury in terms which are intelligible to them. In Regina v Rogonui 13 April 2000, the New Zealand Court of Appeal gave consideration to the problem. Tipping J giving one of the majority judgments, which held that the New Zealand statute on provocation (section 169 of the Crimes Act 1961) required the application of the distinction, said that it required 'mental gymnastics'. Thomas J, who thought that the statute did not have to be construed so rigidly, said that most trial Judges had seen: 
      
       
        
         
         ""the glazed look in the jurors' eyes as, immediately after instructing them that it is open to them to have regard to the accused's alleged characteristic in assessing the gravity of the provocation, they are then advised that they must revert to the test of the ordinary person and disregard that characteristic when determining the sufficiency of the accused's loss of self-control."" 
         
        
       
     19    I would go a little further. Many trial Judges in this State give juries both verbal and written directions on provocation. Juries struggle with the distinction and find it hard to grasp. Many do not do so. The directions on provocation and the distinction frequently lead to a series of questions indicating that these issues are causing difficulty, prolonged deliberation by juries and, not infrequently, to juries being unable to agree whether the accused is guilty of murder or manslaughter. This leads to a re-trial. I have been left with the firm impression that, despite extensive endeavours to explain the directions, the jury has had trouble appreciating their import. Other trial Judges have had similar experiences. It is important that juries have a good understanding of what they are required to do. 
      
       
     20    The House of Lords has recently reviewed this area of the law in considerable depth and on a broad basis. If its approach were ultimately to find favour it would encompass but not be restricted to the matters which the appellant seeks to advance. In Regina v Smith (Morgan) 2000 3 WLR 654 the House, by a majority of three to two, held that in determining under section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957:  
      
       
        
         
         ""whether provocation was enough to make a reasonable man do what the defendant did, the jury was required to ask whether the degree of self-control exercised by the defendant was that which reasonable people with his characteristics would have exercised, that all the particular characteristics of the defendant were to be taken into account in deciding both whether he was in fact provoked and whether the objective element of provocation was satisfied; that the question for the jury was whether the circumstances were such as to make the loss of self-control sufficiently excusable to reduce the gravity of the offence from murder to manslaughter; that the jury had been entitled to take into account the effect of the defendant's depression in relation to the question whether he had measured up to the standard reasonably required of him"". (Headnote at 654). 
         
        
       
     21    I am not unmindful of the differences between the English and the New South Wales legislation. At 661 Lord Slynn said: 
      
       
        
         
         "" ... the particular characteristics of the accused may be taken into account at both stages ... "" 
         
        
       and  
        
         
         ""moreover the distinction between the 'objective' and 'subjective' tests ... is very difficult for a jury and I doubt whether it is really workable."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     22    At 672-673 Lord Hoffmann pointed to the practical difficulties of explaining the distinction between gravity of provocation and powers of self control. He noted that in many cases ""the two forms of claim are inextricably muddled up with each other."" At 674 Lord Hoffmann emphasised, ""For the protection of the public, the law should continue to insist that people must exercise self-control."" Lord Hoffman referred with approval to the actual decision in Stingel. 
      
       
     23    He regarded it as important to retain the objective element in provocation and suggested that this could be achieved by a direction that characteristics such as jealousy and obsession should be ignored in relation to the objective element. 
      
       
     24    At 681 Lord Clyde said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""In principle it is not easy to see how the plight of the individual accused can appropriately be taken into account if the standard of his conduct is to be tested by reference to an artificial concept remote from his own situation"". 
         
        
       
     25    There is an illuminating discussion of the problems by his Lordship at pp.682-684. 
      
       
        
         
         ""This difficult area of the law could, with profit, be further considered. The practical difficulties of the current approach and the lack of understanding of the distinction by juries cannot be over-emphasised."" 
         
        
       
     26    On the law, as expounded by the High Court in its three decisions earlier mentioned, the appeal must be dismissed. 
      
       
     27    HEYDON JA: The order of the Court is that the appeal will be dismissed.

      HEYDON JA BARR J SMART AJ Wednesday, 28 February 2001 
      
      REGINA v Nissan PAKISTAN 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1   HEYDON JA: I would ask Justice Barr to deliver the first judgment. 
      
       
     2   BARR J: The applicant, Nissan Pakistan, seeks leave to appeal against convictions and sentences entered in the District Court. On 7 February 2000 he pleaded not guilty before a jury to one count that on 24 July 1999 at Lavington he had sexual intercourse with Kristy Lee O’Connor without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting and that at the time of the commission of the offence he maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm upon her and to one count that at the same time and place he had sexual intercourse with Miss O’Connor without her consent knowing that she was not consenting. 
      
       
     3   The trial began and on the third day the applicant, through his counsel, asked to be arraigned again. When that was done he pleaded guilty to both charges. The jury were invited to return a verdict in view of the change of plea but were unable to reach a unanimous decision. Accordingly, the trial judge, Judge Gibson QC, discharged the jury and convicted the applicant of both offences. 
      
       
     4   On 18 February 2000 his Honour imposed on the first count a term of imprisonment of five years comprising a minimum term of one year nine months and an additional term of three years three months. On the second count his Honour imposed a concurrent fixed term of one year six months. His Honour recommended the deportation of the applicant, who was a native and resident of New Guinea. 
      
       
     5   The applicant draws the attention of the Court to the circumstances in which he changed his pleas. 
      
       
     6   The Court will go behind a plea of guilty and hear an appeal against a conviction where there may have been a miscarriage of justice: R v Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218. The applicant bears the onus of showing that he should have leave to argue the appeal: R v Boag (1993) 73 A Crim R 35, R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 21. 
      
       
     7   The principles which govern the grant of leave to appeal against a conviction following a plea of guilty are the same as those which govern the grant of leave by the court at first instance to withdraw a plea of guilty. Leave will readily be granted where there has been a mistake or other circumstance affecting the integrity of a plea of guilty as an admission of guilt. But if the plea has been entered in full knowledge of all the facts and intentionally as a plea to the charge which is made, the court is entitled to exercise its discretion against the grant of leave. 
      
       
     8   The law regards a plea of guilty made by a person in possession of all the facts and intending to plead guilty as an admission of all the legal ingredients of the offence and as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made: R v Lars, Da Silva & Kalanderian (1994) 73 A Crim R 91 at 109. 
      
       
     9   By common consent it was the effect of communications that took place between the applicant and his legal advisers on the third day of the trial that gave rise to his changes of plea. By that time the complainant had given evidence which may be summarised thus. She lived in Albury and met the applicant at an hotel in June 1999. They played pool together and had drinks. He accompanied her home and she invited him in. They had more to drink and played music. There was only one bed in the premises and when the complainant went to bed she permitted the applicant to use it as well. However, she kissed him good night and made clear by her conduct that she was not interested in sexual relations. 
      
       
     10   After that she and the applicant saw each other from time to time. They also spoke on the telephone. He invited her out but she declined his invitation. 
      
       
     11   On the evening of Friday 23 July 1999 the complainant declined an invitation to go out with the applicant. She spent the evening with a girlfriend at home and eventually went to bed. Her night clothes included a pair of red boxer shorts. At 6.40 am the applicant telephoned her house and asked whether the complainant would come and collect him and whether he might stay at her premises. She declined the invitation to collect him but said that he might come and stay. He arrived there at about 7.40 am. The complainant let him in. She got into bed because she wanted to continue sleeping. He got into bed with her and put his arm around her. She told him to go away if he were going to behave in that manner. The applicant responded by pushing and then punching the complainant. A violent struggle ensued during which he tried to get the better of her and she tried to fend him off. Her face and chest were badly bruised. She was calling for him to stop, banging on the wall and calling for help. Eventually the complainant ran out of strength and decided that the best way to cope with the circumstances was to pretend that she was dead. After that the applicant twice had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with her and ejaculated. During the attack the boxer shorts were ripped. 
      
       
     12   A neighbour heard the complainant’s screams and calls for help and telephoned the police. Police officers arrived at the complainant’s flat during or immediately after the applicant’s second act of sexual intercourse. They noticed that his face was scratched. They noticed that the complainant was dishevelled and had blood on her face. She made immediate complaint of rape and the police arrested and removed the applicant. 
      
       
     13   The applicant was formally interviewed by police officers and admitted having had sexual intercourse and then having had a fight with the complainant. He admitted hitting her. 
      
       
     14   Evidence of all these matters had been given by the middle of the morning of the third day of the trial. The Crown case was that the red boxer shorts had been torn by the applicant during his attack on the complainant. The defence case was that sexual intercourse was consensual and that the complainant had not been wearing that garment at any relevant time. The Crown tendered a certificate from an analyst the effect of which was that a portion of material removed from the red boxer shorts bore semen. Defence counsel objected to the tender of the certificate, which apparently came as something of a surprise, and asked for the trial judge to grant a short adjournment so that the matter could be considered. 
      
       
     15   The conversation the subject of dispute in this application took place during that adjournment. 
      
       
     16   The applicant’s case had been foreshadowed during the cross-examination of the complainant. The court knew if the applicant gave evidence he would say that he had had consensual intercourse and had ejaculated. There was nothing he could do to change that. Although there was no indication that the certificate would prove that the semen on the shorts was the applicant’s it did give strong support to the complainant’s version of events. The complainant was also supported by the unchallengeable evidence about her own injuries and to the efforts she had made to call for help and by what she said to the police when they arrived. It was supported by evidence of scratches on the applicant’s face and by the presence of the applicant himself and no other man when the police came. The evidence of the certificate made a strong case substantially stronger. It is not difficult to understand why his counsel and solicitor considered it appropriate to give the applicant the opportunity of reconsidering his earlier instructions. 
      
       
     17   Mr Christopher Charles Halburd was the applicant’s solicitor throughout the preparation for the trial, the trial and the sentencing proceedings. Mr Halburd has sworn two affidavits which have been read in this application and has not been cross-examined. 
      
       
     18   According to Mr Halburd he had a conference with the applicant on 20 November 1999 and some signed instructions were brought into existence. The document, which is an annexure to the affidavit of Mr Halburd of 21 February 2001 bears a date 20 October 1999, and I take it that the reference to “November” is an error. The document appears to be in Mr Halburd’s handwriting and says this: 
      
       
        
        ON A PLEA OF NOT GUILTY 
        
        
         
         I have been informed by Mr George Ritchie, Public Defender and by Mr Chris Halburd, Solicitor that if I were to plead guilty to these charges or either of them then that would be a matter that the Judge would have to take into account when passing sentence on me and would normally result in a lesser penalty being imposed than if the matters proceed to a trial. 
         
        
        
         
         I wish to plead not guilty to both charges which were read in full to me yesterday. 
         
        
       
     19   The document bears a notation to the effect that the contents were read to the applicant by Mr Clement Chikalli in the Pidgin English language. 
      
       
     20   There was a conference between Mr Halburd and the applicant in January 2000 at the Correctional Centre at Junee where the applicant was being held.  
      
       
     21   On 7 February 2000, the first day of the trial, a further document was brought into existence following a conference between Mr Halburd and the applicant. Mr Stanley Tandawai, the applicant’s cousin, was also present. The text is as follows - 
      
       
        
         
         I Nissan Pakistan remember telling my Solicitor Chris Halburd when I saw him at Junee gaol in early January that on the night that Kristy says I raped her I did not have sex with her. 
         
        
        
         
         I told Mr Halburd that because someone at gaol told me it would be better for me. It was not true I did have sex with Kristy. She agreed to have sex with me and then we had a fight which caused the injuries and the police being called. 
         
        
        
         
         I am aware that I could object to the conversation that I had with the police on the morning of the 24th July 1999 going before the jury. The advantage of it going before the jury or not going before the jury have been explained to me. Similarly the disadvantages of each approach have been explained. 
         
        
        
         
         I want the conversation to go before the jury because it is what happened although I did get some of the words wrong in my answers. 
         
        
        
         
         During this conference my cousin Stanley Tandawai has interpreted and also interpreted this document before I signed it. 
         
        
       
     22   The document bears the signature of the applicant.  
      
       
     23   During the conference on the third day of the trial Mr Halburd and Mr Ritchie and Mr Tandawai were again present with the applicant. As before, Mr Halburd brought a document into existence in his own handwriting and it was signed by the applicant. The contents are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         I Nissan Pakistan instruct my legal representatives that I wish to change my plea from not guilty to guilty in respect of the following charges:- 
         
        
        
         
         (i) That on the 24th of July 1999 I did have sexual intercourse with Kristy O’Connor without the consent of Kristy O’Connor knowing she was not consenting and at the time of committing the offence I did maliciously inflict actual bodily harm on Kristy O’Connor. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) On the 24th July 1999 I did have sexual intercourse with Kristy O’Connor without the consent of Kristy O’Connor knowing she was not consenting. 
         
        
        
         
         Present in this conference apart from myself are G Ritchie (Counsel), C Halburd (Solicitor) and Stanley Tandawai who is interpreting as we go along. Stanley is my cousin. 
         
        
        
         
         I am aware that I can continue with my trial before the jury. I am aware that at approximately 11 o’clock today the ninth day of February 2000 an analysis certificate was handed to the Crown which indicated that semen was found on red boxer shorts. These red boxer shorts have a ripped crotch. The Complainant alleging that I ripped the crotch out of them. When I spoke to the police and when I spoke to my legal representatives I told them that she was not wearing red boxer shorts that night. That I didn’t rip them. I told them that she was wearing underpants or panties and that I asked her to take them off and she did. 
         
        
        
         
         When I told the police and my legal representatives the above I was lying. 
         
        
        
         
         I acknowledge that Kristy O’Connor told the truth when she gave evidence. I did hop in her bed and I tried to touch her and she told me to stop. I persisted and she told me “if you’re going to be like that you can piss off”. She continued to fight me off and then I started punching her. I punched her about the face the neck the chest and body area. She tried to protect herself and scratched my face. I ripped the crotch out of her red boxer shorts. After a while she stopped resisting and I pulled her legs apart and put my penis in her vagina. I had intercourse and after a little while I ejaculated. I moved her to another position and continued having intercourse. There was a knock on the door and the police had arrived. 
         
        
        
         
         I am aware that by changing my plea to guilty the Judge will have no alternative other than to impose a lengthy gaol sentence on me. 
         
        
        
         
         I enter this plea of guilty of my own free will. 
         
        
        
         
         Stanley has been with me throughout the conference and I understand the consequence of entering the plea. 
         
        
        
         
         I repeat that what I initially told my legal representatives was a lie and that Kristy O’Connor is telling the truth. 
         
        
       
     24   There were subsequent conferences between Mr Halburd and the applicant during submissions on sentence on 10 February 2000 and on 18 February. On the latter day the applicant indicated a desire to change his plea on each count to one of not guilty. Mr Halburd arranged for the applicant to be interviewed by another barrister, Mr Blackman. As it turns out, an affidavit of Mr Blackman read to this Court and the evidence of the applicant himself shed no light on what was said at that conference. However, following the conference, the applicant was content to proceed to sentence, having Mr Halburd continue to represent him in the proceedings. 
      
       
     25   The complaint that the applicant makes is as follows. He says first that his understanding of English was not good and that during the conference on 9 February, instead of calling his interpreter to come to the interview room, his solicitor called in his cousin, Mr Tandawai, who was only eighteen years of age, to interpret. Mr Tandawai knew nothing about the court system and was too young to say anything. He says that Mr Ritchie told him that he had to plead guilty because the evidence was strong. He says that Mr Ritchie said that if the applicant did not plead guilty the jury would find him guilty and he would be sentenced to fifteen to twenty years’ imprisonment. He says that Mr Ritchie pointed out that there had been no other man in the complainant’s premises at the relevant time, that it was the third day of the trial and that there was nothing that Mr Ritchie could do to help him. Therefore he had to plead guilty. Mr Ritchie said that the evidence showed that the boxer shorts were torn, so the applicant would have to say something about that. The applicant said five times that he did not want to plead guilty. At that Mr Ritchie repeated everything that he had already said and that the applicant would have to say something before he and Mr Halburd left the room. Mr Ritchie said that if the applicant pleaded guilty he would tell them - which I take to mean the prosecution - to drop one charge. He repeated that he could do nothing further for the applicant and that the jury would find him guilty. The applicant was crying and again and again told Mr Ritchie that he did not want to plead guilty for a crime that he had not committed. He was again told he would have to say something before Mr Ritchie and Mr Halburd left the room. Eventually he decided to plead guilty but that was a result of all the forceful words which had gone before. 
      
       
     26   The applicant gave evidence before this Court and made reference to the pressure that he felt during the interview with Mr Ritchie and Mr Halburd. He was asked to say what it was that caused that pressure and said that it was Mr Ritchie’s statement to the effect that the jury would find him guilty, that the evidence was very strong, and that the jury would not believe him. Further, that if the jury found him guilty he would get a longer sentence and that there was no more that Mr Ritchie could do for him. 
      
       
     27   Two of Mr Ritchie’s affidavits were read in the application, dated respectively 19 and 28 February 2001, and he attended to be cross-examined. He denied in terms most of the words put into his mouth by the applicant. Of the catalogue of complaints made by the applicant about what Mr Ritchie said and did, Mr Ritchie said that during the conference he raised the topic that the applicant was the only man present when the police came and that something would have to be said about the torn boxer shorts. Mr Ritchie denied telling the applicant he had to plead guilty. He denied telling him that the jury would find him guilty and he denied telling him that he could not help him or that there was nothing further he could do. He denied saying that he would get the prosecution to drop one of the charges. He denied saying if the applicant did not plead guilty he would be sentenced to prison for fifteen to twenty years. 
      
       
     28   He did say that the Crown case was a strong one, however, and that the jury might well find the applicant guilty. He denied that the applicant was crying during the interview. He denied that he required an answer before he and his solicitor left the room and asserted that he and his solicitor left the room having spoken to the applicant in order to allow the applicant to speak to his cousin and consider the matters that Mr Ritchie had raised for his consideration. 
      
       
     29   In view of the documents which the applicant has conceded he signed, particularly the one signed on 9 February 2000, his understanding of spoken and written English is a matter of some importance. During cross-examination in this application the documents were severally put before the applicant. He admitted that they bore his signature. He admitted much of the contents of them. When parts of the document which he might reasonably have thought were damaging to his case were drawn to his attention, however, he claimed not to understand the contents. This was particularly so with the contents of the document in which he acknowledged that he had not been telling the truth and stated his desire to change his pleas to guilty. 
      
       
     30   I listened carefully to the applicant and observed him as he gave evidence in this Court and it seemed to me that he understood the questions that he was being asked. Many of the questions were answered simply ‘yes’ or ‘no’ but he was very selective about which he answered ‘yes’ and which he answered ‘no’. It seemed to me that he was inclined to answer ‘yes’ to questions the factual contents of which were irresistible or perhaps not damaging to his case and ‘no’ to questions the contents of which he might have thought would hurt his case. I thought he approached the questions with some care. Some of them he answered at considerable length. He also addressed the Court and, for a few minutes, cross-examined Mr Ritchie. His English was by no means perfect but I think that it was reasonably fluent and, to me, it showed a capacity to express complex thoughts. 
      
       
     31   The interview with the police to which I have made short reference is a substantial document. There were five hundred and thirty questions and answers. During many of the answers the applicant gave a detailed explanation of what happened on one occasion or another. Throughout the transcript of the interview there appears to me to be good evidence that the applicant understood well questions which were put to him in the English language. During that interview, which lasted well over an hour, there was no interpreter present and no family member to assist the applicant in his understanding of the English used by the interrogating police officer. 
      
       
     32   Speaking of the applicant’s understanding of English Mr Halburd said this in his affidavit of 21 February 2001: 
      
       
        
         
         I have spoken to the appellant on numerous occasion both with and without interpreters. I also viewed various parts of the video tape of his record of interview with the police. Whilst, in fairness to him, it was necessary for the appellant to have an interpreter available at the trial due to the speed and complexity of that process, I formed the view that he generally had a fairly good understanding of the English language and was able to seek clarification of things that he did not understand. 
         
        
       
     33   Mr Halburd goes on to say Mr Tandawai spoke the Enga dialect of Papua New Guinea, apparently a rare dialect, spoken by the applicant. 
      
       
     34   In my opinion the court can accept and act upon the opinion of Mr Halburd about the ability of the applicant to understand spoken English. It coincides with the opinion that I have formed. 
      
       
     35   Mr Halburd’s documents show that the applicant’s case, a difficult one, was dealt with carefully, indeed meticulously. I think it quite unlikely that Mr Ritchie would have said the things attributed to him by the applicant. I think it quite unlikely he would have said anything that could be understood as meaning that if convicted the applicant would be sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen to twenty years, that the jury would find him guilty, and that he had to plead guilty. Mr Ritchie is a barrister of long experience in criminal cases. He told the court, and I accept, that he had a practised way of dealing with conferences of this kind, conferences in which it is necessary, because of the apparent strength of the Crown case, to ensure that an accused person understands the choices and the circumstances and the consequences that he faces. Mr Ritchie called it a “patter.” One can understand that he would have a standard way of dealing with such things. I accept his denials and I prefer his and Mr Halburd’s evidence to that of the applicant. I think that the applicant was less than frank with the court particularly with regard to his asserted understanding of spoken English. 
      
       
     36   During his cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor he answered questions instantly and fluently, I thought. Some minutes ago this was pointed out to him and he was asked whether he had had any difficulty understanding the questions he had so readily answered and he said that he had had difficulty. In view of the facts that he never hesitated and never asked for explanation I do not accept that statement. I think that his understanding was far better than he would have the Court believe. 
      
       
     37   One can easily accept that a conference of the kind at which the applicant, Mr Ritchie and Mr Halburd and the applicant’s cousin were present was not an easy one for the applicant. It was a conference at which there would have been anxiety and tension. It is easy to accept that the decision which the applicant made in due course was one made in some agony of mind. Even so I do not think that anything improper happened at the conference. I do not think that he failed to understand anything of significance, spoken or written. I think that the applicant pleaded guilty because he believed he was guilty and that he would probably be found guilty if he continued on before the jury but that pleas of guilty might bring him a lesser sentence. I do not think that the circumstances in which the applicant changed his pleas amounted to a miscarriage of justice. I do not think that there was any mistake. I do not think anything happened affecting the integrity of the applicant’s pleas of guilty. I would refuse leave to appeal against the conviction. 
      
       
     38   HEYDON JA: I agree. 
      
       
     39   SMART AJ: I also agree. 
      
       
     40   HEYDON JA: Accordingly leave to appeal is refused.

       JUDGMENT No. 2- On application for bail 
        
       
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: My reason for suspending the order which I made earlier today was that I was informed by the Crown that an order had been made pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 in relation to the applicant’s interest in the property 52 Brighton Street, Banksmeadow, and that a further order might have been made affecting, in a relevant way, the premises at 243 Pyrmont Street, Pyrmont. The relevant orders of this court made under the statute have now been produced. It is apparent that the applicant’s interest in the property at 52 Brighton Street is not available to be pledged as security for performance of the conditions of the order which I proposed. That appears to be the whole of the relevant effect of the orders made under the statute. 
     
      
       
      
    2    I should add that counsel for the applicant did not, in his submissions to me, propose that the applicant’s interest in the Brighton Street property should be made available for the purpose of the bail application. That was something that I introduced of my own initiative, being unaware of the orders which had been made under the Proceeds of Crime legislation.  
     
      
       
      
    3    It is necessary, therefore, to reconsider the application without regard to the applicant’s interest in the Brighton Street property. Putting that interest out of the account, there remains a sum substantially in excess of $1 million, suitably secured, available to support the conditions which I proposed for an order that bail be granted. That being so, I remain of the view that conditional bail should be granted, and I re-state my previous order, with the exception that there will be deleted from paragraph 1 (f) the item relating to the appellant, including the figure of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars and the reference to the Brighton Street property. I have crossed out that item in the minute of my order.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
        SIMPSON J :  
        
       
     1    IPP AJA: I will ask Simpson J to deliver the first judgment. 2    SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed on him by Ducker DCJ in the District Court on 15 October 1999 following his plea of guilty to a charge of escaping from lawful custody. By s 34 of the Correctional Centres Act 1952 such an offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment of ten years and the sentence is to be accumulated upon the sentence or sentences imposed by the Court or to which the offender was subject at the time of sentencing.  
      
       
     3    Ducker DCJ imposed a sentence of imprisonment for three years and one day, commencing on 10 January 2005, and specified a non-parole period of one year. The reason for the unusual length of the total term is the foundation for one of the grounds of the application. I will return to this. 
      
       
     4    The facts were put to the sentencing judge in the form largely of a number of bundles of documents, one of which, marked as ex C, contained a statement of Jason Michael Anderson, who was a Constable of Police stationed at Noosa Heads and who interviewed the applicant on or about 23 January 1999. This interview was tape recorded and, therefore, there was no written note taken. However, when it came to transcribing the tape recording, it was found o be indecipherable and Mr Anderson made his statement from recollection some time later. 
      
       
     5    To the extent that that statement is in conflict with evidence given by the applicant, it must be seen in light of that circumstance. However, it is also relevant that ex C, as recorded in the transcript, seems to have been jointly tendered and admitted without objection. Both of those matters create some difficulty in relation to the ascertainment of disputed facts where the sentencing judge has not made a specific finding. 
      
       
     6    The applicant was incarcerated at Grafton Gaol where he was held in the minimum security section. He apparently had access to gardening implements and tools - this is drawn largely from Constable Anderson's statement - and the day before his escape he secreted a pair of bolt cutters, a file and a hacksaw blade in the nursery. The following morning after muster he took the tools and cut his way out of the perimeter fence. There his wife was waiting with a car. There was little doubt that the car had been stolen, although there is some uncertainty as to the manner in which the arrangements for its theft had been made and the applicant's knowledge of that. These circumstances evidence a degree of planning, and preparation, and involvement in some criminal activity apart from the escape itself although, as I have said, it is necessary to be cautious about what was said about the applicant's knowledge of the circumstances of the theft of the car. 
      
       
     7    The applicant remained at large until, on 22 January 1999, he was stopped by highway police at Noosa. He gave false details before admitting his true identity and situation. He had been at large for a few days less than one year.  
      
       
     8    The background of the offence has a number of unusual features. The applicant was born in September 1955. He is now forty-five years of age and at the time of the offence he was forty-two years of age. He had spent what would appear to be the greater portion of his life in custody. He has a long-standing and serious problem with alcohol. In 1989 he was sentenced to several lengthy concurrent terms of imprisonment. These related to offences of armed robbery and wounding, robbery with striking, armed robbery, assault and malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. The sentences then imposed ranged from two years for the assault to eighteen years for the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm. These sentences were imposed in the dying days of the sentencing regime that existed prior to the commencement of the Sentencing Act 1989. It appears that no non-parole period was specified.  
      
       
     9    A month later the applicant was again sentenced for an offence of malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm with intent to do so and for this he was at first instance sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment to date from the date of sentence, 25 August 1989. This sentence was also imposed under that regime. It seems that this sentencing judge also declined to specify a non-parole period and the sentence was subsequently re-determined under the provisions of the Sentencing Act 1989. A fixed term of nineteen years, seven months and twenty-one days dating from 27 July 1984 was imposed. An appeal against that re-determination was dismissed. As a result, the applicant became entitled to release without parole on 17 March 2004. That entitlement is deferred by reason of the time he spent at liberty following his escape. 
      
       
     10    The applicant made impressive progress whilst in custody. In a number of reports psychologists, a counsellor and a clinical nurse consultant wrote of his apparent rehabilitation and his contribution to the welfare and rehabilitation of other prisoners. Each report was favourable to the applicant to an unusual degree. Whilst at Grafton Gaol he met and eventually married an inmate of the women's prison. She was, or had been, a heroin addict. On her release she experienced problems adjusting to the community and put a good deal of pressure on the applicant to provide her with support and assistance which, obviously, was difficult, if not impossible, for him to meet whilst in custody. 
      
       
     11    It is evident that a degree of planning went into the escape. The applicant took the trouble to obtain and secrete the implements already mentioned. A stolen car had been arranged. The applicant's wife was waiting with that vehicle on the outskirts of the prison. The two of them drove to Capertee near Lithgow where they located a bush hut in which they lived for several months. During this time the applicant obtained a rifle and ammunition. Apart from possession of this weapon, which I would infer to be without the necessary licences, the applicant committed no offences whilst he was at large. I should say that the principle stated in R v  de Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 would prevent any regard in sentencing being given to the inference I have drawn about the lack of licences for the gun. 
      
       
     12    After about six months the applicant's wife travelled to Sydney to visit her children and she subsequently died of a drug overdose. The applicant travelled around Australia working in a variety of jobs. Prior to his apprehension and during the three months or so after his wife's death, the applicant telephoned Ms Sue Jeffreys, a clinical nurse consultant employed by Corrections Health, with a view to surrendering himself, but he never took this step before he was arrested. Indeed, he left New South Wales and took up residence interstate. 
      
       
     13    Taking account of the time spent as an escapee, the applicant's date of release, apart from the sentence for escaping, has been delayed to 9 January 2005. The sentence being served being one of a fixed term, it provides for no period of supervision after release. 
      
       
     14    Ducker DCJ accepted that the applicant, with relatively few intellectual or emotional resources, had succumbed to the considerable pressure imposed upon him by his wife. His Honour was conscious of the substantial and impressive progress the applicant had made prior to his marriage and also of the heavy sentence the applicant was already serving although he, correctly, reminded himself that it was not his function to tailor the sentence for the offence with which he was dealing to accommodate his own views about the severity or otherwise of sentences earlier imposed. His Honour was, on balance, quite sympathetic to the applicant and was particularly mindful of the circumstances that prompted his escape. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""I have come to the view, after careful consideration, that a period of three years or thereabouts is an appropriate sentence. I think, bearing in mind the length of time he still has to serve, that a minimum term of one year is sufficient."" 
         
        
        
       He then turned his attention to the provisions of s 24(1) of the  
       Sentencing Act 
        which then required: 
        
         
         ""When a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of three years or less that has a minimum term, the Court is required to make an order directing the release of the prisoner on parole at the end of the minimum term."" 
         
        
        
       Ducker DCJ then said: 
        
         
         ""I do not believe that this is an appropriate case for me to make an order under s 24 of the  
         Sentencing Act 
          for his automatic release on parole at the expiration of the minimum term which must, by statute, commence at the expiration of the term of imprisonment to which he was subject at the time of the escape ..."" 
         
        
        
       Very shortly after that he said: 
        
         
         ""I do not believe that it is appropriate that I, with limited material, should determine when Mr Stokes should be released. I propose to add one day to the three years that I have determined as appropriate in order to see that his supervision is undertaken by the Parole Board, which will be in a superior position at that time to consider him for parole."" 
         
        
       
     15    Ducker DCJ then proceeded to make a finding of special circumstances under s 5(3) of the Sentencing Act justifying departure from the conventional ratio between the minimum and additional terms. He identified those circumstances as the previous sentences the applicant was serving and the need for close supervision and alcohol counselling for at least two years after his release. 
      
       
     16    The explanation for the unusual length of the full term of the sentence lies in the sentencing judge's reluctance to take upon himself the determination that the applicant be released on parole at the expiration of the minimum term. Some confusion is evident in the reason given by his Honour. His Honour appears to have thought, at least in one passage of the paragraph I have extracted, that an order for release on parole made by the Court would not necessarily involve supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. What he was really attempting to do was to ensure that the decision about whether the applicant was to be released on parole at the end of the minimum term or not was one made at a time closer to the date of that entitlement by authorities in possession of current knowledge and information about the applicant's then condition and circumstances. The rationale for this is clear. It is fairly unusual that a relatively short sentence of three years or less is imposed with its commencement date deferred by more than five years. It may well be that this was not envisaged when s 24 was drafted. However, it is an incident of any sentence imposed under s 34 of the Correctional Centres Act that the sentence will be deferred for a period and what that period is will depend upon how long the expired portion of the sentence being served is. 
      
       
     17    On behalf of the applicant it was argued that error is disclosed in this aspect of his Honour's approach to sentencing. I agree. The Crown, in response, put some store on the words ""or thereabouts"" in the passage first quoted which, the Crown submitted, indicated that the Judge had not selected a three-year term as the correct sentence but had arrived at a term that could have been more or could have been less. That is usually the case in sentencing. There is always a range available within which a sentence is appropriate, neither excessive nor inadequate. No single term can ever be identified as the only sentence adequate to meet the varying considerations that go into the determination of a sentence.  
      
       
     18    Sentencing involves a delicate balancing exercise, sometimes said to be ""largely intuitive"". A sentencing judge is obliged to take into account, for example, the objective circumstances of the crime, the subjective circumstances of the offender, the need for deterrence, both general and specific, the prospects of rehabilitation and, in appropriate cases, many more factors. While some of these circumstances, for example the objective seriousness of the offence, are a compulsory and essential ingredient of every sentencing decision, others will be relevant and given weight according to the exigencies of the individual case. What the sentencing judge said was not limited to the passage in which he selected the “three-year or thereabouts” term. He added that he intended to add one day to the three years which he had determined as appropriate and stated the reason for doing that was to, and I am paraphrasing what he said, reflect what he intended, to ensure that the decision about the date of release on parole would be taken by the authorities who were in possession of current and better information than he was at the time of sentencing. 
      
       
     19    Whatever the motivation for that decision, in my opinion it is not a relevant consideration that the determination of release on parole should be made by the Parole Board. Being in possession of better knowledge and information than the sentencing judge at the time of sentencing is not a factor to be taken into account in the determination of the sentence. If the sentencing judge considers, as Ducker DCJ did, that a three-year term or less is the appropriate term, then that is the sentence that should be imposed and s 24 will take effect. That the sentencing judge thought that a three-year term was the appropriate sentence is apparent from what I have already said. Even without the express detail, it would be plain that a term of three years and one day is artificial and was explicitly chosen in order to defeat the automatic operation of s 24.  
      
       
     20    I am, therefore, satisfied that an error in the sentencing process in this respect has been disclosed and I would grant leave to appeal on this ground alone and reduce the sentence by at least one day. It will, therefore, be necessary to proceed to re-sentence. The effect will be that the applicant is entitled to a direction that he be released on parole at the expiration of the minimum term.  
      
       
     21    It was also argued on behalf of the applicant that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In R v Thomson (unreported, 21 May 1986) the then Chief Justice held that the penalty for an unremarkable escape could be expected to approximate a total sentence of two years imprisonment. At the time that case was decided the maximum penalty was penal servitude for seven years. However, as I observed in R v Mackenroth (CCA, unreported, 19 May 1998) that case has to be read in light of the changes in sentencing legislation. As I understand it, that was also the view taken by Wood J (as his Honour then was) in R v Simonds (6 May 1991) to which I will shortly make more detailed reference. In any event, I am satisfied that what was said in Thomson was not intended to be prescriptive. 
      
       
     22    This Court was provided with statistics of the Judicial Commission in relation to offences of escaping from lawful custody. These show that ninety-five per cent of all offenders sentenced in higher courts between January 1993 and December 1999 received full terms of three years or less. Only four per cent were sentenced to terms of three years and another six per cent to lengthier terms, although I observe here that in case anybody examines the mathematics too closely, the statistics are arranged in such a way as to give 101 per cent. The reason for this is obviously the rounding up or down of the number of individual cases considered. Thirty-four per cent were sentenced to a full term of six months; another twenty-seven per cent to a full term of twelve months; eleven per cent to eighteen months and fifteen per cent to twenty-four months. From there the sentences drop dramatically: four per cent were sentenced to two and a half years and another four to three years. These statistics would tend to suggest that the total term imposed on the applicant was at the outer limit, if not outside, the range legitimately open for this offence. 
      
       
     23    The picture, however, is not so stark when minimum or fixed terms are analysed. Fifty-four per cent of offenders were sentenced to a minimum or fixed term of six months and thirty-one per cent to twelve months. Forty-eight per cent were sentenced to twelve months or more. However, the primary sentence is the total term and, having regard to all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that it has been shown to be manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     24    That conclusion means that this Court must proceed to re-sentence. In relation to the appropriate length of sentence, the Crown relies upon the decision of this Court in R v Simonds to which I have just referred in which Wood J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said that the excuse for the escape was not of much assistance. In that case the escape was because of family difficulties and Wood J observed that it was a fact of life that prisoners will undergo personal hardships and these provided no excuse or justification for an escape. 
      
       
     25    The Crown relied upon this decision as authority for the proposition, as I understand what was put, that the motivation for an escape, whatever it is, is not a mitigating factor, and should not be taken into account in the consideration of the sentence. I find that proposition difficult to accept. I am conscious of what Wood J said but I do not regard the judgment as an attempt by his Honour to lay down a binding principle. It only takes a moment's consideration to realise that there can be quite heinous reasons for prisoners to escape. An example proposed in argument was a prisoner who escaped purely for the purpose of doing damage to a witness who is to testify against him or her. Clearly, that would be a more serious escape than an escape of the kind we are here considering, or an escape of the kind the Court was dealing with in Simonds. In any event, when Wood J came to proposing the sentence in Simonds, he went on to take into account that her escape was prompted by news of injury to her son and father.  
      
       
     26    There is no suggestion that Ducker DCJ failed to take into account relevant circumstances. As I have mentioned, he evinced a good deal of sympathy for the applicant. In particular he referred to the applicant's rehabilitation.  
      
       
     27    He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The circumstances of the case are unusual. There is a considerable volume of evidence before me which indicates that over the years since he committed the awful crime to which I have earlier referred, Mr Stokes appears to have undergone a considerable change for the better. This evidence relates to his activities and attitudes in prison over a number of years now, which give the appearance of his having changed his ways and making a determined attempt towards his own rehabilitation, and in trying to assist other prisoners. Perhaps in his own mind he is trying to expiate his sense of guilt for his crime.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       And, later: 
        
        
         
         “For my part I should add that he is to be commended for his determined efforts towards his own rehabilitation before and after his escape. It is most regrettable that that escape has blemished his long period of good behaviour.” 
         
        
       
     28    Relevant circumstances adverse to the applicant in this case include the degree of planning that went into the escape, the use of implements, the fact that he was from a minimum security institution thus endangering beneficial rehabilitative policies for other prisoners and the length of time during which he remained at large. Mitigating circumstances include the circumstances in which he escaped, without violence, the pressure brought to bear upon him by his wife and the absence of any criminality during almost a year of freedom and the fact he supported himself by working during that period of time. 
      
       
     29    Recognition must be given to the very impressive performance whilst he was in custody. Against the possibility of re-sentencing, this Court accepted an affidavit sworn by the applicant today in which he has set out the circumstances of his present incarceration, together with certificates attesting to the courses he has undertaken. 
      
       
     30    More importantly than any of these factors, important though they are, in my opinion there is a clear need for the sentence, whatever its total term, to be structured in such a way as to provide the applicant with the support and assistance he will plainly need on release. In this respect, it is to be observed that he apparently went into custody on 1 September 1986. Even without the sentence for escape, he will have been in gaol very nearly twenty years when he is entitled to release. To turn him out into the community without the benefit of and the obligation to comply with parole conditions and the supervision and assistance of the Probation and Parole Service is to invite disaster, not only for the applicant but also for the community. 
      
       
     31    I would here observe that what used to be the additional term is now the time between the non-parole period and the full term and it is not only beneficial to the prisoner but is also beneficial to the community in bringing about the rehabilitation of released prisoners. It may well be that the sentence that was imposed in 1989 without a non-parole period reflected not only a different sentencing regime but also a different philosophy of sentencing, including what I have just said about the reasons for the imposition of a non-parole period. The usefulness of that non-parole period is not only in relation to the prisoner but also to the community at large. 
      
       
     32    It may also be that what I have said will be interpreted as an attempt to remedy a perceived deficiency in the sentence imposed in 1989. That is not my intention. Such was not the role either of the sentencing court at first instance or this Court on appeal. However, it is proper for this Court to take account of the fact that when his sentence for escaping expires, the applicant will have been incarcerated for almost twenty years and that circumstance alone makes this case, if not exceptional, at least highly unusual.  
      
       
     33    I propose that this Court grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, quash the sentence imposed and re-sentence the applicant to a total term of imprisonment of two years. It is necessary for this Court to sentence under the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 44 requires the Court, firstly, to set the term of the sentence and, secondly, to set a non-parole period which must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances for it being so. 
      
       
     34    For the reasons given by Ducker DCJ in relation to the equivalent provisions under the Sentencing Act 1989 I would adopt his finding of special circumstances. To those reasons I would add, perhaps by way of emphasis, the extraordinarily long time the applicant will have been in custody when he is due for his release and his clear need for the assistance I have mentioned. 
      
       
     35    I therefore propose this Court sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment of two years with a non-parole period of eight months. The sentence is to commence on 10 January 2005. Pursuant to s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in which the provisions of s 24 of the Sentencing Act 1989 are re-enacted, I would make an order directing the release of the applicant on parole at the end of the non-parole period. 
      
       
     36    I propose that the orders of the Court be: 
      
       
        
       1. Leave to appeal granted. 
        
       2. Appeal allowed. 
        
       3. Sentence imposed quashed. 
        
       4. This Court sentences the applicant to a total term of imprisonment for a period of two years with a non-parole period of eight months. 
        
       5. The applicant be released at the end of the non-parole period. 
        
       
     37    IPP AJA: I agree. 
      
       
     38    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. It is obvious from what Simpson J has said this is an exceptional case which may be viewed as such.  
      
       
     39    IPP AJA: The orders of the Court will be as proposed by Simpson J.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONSPERLING JTHURSDAY 01 MARCH 200171244/01 - REGINA v DAVID PETER CAIN(VIDEO LINK TO METROPOLITAN REMAND CENTRE) 
     
      
       
       JUDGMENT No. 1 - On application for bail 
       
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: The applicant is thirty nine years of age and normally resides with his de facto wife Renee Schulz and two children at Banksmeadow, New South Wales. He is an Australian citizen and a holder of an Australian passport which is currently in the possession of the Australian Federal Police. The applicant has a criminal history but it could not be said to be serious, relative to what is frequently seen in this court or of any significant relevance for the present purposes. 
     
      
       
      
    2    The applicant was arrested on 11 January 2000 and has been in prison since that date. He stands charged with conspiracy to import a prohibited import being 74.5 kilograms of ecstasy, that being in excess of the commercial quantity, and with conspiracy to import a prohibited import being 9 kilograms of cocaine also being in excess of the commercial quantity, together with certain other offences which in context are of a less serious nature. 
     
      
       
      
    3    In making a determination as to bail and irrespective of an assumption for or against bail the court is required to take into account the considerations specified in s 32 so far as reasonably ascertained and only those considerations. 
     
      
       
      
    4    The considerations are, in brief form, the probability of the applicant appearing in court in respect of the offence, the interests of the applicant, the protection of any particular person or persons and the protection and welfare of the community.  
     
      
       
      
    5    Section 8A provides that an applicant accused of an offence specified in that section, being certain serious drug offences, which include those with which this applicant is charged, is not to be granted bail unless the applicant satisfies the court that bail should not be refused. In my judgment in Iskandar (22 January 2001, unreported), I reviewed the relevant authorities and I said (at paragraph 15): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “In view of the authorities binding on me I proceed on the basis that where s 8A applies, an application for bail should normally or ordinarily be refused. A heavy burden rests on the applicant to satisfy the court that bail should be granted. The strength of the Crown case is the prime but not the exclusive consideration. Countervailing circumstances common to applications for bail in the generality are to be accorded less weight than in the ordinary case. The application must be somewhat special if the Crown case in support of the charge is strong."" 
         
        
       
      
    6    I apply those principles. However, in the course of my review of the authorities in Iskandar I noted that in Hanley (8 December 1992, unreported) Badgery-Parker J, who had been closely involved in generating the line of authority to which I have referred, granted bail in a s 8A application, notwithstanding a strong Crown case, because of the substantial security offered. The figure in that case was $1 million but as I said in Iskandar (at paragraph 10): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “… the significance of the amount of security offered must vary with the financial circumstances of the persons involved”. 
         
        
       
      
    Hanley is an important precedent in relation to the application of the principles to which I have referred. 
     
      
       
      
    7    I assume for the purpose of the present application, without deciding, that the Crown has a strong case against the applicant in relation to the offences with which he is charged. On the other hand, members of the applicant’s family and others have offered to enter into agreements to forfeit sums of money substantially in excess of $1 million in total. In one instance, the offer is to deposit cash. Otherwise, security over real estate is offered, the properties being of sufficient value on the uncontested evidence to support the respective agreements. There is also uncontested evidence that in almost all instances, the property offered as security is the only significant asset of the individual concerned. That is a factor which strengthens the practical value of the offers in minimising the possibility that the applicant might abscond. 
     
      
       
      
    8    I have regard to the following considerations pursuant to s 32 as to the probability of whether or not the applicant will appear in court in respect of the offences for which bail is sought. The charges are very serious charges. I have assumed for the purpose of the application that there is a strong Crown case. There is, accordingly, on that assumption, a strong motivation for flight, and I take into account that the applicant may have access to funds and the means of obtaining false documents to enable him to disappear. As against that, I find that the applicant has very strong community ties, being ties with his de facto wife, his children and his extended family. There has been no previous failure to appear in court. The prospect that the applicant will appear in court as required would be fortified by the security which can be provided for his attendance. 
     
      
       
      
    9    As to the interests of the applicant, he has a legitimate claim to be at liberty to go about a lawful life and to be with his family pending trial. He has been in custody for over a year. I am told by the Crown that the present charges might not come to trial but a further year. The prospect that a private citizen who has not been convicted of any offence might be imprisoned for as long as two years pending trial is, absent exceptional circumstances, not consistent with modern concepts of civil rights. 
     
      
       
      
    10    As to protection of any particular person or persons, there is no suggestion that, if released on bail, the applicant might cause harm to anyone. 
     
      
       
      
    11    As to the protection and welfare of the community, it is unlikely, in my view, that the applicant would endeavour to carry on any illicit enterprise of a similar kind if released on bail. On the evidence before me, the ring in which the applicant was allegedly involved, has been broken. 
     
      
       
      
    12    Having regard to these considerations I am satisfied that the presumption against bail is displaced and that conditional bail should be granted. 
     
      
       
      
    13    In relation to all outstanding matters and offences I grant bail subject to the following conditions: 
     
      
       
        
       1) The applicant is to enter into an agreement to observe the following requirements as to his conduct while at liberty on bail. 
        
        
       a) He is to reside at 52 Brighton Street, Banksmeadow. 
        
        
       b) He is to report to the officer in charge of the Botany Police Station once on each day, between the hours of 8am and 6pm. 
        
        
       c) He is not to go within one kilometre of the boundary of any airport or recognised point of departure for overseas except as may be necessary for reporting to the police. 
        
        
       d) He is not to associate in any way with any of his co-accused. 
        
        
       e) He is not to communicate directly or indirectly, except through his legal advisers, with any person of whom he has received notice that the person is to be called or is likely to be called by the Crown at his trial. 
        
        
       f) The following persons are to enter into agreements to forfeit the following respective sums if the applicant fails to comply with his bail undertaking, such agreements to be secured by mortgage and caveat over the respective properties specified: Mr W P Cain fifty thousand dollars, 811/243 Pyrmont Street Pyrmont; Ms A Cain fifty thousand dollars, 811/243 Pyrmont Street Pyrmont; Ms R D Schulz one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, 52 Brighton Street Banksmeadow; the applicant, one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, 52 Brighton Street Banksmeadow; Ms R J Schulz, three hundred thousand dollars, 16/16 Morgan Street Botany; Mr B J Dunn, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, 8 Torrens Street Matraville; Mr G A MacDonald, four hundred and fifty thousand dollars, 10/2 Melrose Parade Clovelly; Mr B Schweickle, forty thousand dollars, 24 Toyer Street Tempe. 
        
        
       g) Ms R J Schulz is to covenant by deed that the proposed security over 52 Brighton Street, Banksmeadow, has priority over the existing mortgage for one hundred thousand dollars in her favour over that property. 
        
        
       h) Mr M E Gould is to enter into an agreement to forfeit the sum of one hundred thousand dollars if the applicant fails to comply with his bail undertaking, and is to deposit that sum of one hundred thousand dollars cash as security. 
        
        
       2) Bail is to be automatically revoked in the event of any breach of any one of these conditions and the applicant may thereupon be arrested by any police officer. 
        
        
       3) Without prejudice to any other application to vary this order, liberty to apply to me for any variation to this order within twenty one days from today on two days notice. 
        
        
       4) Bail may be entered into before any justice of the peace.

       JUDGMENT 
       
       
        
         
        
       
      1     
      IPP AJA 
      : The appellant was convicted by a jury in the District Court of three charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In respect of the first count, the appellant was ordered to enter into a recognisance in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour for a period of two years and to place himself under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service during that period. 
       
        
       
      2     
      As regards each of the remaining two counts, a sentence of twelve months periodic detention was imposed, each such sentence to be concurrent upon the other. The appellant appeals against the three convictions. 
       
        
       
      3     
      The complainant in respect of all three offences was Viviana Hanes. The first offence was committed between 8 and 9 pm on 9 January 1999 at 48 Proctor Way, Claymore. The second and third offences were committed between midnight and 1 am on 14 March 1999 at 6 Melliodora Way, Macquarie Fields. 
       
        
       
      4     
      The complainant first met the appellant on 31 January 1998 when she was staying with her parents at 52 Proctor Way, Claymore. The relationship developed and in February 1998 the complainant began residing with the appellant in his house in Parliament Road, Macquarie Fields. 
       
        
       
      5     
      In April 1998 the complainant became pregnant with the appellant's child. At some stage, and it is not clear when, because the complainant gave conflicting evidence in this respect, she moved out of the house in Parliament Road and eventually commenced living in a two-storey town house at 48 Proctor Way, Claymore. The reason for her moving out was that the appellant told her that his cousin, Christine Arpadjian, was coming to live with him. 
       
        
       
      6     
      Later the complainant discovered that Ms Arpadjian was not the appellant's cousin, and was the mother of a child of the appellant known as Domenique Junior. 
       
        
       
      7     
      While the complainant was living at 48 Proctor Way, the appellant brought Domenique Junior to her house where she looked after him. This occurred, according to her, every day. Domenique Junior was then about 18 months old. In December 1998 the complainant gave birth to a boy who was named Claude. Thereafter, she continued to reside in 48 Proctor Way with Claude. According to her, at that stage she was very much in love with the appellant and would see him two or three times a week. The appellant visited her at 48 Proctor Way, and she would also go to the appellant's home in Parliament Road, where she looked after Domenique Junior, Ms Arpadjian not being present at those times. 
       
        
       
      8     
      On 9 January 1999 the appellant came to 48 Proctor Way with Domenique Junior. After about 15 minutes, while she was in the kitchen and the appellant and Domenique Junior were upstairs, she heard Domenique Junior crying. The appellant and Domenique Junior thereupon came downstairs to the kitchen, and the appellant started to punch her in the face, saying that it was her fault that Domenique was crying. 
       
        
       
      9     
      The complainant said that the appellant punched her about three times in the face and in the stomach. She then fell down and he kicked her two or three times. She was severely bruised. The appellant then left taking Domenique Junior with him. These events constituted the prosecution case in regard to the first count. 
       
        
       
      10     
      The appellant denied the complainant's version of what had occurred on the evening of 9 January 1999. He testified that on 9 January 1999, for the entire day, he was at home with Ms Arpadjian and Domenique Junior. Ms Arpadjian at the time was pregnant with another child fathered by him and, indeed, she gave birth to that child at Liverpool Hospital at about 2 am on 10 January 1999. The appellant said that after being with Ms Arpadjian throughout the day of 9 January 1999, he drove to Liverpool Hospital in the evening and waited at the hospital until Ms Arpadjian gave birth. His evidence, in effect, was that the complainant's version was an entire fabrication. 
       
        
       
      11     
      At some stage, which is not entirely clear, the appellant moved his place of residence from Parliament Road to 6 Melliodora Way, Macquarie Fields. According to the complainant, on 28 January 1999 she moved in with the appellant at that address. Ms Arpadjian was also residing there and she and Ms Arpadjian each had a single bedroom. According to the complainant, she believed that Ms Arpadjian's relationship with the appellant was over. 
       
        
       
      12     
      Around midnight on 13 March 1999, the complainant walked into Ms Arpadjian's bedroom and found Ms Arpadjian having sexual intercourse with the appellant. She immediately returned to her own room. Shortly thereafter the appellant came into her room and hit her more than three times with his closed fist. He told her that it was her fault that she saw what was going on in Ms Arpadjian's room. He was very angry with her. The complainant apologised. The appellant told her to pack her bags and leave the house, but she was to leave her child Claude with him. 
       
        
       
      13     
      The complainant asked the appellant to give her another chance. He then left the room. The punches to which I have referred constitute the assault which is the subject of the second charge. 
       
        
       
      14     
      Ms Arpadjian came into the complainant's room and they had a discussion. After Ms Arpadjian left, the appellant entered the room with a baseball bat. He struck the complainant twice on the right side of her ribs with the baseball bat. The appellant then left the room. The blows with the baseball bat constitute the assault which is the subject of the third charge. 
       
        
       
      15     
      According to the complainant, she sustained serious bruising in consequence of the two assaults. Again, the appellant denied the complainant's version entirely. He asserted that the complainant was not living at Melliodora Way on the evening of 13 March. He denied that he owned or possessed a baseball bat. He denied striking the complainant at all. Essentially, he contended that the complainant's allegations were all lies and she was motivated by a resentment caused by the fact that he had rejected her and terminated their relationship. 
       
        
       
      16     
      The complainant was cross-examined extensively and she was in the witness box for some two days. The cross-examination was wide ranging. I shall mention some aspects of it. There were inconsistencies in regard to matters of detail in her testimony, and inconsistencies in her evidence when compared to that of others, and these were all taken up by cross-examining counsel. As mentioned, the complainant testified that she received several bruises as a result of the blows inflicted on her by the appellant. Nevertheless, she had not immediately complained to any person, and had not sought medical attention for her bruises. 
       
        
       
      17     
      Counsel for the appellant questioned her thoroughly about these matters. The appellant's version of their relationship was put to her in detail. Generally she was questioned on every aspect of her testimony, which could be said, in any respect, to be improbable. 
       
        
       
      18     
      The prosecution called Dr Lau, a general practitioner, who testified that he saw the complainant on 16 April 1999 and she complained to him that she was living in a violent relationship. This evidence was admitted on the authority of  
      Regina v DJT 
       [1999] NSWCCA 22, on the basis that the evidence concerned a prior consistent statement that rebutted the suggestion that was to be made in the trial that the complainant had fabricated the charges against the appellant. (See s 108(3) of the  
      Evidence Act 
       1995). No complaint is made in respect of this ruling. 
       
        
       
      19     
      The complainant's mother gave evidence that tended to support the complainant's testimony that she was living at Melliodora Way at the relevant time. She also stated that she had told the complainant to go to the police. The latter piece of evidence was also admitted on the same basis as that of the general practitioner, and similarly no complaint is now made in respect of that ruling. 
       
        
       
      20     
      A further witness, Mrs Carr, also gave evidence that tended to support the complainant's testimony as to her residence in Melliodora Way. It was put to Mrs Carr in cross-examination that she did not like the appellant, and she frankly admitted this. It was plain from her testimony that she was generally inimical to the appellant. 
       
        
       
      21     
      The appellant testified and was cross-examined. Ms Arpadjian also testified and she was cross-examined in particular about a statement she had made which was consistent with the version given by the complainant, as to the incidents that occurred on the night of 13 March 1999. She retracted what she had said in the statement and said that she had made the statement out of anger and jealousy. Mr Dib, a neighbour and friend of the appellant, gave evidence that tended to support the appellant's testimony that at the relevant time the complainant was not living in Melliodora Way. 
       
        
       
      22     
      It can be seen from this brief summary of the testimony given by the various witnesses that the trial was, in essence, a credibility contest between the witnesses who testified on behalf of the Crown and the appellant and his witnesses. In other words, the guilt of the appellant depended upon the jury's view of the credibility of the respective witnesses. 
       
        
       
      23     
      The nature of the dispute was made patently clear by the directions of the learned trial judge. His Honour pointed out that the accounts given by the complainant, her mother and Mrs Carr were irreconcilable with the accounts given by the appellant, Ms Arpadjian and Mr Dib. His Honour pointed out the more important inconsistencies in the testimony of the complainant. He noted that there was no evidence of witnesses who saw any bruises or marks on the complainant. He drew the jury's attention to the fact that the complainant did not speak to her mother, the neighbours, or go to a doctor about what had occurred. 
       
        
       
      24     
      There was a complete absence of corroborative evidence in regard to the bruises that she said she sustained. His Honour told the jury that they should consider whether this was a very serious omission from the case for the prosecution. He pointed out to the jury that according to the hospital records, the appellant was at the Liverpool Hospital birthing unit at about 10 pm on 9 January 1999, and said that this meant that it would have been possible for the appellant to have been at Proctor Way, as alleged by the complainant, but noted that if that were so, ""then his timing must have been extraordinarily good to ensure that Christine, that is, Ms Arpadjian, arrived at the hospital at ten o'clock"". 
       
        
       
      25     
      The learned trial judge pointed out to the jury that there was a crucial question as to whether the complainant was in fact living at Melliodora Way on the evening of 13 March 1999. He pointed out that both the appellant and Ms Arpadjian testified that she was not living there. He said that if it was not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was living at Melliodora Way on the evening in question, then the jury might think that the evidence fell short of establishing the Crown case. 
       
        
       
      26     
      His Honour carefully told the jury what use they could make of the evidence of Dr Lau, the general practitioner. He dealt fully with the conflicting evidence concerning the baseball bat. He detailed inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant as to where she was living at particular times, the periods at which she was living at particular addresses, the length of the relationship with the appellant and other matters. He pointed out the possible bias on the part of Mrs Carr. His Honour dealt fully with the version given by the appellant. He concluded by saying: 
       
        
         
          
          ""You may, of course, rely entirely upon the evidence of Viviana Hanes. She gave sworn evidence as to what she said happened and you may accept what she said, but needless to say, you would do so only after the most careful consideration of what she had to say on the subject."" 
          
         
        
       
      27     
      In the end, the verdict of the jury demonstrates that they rejected the evidence of the appellant and his witnesses and believed the complainant beyond reasonable doubt. 
       
        
       
      28     
      There are fifteen grounds of appeal. These grounds are, however, in effect only particulars of one ground, namely, that the verdicts of the jury are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. It follows that the principles laid down in cases such as  
      M v The Queen 
       (1994) 181 CLR 487 are applicable. That is to say, notwithstanding that there may be evidence to sustain a verdict of guilty, when a Court of Criminal Appeal is asked to conclude that a verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory, it must ask whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. 
       
        
       
      29     
      In answering this question, the Court must pay full regard to the fact that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the fact that the jury has had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses. The Court must decide the question by making its own independent assessment of the evidence. As the majority in  
      M v The Queen 
       said at 494: 
       
        
         
          
          ""It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred."" 
          
         
        
       
      30     
      Most of the fifteen grounds of appeal are repetitive and argumentative. They say little more than that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the verdict, that there was a miscarriage of justice, that the only direct evidence incriminating the appellant was that of the complainant, and that by reason of inconsistencies, inherent improbabilities and other matters, the prosecution witnesses should have been disbelieved and the appellant and his witnesses should have been believed. The appellant also relies on the delay on the part of the complainant in bringing the matter to the attention of the police. 
       
        
       
      31     
      As regards the argument that there was insufficient evidence to sustain a verdict, there was in fact ample evidence to support a conviction. The complainant gave graphic testimony in considerable detail as to the assaults committed upon her. It is the case that the only direct evidence incriminating the appellant was that of the complainant, but the jury were properly instructed in this respect, and they were entitled to rely on that evidence to find that the prosecution case had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
       
        
       
      32     
      The allegation that the complainant ""was on a vendetta and course of revenge in making her allegations against the appellant"" was put to the complainant in cross-examination, and she denied it. A submission to the same effect was put to the jury and was rejected. That is the end of the issue. 
       
        
       
      33     
      The complainant was cross-examined as to the delay in complaining to the police. Essentially she said she was scared of the appellant and was reluctant to proceed. There is nothing improbable in this explanation, and this was accepted by the jury. 
       
        
       
      34     
      There were internal inconsistencies in the appellant's testimony, but these were matters for the jury. They were not of great moment. It was for the jury to decide whether those inconsistencies detracted from her evidence to the extent that she was not to be believed beyond reasonable doubt. The jury did believe the complainant beyond reasonable doubt and it was open for them to do so. 
       
        
       
      35     
      There was nothing inherently improbable in the complainant's version. As regards the differences between her version and between that of the defence witnesses, these were drawn to the attention of the jury. Examples of matters that fell into this category were the assertion that the appellant was with Ms Arpadjian for the whole of 9 January 1999, and could not have committed the assaults alleged; that the complainant never resided at Melliodora Way; the absence of medical evidence to support the testimony of the complainant, and, of course, the fundamental denial of the complainant's version by the appellant. 
       
        
       
      36     
      These matters were all questions for the jury. They were raised properly with the jury and were decided adversely to the appellant. They were essentially matters to be resolved by the jury, who had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses concerned. They do not give rise to any reasonable doubt in the sense described in  
      M v The Queen 
      . 
       
        
       
      37     
      In all the circumstances I would dismiss the appeal.

      REGINA v Isabella Jean CONWAY  
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
     1    HEYDON JA:  This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Kinchington DCJ, QC, on the applicant on the ground that they are manifestly excessive. The applicant submitted that the circumstances were so exceptional that no custodial sentence should have been imposed; alternatively, that if a custodial sentence should have been imposed, that which was imposed was excessive. It must be said at the outset that the case is a most distressing one, but sympathy for the applicant by itself cannot deflect attention from the fundamental issue of whether the sentencing judge’s discretion can be said to have miscarried. 
      
       
     2    On 15 March 2000 the applicant pleaded guilty to five charges of defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s 29D of the Crimes Act 1900 (Cth), and repeated those pleas in the District Court on 16 May 2000. 
      
       
     3    On 17 May 2000 on each charge the sentencing judge imposed a head sentence of 2½ years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months. He ordered that the sentences be served concurrently. He also made an unopposed order that the applicant pay $51,337.85 by way of reparation. 
      
       
     4    The five charges related to over-payments stemming from the applicant’s use of three names and three bank accounts over nearly ten years. Those over-payments totalled $109,905.05. At the time of sentencing, the sum of $58,567.20 had been repaid.  
      
       
     5    The trial judge described the applicant’s subjective circumstances as follows (AB 68.1-71.3): 
      
       
        
         
         “You are presently aged sixty-two, having been born on 5 April 1938, at the present time you are a widow. You reside in premises owned by yourself and which you have told me are valued in the vicinity of just over $300,000. The only money that is outstanding on those premises is the charge to the Social Security Department. It is clear from this material that you have endured a life of hardship. You came from a dysfunctional family background, your parents separated when you were young and it was your practice, or your mother’s practice, to allow you to accompany one of your elder sisters to dances in the town in which you reside[d]. On one of those occasions while you were walking home you were raped by three men. You apparently received no counselling or help following that rape and it undoubtedly has impacted upon you throughout your life. 
         
        
        
         
         Eventually because of the dysfunctional nature of your family life you were placed in a girls’ home in Armidale, you stayed there until you were aged fifteen when you returned home. However things did not get better for you because by this time your mother had acquired a further partner who sexually harassed you following your return home. In order to escape that sexual harassment you married at the early age of sixteen. As a result of that marriage you had three sons but that marriage did not last very long and after some ten years you and your husband separated as a result of his infidelity and other conduct towards you. You were left to raise your three sons and it would seem that you did the best for those sons over the ensuing years and you made every effort to provide those children with a secure home and you did everything to ensure that they would have something after your death. You were very much aware, it would seem, of the fact that you had received no assistance, financial or emotional from either of your parents. 
         
        
        
         
         Two things appear to have dominated your life, firstly the desire to do well and secondly the desire to obtain and own your dream home. It would seem that your first desire has been unfulfilled because a large part of your life, after early business ventures failed has been spent in receipt of pensions under our Social Security system. However, you seem to have acquired your dream home. That dream home, to some extent, I am satisfied was financed by the moneys that you received from the Social Security Department and which you have now agreed to repay to them. 
         
        
        
         
         Following your arrest in respect of these matters it would seem that you have co-operated with the authorities at all times and admitted your guilt in respect of defrauding the Commonwealth of the moneys that have now been specified. It would seem from that material that throughout your life, after two businesses failed, towards the end of the seventies, or in the early eighties, you appeared always to have difficulties with money. You were short of money to pay bills and short of money to make improvements on the houses that you occupied during that time. You were always conscious of the fact that you had received no financial assistance from your parents and you did not want to leave your sons in the same situation and you were conscious that you wanted to leave them some money following your death. 
         
        
        
         
         It is clear from the material contained in the pre-sentence report that you were well aware of your criminal activity and that it was wrong. You now accept that your conduct was unacceptable and you [are] now deeply ashamed and sorry for that criminal behaviour over the nine and a half years during which you conducted this fraudulent activity. It is clear that you wish to make reparation to the best of your ability, it is clear that you have the ability to make full reparation of the moneys that you received from the Commonwealth and you have made some attempt to pay that money, in fact you have paid just over half of the money that you did so fraudulently obtain. Now, as I have previously indicated, you are prepared to sell your house, or raise money on it to complete those reparation payments. 
         
        
        
         
         In summary, your life can be assessed to date as being one full of tragedy to some extent. The partners you have taken up with have not all been supportive of you and certainly have not ended up in providing you with the support that you obviously needed to become a worthwhile member of our community. 
         
        
        
         
         In the Pre-sentence report of 15 May, which was prepared by Marguarita Bonnet, but signed by Lorraine King, you have been assessed as being suitable for all the alternative non full time custodial sentences. I am satisfied that your pleas of guilty and your willingness to pay reparation to the Commonwealth and your general attitude to the situation you are now in represent true contrition and remorse for your criminal conduct over the period in question.” 
         
        
       
     6    He then said (AB 71.3-72.9): 
      
       
        
         
         “I now turn to a consideration of the sentences that I must subject you to in this case. 
         
        
        
         
         You have pleaded guilty to each of these five charges and I accept those pleas as signs of your remorse and contrition for conducting yourself in this criminal way over the nine and a half years in question, however, your pleas of guilty to those charges must be looked at in the light of the extremely strong Crown case that existed against you. Both from a specific and general deterrent point of view persons involved in defrauding the Commonwealth through the Social Security system deserve no sympathy from this Court. Both this Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State have emphasised on many, many, occasions that people who defraud the Social Security system must go to gaol except in the most special of circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
         The concepts of general and specific deterrence are very important in frauds of this nature because the Social Security system is based upon trust and not only must it to be brought home to those who defraud the system that they will be punished but it must also be brought home to others who might be tempted to defraud the system that if they do so and they are caught they also will face severe punishment. One of the disturbing facts of your case is that these frauds were committed over a period of some nine and a half years and involved just over $100,000. 
         
        
        
         
         You certainly are entitled to a discount for your early plea of guilty and your admission of guilt from the outset and I will discount the sentence that I must subject you to because of that factor. One of the matters that has influenced me in determining what I should do with you is the fact that your conduct over the period in question, to my mind, showed a considerable degree of organisation. It was undoubtedly planned, you were aware of the weaknesses in the Social Security system, you used three different names and identities and three different bank accounts to attempt to hide your fraudulent conduct. 
         
        
        
         
         You have no prior convictions but the on-going nature of these offences establishes to my mind that less weight can be given to that fact and the fact that you were previously a person of good character. While you might have been a person of good character at the outset of your fraudulent conduct it seems that you were not such a person half way through or later during the period of your conduct.  
         
        
        
         
         Your age is another problem. You are now, as I said, sixty-one years of age. While not in your twilight years, because a person of sixty-one has many many years of useful life left to them for them to enjoy, you are not young and any sentence that I must subject you to must take that factor into account. 
         
        
        
         
         Bearing in mind that your criminal conduct was over a period of some nine years, leads me to the conclusion that I have no alternative but to subject you to a full time custodial sentence of some severity.” 
         
        
       
     7    He concluded (AB 73.5): 
      
       
        
         
         “It seems to me that in all the circumstances of this case the community’s abhorrence to people committing this type of crime, which involves breaching the trust that is placed in them by the Social Security system can only be appeased by my subjecting you to a head sentence of some two and a half years imprisonment and fixing a non-parole period in relation thereto of fifteen months.” 
         
        
       
     8    Counsel for the applicant advanced three submissions.  
      
       
     9    The first was that the sentencing judge “failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s subjective case”. 
      
       
     10    The second was as follows (written submissions pp 2 and 3): 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned sentencing judge noted that repayment in full would be made and used that finding as demonstrating ‘true contrition’ (Summing Up page 7 [AB 71.1]). He did not however take it into account in any other way in mitigation of penalty. In  
         Raymond Anthony Phelan 
          (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 Hunt CJ at CL stated that where repayment involves considerable sacrifice then the repayment is a matter which can be taken into account. Justice Hunt’s restriction upon the circumstances in which restitution may be relevant was not followed by Justice Smart, who commented (p. 450): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘I regard restitution as an important factor in this type of case and I would not wish to restrict the use of which could be made of that. So much depends on the circumstances of the case.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that the sale of Mrs Conway’s house would involve sacrifice given the priority she has placed upon such ownership. 
         
        
        
         
         The applicant’s readiness and ability to make restitution it is submitted was a matter to which insufficient weight was given by the learned sentencing judge.” 
         
        
        
       Orally, stress was placed on the $58,000 (approximately) paid voluntarily before sentence.  
        
       
     11    The third submission amalgamates the first and second (written submissions p 3): 
      
       
        
         
         “It is submitted that the learned sentencing judge erred in failing to find that this case was one in which very special circumstances existed, so as to justify a penalty of other than full time custody.  
         Regina v Winchester 
          (1992) 58 A Crim R 345. 
         
        
        
         
         Mrs Conway’s immediate confession and early plea, her tragic life history, her candour and contrition, the repayments she had made at the time of sentence and the secure arrangements for full restitution upon the sale of the house, in conjunction with her age, it is submitted, combine to make this an exceptional case. 
         
        
        
         
         Consequently, it is submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive.” 
         
        
        
        
       Did the Subjective Case Constitute Exceptional Circumstances? 
       
     12    Every element of hardship in the applicant’s background on which her counsel relies appears to have been specifically mentioned by the sentencing judge except for Mr Conway’s suicide and the death of her son at the age of 32. The suicide took place in January 1997, relatively late in the period during which the crimes were committed. The son’s death took place in 1991, but the evidence does not appear to demonstrate that it was a justification or excuse for the crimes.  
      
       
     13    In evaluating whether the applicant’s subjective circumstances were sufficiently exceptional to make an appropriate sentence for her significantly below the usual sentences in this type of case, it must be borne in mind, as the sentencing judge did, that social security fraud is a relatively easy crime to commit, so that general deterrence is a particularly important goal; that goal is reflected in the view that “a custodial sentence should be imposed unless there exist some very special circumstances justifying some lesser punishment”: R v Winchester (1992) 58 A Crim R 345 at 347.  
      
       
     14    Social security fraud is a relatively easy crime to commit because persons who claim social security payments are often in genuine and urgent need, and there is no time to investigate their bona fides closely. The price of avoiding hardship by granting speedy relief is the risk of abuse by non-genuine claimants. Thus in R v van Tung Luu (NSWCCA, unrep, 7 December 1984, p 3) Street CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The courts of this State have uniformly sought to make plain to persons who abuse the system of social welfare that they must expect to face heavy penalties. The introduction into the administration of that system of overly meticulous preliminary checks before benefits are paid could result in real hardship to persons whose need for benefits is urgent and immediate. Thus it is that such susceptibility is open to abuse, which results in persons who do abuse it receiving salutary penal consequences at the hands of the courts.” 
         
        
        
       And in  
       R v Purdon 
        (NSWCCA, unrep, 27 March 1997, p 7) Hunt CJ at CL said: 
        
         
         “The rationale stated for the rule that a custodial sentence is to be imposed for social security fraud except in very special circumstances is that the offence is easy to commit but difficult to detect, it is widespread, and the introduction of more checks upon applicants for social security would cause delays in the payment of benefits and therefore hardship to those whose need is urgent. It has also been said that the rule reflects a concern for the protection of the revenue, but I would prefer to express it as a concern for the additional burden upon all taxpayers who shoulder the heavy burden of providing the funds for the social security system to operate and the even heavier burden created by the widespread abuse to it by frauds such as these.” 
         
        
       
     15    The Crown has referred to numerous cases relating to sentencing for social security fraud. Many of the sentences imposed have been much heavier than those imposed on the applicant, often for conduct of less criminality. The serious elements of the applicant’s offences turn on the long period over which they were committed, the premeditation involved, the repeated and continuing character of the misrepresentations, the total sum involved and the degree of planning and organisation evidenced by the use of three different identities and three different bank accounts. The sentencing judge weighed against these matters the unhappy history of the applicant, her age, her health, her good general character, her remorse and contrition, her co-operation with the authorities and the fact that she had made and would continue to make reparation.  
      
       
     16    The circumstances cannot be described as so exceptional that no custodial sentence should have been imposed. Nor can it be said that the circumstances (apart from those to do with reparation) made the sentences manifestly excessive. From one point of view they are comparatively light, and significantly heavier sentences have been imposed on much older people in worse health. Despite that, other minds might have arrived at lower sentences for the applicant, but at the end of the day the applicant’s argument boils down to the proposition that the discretion miscarried because its result was manifestly excessive, not because of any particular identifiable error leading to that result. The sentences determined by the sentencing judge are not outside the bounds of a sound sentencing discretion if reparation issues are left out of account.  
      
       
        
       Repayment 
       
     17    Apart from the reference relied on by the applicant to the applicant’s willingness to pay reparation representing “true contrition and remorse” at AB 71.1, the sentencing judge made three other references to reparation (at AB 67.5, 70.5 and 73.9-74.1).  
      
       
     18    The reference at AB 67.5 was: 
      
       
        
         
         “At the present time it would seem you are reducing your debt to the Commonwealth at the rate of just over $50 per week from pension entitlements that you are presently receiving under the Social Security system. You have also given evidence in these proceedings that it is your intention to place your house on the market for sale and to repay the balance of the money that you acknowledge is owed to the Department.” 
         
        
       
     19    The reference at AB 70.5 was quoted above. 
      
       
     20    The reference at AB 73.9-74.1 was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown seeks a reparation order in the sum of $51.337.85, that is not opposed and I make that order. In making that order I note that the Social Security Department holds a mortgage over your home under the relevant legislation.  
         
        
        
         
         In fixing the sentences I have subjected you to I have taken into account the fact that you have already repaid to the Department over $58,000 and that I will make the reparation order in the sum I have specified.” 
         
        
       
     21    These references, particularly the last, are quite inconsistent with the submission that the sentencing judge only used the fact that the applicant had made and was continuing to make reparation as evidencing contrition and remorse. 
      
       
     22    Whether or not the repayment can be described as involving “considerable” sacrifice in the light of the facts presented to the sentencing judge, it certainly involved real sacrifice. To be compelled to give up the home in which the applicant had lived, a home with which she had presumably had some happy associations, despite the generally sad nature of her life, is a real sacrifice; and it was contemplated that if a loan could not be raised on the house it would have to be sold pursuant to the statutory mortgage. While the sentencing judge did not make an explicit reference to the obvious point just made, it goes without saying, particularly in view of the sentencing judge’s reference to the applicant’s original desire to acquire the house as a “dream home”. It cannot be concluded that the sentencing judge overlooked the point.  
      
       
     23    Accordingly it seems that the sentencing judge did give some weight to the fact that the applicant had before sentence made some, and would in due course make full, reparation, in part by losing equity in her house. 
      
       
     24    Though the sentencing judge did not mention this, in evaluating the hardship to the applicant of possibly losing her house, it must be remembered that some of the proceeds of her crimes were used to improve it.  
      
       
     25    The contention that a discretionary decision on sentencing should be set aside because “insufficient” weight was given to a particular factor is not an easy contention to succeed in. To fail to give any weight to a material matter is an error the evidence of which is relatively easy to demonstrate, and the consequence of which will usually be to cause the decision to be set aside. A contention that there was a failure to give sufficient weight to a particular factor involves a contention that some error occurred in a complex process of weighing that factor with others. However, an error of principle or a result which is plainly indicative of some error can be caused, and evidenced, by a failure to give sufficient weight to a relevant factor. 
      
       
     26    The sentencing judge considered a wide range of relevant matters. The applicant concedes that he gave some weight to the reparation question.  
      
       
     27    The Crown referred to R v Price (NSWCCA, 2 September 1993, unreported) and R v Hull (NSWCCA, 6 October 1994, unreported). The Crown pointed to the sentences in R v Price, which were much heavier than those imposed on the present applicant, despite the fact that approximately $1,000,000 was recovered after the sentence from asset sales. However, the criminal record of the accused in R v Price was bad. The Crown also submitted that in R v Hull distressing personal circumstances did not deflect the court from the view that there should be a full time custodial sentence. That may be accepted: the issue is whether the sentence actually imposed was too long. The Crown also submitted that the sale of the applicant’s house, which at the time of sentence was seen as a real possibility, could not be characterised as causing her much prejudice, because even after a sale and repayment of what was owed she would still have about $300,000. That does not grapple with the non-monetary prejudice of losing the home with which part of her past life had been associated.  
      
       
     28    In my judgment when one couples the substantial voluntary pre-sentence payments with the real hardship involved in the possible loss of her home, the submission that insufficient weight was given to reparation factors is valid.  
      
       
        
       Orders 
       
     29    I am of the opinion that orders should be made which would have the result of the applicant being released today, while not altering the balance of the sentence. Settlement of the form of the orders is left to counsel.  
      
       
     30    BELL J: I agree. 
      
       
     31    SMART AJ: I agree.

       5. Pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the  
       Crimes Act 
        1914 (Cth) the applicant be released on 2 March 2001 upon entering into a recognizance herself in the sum of $100 to be of good behaviour until 16 November 2002.]

     DETERMINATION OF LIFE SENTENCE 
      
       
        
       
      
     1     
     HIS HONOUR: For reasons which will be apparent, I propose to give my decision in this matter now rather than to reserve my decision. The result will be that what I now say could no doubt be more elegantly expressed with the luxury of time in preparation and would likely be a good deal shorter. 
      
       
      
     2     
     This is an application for re-determination of a life sentence pursuant to the scheme in Schedule 1 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 
     . This is a case in which it is appropriate to grant the application and to re-determine the sentence. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The applicant was born on 15 May 1947. On 14 February 1989, the applicant murdered Kim Susan Cameron. For that crime, he was indicted before McInerney J and a jury on 27 February 1990. On 1 March 1990, the jury found the applicant guilty as charged.  
      
       
      
     4     
     On 11 May 1990, McInerney J sentenced the applicant to penal servitude for life as he was bound to do. The following findings were made in the course of his Honour’s remarks on sentencing. The applicant had previously had a de facto relationship with the deceased. They had separated. The deceased had a child called Elana from a previous relationship. The deceased had formed another relationship with a Mr Harrison at or about the time of the break-up with the applicant. That break-up had occurred it seems late in the year 1988. 
      
       
      
     5     
     Elana attended a kindergarten at Revesby. On the day before the murder, the applicant waited for the deceased at Revesby railway station and had a conversation with her there. He was keen to resume his relationship with the deceased. She gave him no encouragement. The following day was Valentine’s Day. The applicant drove to the kindergarten in his van and waited to see the deceased there. He had brought flowers with him to give to her, which were later found in the van. These facts indicate that the applicant went to the kindergarten that day with the intention of trying to persuade the deceased to resume their former relationship. McInerney J made no finding to the contrary of that. 
      
       
      
     6     
     The deceased did not arrive at the kindergarten alone, she arrived in a vehicle driven by Mr Harrison. Mr Harrison’s presence appears to have inflamed the applicant. He left his vehicle, not with the flowers but with a knife on his person and approached the deceased in a rage. He first punched the deceased and then he stabbed her twice in the chest, causing injuries from which she died. 
      
       
      
     7     
     From his actions and from what he said at the time it is clear that he stabbed the deceased with the intention of killing her. At precisely what point in time he formed that intention is not, however, clear. The fact that he punched the deceased first suggests that it was in the course of the attack that he formed the intention to kill. At all events, the elements in the episode which need to be recognised are that this was a killing without premeditation; that it was done in a state of extreme rage and that the intention to kill was formed in that state. 
      
       
      
     8     
     It is also to be noted that at the time of the event the deceased’s child was in the vehicle and witnessed what occurred. The child was then about four years of age. Her presence was either known to the applicant or was reasonably to be assumed by him. 
      
       
      
     9     
     At the trial, the applicant raised the partial defence of diminished responsibility. Expert evidence was called by both sides. The jury’s verdict demonstrates that they rejected the defence. McInerney J found that he himself was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the applicant was, as had been alleged, mentally dissociated at the time. His Honour acknowledged that the applicant was enraged but his Honour was unimpressed with that consideration as a possible matter in mitigation. 
      
       
      
     10     
     That the killing was carried out in the sight of the deceased’s child was of course a very significant matter of aggravation. It is moderated to some extent by the fact that the deceased was at the time in a state of rage and would have been less capable, by reason of his emotional state, to appreciate the implications of the child being present. Nonetheless, having made that observation, I do not lose sight of the stark reality that to kill a mother in the presence of a young child is an aggravating factor of very considerable moment. It goes to the culpability of the accused, it is part of the objective circumstances of the crime. 
      
       
      
     11     
     There was evidence before the sentencing judge of feelings of remorse shortly after the incident. Some 40 minutes later the prisoner rang the triple O number and stated, in emotional tones, that he had just killed his girl and wanted to hand himself in. Among other things, he said, “I think she is dead, I hope not.” Later the same day, he telephoned Mrs Jennings, a friend with whom he had been living. He was crying on the telephone. He said he had done something terrible and wanted to talk to her. Meanwhile, the police had been looking for the applicant. When initially observed the applicant was wearing a black t-shirt with a gold motif. He was seen to take off the t-shirt, turn it inside out and put it back on again. This, I would interpret, was a clumsy attempt to avoid apprehension at that stage. However, when approached by a police officer immediately thereafter the applicant said, “Okay I did it, the girl at Revesby, I’m so sorry.” Asked what he had done, the applicant said, “I stabbed her. I should have punched her but I stabbed her. Is she dead?” He was then spoken to by a more senior police officer and, after an official warning, said, “Yes, mate, I have killed Kimmie.” 
      
       
      
     12     
     McInerney J had before him the report of Ms S Feld, Probation and Parole Service, Hurstville district office. The report was dated 26 April 1990. She also gave oral evidence. The substance of what she said, so far as is presently material, is as follows: The applicant was born and raised in New Zealand. He was raised apart from his siblings when, following his parents separation, he was sent to a farm where he resided with an aunt and uncle. He remained there from the age of 12 to 18 years, when he joined the New Zealand Army. He first married in 1970 to a Czechoslovakian woman. The relationship terminated when his wife returned to Czechoslovakia for vacation and was not allowed to leave the country. She was subsequently killed in a motor car accident and their daughter remained in Czechoslovakia raised by her maternal grandparents. The applicant migrated to Australia in 1975. Five years later, he met and married an Australian woman. The marriage was brief and the applicant had since been involved in several de facto relationships. The applicant had met the deceased in 1986 and they had commenced co-habiting soon after. Co-habitation was intermittent. In 1986, there was an incident of assault on the deceased. The applicant had a limited education, and did manual work in New Zealand and Australia. Inquiries with several employers revealed that the applicant was generally well regarded and there were no significant problems relating to his employment. 
      
       
      
     13     
     At interview with Ms Feld, the applicant was visibly distressed when discussing the offence and his actions on that day. He admitted that, prior to going to the kindergarten, he had consumed several cans of beer and had smoked marijuana. He said he had intended to see his wife and give her the flowers which he had bought for Valentine’s Day. It was the sight of Mr Harrison which caused him to become angry and to lose control. He referred to his strong love for the deceased and to a deep sense of loss, not only for himself but also for the victim’s family and child. 
      
       
      
     14     
     Ms Feld’s overview was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Tumanako appears to have experienced a disturbed childhood and adolescence. Inquiries had suggested that he becomes extremely involved and exhibits feelings of strong emotional attachment in intimate relationships. Unresolved feelings, conflicts from earlier life, including physical abuse and active combat duty, may have some bearing on his behaviour. In this respect, it may be that Mr Tumanako has difficulty with painful aspects of reality. It is considered that Mr Tumanako may benefit from psychological psychiatric counselling to assist him in dealing with the above-mentioned areas during the period of his incarceration.” 
         
        
       
      
     15     
     I mention in passing that the history of active combat duty was not in fact correct. The reasons for that history having been given emerges from the documents I have seen. I do not regard it as being a matter of significance. 
      
       
      
     16     
     The applicant’s criminal history prior to this crime, consists of two convictions for assault female committed when the applicant was 18 years of age. That was in New Zealand. The papers indicate that these were not serious offences in the scale of that particular crime. Note needs also to be taken of the applicant’s age at that time. On 29 October 1982, the applicant committed the offence of accessory after the fact to armed robbery for which he was sentenced in the District Court at Sydney to six years hard labour with a non-parole period of two years. Further details in relation to that offence, apparent from the papers, would indicate the applicant had not taken an active part in the robbery itself and that the offence had to do with concealment of relevant information. The offence does not, therefore, of itself, give rise to apprehension of a violent disposition. On 26 September 1984, the applicant committed the offence of negligent driving and driving while unlicensed, for which he was fined $100 each charge, in default four days hard labour. That is the applicant’s prior criminal history. 
      
       
      
     17     
     The court has before it a statement of facts prepared by the Director of Public Prosecutions, dated 9 September 1999. What is contained in that statement and in the annexures to it is largely covered by the findings made by McInerney J in his remarks on sentence insofar as it relates to events prior to and on the day of the crime. Insofar as it relates to the applicant’s history in prison since that time, I will refer in a more compendious way to that aspect of the matter at a later stage. 
      
       
      
     18     
     The Court also has a report of the Serious Offenders Review Council, dated 19 October 1999. The report reviews the applicant’s prison history up to that point in time. It concludes with the following comment: 
      
       
        
         
         “Throughout his period of incarceration Tumanako has generally presented in a favourable light. He has taken advantage of therapeutic and education courses. It is unfortunate, however, that he has devoted such extraordinary energy into manipulating his placement in the Sydney Metropolitan area. This manipulation has undoubtedly affected his ability and readiness to progress through the security classifications. If the Court re-determines his sentence of life imprisonment then the Council will endeavour to extend Tumanako’s personal development and secure his progress through the remainder of the security classifications and, in due course and subject to satisfactory behaviour, will recommend his placement in unescorted external pre-release leave programs.” 
         
        
       
      
     19     
     The court has had the benefit of oral evidence from Mr McConnell, the present secretary of the Council. I should record that his evidence was led by the Crown. Having regard to his evidence and other material before the court, I do not accept that the applicant has behaved unreasonably in relation to his endeavours to serve his sentence, in recent years, in the Sydney area rather than in any country corrective institution. It appears now to be common ground that the applicant’s endeavours in that regard have, first of all, been carried out in a regular manner and, secondly, have been motivated by a wish to maintain contact with his daughter with whom he was reunited in 1995 and who, through her own ill-health, was unable to visit him while he was incarcerated out of Sydney. It further appears from the evidence before me that the applicant’s actions in that regard have not had any demonstrable effect at all on his movement through the classification system towards readiness for release into the community. 
      
       
      
     20     
     I think it is unfortunate that the construction on events, as conveyed in the report of 19 October 1999, came to be put before the court as an authoritative view of the situation at that time. 
      
       
      
     21     
     It is apparent that the applicant has participated extensively in programs within the prison system by way of vocational education and by way of psychological improvement. This is demonstrated by a substantial collection of certificates that have been placed before the court. They are annexed to the applicant’s notice of reply to the Crown statement of facts. 
      
       
      
     22     
     Of considerable importance is a supplementary report by the Serious Offenders Review Council which is dated 21 February 2001. It and materials appearing in the earlier report satisfy me of two things. First, it appears that certain incidents, occurring particularly earlier in the sentence, which on the face of it indicate a degree of unruly behaviour, may in fact have been nothing of the kind. I think it would be unjust in view of what I have heard to allow those earlier reports to influence my judgment. 
      
       
      
     23     
     The second thing that emerges from the supplementary report and the materials attached to both reports of the Council is that the applicant has applied himself assiduously to self-improvement during his prison sentence, that he has been of considerable assistance to the prison authorities in mentoring younger prisoners and in settling factional friction within the prison system. Notwithstanding the ordinary provocation of prison life and perhaps more particularly so in regard to an inmate who is taking an active part in assisting prison authorities, the appellant has not, according to his own evidence, ever responded in an untoward manner. If he had, one would expect that to have come to notice and to be apparent from the material put before the Court. 
      
       
      
     24     
     The supplementary report of the Council dated 21 February 2001 concludes with an overview as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the court decides to grant Tumanako’s application and determine his sentence so that he is eligible to be considered for released to parole at some time in the future, then the SORC will develop a management plan for Tumanako’s reduction to minimum security, that is C1, C2 and C3, whereupon he will be considered for participation in the pre-release unescorted leave programs, including day and weekend leave, education leave and work release. The purpose of such programs is to allow inmates a structured reintroduction to the community. The customary time table for minimum security for long term inmates like Tumanako is five years. The Department’s policy generally requires an inmate to be in the last 18 months of their sentence before entry to pre release programs as approved.” 
         
        
       
      
     25     
     In this regard, I refer again to the evidence of Mr McConnell, who made it clear that, in the event of a re-determination, which does not allow for a period as long as five years to elapse before the expiry of a minimum term or non parole period, the prison authorities make a practice of endeavouring to construct an accelerated program for the individual prisoner, with the objective of completing such a program within the time remaining for the non parole period. 
      
       
      
     26     
     I pause there to make the following observations. I have heard that in the ordinary course of things an application of this kind is initiated by an approach by the prison authorities to the particular prisoner with the suggestion that the time has been reached when such an application would be appropriate. It seems, therefore, that, as a practical matter, the initiation of the process is by the prison authority. A prisoner might not otherwise be aware of the entitlement to apply and, if aware, might be loath to initiate the move without the co-operation and goodwill of the prison authority. So the position seems to be that prison inmates are in the hands of the prison authority concerning the initiation of applications of this kind. 
      
       
      
     27     
     I would then observe that, in the present case, a period of two and a half years has elapsed between the making of the application by filing the process in this court and the matter coming before a judge for determination. I hasten to say that the matter came into a list for call-over only at the end of last year and a fixture in February of this year could hardly have been more prompt. The delay is attributable to the lodgment of documentary material by agencies of the Crown, namely, the Director of Public Prosecution’s office, SORC and the Legal Aid Commission. 
      
       
      
     28     
     I make no criticism. The time may be required to gather in all of the material that is necessary. However, it is unfortunate that the court should, in such circumstances, be informed, as this court was informed, by the supplementary report of the Council of 21 February 2001, that it would, in effect, be five years from a determination before the prison system would be able to make the applicant ready for release. As I have mentioned, the oral evidence given in the case is to the contrary. It would be preferable if, in applications such as this, the Council were to put the position in its report in a way which better reflects the reality. What I have just said is however in a sense by the by for this reason. 
      
       
      
     29     
     In a case such as this, where the sentence is to be re-determined, the court will exercise its function having regard to the principles which apply to sentencing and having regard to the material before the court, which includes what was before the sentencing judge and what has since become available. The court will not have the regard to prison policy or the implementation of prison policy or the timing of the implementation of prison policy in determining what is an appropriate sentence in a given case. So, for the Council to state how much time is needed to implement a redetermination is as ineffectual as it appears to be inaccurate. 
      
       
      
     30     
     There is, nonetheless a practical matter that I cannot ignore. It appears from the material before me that the prison authority does not, as a matter of practice promote a prisoner serving an old style life sentence until such time as it receives notice of a redetermination. Such reclassification is, I understand, a necessary step in the progress of the prisoner towards readiness for release. To that extent, it seems that the court’s intentions may be subject to prison policy which is, to say the least, unfortunate. All I can do to minimise any such impediment is to avoid further delay in bringing the application to a conclusion. It is for that reason that I have given an ex tempore decision. 
      
       
      
     31     
     The court also has before it a supplementary notice of reply to the Director of Public Prosecutions statement of facts which is dated 1 March 2001. Annexed to that document are a report by Dr J M Carne, forensic psychiatrist, and a report by Mr W J Taylor, clinical forensic psychologist. The first of those reports is dated 19 February 2001, the second 28 February 2001. 
      
       
      
     32     
     Dr Carne has specifically addressed the risk of re-offending. He says, 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Tumanako is not a violent man, he does not have an antisocial personality, he has normal intelligence, he does not abuse drugs or alcohol, he has always been a hard working conscientious man and has an almost exemplary record within gaol. I asked Mr Tumanako what the likelihood would be of the offence being repeated. He told me he has no interest in returning to relationships. His life will revolve around family, particularly his grandchildren and his daughter, with whom he has only reunited in 1995.” 
         
        
       
      
     33     
     Dr Carne’s conclusion was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is no evidence of any psychiatric disorder being involved in this offence, suggestions that dissociation or psychogenic amnesia took place are not supported by the facts or the literature. Mr Tumanako expressed profound regret for the offence and takes full responsibility for it. His behaviour in general in prison has been exemplary. In my opinion there is little chance of the offence being repeated. There is no evidence that there are any other psychiatric factors which need to be taken into account.” 
         
        
       
      
     34     
     I do not share Dr Carne’s assumption or acceptance of what he took to be the applicant’s statement that the applicant has no interest in returning to relationships. It is clear that the applicant is an emotional man and I do not doubt that, on his release, he will again become involved with a woman or women in an intimate way. That, however, does not seem to me to be fundamentally discordant with Dr Carne’s analysis of the situation. 
      
       
      
     35     
     Mr W J Taylor was also involved in the matter at the time of the applicant’s sentence. In the course of his later report he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The impression gained from Mr Tumanako was that he is very remorseful for having committed the offence and is fully accepting responsibility for his behaviour in committing the offence. He still is somewhat tearful in talking about the deceased and clearly has not stopped grieving over her death and the fact that he caused it. However, it is also of significance that he appears to be reunited with his daughter and indeed spoke about his daughter and grandchildren with a great deal of reflection. Should he be released from prison he stated that he has been asked by his daughter to live with her and her family.” 
         
        
       
      
     36     
     Mr Taylor was also of the opinion, along with Dr Carne, that there is no evidence of personality disorder in this case. Mr Taylor went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         “From the basis of information that has been available to me at the time of preparing this report it would seem that many changes have occurred in Mr Tumanako since he has been convicted of the offence of murder. His remorse does appear to be quite genuine and he does seem to have made very real efforts at rehabilitation. An actuarial assessment of his potential for recidivism suggests that this is quite low and there was no information that could be gained which would suggest that he is indeed likely to re-offend. Mr Tumanako is now a 53 year old man who does seem to have made some plans for his life should he be released from gaol, these plans do seem to be quite appropriate.” 
         
        
       
      
     37     
     The applicant gave evidence in the proceedings. It appears that, at an earlier time in his life and by reason of the unfortunate experience of a violent father he grew up with the notion that it was justifiable to use violence in circumstances where it seemed that that was the appropriate course. He gave evidence of being reunited with his daughter in 1995, and it is apparent that a close relationship has developed there, not only with her but with his grandchildren as well. His daughter has suffered a mental health problem, to which I have earlier referred and there is some illness involved with one of the grandchildren. These have been matters of understandable distress to the applicant. More particularly, it seems to me that the applicant’s experience of being reunited with his own daughter has very considerably potentiated his feelings of remorse and his sense of responsibility for the crime for which he is now serving a sentence. I believe it has been brought home to him that the fact that this crime was committed in the sight of the deceased’s child is a matter of particular importance and one which heightens his own responsibility for the crime very considerably. 
      
       
      
     38     
     On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that, notwithstanding the internalising of a sense of justification in relation to violence having occurred early in the applicant’s life, this was no longer to be seen as a feature of his personality, as demonstrated by his prison history. It was emphasised on his behalf that there is no evidence of a pathological basis for the crime and hence no evidence of a pathological basis for of any similar behaviour. 
      
       
      
     39     
     It was pointed out, appropriately it seems to me, having regard to what I have seen, that the applicant’s behaviour in prison has been exemplary and that his prospects of rehabilitation on release from gaol are as good as one might expect. 
      
       
      
     40     
     It is argued, I think with some force, that there is a diminishing return to be gained from the prolongation of prison sentences beyond what is necessary. 
      
       
      
     41     
     The Crown very properly took the position that it neither opposed nor consented to the present application. Helpful data has been produced by the Crown showing the level of sentences which have been imposed by individual judges and by courts of appeal in relation to offences of a similar kind. Very properly, the Crown raises for consideration by me whether the applicant’s behaviour in prison, non violent as it has been, is a reliable indication that he would not again be violent in the context of a relationship with a woman at some future time. The Crown also raised for consideration, again very properly, whether the role of alcohol might not again be a factor in leading the applicant to re-offend. The applicant concedes that, before this crime, he did on occasions tend to drink too much and it does seem likely that alcohol played a role, perhaps not a very significant role but a role nonetheless, both in this crime and in the earlier less serious episode of assault on the deceased. I am not satisfied that the considerations to which I have referred raise a serious prospect of any similar crime being committed by the applicant or, indeed, any crime of violence on release from prison. 
      
       
      
     42     
     As indicated earlier in these reasons for decision the court is bound by the usual principles relating to sentencing. I am bound to take into account the role of a prison sentence in serving to rehabilitate the individual offender. I am bound to have regard to the role of convictions of this kind and sentences of this kind in deterring other would-be offenders from behaving in a similar way. I am also bound to have regard to the role of a sentence such as this in deterring the individual offender from re-offending in a similar way. Last but, in my view, far from least, the court is bound to take account of the legitimate demand of the community in any civilised society for punishment and retribution in response to breaches of the law and, most particularly, in the case of serious offences such as this. I have regard to all those considerations in the present case. 
      
       
      
     43     
     Applying those principles to the facts and circumstances as presently disclosed, an appropriate sentence in the present case by way of re-determination is a sentence of imprisonment of 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 years. The re-determined sentence will operate from the date on which the applicant was taken into custody, namely, 14 February 1989. The non-parole period will expire on 13 February 2003. That is the earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole. 
      
       
      
     44     
     I express my hope and expectation that the prison authorities will do whatever is necessary to maximise the prospect that the applicant will be released from prison on or shortly after that date.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
     1    HEYDON JA: This is an appeal by the Crown against the sentence imposed on the respondent on the grounds of its alleged manifest inadequacy. 
      
       
     2    On 13 September 2000 the respondent pleaded guilty to the charge of having been knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of a prohibited import to which s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 applies, being narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of heroin not less than the commercial quantity applicable to heroin.  
      
       
     3    Kinchington DCJ, QC, sentenced the respondent to 6 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months. It may be accepted that that was a lenient sentence; the question is whether it was appellably wrong.  
      
       
     4    The essence of the Crown complaint is that in R v Wong (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 this Court provided an indicative range of 8 to 12 years’ imprisonment for importations of between 1.5 and 3.5 kilograms of heroin; that the quantity involved here was 1.9264 kilograms; that, contrary to the sentencing judge’s opinion, there were no special features sufficient to take the case outside the range indicated in R v Wong; and that the ratio of non-parole period to head sentence should have been about two-thirds, not about 54 percent.  
      
       
     5    At 7.45 pm on 4 May 2000, the respondent arrived at Sydney Airport on a Qantas flight from Bangkok. At 8.50 pm an officer of the Australian Customs Service stopped the respondent as he was heading to the “Green Nothing to Declare” exit. He and other officers questioned the respondent and examined his bags. In the course of conversation about the respondent’s Buddhism, the respondent showed them a small tattoo on his lower left arm. He was asked if he had more tattoos. He said he had two on his chest, and lifted his shirt to reveal them. It was noticed that there was an abrasion on his skin and some tape around his back. The sentencing judge described what happened next as follows (AB 17.7-19.1): 
      
       
        
         
         “A search was then conducted by the Customs Service of the terminal area and located in one of the toilet areas was a blue carry bag, which on examination contained a white powder when subject to a presumptive drug test proved to be heroin. 
         
        
        
         
         Those packages were consistent with being packages that could be carried on the body of a person. The powder in the packages was ultimately subject to analysis and found to contain heroin of 69.8 to 74.3 per cent purity, and it has been estimated the pure weight of heroin contained in those packages was 1,926.4 grams. 
         
        
        
         
         The offender was interviewed, and during the course of that interview he admitted that he had taken those packages out of Bangkok. He informed the officers in the course of that record of interview that he had been recruited, I think, in Singapore, flown to Bangkok where the packages had been attached to his body, and received instructions to hand them over in the course of the flight to Australia to another person, whom he would meet on that flight. 
         
        
        
         
         He says that that was done in the course of the flight. He identified the packages that were found in the toilet area as being the packages that he had taken out of Bangkok, and [which] he had given to the person on the flight to Sydney. He also informed the police that, so far as he was aware, the final destination of the heroin was to be Christchurch in New Zealand, but that he did not know how it was to get there after he handed it to the man on the flight to Sydney.  
         
        
        
         
         He also indicated that his air fare and the sum of $1,500 which was found in his possession were provided to him by the persons behind the operation. He says that the only name that he knew was the name Ben and he had a phone number he was to contact. Enquiries made by the Australian Federal Police force in regard to the phone number and the name Ben did not help the investigating authorities locate anyone else connected with the importation of the heroin into Australia. 
         
        
        
         
         The estimated wholesale value of the heroin was just over $500,000, and it had an estimated street value of just over $5,500,000.”  
         
        
       
     6    Initially the respondent was charged with importing heroin, and he pleaded guilty to that charge on 18 August 2000 before the Chief Judge of the District Court. He adhered to that plea when he was brought before the sentencing judge for sentence on 11 September 2000. After the evidence had closed and addresses had been completed, the sentencing judge opined that the facts proved did not establish importation, as distinct from being knowingly concerned in importation. The Crown asked for an adjournment and the matter was stood over to 13 September 2000. The charge was amended from importation to being knowingly concerned in importation. The respondent pleaded guilty to the amended charge and after further argument and a short period of reservation the respondent was sentenced.  
      
       
     7    The operative parts of the sentencing judge’s reasoning so far as they bear on the determination of his sentence were as follows (AB 19.4-20.8, 21.2-22.8 and 23.2-.8): 
      
       
        
         
         “He is a young man now aged twenty-eight, having been born on 25 December 1972. He is a citizen of Singapore. He is single and has no family or no children. 
         
        
        
         
         At the time he was recruited to bring this heroin on to the plane whose destination was Australia, he was unemployed, although he had previously worked as a driver and a butcher. He had previously been to Australia in 1989 with his family. 
         
        
        
         
         He has no prior criminal convictions in Australia, and I am not aware that he has any prior criminal convictions either in Singapore or anywhere else in the world. He has pleaded guilty to this charge and has co-operated with the authorities from the outset. Indeed, it could be said that if he had exercised his right of silence when questioned by the customs officials and the Australian Federal Police, that they would have had no material which would have established his connection with the heroin found in the toilet cubicle at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport. 
         
        
        
         
         He has at no stage tried to hide his involvement as a courier in this operation to bring the heroin into Australia so that it could be re-exported apparently to Christchurch in New Zealand. I accept his pleas of guilty and his co-operation with the Australian Federal Police at the early stage that it was done as a genuine sign of his remorse and contrition for the criminal act he got involved in on this occasion. 
         
        
        
         
         He has been in custody since his arrest on 4 May this year. While in custody, he has pursued a number of educational courses, and certificates relating to those courses are contained in exhibit 1 herein. I will have copies of those certificates made. The copies will stay with the file and the originals will be returned to him.  
         
        
        
         
         I now turn to a consideration of the sentence I must subject him to. The offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a commercial quantity of heroin into Australia is indeed a serious criminal one. As I have previously indicated, the maximum penalty available to me in respect of this type of offence is life imprisonment. Both from a general and a specific deterrent point of view, I must subject the prisoner to a severe penalty. 
         
        
        
         
         It seems to me that none of the sentencing options other than a full-time custodial sentence is available to me in this case. This is an unusual case. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         As I have indicated, I am satisfied that from the prisoner’s co-operation with the authorities from the outset and his forthrightedness during the course of being interviewed by the Australian Federal Police that at no stage did he try to hide his involvement in this operation. I am satisfied from all the material that has been placed before me that he was a courier and that his role was to partake in the chain of carriage of this drug, this prohibited drug, into Australia. 
         
        
        
         
         As I said, both from a general and a specific deterrent point of view, it must be brought home not only to the prisoner but also to others who might be tempted to act as couriers or play a part, even though they consider it a minor part, in the importation of illicit drugs into Australia, that if they do and they are caught they will be severely dealt with by this Court. 
         
        
        
         
         In recent years, the Supreme Court of New south Wales in exercising its jurisdiction as a Court of Criminal Appeal has set down sentencing guidelines in relation to the importation of heroin in the case of R v Wong and Leung. Those guidelines would indicate that so far, for those involved in the importation or those connected with the importation of a low range commercial quantity of heroin, that is, between one and a half kilograms to 3.5 kilograms, can look forward to being subject to terms of imprisonment between eight and twelve years in the ordinary case. 
         
        
        
         
         As I have indicated, this is no ordinary case. It has a number of unusual features, one being the fact that the accused pleaded guilty when charged with importation; did not seek to hide behind the fact that that importation charge could not be proved; and when it was changed to one of being knowingly concerned in the importation of this commercial quantity of heroin, he also pleaded guilty to that charge. 
         
        
        
         
         Another unusual feature is that it was only through questioning of the prisoner that the part that he played in the bringing of this heroin into Australia was ascertained. To some extent, it could be said that he has been subject to a double jeopardy, not in the true sense of that word, but in the broader sense of that word. 
         
        
        
         
         In any event, I am satisfied that his remorse and contrition is of the highest order that one could have in regard to remorse and contrition, that he is entitled to the benefit of that. He is entitled to a benefit on his sentence, which is otherwise appropriate, discounted because of his early plea. He has admitted his guilt and pleaded at the first available opportunity. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         I have already indicated that I think this is a case in which I must subject him to a full-time custodial sentence. 
         
        
        
         
         I also note that the prisoner is not a national of this country, and that any sentence he will serve will be served without the support of close family or friends. It is highly unlikely that he will have anyone visiting him while he is in custody from his own family or from his friends. Of course, that is something that he would have expected if he was caught bearing in mind his connection with this country. 
         
        
        
         
         In all the circumstances of this case, and bearing in mind it is an unusual one, I think that it falls just outside the sentencing guidelines referred to in the case of Wong and Leung. It seems to me that an overall prison sentence in the vicinity of some six years is an appropriate sentence to subject the prisoner to in this case, and to fix a non parole period of three years and three months in relation to it in the special circumstances of this matter, special and unusual circumstances of this matter.” 
         
        
       
     8    The Crown identified the unusual features on which the sentencing judge relied in the following terms (written submissions, p 6): 
      
       
        
         
         “(i) The fact that the accused pleaded guilty when charged with importation and that he did not seek to hide behind the fact that that importation charge could not be proved and that when changed to a charge of being knowingly concerned, he also pleaded guilty to that charge. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) It was only through questioning of the prisoner that the part he played in the bringing of the heroin into Australia was ascertained. 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) His remorse and contrition was of the highest order entitling him to a benefit on sentence which would be further discounted because of his early plea.” 
         
        
       
     9    The Crown then advanced the following submissions (written submissions pp 7-10): 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown respectfully submits that the features identified by the learned trial judge were not such as to take the case outside the guideline judgment, nor ‘out of the ordinary’ in respect of comparable cases. 
         
        
        
         
         It is respectfully submitted that his Honour erred in concluding that the importation charge could not itself have been proved. A person who consigns goods into Australia, who posts them for collection within Australia, or who physically carries them onto an aeroplane which will land in Australia, is guilty of the act of importing a prohibited import irrespective of whether he physically carries the item personally, utilizes innocent agents such as the postal service or hands it to another participant in a joint enterprise. 
         
        
        
         
         As observed by the High Court in  
         White v Ridley 
          [(1978) 140 CLR 342]: ‘the applicant did not himself bring the cannabis into Australia; it was brought in by the airline. However, it is well settled at common law that a person who commits a crime by the use of an innocent agent is himself liable as a principal offender’; per Gibbs J at 346 (see also Stephen J at 353; Jacobs at 360). 
         
        
        
         
         The present Respondent did not abandon any available defence. To the extent that there was a change of charge in the Indictment to which the Respondent again entered a plea of guilty, there were neither any alteration in the objective level of criminality, nor was there any special circumstances (such as  
         Bernier 
          abandoning a possible defence of duress) which entitled the Respondent to any particular discount. 
         
        
        
         
         The fact that the prisoner had indicated his part in the bringing of the heroin into Australia through questioning was similarly not a matter which attracted any special element of leniency. 
         
        
        
         
         The objective circumstances would conceivably have justified a conclusion that the Respondent had carried the heroin from Bangkok and that he had removed the body packs after disembarking from the plane. He presumably had then hidden the heroin within the toilet cubicle in the terminal building. The fact that the Respondent gave an account, which was accepted by the Crown, to the effect that he had removed the heroin whilst still on the plane and given it to a third party, was not a factor which removed the case out of the ‘ordinary’. 
         
        
        
         
         There was no element of ‘double jeopardy’ either in the circumstance of the altered Indictment, or in the circumstances of the Respondent’s disclosures. 
         
        
        
         
         The Respondent had admitted his guilt and had adhered to a plea of guilty from the earliest opportunity. He was entitled for that to be appropriately taken into account. 
         
        
        
         
         However it is noted that the table of sentences handed up by the Crown in  
         Wong & Leung 
          and indeed the comparables to which Judge Kinchington was taken in the present case, were matters in which couriers and others lower in the hierarchy (where one could be ascertained) had in fact pleaded guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         The learned sentencing judge in the present matter placed undue reliance upon the admissions and the plea of guilty because of his conclusion that the Crown had no case without the admissions. 
         
        
        
         
         Whilst the Respondent pleaded guilty at an early point in time, it is to be observed that his confession was made only after the authorities had discovered his carry bag and arose in the circumstances where the Respondent must have presumed at that time that the authorities would have been able to discover his fingerprints on either the bag or the body packs which contained the heroin. The fact that subsequent fingerprint analysis failed to yield identifiable fingerprints did not alter the perception which must have been in the Respondent’s mind on the day of his arrest that such evidence was likely to be able to be ascertained and thereby able to link him, together with the other surrounding circumstances, with the carry bag and the heroin. 
         
        
        
         
         In the course of the sentencing proceedings the case officer from the Australian Federal Police was cross-examined by counsel for the Respondent about the importance of the admissions which had been made:  
         
        
        
         
         ‘Q. The fact was that without those admissions you wouldn’t have much of a case against him, would you agree with that? 
         
        
        
         
         A.  
         At that stage, yes 
         ’ (AB 8). 
         
        
        
         
         The significance of the officer’s response: ‘ 
         At this stage, yes’ 
         , is an important one. 
         
        
        
         
         The Respondent had made full admissions regarding his activities and his knowledge of the importation being in relation to heroin, both to the customs officers at the airport and to the police in a formal interview. He had pleaded guilty and proceeded to the District Court by way of a paper committal and had reaffirmed that all of the heroin in the carry bag had been transported by him in the course of a second interview at the jail referred to during cross-examination by Ms Flannery (AB 8). 
         
        
        
         
         The fact was that the admissions made at the stage of arrest were such that without them there was ‘not much of a case’  
         at that stage 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         However the circumstances in which the location of sticking plaster by which means the body packs had been adhered to the skin of the Respondent, combined with the finding of the body packs still bearing tape in a bag containing an item of clothing belonging to the Respondent, was such that in the event of a plea of Not Guilty, further investigations were clearly available to be undertaken by the Crown. 
         
        
        
         
         In the light of the early and continuing plea of guilty, there was no focus on questions such as the size and number and spacing of the markings on the torso and legs of the Respondent which might have been able to be aligned with the body packages of heroin and the tape adhering thereto in the event of a forensic contest. Similarly, consideration was not needed to be given to the question of DNA testing which would presumably have been well able to establish the fact that the sticking plaster attached to the body packs had been taped to the body of the Respondent. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown acknowledges the significance and importance to be attached to admissions of guilt and to pleas of guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         However, in the circumstances of the present case the learned sentencing judge placed too much emphasis on the admissions and understated the position of the Crown case in reaching a conclusion that there would have been ‘no material which would have established his connection with the heroin’, if he had exercised his right to silence. 
         
        
        
         
         The case was not one in which a significant added element of leniency arose because of ‘ 
         the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence’ 
         , nor was it one ‘ 
         where it was unlikely that the guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence 
         ’: see  
         R v Ellis 
          (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604. 
         
        
        
         
         Whilst appropriate acknowledgment and encouragement needs to be given in respect of confessions and pleas of guilty, this ought not to result in the imposition of a sentence which might be perceived as manifestly inadequate by reference to other factors such as the quantity of narcotic involved. 
         
        
        
         
         Comparative sentences specifically brought to the attention of the sentencing judge, in addition to the guideline judgment and cases referred to therein, were contained in a document handed to the sentencing judge. They each involved confessions at the earliest opportunity and subsequent pleas of guilty. Degrees of assistance to the authorities were also involved as indicated in the individual cases.” 
         
        
       
     10    The first significant criticism which the Crown made was that the “importation charge could not be proved”. The second, and related, significant criticism is that the respondent’s admissions were not vital in establishing the case against him.  
      
       
     11    First, the citation of White v Ridley is not material: the person to whom the respondent delivered the heroin was not an “innocent agent” but a guilty principal offender. 
      
       
     12    Secondly, although the Crown now evidently submits that the respondent was guilty of importation, before the sentencing judge it apparently thought otherwise, because it acquiesced in the sentencing judge’s suggestion that the respondent was not guilty of importation and sought an adjournment, and amended the charge (AB 9 line 31-10 line 36).  
      
       
     13    Thirdly, the sentencing judge’s view that if the respondent had remained silent the Crown would have had no material linking him with the heroin is, on the evidence before him, correct. However, the Crown argument appears to be that if the respondent had made no admissions, even though there were no identifiable fingerprints on the blue carry bag or on the packets containing the heroin (AB 8 lines 25-30), it would have been possible to link the accused with those items because of the finding in the bag of “an item of clothing belonging to the” respondent, the possibility of aligning the markings on the respondent’s body with the packages, and the possibility of conducting DNA testing. There was no evidence that the clothing belonged to the respondent beyond his admission (AB 44.2): hence ex hypothesi if he made no admissions that would not have linked him to the bag. It must be questionable whether the alignment procedure would have proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Even if one assumes that DNA testing could have proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt - there is no evidence that it would have and the Crown fairly conceded that there was a degree of speculation in thinking that it would have - the Crown’s reasoning does have the by-product of highlighting the immense extent to which the respondent, by making admissions, saved the prosecution and the court time and trouble. The reasoning also has an unpalatable aspect: it suggests that if no admissions had been made, the prosecution would have tried to prove the accused guilty of a particular line of conduct which at trial it in fact accepted the respondent did not carry out. Of course that endeavour by the prosecution would have been an entirely innocent one, but that does not alter the fact that the argument under consideration is making appeal to the circumstance that the prosecution would have been seeking to prove a case which one now knows is wrong and which is contrary to that which it accepted as being correct at the sentencing hearing.  
      
       
     14    Fourthly, on the assumption that the sentencing judge’s opinion about the lack of evidence in the absence of the respondent’s admissions was founded on a submission put by the respondent to the sentencing judge, which seems likely, it is significant that on 13 September 2000 the counsel then appearing for the Crown said of the events of 11 September 2000 (AB 11 lines 45-52): 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown relies on the evidence submitted on Monday. I indicated to your Honour that I agreed with the submissions made on behalf of the offender in relation to the significance of his admissions in relation to the strength of the Crown case, and I don’t resile from that position, your Honour.” 
         
        
        
       Counsel did go on, reasonably enough, to draw attention to the objective seriousness of the offence. But she also appeared to accept and adopt the force of the point made by the sentencing judge which is now under attack by the Crown in the following passage (AB 12 lines 8-32): 
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: But the thing that concerns me more than any of all that matter, if the accused had said nothing, I mean said nothing pleaded not guilty, the Crown’s case would have failed, wouldn’t it. 
         
        
        
         
         MUIRHEAD: Your Honour, I don’t want to make that concession. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: You can’t. It’s not a question of you making that concession at all. He was charged with supply. If he would have said nothing, pleaded [scil. not] guilty, the Crown would have entered all this evidence; at the end of the Crown case, you would have been faced with the situation that you hadn’t proved importation. 
         
        
        
         
         MUIRHEAD: Yes, your Honour. I agree with that. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: All I am saying is, it seemed to me that the accused has co-operated at all times. He hasn’t sought to hide behind technicalities of the law, which he is entitled to do, and it makes it into a more unusual case than a normal one. 
         
        
        
         
         MUIRHEAD: Well, I agree with that, your Honour. It is an unusual case.” 
         
        
        
       In those circumstances there is a degree of inconsistency between the Crown posture below and the Crown posture here.  
        
       
     15    One point made by the Crown was that it was wrong to say there was no evidence of guilt apart from admissions. It may be that the sentencing judge exaggerated in that respect. But it was not a material error.  
      
       
     16    Another of the Crown’s points is that there was little if any difference between the objective criminality of importation and the objective criminality of being knowingly involved in importation. This is a valid point. But the respondent’s frankness about the precise factual position did save the authorities much trouble and offered solid support for the sentencing judge’s opinions about the respondent’s “remorse and contrition”. The assessment of remorse and contrition is a process in relation to which a sentencing judge enjoys a peculiar advantage over an appellate court, and cannot lightly be disturbed or discounted on appeal if, as here, there is a rational basis for it.  
      
       
     17    The sentencing judge’s opinions on the extent of the respondent’s co-operation, and of his remorse and contrition, are supported not only by a reading of his record of interview but also by what Federal Agent Evans said in evidence at the sentencing hearing. In the record of interview, the early questions were of a formal character. One of them was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q60. You said to me earlier during this interview that you travelled on a flight from Bangkok to Sydney. Can you tell me what your travel arrangements were from the time that you left Bangkok? 
         
        
        
       That innocuous question was answered: “To carry heroin” (AB 33.6). This admission, contrary to a suggestion at page 3 of the Crown’s written submissions, was not made after the respondent “was confronted with the fact that a search had located the bag in which the heroin was contained.” That happened in Q198; the respondent made many detailed admissions between Q60 and Q198. The Crown did point out that on the evidence the respondent did not make any admissions in an initial period of questioning by customs officers before the bag was located. The evidence is unclear how long that questioning lasted and what questions were asked. Even if the respondent remained silent or made false denials in the initial questioning, the fact is that he began to confess the details of his conduct at a very early stage thereafter.  
        
       
     18    Federal Agent Evans correctly said that the respondent made “full admissions”; he was “completely co-operative … most certainly”; he assisted “as much as he was able”; and at a second interview on 16 August 2000 at gaol, he identified all the drugs shown in a photograph as drugs he recognised as having placed into the bag, even though he could have said some were not his and thereby reduced the quantity and the maximum penalty to which he was subject (AB pages 8-9).  
      
       
     19    The sentencing guidelines set out in R v Wong (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 are only guidelines. They are not rules of law; they are not binding; their role is indicative (see at 349). The particular circumstances of a particular case can justify departures from them (at 365). The circumstances of each particular case are very various, and in their nature guidelines cannot take account of many of them: R v Ngui (2000) 111 A Crim R 593 at [13]; R v Karacic [2001] NSWCCA 12 at [48].  
      
       
     20    Further, though the guidelines take account of sentences in cases where there was a plea of guilty, they make “no assumption one way or the other about such matters as whether there was a plea of guilty”: R v Karacic [2001] NSWCCA 12 at [50]; R v Ngui (2000) 111 A Crim R 593 at [17]. And they explicitly recognise that there “may also be circumstances in which a plea of guilty is entitled to such significant weight as to justify a sentence below the range” (at [141]). In the circumstances it was open to the sentencing judge to treat the co-operation of the respondent at all stages and his pleas of guilty as being of such significant weight as to justify a sentence below the range set out in the guidelines and below those in the other cases to which the sentencing judge was referred. 
      
       
     21    This Court ought not to interfere with discretionary decisions on sentences unless error in principle, significant error in fact, failure to take into account a relevant matter or the taking into account of an irrelevant matter is established, or unless the result of the decision is such as to suggest that some error of one of those kinds has occurred. At least in the last-mentioned respect, the willingness of the court to interfere must in practice be reduced where a sentence imposed by a judge of the experience of the sentencing judge in this case is in issue. In all the circumstances the sentence itself does not suggest error, and no explicit error appears on the face of the sentencing judge’s reasons.  
      
       
     22    At AB 22.5, the sentencing judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “To some extent, it could be said that [the respondent] has been subject to a double jeopardy, not in the true sense of that word, but in the broader sense of that word.” 
         
        
        
       The Crown suggested that by the expression “double jeopardy” the trial judge was referring to the fact that the respondent had to plead to two different charges on different occasions. To my mind those events count a little, but not much, in the respondent’s favour. There is little to suggest that the sentencing judge thought otherwise.  
        
       
     23    Turning to the Crown’s complaint about the ratio which the non-parole period bore to the total sentence, in R v Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44 at 49 this Court said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The norm for non-parole periods is in the range of about 60 percent to 66 and two-thirds per cent. One factor which may be material is the length of the head sentence and its position in the permissible range. Circumstances may exist which make it appropriate to move outside the usual range for non-parole periods. The process is not mathematical or rigid, and often requires a finely tuned assessment.” 
         
        
        
       In its written submissions which were used at the sentencing hearing, the Crown submitted that the appropriate ratio was “approximately 60 percent of the head sentence”: AB 60.2. The difference between 60 percent and 54 percent in the circumstances of this case does not suggest error, and even if it did, intervention by this Court would resemble impermissible tinkering.  
        
       
     24    The respondent advanced various discretionary reasons why this Court would not increase the sentence even if the Crown’s arguments were otherwise sound. In the circumstances it is not necessary to deal with those discretionary reasons. 
      
       
     25    I would propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     26    BELL J: I agree. 
      
       
     27    SMART AJ: I agree

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONMcCLELLAN JFRIDAY, 2 MARCH 200170046/00 - REGINA v Anh Tuan LEJUDGMENT1    HIS HONOUR: Yesterday, during the course of the evidence of Mr Trieu, it was, for the first time in this trial, suggested that he rather than the accused stabbed the deceased. Mr Trieu denied this assertion. It was further suggested to him that before the stabbing he had secreted a knife on a ledge in a nearby laneway, which he retrieved and was then carrying during the scuffle in which the deceased died. Mr Trieu denied all of these assertions. 
     
      
    2    The Crown then called Mr Carzo who gave evidence that he saw a person secrete a knife on a ledge in an alleyway and later saw the same person at the scene of the alleged crime. He was cross-examined by counsel for the accused and Mr Trieu, having been brought into court for this purpose, Mr Carzo identified Mr Trieu, as the person he had seen. 
     
      
    3    The transcript reveals that the Crown sought leave to ask further questions pursuant to s38 of the Evidence Act. That application was opposed. 
     
      
    4    The transcript also reveals the discussion which occurred between the Court and counsel, where the Court identified the legitimate role of re-examination in clarifying any matter which it was appropriate for the Crown to clarify. However, the Court did not express any ruling in relation to s38. 
     
      
    5    Thereafter the Crown proceeded to further question Mr Carzo and, in the course of that questioning, asked questions in the form of cross-examination. Those questions were not objected to by counsel for the accused and I have no doubt that this was because he, having regard to the earlier exchange, believed that the Court had made a ruling pursuant to s38. 
     
      
    6    The Crown has now indicated that it proposes to call Mr Lombardie and, as I understand the position, he will give evidence of a conversation which he overheard on the day of the events, the subject of this trial. The substance of that conversation could be understood as indicating that the speaker was responsible for the stabbing which killed the deceased. 
     
      
    7    I understand the Crown anticipates that Mr Lombardie will be cross-examined by counsel for the accused and may identify Mr Trieu as the speaker who was overheard. This application has, of course, been dealt with upon the assumption that this is the evidence which will emerge and, of course, the ultimate position may be otherwise. However, the Crown has sought a ruling from the Court before Mr Lombardie is called. In these circumstances the Court is required to consider the proper application of s38. 
     
      
    8    I had the benefit today of addresses from counsel which have explored the relevant authorities in relation to that section. The authorities were not explored yesterday. There is an important discussion of the history of the section and an explanation of its purpose in the judgment of Hunt J in R v Milat, unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 23 April 1996, where his Honour was dealing with preliminary matters, which included an application by the Crown for the exercise of the Court's discretion pursuant to s38. The issue appears to have been one of identity and the Crown, accepting an obligation to do so, proposed to call a witness at the request of the accused, although it anticipated that the evidence would be unfavourable to its case. His Honour said at p 5 of the judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In my opinion, the situation where the Crown is obliged to call a witness at the request of the accused, notwithstanding that the evidence of that witness is unfavourable to its case, falls directly within the contemplation of s 38. In the present case, the Crown prosecutor proposed simply to call the witnesses, to obtain their name and address and to leave them for cross-examination by the accused. Then, after the unfavourable evidence had been given in the course of that cross-examination, it proposed that leave should be granted to it (pursuant to subs(1)) to question the witness about that evidence as though cross-examining that witness. (for ease of reference, I have referred to this rather awkwardly described procedure (as did the Commission itself) as cross-examining the witness). The Crown intended by such cross-examination to demonstrate that the identifications made by these witnesses were unreliable, and thus (because of the extraordinary width of the definition of 'credibility' in the Dictionary to the Act) such evidence would be relevant to the credibility of those witnesses. Such evidence would nevertheless go also to a fact in issue (whether the 'signature' pattern upon which the Crown relies existed) or to a fact relevant to that fact (whether there is a reasonable possibility that some of the victims were not picked up as hitchhikers on the Hume Highway near Liverpool). Accordingly, further leave to cross-examine upon credit was not required pursuant to subs(3), as the Crown was not concerned with the truthfulness of these witnesses. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view, as the reliability of the evidence of such witnesses would certainly not be tested by the accused, and as the Crown was obliged to call the witnesses only out of fairness to the accused, it would be unjust to the Crown (which prosecutes on behalf of the community) to refuse leave to cross-examine in relation to the unfavourable evidence given. It was very fairly - and correctly - accepted by the accused that no argument could be mounted to the contrary. 
        
       
       
        
        As the unfavourable evidence was not to be given until the witnesses were cross-examined by the accused, the Crown could not cross-examine them about the unfavourable evidence until that cross-examination by the accused had taken place. In those circumstances, the situation was to be very different to that where the Crown has led evidence from the witness which is favourable to its case but has then also obtained evidence upon some other issue which was unfavourable. The Law Reform Commission expressed different views at different times concerning the stage at which the party calling such a witness should be entitled to cross-examine upon the unfavourable evidence in that different situation. Originally, it proposed that it should be after the other party or parties had had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness. 26 ALRC Vol 1, par 625. In its Final Report, the Commission said that this should not be an inflexible requirement, and that provision should be made to enable the other party or parties to question the witness further after the cross-examination by the party who called the witness. 38 ALRC par 114. Although perhaps not readily apparent from their terms, this appears to have been the intention behind subsections (4) and (5) of s 38. 
        
       
       
        
        In order to reflect the intention (or to comply with the spirit) of the section, therefore, I held that, in the event that these witnesses called at the request of the accused gave the unfavourable evidence as expected, it would be appropriate to grant leave to the Crown pursuant to subs(1) to cross-examine them in relation to that evidence, and to do so after they had been cross-examined by the accused. I also said that the accused would then be permitted to cross-examine the witness further after the Crown had conducted its cross-examination, such cross-examination to be unlimited in nature and not restricted as if it were a re-examination with the Crown having the right finally to re-examine the witnesses. 
        
       
      
    9    In the present matter the application made by the Crown today appears to me to fall relevantly within the principles set forth by Hunt CJ at CL in those passages. However, it has been submitted by counsel for the accused that a more narrow view of the word ""unfavourable"" should be accepted by this Court and that that word could never extend to encompass evidence coming from a witness which may be contrary to the Crown theory as to how a crime may have been committed. In any case it is submitted that the word ""unfavourable"" must mean more than evidence which is inconsistent with the Crown's theory. 
     
      
    10    Justice Smart commented on the meaning of the word ""unfavourable"" in R v Souleyman (1996) 40 NSWLR 712. Having reviewed the history of s38 in Australia and its equivalent in the United Kingdom, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""When the word ""unfavourable"" was used in s38 the draftsman probably had as a background the history of the English legislation and selected the alternate word ""unfavourable"" used by Williams J in  
        Greenough v Eccles 
        ."" 
        
       
      
    11    His Honour had already referred to other words than ""unfavourable"" which were available to the draftsperson being adverse or hostile which he, in my opinion, appropriately identified as having been consciously rejected by the adoption of the word ""unfavourable."" He went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The word ""unfavourable"" in section 38(1)(a) does not mean adverse. It means ""not favourable"". That construction could have wide ranging ramifications but the Court is given a discretion and will carefully examine the circumstances to see how the discretion should be exercised."" 
        
       
      
    12    Justice Greg James referred to this issue in R v Kneebone (1999) 47 NSWLR 450 where, at page 461, he collected the decisions which had by then, considered the meaning of unfavourable in s38 of the Evidence Act. He draws attention to the necessity to exercise care in the application of the section, indicating that at that point there was much about the section which was still to be resolved. 
     
      
    13    The issue was also addressed by Adams J in R v Pantoja, unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 5 November 1998, where his Honour raised the question of whether truthful evidence could ever be unfavourable from the Crown's point of view. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It seems to me that some attention will need to be given in due course to the meaning of 'unfavourable' so far as the Crown case is concerned. The Crown case is, in essence, the truth, wherever that might lead and even if it leads to reasonable doubt about guilt, I am far from persuaded that merely because a witness declines to give evidence supporting the theory of the facts for which the prosecution contends or, indeed, gives evidence that contradicts that theory or contention, his or her evidence may thereby be regarded as' unfavourable'."" 
        
       
      
    14    It must be accepted, as Adams J identified that the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act should be construed to ensure that the ultimate purpose of the trial is facilitated. With respect to s 38 that purpose, as identified in the earlier authorities, is to ensure that the Court is not denied evidence which might be relevant to enable the truth to be ascertained. As Hunt CJ at CL pointed out, one of the concerns which, no doubt, led to s38 being enacted, was that because the Crown may be unable to contradict evidence which it is required to call, in some cases the Court may be denied evidence which could be relevant to ascertain the truth. 
     
      
    15    Adopting this approach to the section, in my opinion, the word ""unfavourable"" should be given a broad meaning thereby ensuring that in the course of any criminal trial the Court would not be denied evidence as to any relevant issue and would not be denied the opportunity for that evidence to be appropriately tested. Only this approach will allow the jury to have the opportunity of coming to an informed view about whether or not the evidence called by the Crown should be accepted. 
     
      
    16    The judgment of James J in Pantoja addresses the further issue advanced by counsel for the accused in this case. In Pantoja it would appear that the difficulties which gave rise to the application by the Crown under s38 arose, at least in part, during cross-examination of a witness by counsel for the accused. James J makes plain that whether the difficulty arises in evidence-in-chief or cross-examination is not relevant to the potential exercise of the discretion under s38.  
     
      
    17    In my opinion, it would be inappropriate to confine the discretion to the circumstance where the Crown has merely called a witness at the request of the accused. Accordingly, I reject the submission that the section should be confined to the circumstances considered by Hunt J in Milat. 
     
      
    18    As I have indicated, in the present matter the allegation that Mr Trieu was responsible for inflicting the fatal wound upon the deceased has been raised during the course of the trial. It has been sought by the accused's counsel, and I make no criticism of him in so doing, to support that assertion by obtaining evidence in cross-examination from Mr Carzo and, it is apprehended, by the prospective cross-examination of Mr Lombardie. In this way counsel for the accused seeks to construct an alternate theory of the killing to that which is fundamental to the Crown's case against the accused. 
     
      
    19    In these circumstances it seems to me that the evidence which was adduced in cross-examination from Mr Carzo, and which is proposed to be adduced in cross-examination of Mr Lombardie, is evidence which is unfavourable in the relevant sense to the Crown. Furthermore, in my opinion, if that evidence was allowed to be adduced without an opportunity to test its reliability, it is possible that the outcome would be unjust to the Crown in the sense that expression was used by Hunt J in Milat. 
     
      
    20    Accordingly, I am of the view that in relation to the evidence of Mr Carzo and that proposed from Mr Lombardie, the Court should conclude that the evidence already given by Mr Carzo, and which may come from Mr Lombardie, is evidence which is relevantly unfavourable. 
     
      
    21    Before granting leave under s38, the Court is required to have regard to the provisions of s192 of the Evidence Act. Section 192, without limiting the matters which the Court is required to consider, requires the Court to take into account, in particular, in deciding whether to give leave, the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness (s 192(2)(b)) and, furthermore, the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought. (s 192(2)(c)). 
     
      
    22    The evidence which the accused counsel seeks to adduce from the two witnesses is evidence of great significance to the case which he has now advanced through his cross-examination of Mr Trieu. Accordingly, the evidence in respect of which leave is sought under s38 by the Crown is of great importance in this matter. 
     
      
    23    I am also satisfied that by granting leave there would be no unfairness to the accused, but that if leave was denied this could be unfair to the Crown. 
     
      
    24    When taking the evidence of Mr Carzo yesterday, I invited counsel for the accused to make an application to further cross-examine Mr Carzo after the Crown had concluded questioning.. Counsel indicated that he did not wish to ask any further questions. This course was the course taken by Hunt J in Milat and, in my opinion, it is an appropriate course to take in the circumstance where leave has been granted to the Crown under s38. Any possible unfairness or other difficulty which may have arisen from the Crown exercising its right pursuant to that leave may be dealt with and effectively removed. 
     
      
    25    Accordingly, in relation to the application made in anticipation of the evidence to be given by Mr Lombardie, I hold that in the event that Mr Lombardie gives the unfavourable evidence as expected, it would be appropriate to grant leave to the Crown, pursuant to s 38, to cross-examine in relation to that evidence and to do so after Mr Lombardie has been cross-examined by counsel for the accused. I also indicate that in my opinion, if a request is made and leave is granted, I would only grant it on condition that counsel for the accused was entitled to further cross-examine if he wished.

      WOODLEY v BOYD 
     Tort - Whether Unlawful arrest - Whether Assault - Damages sought - Whether collateral purpose of arrest - Police conduct - Use of force by police during arrest - Whether excessive force used - Resistance of arrestee - Effect of trial judge’s rejection of plaintiff as witness of truth on claim for unlawful arrest and assault.The appellant had an encounter with two policemen (the first and second respondents) on the night of 18 December 1991. The appellant was driving his car and was stopped by the policemen. An altercation ensued resulting in the breaking of the appellant’s arm. The appellant alleged that the policemen assaulted and unlawfully arrested him, and he sued them (and the third respondent, the State of New South Wales) in the District Court for unlawful arrest, assault and malicious prosecution. The claim of malicious prosecution related to charges brought against the appellant in relation to his behaviour on the night in question. At trial, the plaintiff and the respondents proffered different versions of the events that occurred on 18 December 1991, but the trial judge accepted the respondents’ version. The appellant’s claims failed at trial and the judge entered verdicts for the defendants. This is an appeal from those orders on the grounds that even if the trial judge was correct in accepting the respondents’ version of events, the appellant should nonetheless have succeeded at trial.Held by Heydon JA (Davies and Foster AJJA concurring), dismissing the appeal:1. The trial judge did not err in concluding that the arrest was lawful and fully justified and no undue force was used. Nor did the trial judge err in failing to consider a submission to the contrary, which was put to the trial judge. The Court of Appeal is at liberty to reverse the trial judge’s conclusion since it was a conclusion of mixed fact and law. Abalos v Australian Postal Commission  (1990) 171 CLR 167, referred to. However, the Court of Appeal will not do so because the trial judge did not err in this regard for the following reasons:(a) The trial judge had made findings unfavourable to the appellant in relation to the question of whether the arrest was lawful and for a bona fide purpose. (b) Evidence existed that was unfavourable to the appellant in this regard. (c) There were no admissions by the police that favoured the appellant’s claim of collateral purpose, and this claim was not put directly to the policemen by counsel for the appellant at trial. (d) The action of the police in applying restraint and pain to the appellant was not excessive in the circumstances and therefore the appellant was not entitled to use reasonable force to resist. Any evaluation of police conduct must be made with “the pressure of the events and the agony of the moment” in mind and not by the application of hindsight. McIntosh v Webster (1980) 43 FLR 112 and R v Turner [1962] VR 30, referred to.2. The trial judge did not err in finding that the injuries suffered by the appellant were the result of his own “violent and irrational” response to being placed under handcuffed arrest. This is because the evidence strongly supports a finding that the appellant had made a “sudden and violent” move, which was sufficient to fracture his own arm. 3. The trial judge did not take into account irrelevant considerations or conclusions of fact unsupported by evidence, and hence did not err in this regard. The trial judge may have made errors in relation to the diagnoses of Drs Lee and Knox and the applicability of those diagnoses to the plaintiff at the time of the police encounter. However, such errors were immaterial and did not alter the trial judge’s findings on the appellant’s credibility or the evidence that pointed to the appellant’s violent tendencies. ORDERS:1. Appeal dismissed.2. Appellant to pay respondent’s costs of the appeal.

        WOODLEY v BOYD 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
        
       
     1    HEYDON JA:  
      
       
       Background 
        
        
       This is an appeal from orders made by Dent DCJ, QC, made on 25 August 1999 after a long trial. The primary orders complained of are the verdicts which he found for the defendants.  
        
       
     2    On 18 December 1991 the plaintiff was driving north near Cundletown, a small village about 7 kilometres north of Taree. He was stopped by two police officers (the first two defendants). The plaintiff alleged that he was physically assaulted by the police officers after they had arrested him unlawfully, and was also the victim of malicious prosecution. The last-mentioned complaint arose in part out of the acquittal of the plaintiff by a magistrate on 28 August 1992 on four charges brought arising out of the events of 18 December 1991. No case based on malicious prosecution was pressed on the appeal.  
      
       
     3    The proceedings have had an unfortunate history. A Statement of Claim was filed on 7 June 1993. Particulars were requested by, and the form of the Statement of Claim was criticised in, a letter of 7 September 1993 from the defendant’s solicitors to the plaintiff’s solicitors. That was not replied to until 14 September 1994, when a draft Amended Statement of Claim was sent. An Amended Statement of Claim was filed on 22 September 1994. On 9 February 1998 a trial commenced before Vincent ADCJ and a jury. On the twelfth day of the trial, 24 February 1998, Vincent ADCJ acceded to an application that the jury be dispensed with and that he proceed to determine the case alone. Written submissions were filed thereafter. Vincent ADCJ died on 5 June 1998 without delivering a judgment.  
      
       
     4    On 9 November 1998 the trial resumed before Dent DCJ. He read the transcript, and the trial then resumed again on 29 April 1999. The evidence continued until 14 May 1999. Addresses, which included reliance on detailed written submissions, were fixed for 17 May 1999. The trials were bitterly fought, the parties did not exhibit much testimonial self-denial, and the materials to be considered by the trial judge were very substantial. The trial judge delivered judgment on 25 August 1999.  
      
       
        
       The Reasons for Judgment of the Trial Judge 
       
     5    After setting out the issues as they appeared from the pleadings (Red 15-17), the trial judge set out the plaintiff’s evidence in summary (Red 18-25). So far as Grounds 1 and 3 in the Notice of Appeal are concerned, it is not necessary to examine this evidence in detail in view of the following paragraph in the appellant’s Written Submissions, which is a realistic statement of one aspect of the difficulties facing the plaintiff’s case, and which corresponds with the structure of the Notice of Appeal (para 2.1): 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour was faced with two versions of what happened in the space of about two minutes on a night nearly eight years in the past. Clearly, his Honour had to decide whether either version was completely true, or whether the truth was somewhere between the two versions, and in the face of past authority the Appellant does not seek to re-agitate in this Court his Honour’s finding that the account given by the Respondents was true, even though it was heavily contested.” 
          
         
        
       In a nutshell, the plaintiff’s case (on Grounds 1 and 3, but not 2 and 4-5) now is that even if the version of events contended for by the first and second defendant is correct, the plaintiff’s case must still succeed.  
        
       
     6    The balance of what the trial judge said after dealing with the plaintiff’s evidence is as follows (Red 25.8-39.1): 
      
       
        
         
         “Senior Constable Brian Frederick Boyd gave evidence in the proceedings before the late Acting Judge Vincent and before me. The substance of his evidence was that he had been a policeman since 1975, and at the time of giving evidence before me and before the late acting Judge, he was attached to the Kuring-Gai highway patrol at Hornsby. He had since December of 1991 been certified by the Commissioner of Police to operate a microwave speed detector in the State of New South Wales. Before going on shift on the day in question this equipment was checked. He went out on shift at about 5pm on the 18th December 1991 using police vehicle serial number 32450 which to his recollection was a straight coloured brown goldy bronze sort of colour. 
         
        
        
         
         He explained the testing procedures in respect of the microwave speed detector unit and swore that at about 10.45pm he was patrolling in the subject car in the company of Constable Caldwell in the Pacific Highway at Cundletown travelling in a southerly direction. He explained Cundletown was six to seven kilometres north of Taree. 
         
        
        
         
         He swore he observed another vehicle travelling towards the police vehicle in a northerly direction in front of the Cundletown Motor Lodge and explained the relative positions by exhibiting a diagram to the court. He says that the police vehicle was approximately 300 metres south of the commencement of the 60km/h zone when he saw an oncoming vehicle and estimated its speed as being well in excess of 60km/h. 
         
        
        
         
         He saw the numerals appear in the target display, window ‘96’ in the display window of the detector. After hearing a tone he checked the patrol speed against the speed indicated on the checked police speedometer and found that they were co-related. 
         
        
        
         
         He swears that the oncoming vehicle was checked for four seconds and a speed of 96 km/h was displayed on the target display while the tone emitted remained constant. He explained that the pitch of the tone emitted is directly proportionate to the speed of the vehicle coming towards the police vehicle. …  
         
        
        
         
         He observed that the detector fitted in the police vehicle was giving a positive signal indicating that the oncoming vehicle was fitted with a radar detection device which was on and that the signal continued getting stronger until what turned out to be Mr Woodley’s vehicle passed them in the opposite direction. He explained that the vehicle was in the vicinity of Dennison Street, Cundletown when first seen, which was approximately 300 metres from the police vehicle, and that just on the southern side of Dennison Street and its intersection with what is the highway, there is a crest in the road reducing visibility of oncoming vehicles. 
         
        
        
         
         He says that he made a U-turn and pursued the plaintiff’s vehicle. He says that both the vehicles entered into the 100km/h area north of Cundletown and he signalled to the plaintiff’s vehicle to stop which it did and he observed that while it was in the process of stopping the radar detector detection element in the police detector suddenly ceased to emit the audible and visual readings which would indicate to him that the plaintiff had turned his radar detector off at that point of time. 
         
        
        
         
         He says he made a U-turn in the highway to follow at Arcarma Avenue and thought that the distance from the point of that turn to the sign to the north of Cundletown changing the speed limit to 100km/h would be approximately 400 to 500 metres and that this was an estimate based upon recollection going back some years.  
         
        
        
         
         He says that the plaintiff’s vehicle came to a stop roughly 400 metres north of the 100km/h sign, and that after stopping the police vehicle he walked to the plaintiff’s vehicle with Senior Constable Caldwell. The plaintiff was still seated in the driver’s seat. 
         
        
        
         
         He says that he said ‘Good evening sir. Your speed has just been checked on radar at 96 km/h in the 60 km/h area, and the instruments in the police vehicle indicate that your vehicle is fitted with a radar detector. Would you please produce your licence and the radar detector’. The plaintiff got out of his vehicle and said ‘I don’t have a radar detector’. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff produced his licence. Boyd observed that he was holding in his hands a set of keys with a pocket knife attached to it and he said to the plaintiff ‘Put them on the floor’. He felt that the plaintiff was in some way threatening him with that knife and he then saw Senior Constable Caldwell reach into the plaintiff’s vehicle and remove nunchakus. Caldwell said to the plaintiff ‘Did you know that these were illegal, a prohibited weapon in this State’. The plaintiff replied ‘Well [they’re] not in the ACT’ [(Black 7/1153 line 4)]. 
         
        
        
         
         Boyd noticed that Woodley was agitated and on edge and obviously not pleased to be in the position he found himself in, and he thought he appeared to be very nervous. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff was asked to produce the radar detector in his vehicle. The plaintiff replied ‘I don’t have a radar detector’. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff was asked to open the bonnet of his vehicle. This was done. At this point of time Senior Constable Boyd was of the opinion that he could ask the plaintiff to surrender the radar detector device. The engine compartment of the plaintiff’s vehicle was searched. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff said ‘Do you have a warrant to search my vehicle’ and Boyd said ‘No I don’t need one. I have already found a prohibited weapon in your car, this gives me the power to search your vehicle’. 
         
        
        
         
         Boyd believed that he had the power to search the vehicle both under the Firearms and Dangerous Weapons Act and the Motor Traffic Act, having detected the radar detector. The plaintiff then slammed shut the bonnet of his vehicle and hurried around to the driver’s side and reached in and grabbed the keys from the floor, closed and locked the driver’s side door and placed the keys of the vehicle in his right rear trouser pocket, and in performing these actions he appeared to be agitated and becoming aggressive towards the Police. At this point the plaintiff said ‘You show me my speed on the radar’ and the trio walked back to the police vehicle. 
         
        
        
         
         Boyd said to Woodley ‘That’s your speed there. The 95 flashing on the left hand side. The other speed is on the right hand side and that is the speed of the police vehicle’ and then said to the plaintiff ‘I am now going to search your vehicle for any other prohibited weapons’. The plaintiff then reached into his rear trouser pocket and turned and threw his keys into the paddock on the western side of the Pacific Highway. The plaintiff then turned back to Boyd and yelled ‘You cannot search my car’ in a very much raised tone of voice. 
         
        
        
         
         Boyd said ‘You are now under arrest for a prohibited weapon’ and took hold of the plaintiff’s right arm around the wrist area to control the situation which was the plaintiff’s agitated state. He did not wish to give the plaintiff any chance of assaulting Senior Constable Caldwell or himself and he did not wish Mr Woodley to walk away from the situation. The plaintiff tried to pull his arm away from something between a tug of war and an arm wrestle. 
         
        
        
         
         Shortly after this struggle commenced Boyd placed a wrist lock on Woodley as taught to members of the Police Service by Police Survivor Trainers at the Police Academy. He explained that this is still a current technique which is taught to trainees now. The hold was demonstrated. Boyd explains that when applied it causes acute pain in the area which is usually enough to control a person and if the person continues to struggle more pressure could be applied. 
         
        
        
         
         Boyd explained that the plaintiff continued to struggle after the application of the wrist lock either because he had not applied it correctly or had not got the pressure to actuate the nerve pain. The plaintiff continued to struggle and pull away. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff said ‘What am I being arrested for?’ Boyd said “I have already told you for possession of the nunchakus’. A short time after that Boyd decided to swap from a wrist lock to a full arm lock to control the plaintiff who was still trying to pull away. 
         
        
        
         
         Caldwell at that time was on the opposite side of Woodley and had taken hold of his left arm. Boyd successfully applied a wrist lock which was demonstrated. The plaintiff continued to struggle and tried to shift his weight around to try and straighten his arm out and release himself from the hold and he was applying a great deal of force. He described the plaintiff as a strong man. 
         
        
        
         
         Boyd then said to Caldwell ‘I am going to handcuff him’. He took his handcuffs out and started to put them on and the plaintiff shouted ‘You are not putting them on me’ and then made a sudden move of his body both forwards and down and a snapping sound was heard by Boyd. Boyd described this as a move with as much force as the plaintiff could muster, a sudden and violent move. He did not move forward that much bearing in mind that Boyd had a firm grip and that Caldwell had a grip on the other side. 
         
        
        
         
         The parties were at the passenger side of the police vehicle when the incident occurred. Immediately after the snapping sound Woodley said ‘You have broken my arm and I hope you are pleased with yourself’. He says that the torch that he carried in the police vehicle and used to search the engine compartment of the plaintiff’s vehicle was on its ring on the appointments belt while he was applying the arm lock to the plaintiff. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff said ‘Get an ambulance right away’. Boyd said ‘We can take you to hospital it will be quicker’. The plaintiff attempted to get into the rear of the police vehicle and said ‘I can’t get in it hurts too much’. 
         
        
        
         
         The Taree Police Station was radioed for an ambulance to attend at the location and for the shift supervisor to attend the location as the patrol commander’s representative. Their call was recorded in the police radio log at Taree Police Station at the hour of 22.50. 
         
        
        
         
         Whilst the parties were waiting for the ambulance Caldwell searched the paddock and found the keys. 
         
        
        
         
         Boyd said to the plaintiff ‘What’s in the car you are trying to hide. Don’t tell me it is just the radar detector’. The plaintiff said ‘I have $11,000 in cash in the boot’. 
         
        
        
         
         Boyd said to the plaintiff ‘Don’t tell me you thought we were going to rip you off’ and the plaintiff looked at Boyd and made no reply. 
         
        
        
         
         Boyd said to the plaintiff ‘What are you carrying that amount of cash with you’. The plaintiff said ‘I am on my way to Grafton to pick up a mate and we are going to Brisbane to go to an auction’. 
         
        
        
         
         Boyd said ‘What type of auction’. The plaintiff said ‘A general auction’. Boyd said ‘What are you going to buy’. The plaintiff said ‘Anything that takes my fancy’. 
         
        
        
         
         Boyd said ‘Well you get the money out of the boot and take it with you to hospital because I don’t want the responsibility of having it left here’. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff was handed his keys and he opened the boot of his vehicle and removed a yellow envelope from between a stack of clothes in the boot. 
         
        
        
         
         Boyd said ‘Give me a look’. The plaintiff showed him an unsealed yellow envelope containing a large amount of 100 dollar notes. The plaintiff placed the envelope in his rear left hand trouser pocket. Shortly thereafter an ambulance arrived and the plaintiff was treated at the scene. 
         
        
        
         
         A Sergeant Scotcha of Taree police had come to the scene, the plaintiff was conveyed by ambulance to Manning Base hospital and the plaintiff’s vehicle was searched in the presence of Sergeant Scotcha and the offending radar detector which the plaintiff denied having was found concealed in the dash board of the subject vehicle. It was operated by a toggle switch on the right hand side of the steering wheel under the dash.  
         
        
        
         
         The vehicle was taken to Taree Police Station to a secure yard and further searched. Constable Boyd made his entries in his notebook and other departmental documents and associated paper work and at five in the morning of the day following the arrest he again checked the radar equipment in the police vehicle as that was the end of his shift. 
         
        
        
         
         He had sought advice from the most senior detective at Taree Police Station relating to the charges that ought to be laid on the recorded facts and he acted in accordance with that advice. 
         
        
        
         
         In March 1992 he was required to make a statement in relation to the matter as was Constable Caldwell. They nominated the vehicle they used by its police serial number at that time. It was an unmarked vehicle but the radar speed detecting device was one which was removed at the end of every shift. In due course as was police practice he consulted with a Police Prosecutor about the charges that should go forward, and abided by the prosecutor’s decision. 
         
        
        
         
         He was cross-examined at length in the hearing before Judge Vincent and in the hearing before me and the plaintiff’s version of events was put to him strongly and firmly and where that version was inconsistent with his version he denied it.  
         
        
        
         
         The defendant Senior Constable Christopher David Caldwell gave evidence before Judge Vincent and before me and his account corroborated the account of his fellow officer. He was closely cross-examined and the defendants case put forcefully to him and he [rejected] that case in his testimony. 
         
        
        
         
         Sergeant Graeme Robert Scotcha was called and gave evidence before me. He was the officer who was called from Taree Police station to go to the scene of the incidents out of which this litigation arise. His only ultimate relevance from the plaintiff’s and the defendants’ point of view was that in Sutherland Local Court when giving evidence in August 1992 he had expressed the view that the car in which the defendant was patrolling was a marked police car although he did not know the make or model. This view was based upon his recollection that at that time there were only marked Highway Patrol cars at Taree. That recollection I am satisfied was incorrect and Sergeant Scotcha recanted it before me and when challenged as a person who was giving answers so as not to be in conflict with his fellow officers he replied in a fashion which confirmed my overall impression of him that he is an honest witness who was honestly mistaken when he gave the particular answers in Sutherland Court in August 1992. 
         
        
        
         
         Between the plaintiff’s and 1st and 2nd defendants’ accounts of the occurrences on the relevant night there is no grey area. The plaintiff’s attack on the 1st and 2nd defendants’ credibility is centred around the postulation that he was not stopped for speeding in a built up area but stopped because of his having a radar detector and that the scene which unfolded after he was stopped was as he described it and that even if his arrest was justified in the circumstances, which he disputes, that arrest was performed with unnecessary and in effect brutal force causing the fracture of his arm without advising him of the reasons at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         He asserts that in furtherance of the malice displayed towards him the 1st and 2nd defendants and others have conspired since shortly after his arrest to nominate an unmarked police vehicle as the one in which they were patrolling and to destroy or asport vehicle use diaries that would have proved that the vehicle in which they were patrolling was in fact marked and by implication to suborning Sergeant Scotcha to change his recollection given in Sutherland Court during the hearing before the magistrate. I have considered all this at great length and I firmly reject this account as untrue. 
         
        
        
         
         I am of the view that where the evidence of the plaintiff conflicts with the evidence of the defendants as to events on the evening in question the evidence of the plaintiff is false and the evidence of the police is true. This impression is overwhelming. Counsel for the defence in a spirited defence declared his purpose as to unmask the plaintiff as a person in whom the court could place no credence whatsoever. Counsel has achieved that effect. 
         
        
        
         
         The psychiatric evidence that I have heard from Doctor Lee who was the plaintiff’s treating psychiatrist in Canberra prior to the events in question convinces me that at the relevant time the plaintiff was a diagnosed psychopath with paranoid features focused towards Police in general. At the very time that the events occurred he was fighting for a disability pension based upon his assertion that he suffers uncontrollable rages that would preclude his employment because a direction to that which he did not want to do would pitch him into such a state. 
         
        
        
         
         He was supported by social security prior to, at the time of and subsequent to the events which give rise to this cause of action. He was nonetheless able to maintain a very heavy addiction to cannabis which he admits to being twenty cigarettes per day. His explanation to Doctor Lee was that he supported the habit by growing his own. 
         
        
        
         
         On the evening of his arrest he lied to the police about his radar detector, he lied to the court when he asserted that at the time he was uncertain that they were illegal in New South Wales. He was on the clearest notice of that illegality from a pending prosecution for the offence at the time. His insistence on seeing the recorded speed on the Police detector is entirely inconsistent with his own version of events because it would have been irrelevant as on his version it was recorded outside of the 60 kph area. 
         
        
        
         
         His presentation to the court as to his level of claimed back disability I am convinced is a gross exaggeration to seek to mulct the defendants in damages. 
         
        
        
         
         In the course of the evidence in this court he twice referred to the incident of his arm fracture as an accident. A Freudian slip to say the least. 
         
        
        
         
         Other lay witnesses were called to support the plaintiff’s claim as to damages and his credibility. Having seen and heard those witnesses I am firmly of the mind that their calling failed to achieve that object. His common law spouse was one such witness. She was happily there to support his claim in the most obviously biased fashion despite the fact that she more than anyone is aware of the plaintiff’s violent and irrational nature. Her motive revealed in cross-examination is of course founded in the hope of monetary gain. 
         
        
        
         
         I do not intend to pass judgment in what I regard as red herring issues in the trial, such as the source of the cash carried by the plaintiff and the purposes of his carrying it on the evening in question other than to say my disbelief of the plaintiff and his lay witnesses is so profound that I am not persuaded by the explanations offered.  
         
        
        
         
         The above findings have clear consequences. I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s arrest was lawfully executed and fully justified in the circumstances using no more force than was necessary given the aggressive and agitated state that the plaintiff was in as described by the first and second defendants. The cause of action based upon assault and battery accordingly fails. 
         
        
        
         
         The injuries sustained by the plaintiff in my judgment [were] caused by his violent and irrational reaction to the process of placing him under handcuffed arrest which in my view of the evidence was completely justified in the circumstances. I am quite satisfied that the actions of the plaintiff at the side of the police vehicle as described by the 1st and 2nd defendant was an intended course of conduct to resist an arrest which was perfectly justified in the circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
         Being of the above mind it follows that to the extent that the plaintiff asserts malice and absence of reasonable and probable cause in respect of the commencement and prosecution for charges of resist arrest of which he was acquitted. Those causes of action fail and I enter verdicts for the defendants. 
         
        
        
         
         I am completely satisfied that the Police radar speed calculation demonstrated to the Constables as the speed of the plaintiff’s vehicle in the limited area of Cundletown was in fact demonstrated and in fact remained to be inspected by the plaintiff after he had been brought to a halt. The plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that prosecution for that offence was commenced and or maintained maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause and the causes of action based upon that assertion accordingly fail. 
         
        
        
         
         I am quite satisfied on the evidence that the plaintiff in confronting the 1st and 2nd defendants holding the closed lock-blade knife in his hand so displayed it to them as to cause them to reasonably interpret that display as an offensive use of the implement. It accordingly follows that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that in prosecuting and maintaining the prosecution of the charge relating to the implement, the 1st and 2nd defendants acted maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause. I hardly need add that the 1st and 2nd defendant were dealing with this plaintiff for the first time and had no prior knowledge of his violent and irrational dispositions so clearly established in the evidence in this case.”  
         
        
        
       
     7    Of the pocket knife attached to the set of keys, the trial judge said earlier (Red 18.7): 
      
       
        
         
         “The knife is Exhibit A in the proceedings and I note that whilst it is a pocket knife it is of a lock-blade variety which gives it certain advantages if one uses it vigorously.” 
         
        
        
       It was described as an “eight centimetre silver noose lock blade knife” (Black 6/1178 line 55). The “nunchakus”, according to the plaintiff, had been made up by him for use in martial arts routines (Red 18.4). They are weapons which the plaintiff’s counsel described as Japanese fighting sticks, being two lengths of black wood joined by a piece of chain.  
        
        
       Grounds 1 and 3 
       
     8    These grounds are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. His Honour erred in finding that rejection of the Appellant as a witness of truth had the clear consequence that the arrest of the Appellant by the First and Second Respondents was lawfully executed and fully justified in the circumstances and used no more force than was necessary. 
         
        
        
         
         3. His Honour erred in failing to consider the submission put to him that rejection of the Appellant’s evidence and acceptance of the evidence of the First and Second Respondents would still result in a verdict for the Appellant on the causes of action in assault and wrongful arrest.” 
         
        
       
     9    These grounds are directed at the trial judge’s conclusion (Red 37.8-38.2): 
      
       
        
         
         “the plaintiff’s arrest was lawfully executed and fully justified in the circumstances using no more force than was necessary given the aggressive and agitated state that the plaintiff was in as described by the first and second defendants … 
         
        
        
         
         The injuries sustained by the plaintiff in my judgment [were] caused by his violent and irrational reaction to the process of placing him under handcuffed arrest which in my view of the evidence was completely justified in the circumstances. I am quite satisfied that the actions of the plaintiff at the side of the police vehicle as described by the 1st and 2nd defendant was an intended course of conduct to resist an arrest which was perfectly justified in the circumstances.” 
         
        
        
       The plaintiff submitted that the conclusion that no more force had been used than was necessary was an inference or a conclusion of mixed fact and law which an appellate court was completely at liberty to reverse. It is true that no restriction of the type discussed in  
       Abalos v Australian Postal Commission 
        (1990) 171 CLR 167 applies in relation to that conclusion.  
        
       
     10    The plaintiff’s submissions on these grounds commenced with the contention that the corresponding submissions had been made to the trial judge but had been ignored. They continued with a detailed examination of the police officers’ evidence. However, essentially two arguments were put. The first was that the initial arrest of the plaintiff was unlawful; hence the physical acts of the police officers in holding him were batteries. The second was that even if the arrest of the plaintiff could have been lawfully effected, the manner in which he was arrested and the manner in which he was treated while under arrest involved an excessive use of force entitling the plaintiff to use reasonable force to resist it, and the injury he suffered was caused by the unlawful conduct of the police officers.  
      
       
     11    The arrest was effected just after the plaintiff threw his keys into an adjoining paddock and yelled “You cannot search my car”. After analysing the evidence up to that point, the plaintiff’s Written Submissions proceed as follows (paragraphs 2.11-2.14 and 2.16): 
      
       
        
         
         “2.11 There was no further discussion between the Police and the Appellant about retrieving keys, or unlocking the vehicle, and Boyd said to the Appellant ‘you are now under arrest for possessing a prohibited weapon’: Black AB 459.16-22. No other offence (such as failure to surrender a radar detector, possession of an offensive implement or hindering the police in their duty) was mentioned at that time: Black AB 458.54-459.14. There was also no discussion about whether the Appellant would come quietly, even though up to this point the Appellant had given no indication, verbally or otherwise, that he would not be prepared to accompany the Police back to the station to deal with the matters of concern: Black AB 1274.16-25. The demeanour of the Appellant at that time was nervous and agitated, and a little bit shaky, but he was not shouting, swearing, or making any kind of threatening motion towards the Police: Black AB 457.30-43. The nunchakus were in the possession of the Police, and the knife was somewhere in the paddock with the keys. However, the Police gained the impression that there was something in the car that the Appellant did not want them to see (which was true - the Appellant had $11,000 in cash that he had won on the Melbourne Cup in the boot of his car, and was concerned about its safety): Black AB 457.45. 
         
        
        
         
         2.12 Having told the Appellant that he was under arrest, Boyd took hold of the Appellant’s right arm just above the wrist with his right hand: Black AB 459.35-46. The only response of the Appellant was to pull his arm back: Black AB 460.112-28. When the Appellant pushed his arm back, Boyd immediately set about putting a wristlock on him without further word to the Appellant. This involved putting the left hand on the Appellant’s elbow, then putting his right hand on the Appellant’s wrist and pushing it downwards: Black AB 460.34-40. The object of this hold is to apply pain: Black AB 463.45-38. The Appellant tried for a few seconds to ‘shake off’ the wristlock: Black AB 460.53-54. Around the same time, Caldwell took hold of the Appellant’s left wrist and possibly elbow: Black AB 414.10-18. While this was happening, the Appellant asked ‘what am I being arrested for?’, and Boyd said ‘I have already told you, for possessing the nunchakus’: Black AB 1161.16-20. Boyd then decided to put an arm lock on the Appellant in order to ‘control’ him: Black AB 460.56, 1161.23. There was considerable evidence about the nature of the arm lock and whether differing demonstrations of it were done at different times in an effort to mislead the Court as to its nature, but the final and most precise description is that set out at Black AB 461. It resulted in the Appellant’s arm being behind his back and ‘past the horizontal going towards 45 degrees’: Black AB 462.13-18. Once again, the object of this procedure is to apply pain. Caldwell was at the same time attempting to get the Appellant’s left arm up behind his back as well: Black AB 414.21-25. 
         
        
        
         
         2.13 While the Police were attempting these manoeuvres, the Appellant was attempting to straighten his arm: Black AB 460.58-461.1. Boyd clearly understood this was to reduce the pain: Black AB 1240.39-50. There was no suggestion that the Appellant was shouting or swearing while this was happening. Neither was he attempting to kick or make any other violent action. In fact, although the Police evidence was that the Appellant was ""struggling violently’, when questioned in detail this amounted only to the Appellant moving his upper body and not his feet, except ‘shuffling’ possibly: Black AB 414.41-53. During the ‘struggle’, the distance between the Appellant and the Police vehicle did not vary at all, although the officers disagreed on how far that was: Black AB 415.28-39, 470.45-53. Boyd thought that the distance was a metre, even though the Appellant had been examining the radar display immediately before the interaction began: Black AB 487.56-59. In any event, if the evidence is true that the Appellant hardly moved his feet, and the distance between him and the Police vehicle (whatever it was) did not vary, it is completely inconsistent with a ‘violent struggle’. Note that it was put to the Police officers that they had in fact pushed the Appellant up against the car, this being the obvious way to apply leverage to the arm lock, but this was denied: Black AB 469.43-470.10.  
         
        
        
         
         2.14 After some short period, Boyd had the hold applied so the Appellant could not go forward, backwards or sideways and he was ‘pretty well contained’: Black AB 463.10-19. Boyd then told Caldwell that he intended to handcuff the Appellant, and reached around behind his back and removed the handcuffs from the pouch with his right hand: Black AB 462.35-39. The Appellant then said ‘you are not putting them on me’, and then ‘dropped his weight’ and lurched ‘forward and down’: Black AB 416.38, 462.42-43. Even though he fell ‘forward and down’, there was no contact between the Appellant and the Police vehicle when this happened: Black AB 496.3-6. It was this self-inflicted action that the Police said led to the Appellant’s arm being broken, not any application of excessive force by them. Following the injury, no first aid was rendered by the Police: Black AB 1262.14-26. 
         
        
        
         
         2.16 On that evidence, it was submitted to his Honour in summary that: 
         
        
        
         
          (a) the central intention of the Respondents was to locate the radar detector and take possession of it, and the possession of the knife and the nunchakus was of no real consequence in determining the sequence of events; 
         
        
        
         
          (b) the Respondents had no clear idea about the extent or source of their power to search the vehicle for a radar detector, and Caldwell may even have believed at the time of the incident that he did not have the power; 
         
        
        
         
          (c) in fact the Respondents did not have the power to search the vehicle for a radar detector, or for prohibited weapons, in the circumstances then prevailing; 
         
        
        
         
          (d) the Appellant was entitled to refuse permission for the Police to search his car, and in that context, throwing the keys into the paddock, even though it may have been an objectively silly action, and irritating to the Police, was not conduct of any criminality justifying arrest; 
         
        
        
         
          (e) the power to arrest came, if at all, from s.352 of the Crimes Act and from the common law. An arrest will be wrongful if not authorised by law. Section 352(2) of the Crimes Act does not authorise arrests if they are not made in good faith for the purposes contemplated by the relevant enactment relied upon. A Police officer does not act in pursuance of a statute or carry a statute into effect if there is an absence of a bona fide intention of discharging his duty under the statute or if his acts are done only in pretended execution of the statute:  
         Drymalik v Feldman 
          (1966) SASR 227 at 231;  
         Pirani & Diggins v Hardy 
         , SCNSW, 9.9.94, unreported, per Smart J. The arrest immediately after the Appellant threw his keys in the paddock, allegedly for possession of nunchakus, was not effected for that reason, but for an unauthorised collateral purpose, namely to detain the Appellant so that a search of his car for the radar detector (and anything else of interest that might turn up) could be carried out, and was unlawful; 
         
        
        
         
          (f) the restraint then applied to the Appellant was therefore itself not authorised, and amounted to assault and battery, and the Appellant was entitled to use reasonable force to resist it, especially as the Police were deliberately attempting to inflict pain on him when the occasion for so doing had not arisen: see also  
         McLiney v Minster 
          [1911] VLR 347 (FC); 
         
        
        
         
          (g) furthermore, not every resistance of a lawful arrest will necessarily be unlawful. The circumstance of an arrest made lawfully may be such that the person being arrested genuinely and reasonably believes in the need for forcible resistance, such as where the Police use excessive force. In such a case the forcible resistance (if not excessive) is not unlawful:  
         R v Thomas 
          (1993) 65 A Crim R 269 (CCA NSW). In this case, it is clear that the question of whether any force at all was required to get the Plaintiff to accompany the Police to the station was never explored, even on the Police version. If the fact was that he was prepared to accompany the Police, then the process of putting him [in] an arm lock was totally unnecessary. It is absurd to suggest that any person conveyed to the Police Station in a Police vehicle has to [be] handcuffed for safety reasons. Even if the arrest had been otherwise valid, the immediate action of the Police to apply restraint and pain to the Appellant was excessive in the circumstances and the Appellant was entitled to use reasonable force to resist it; 
         
        
        
         
          (h) the subsequently dismissed charges of hindering Police officers in their duty, and possession of an offensive implement (the knife attached to the key ring), were unsubstantiated and evidence of malice in an attempt to lend authority to their dealings with the Appellant.” 
         
        
        
        
       Was There a Power to Arrest? 
       
     12    The heart of the plaintiff’s submission is paragraph 2.16(e). It states the effect of the authorities correctly. 
      
       
     13    Section 352 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Any constable or other person may without warrant apprehend, 
         
        
        
         
         (a) any person in the act of committing, or immediately after having committed, an offence punishable, whether by indictment, or on summary conviction, under any Act, 
         
        
        
         
         (b) any person who has committed a serious indictable offence for which the person has not been tried, 
         
        
        
         
         and take the person, and any property found upon the person, before an authorised Justice to be dealt with according to law. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Any constable may without warrant apprehend, 
         
        
        
         
         (a) any person whom the constable, with reasonable cause, suspects of having committed any such offence, 
         
        
        
         
         (b) any person lying, or loitering, in any highway, yard, or other place during the night, whom the constable, with reasonable cause, suspects of being about to commit any serious indictable offence, 
         
        
        
         
         and take the person, and any property found upon the person, before an authorised Justice to be dealt with according to law.” 
         
        
        
       The possession of nunchakus was an offence punishable after trial on indictment or on summary conviction under the  
       Prohibited Weapons Act 
        1989 s 5. The plaintiff was later charged with that offence and pleaded guilty to it. 
        
       
     14    Did the police officers lack any bona fide intention of discharging their duty under s 352(2)? Were their acts done only in pretended execution of it? Did they effect the arrest for the purpose only of searching for the radar detector? The plaintiff submitted that these questions should be answered affirmatively. The trial judge made no positive finding favourable to the plaintiff on these questions. In particular, he made no finding that the police officers’ purpose was to detain the plaintiff so that the car could be searched. Nor did he make any finding to the contrary, and the plaintiff argued that this revealed a failure to grapple with the essential issue.  
      
       
     15    However that may be, the plaintiff’s submission is rejected for six reasons. 
      
       
     16    First, the trial judge did make findings, which, indirectly, are unfavourable to the plaintiff on these questions. 
      
       
       (a) He found that Constable Boyd told the plaintiff: “You are now under arrest for a prohibited weapon”. That suggests that the state of mind accompanying that statement was an intention to arrest on the stated ground (Red 29.9). The trial judge’s finding that “the evidence of the police is true” (Red 35.9) entails an acceptance of the sincerity of that statement. 
        
        
       (b) A little later the plaintiff said: “What am I being arrested for?” and Constable Boyd said: “I have already told you, for possession of the nunchakus” (Red 30.8). That too suggests that Constable Boyd’s intention was to arrest for possession of the nunchakus. Again, the finding that “the evidence of the police is true” entails an acceptance of the sincerity of what Constable Boyd said.  
        
       
     17    Secondly, the plaintiff’s submission pointed to the evidence of police interest in the radar detector, and they unquestionably were looking for it. But Constable Boyd believed he had power to search the vehicle for the radar detector because a prohibited weapon (the nunchakus) had already been found in it, and he told the plaintiff that (Red 29.2.4; Blue 1/16.4.9; 2/8, 13 and 20; Black 6/1156 lines 25-45, 1211 lines 11-14, 25-28 and 39-59, 1214 lines 14-21, 1220 lines 13-19, 1221 lines 21-52; Black 2/451 line 41-452 line 21; cf 1220 line 43-1221 line 1). If he had that belief, which he must be taken to have had in view of the trial judge’s acceptance of his evidence, there would have been no point in his effecting an arrest in order to give him a power which he already believed he had. (Whether, as the plaintiff submitted, that belief was wrong, is immaterial.) 
      
       
     18    Thirdly, just before informing the plaintiff that he was under arrest, Constable Boyd said to the plaintiff: “I am now going to search your vehicle for any other prohibited weapons” (Red 29.8; Blue 2/8, 13, 16 and 21). There is no reason to doubt that that was a sincere expression both of his intentions and of his belief that he had a right to carry out the search. If that was his mental state, there was no room for the collateral purpose, in effecting the arrest, of giving himself a power to search which he did not otherwise believe he had. 
      
       
     19    Fourthly, the endeavour of the cross-examiner appeared to be directed not towards establishing a desire to search the car as a purpose of the arrest, but more towards establishing that the arrest was unnecessary because the plaintiff was not out of control or unduly threatening and because some means of calming him down by persuasion should have been tried (Black 6/1223 line 41-1226 line 20). Even if the propositions advanced to Constable Boyd were sound, they would not have made the arrest unlawful if it were otherwise lawful (as counsel for the plaintiff conceded before this Court: transcript page 13 lines 1-6).  
      
       
     20    Fifthly, the plaintiff pointed to no evidence of any admission by the police officers favourable to his argument. Were there any such admissions, the trial judge’s acceptance of the police evidence as true would be powerful support for the plaintiff’s argument. The absence of any admissions of a collateral purpose creates a major obstacle to the success of the plaintiff’s argument that the making of the arrest was unlawful. 
      
       
     21    Sixthly, one reason why there were no admissions was that counsel for the plaintiff, though he approached the question of the alleged collateral purpose of the police officers, did not directly put it. As he frankly conceded, he did not put the collateral purpose alleged “as clearly as I might” (transcript page 55 line 7). Members of the court asked to be referred to any passages where this had been done. In Constable Boyd’s evidence, the following was referred to (Black 7/1275 line 35-1277 line 45): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. … until you placed your hand on his arm there was no reason for you to think, I suggest, that he would not comply with … a direction to get in the police vehicle and accompany you back to the station? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see, what I suggest to you, Constable, is what Mr Woodley resisted was the fact that you were applying force to him, that’s what he resisted, isn’t that the case? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that you had no reason until you applied force to him to believe that he would not, if told he was under arrest, accept that and go with you to the station? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I don’t agree with that statement. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But it’s the case, isn’t it, that neither you or Constable Caldwell asked him - I withdraw that. After you said you were under arrest, and I appreciate you say you also indicated a charge at that point, after that point neither you nor Constable Caldwell asked the plaintiff to get into the police vehicle for the purposes of accompany[ing] you to the station before you took hold of him, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And at no point up until the time you indicated that he was under arrest or, sorry, up until the time you took hold of him did he attempt to flee from the scene? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Indeed, at the point when you took hold of him his keys were, of course, in the paddock, that’s correct, isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So that if he had attempted to flee from the scene it would have been on foot? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You saw nothing, did you, that indicated to you that he might be about to do that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I disagree with that statement. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, you’ve told us what you saw, I’ll leave it at that. See, I’m suggesting to you that you’ve told us a number of times now that you were concerned about losing control, you agree with that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         SAIDI: I don’t think so, your Honour, I think his concern was about the situation getting out of control. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I think that’s how it was expressed, Mr Grey. [He] was concerned the matter was getting out of control. 
         
        
        
         
         SAIDI: The situation getting out of control. 
         
        
        
         
         WITNESS: That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         GREY: Q. See you’ve questioned many motorists over years, haven’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And I take it on a number of occasions you’ve asked them to allow you to search their motor vehicle, have you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You’re used to citizens simply complying with requests that you make of them, aren’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. The reactions vary. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But you see, 99 people out of 100 faced with a man in blue like yourself asserting a power to do something will not argue, do you agree with that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I’d agree with that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Indeed, your confidence in that in your dealings with the public is such that you have some difficulty attributing your powers to any particular legislation, don’t you, because you’ve never been put in the position where you have to justify yourself? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I’d like to hear the question again. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What I’m saying is, if it were common that members of the public questioned your power to search a vehicle then over a period of service in the Police Force as long as yours, Constable, you would have been very clear, you would have made yourself very clear in your own mind about what specific powers you had and when they were properly exercisable, wouldn’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Most people enquire basically whether we have the power or not. I’ve had very, very few people ask me to quote the section in an act of any power that I say that I have. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And when people ask you, you assert that you have the power and as I say 99 people out of 100 will simply accept your statement won’t they? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And every so often somebody comes along who says, I’m not satisfied with your statement. I want you to show me or I want to get some advice. Every so often someone like that comes along, isn’t that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. As I’ve already stated very rarely yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. See the difficulty I suggest you had on this night was you were actually not sure about what your powers were? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No that’s incorrect. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that you find it very irritating when you knew that there was, in your own mind you knew there was a radar detector in this car that this man didn’t want you to search his car until he took some advice about whether you were entitled to? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No sir, that’s incorrect. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that it annoyed you a great deal that he was not accepting your authority? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No sir, that’s incorrect. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that when he locked the car up and threw the keys over the paddock you became quite angry indeed that your intention to search the car was being thwarted? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No sir. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I put to you that when you told him he was under arrest he actually went to get in the police car and go with you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No sir that did not happen. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you regarded his behaviour as you losing control of the situation and that really annoyed you didn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No sir. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And so you took it out on him I suggest? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s incorrect sir.” 
         
        
       
     22    In Constable Caldwell’s evidence the following was referred to (Black 7/1357 line 11-1358 line 37): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I appreciate you say he said also something else. But in terms of the first statement about being under arrest, it was made after the keys were thrown into the paddock? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what I suggest to you about what Constable Boyd said was at that time that there was no mention at that point of any charge that would justify the arrest? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes there was. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you say the charge was possession -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. – of prohibited weapon. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it then just coincidental that that statement was made at the moment that Mr Woodley - or immediately after Mr Woodley threw his keys into the paddock? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Could you just repeat that? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you agree with this proposition that the statement ‘You are under arrest’ together you say with words about possession of a prohibited weapon were made immediately after Mr Woodley threw his keys in the paddock? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Very soon after, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. There was no other discussion that took place -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. – between the throwing of the keys and the making of the statement that he was under arrest? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is it just coincidental that statement was made at that time and not earlier when the nunchakus were found? 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION. NOT EVIDENCE OF WITNESS. QUESTION REJECTED. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can I suggest to you that you and Constable Boyd were annoyed with the plaintiff at this point because he had prevented you from searching the car and that’s why you wanted to arrest him? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Not entirely, no.” 
         
        
       
     23    That last answer was not clarified, and the matter was not taken further.  
      
       
     24    In the absence of any direct evidence favourable to the plaintiff’s contention that the police officers had a collateral purpose, it must rest on inferences from circumstantial evidence. The circumstances, when taken with the findings and evidence referred to above, do not permit the necessary inferences to be drawn.  
      
       
     25    In my opinion the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the trial judge erred in not holding the original arrest to be unlawful. 
      
       
     26    There is one submission of the plaintiff which was directed both to the question just discussed and the question about to be discussed. It is convenient to indicate its irrelevance to both of them at this point. The plaintiff submitted that the issue of whether the police actually had power to search the car without effecting an arrest was relevant in two ways. First, if the police lacked power to search the car without effecting an arrest, it was submitted that that supported the plaintiff’s argument that the arrest was for the collateral purpose of giving them a power to search it. Secondly, if the police lacked a power of search, “then very little criticism can be directed at the appellant for the way he behaved” (transcript page 10 line 30-31). The first way of putting the matter is irrelevant, because the moving party in the decision to arrest was Constable Boyd, and while a belief that there was no power of search without arrest would assist the plaintiff, Constable Boyd repeatedly and consistently averred his belief that he did have a power of search without arrest. In either event the actual legal position does not matter. The second way of putting the matter is irrelevant, because what matters in judging how the plaintiff behaved at each particular stage is whether the police conduct in arresting him, and then in applying increasing amounts of force, was lawful. The legality of the use of force rests on criteria quite distinct from the legality of the search.  
      
       
        
       Excessive Force in the Course of the Arrest: General 
       
     27    The plaintiff’s argument had a second limb: 
      
       
        
         
         “Even if the arrest had been otherwise valid, the immediate action of the Police to apply restraint and pain to the Appellant was excessive in the circumstances and the Appellant was entitled to use reasonable force to resist it (paragraph 2.16(g)). 
         
        
        
       As the matter developed in oral argument, it became apparent that there were several stages at which the legitimacy of the police use of force would have to be evaluated.  
        
       
     28    The first stage was the moment when, as the trial judge found, Constable Boyd said: “You are now under arrest for a prohibited weapon” and “took hold of the plaintiff’s right arm around the wrist area to control the situation which was the plaintiff’s agitated state. He did not wish to give the plaintiff any chance of assaulting Senior Constable Caldwell or himself and he did not wish Mr Woodley to walk away from the situation” (Red 29.9-30.1). 
      
       
     29    The second stage was when, shortly after a struggle began in which the plaintiff began to pull his arm away from Constable Boyd’s and “a cross … between a tug of war and an arm wrestle” commenced (Black 6/1157 lines 48-58), Constable Boyd placed a wrist lock on the plaintiff. 
      
       
     30    The third stage was when, after the struggle continued, Constable Boyd applied the arm lock to the plaintiff.  
      
       
     31    The fourth stage arose when Constable Boyd said he was going to handcuff the plaintiff.  
      
       
     32    The firth stage concerns events from the time when the decision to handcuff the plaintiff was announced until the time when the plaintiff’s arm broke.  
      
       
     33    Before considering the law and the evidence that is relevant to each stage, some preliminary matters can be noted. 
      
       
     34    The first is that at the time of the events in issue, the plaintiff was aged 35 (Blue 1/82), he was “very well musculatured” (Blue 1/1), “very strongly built” (Blue 1/4), and “of average/tall height and of strong build” (Blue 1/5). Constable Boyd perceived him to be “a very strong man” (Blue 1/11) and said: “Mr Woodley was, on that particular evening, was a strong man” (Black 6/1162 lines 8-9). Constable Boyd was 6 feet 3 inches tall and in 1998 weighed over 100 kilos. There is no evidence of Constable Caldwell’s build.  
      
       
     35    The second matter relates to questions of time. The period which elapsed from when the cars stopped to the moment of arrest cannot have been long and appears to have been less than four minutes. At the hearing of the appeal counsel for the plaintiff estimated that the period that elapsed from the time when the cars stopped to the time when the plaintiff broke his arm was “five minutes, or possibly less” (transcript page 2 lines 21-22). There is evidence that the time which elapsed between the arrest and the breaking of the plaintiff’s arm did not exceed sixty seconds (Blue 1/11.5). The “events happened very quickly” (Black 2/387 line 25). Another estimate was that the time from the cars stopping to the arrest “may have been up to five minutes” (Black 2/458 lines 39-40). 
      
       
     36    Thirdly, though the trial judge’s findings on what happened are clear, it is convenient, as counsel did on appeal, to go to the detail of the evidence underlying them. It is convenient to analyse events in the first period of four minutes or so up to the arrest and the later one minute period by reference to the trial judge’s findings, and then the contemporary or near contemporary police records, the police evidence to the magistrate on 27-28 August 1992, the police evidence at the first trial and the police evidence at the second trial. In conducting that analysis, the plaintiff submitted that one ought to ignore generalised words of characterisation used by the police officers and picked up by the trial judge, and rather concentrate on the detailed primary facts the police officers described, so far as they did describe detailed primary facts. It was said that “it becomes important … to move from the terms which process the information - words like ‘violent’ and ‘irrational’ are processing words - to what the actual evidence was from the police about what the appellant did” (transcript page 10 lines 49-52). It was said that “it is important to get past the adjectival descriptions to exactly what happened” (transcript page 11 lines 37-39). While the plaintiff is certainly correct that attention must be paid to the specific detailed observations of the police officers, I do not think the generalised words they also used should be ignored. They record impressions which the plaintiff’s conduct caused to be imprinted on their minds. In assessing how a reasonable police officer would have behaved in the circumstances in which they found themselves, their characterisations of the plaintiff’s conduct have significance. Those parts of their evidence in which they used general words of characterisation were both admissible and weighty. The impressions recorded were based in some measure on facts which were likely to have been too evanescent and complicated in their nature to be noticed, recollected and separately and distinctly related to the court. In the words of the 17th Report of the English Law Reform Committee: 
      
       
        
         
         “Unless opinions, estimates and inferences which men in their daily lives reach without conscious ratiocination as a result of what they have perceived with their physical senses were treated in the law of evidence as if they were mere statements of fact, witnesses would find themselves unable to communicate to the judge an accurate impression of the events they were seeking to describe” (paragraph 3). 
         
        
        
       J H Wigmore,  
       A Treatise on the Anglo-American System of Evidence in Trials at Common Law 
        (Boston, Little Brown & Co, 3rd ed, 1940), volume 7, para 1918, p 12, quoted Gibson J in  
       Cornell v Green 
        10 S & R 16 (1823) to the following effect: 
        
         
         “… every man must judge of external objects according to the impressions they make on his senses; and after all, when we come to speak of the most simple fact which we have witnessed, we are necessarily guided by our impressions. There are cases where a single impression is made by induction from a number of others, as, where we judge whether a man is actuated by passion, we are determined by the expression of his countenance, the tone of his voice, his gestures, and a variety of other matters; yet a witness speaking of such a subject of inquiry would be permitted directly to say whether the man was angry or not …”. 
         
        
        
       At p 13 he quoted Foster CJ in  
       Hardy v Merrill 
        56 NH 241 (1875): 
        
         
         “… In the investigation of mental and psychological conditions, - because it is impossible to convey to the mind of another any adequate conception of the truth by a recital of visible and tangible appearances, - because you cannot, from the nature of the case, describe emotions, sentiments, and affections, which are really too plain to admit of concealment, but, at the same time, incapable of description, - the opinion of the observer is admissible from the necessity of the case; and witnesses are permitted to say of a person, ‘He seemed to be frightened’; ‘he was greatly excited’; ‘he was much confused’; ‘he was agitated’; ‘he was pleased’; ‘he was angry’.” 
         
        
        
       The opinions of Gibson J and Foster J, approved as they were by Wigmore, are directly relevant to the observations made by the police officers of the plaintiff’s mental state.  
        
       
     37    According to some writers, at common law, which applies in New South Wales, a person effecting an arrest may use whatever force is “reasonable” in the circumstances (Archbold: Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice 2000 para 19-39) or “reasonably necessary” (Wiltshire v Barrett [1966] 1 QB 312 at 326 and 331). “Thus if the arrestee offered resistance, the arrestor could increase his force in proportion to the force of that resistance”: R W Harding, The Law of Arrest in Australia (eds Duncan Chappell and Paul Wilson) The Australian Criminal Justice System (2nd ed, Butterworths, 1977) p 254. A more elaborate test has been propounded in the context of whether the killing of a felon in the course of committing a felony is a justifiable homicide, or manslaughter, or murder. It was put thus by the Full Court in R v Turner [1962] VR 30 at 36: 
      
       
        
         
         “When a felony is committed in the presence of a member of the public, he may use reasonable force to apprehend the offender or for the prevention of the felony. What is reasonable depends upon two factors. He is entitled to use such a degree of force as in the circumstances he reasonably believes to be necessary to effect his purpose, provided that the means adopted by him are such as a reasonable man placed as he was placed would not consider to be disproportionate to the evil to be prevented (i.e. the commission of a felony or the escape of the felon).” 
         
        
        
       It may perhaps be questioned whether the tests stated apply where the arresting party causes injury to the arrested party, as distinct from death. However, for present purposes it is convenient to assume, as counsel for both the plaintiff and the defendants did, that  
       R v Turner 
        states the law in that context as well. In evaluating what is reasonable, necessary or reasonably necessary the duties of police officers must be remembered. In  
       Lindley v Rutter 
        [1981] QB 128 at 134 Donaldson LJ said: 
        
         
         “It is the duty of any constable who lawfully has a prisoner in his charge to take all reasonable measures to ensure that the prisoner does not escape or assist others to do so, does not injure himself or others, does not destroy or dispose of evidence and does not commit further crime such as, for example, malicious damage to property. This list is not exhaustive, but it is sufficient for present purposes. What measures are reasonable in the discharge of this duty will depend upon the likelihood that the particular prisoner will do any of these things unless prevented. That in turn will involve the constable in considering the known or apparent disposition and sobriety of the prisoner. What can never be justified is the adoption of any particular measures without regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.” 
         
        
        
       The same duties and considerations apply where a police officer is deciding how to effect an arrest. And, in evaluating the police conduct, the matter must be judged by reference to the pressure of events and the agony of the moment, not by reference to hindsight. In  
       McIntosh v Webster 
        (1980) 43 FLR 112 at 123, Connor J said: 
        
         
         “[Arrests] are frequently made in circumstances of excitement, turmoil and panic [and it is] altogether unfair to the police force as a whole to sit back in the comparatively calm and leisurely atmosphere of the courtroom and there make minute retrospective criticisms of what an arresting constable might or might not have done or believed in the circumstances.” 
         
        
        
       
     38    Fifthly, the question of whether touching is necessary and lawful when effecting an arrest arose. If a police officer touches but does not arrest a suspect, the conduct will be unlawful if, for example, it was designed to effect a detention against the suspect’s will (Ludlow v Burgess (1971) 75 Cr App R 227). But it will not be unlawful if the goal was to attract the suspect’s attention: it may be an interference with the suspect’s liberty, but it is a trivial one which does not take the officer out of the course of his duty (Donnelly v Jackman (1970) 54 Cr App R 229). It is possible to effect a lawful arrest without touching the arrested person: Grainger v Hill (1838) 5 Scott 561 at 575; Greenwood v Ryan (1846) 1 Legge 275; Warner v Riddiford (1858) 4 CB (NS) 180; Alderson v Booth [1969] 2 QB 216; Dellit v Small, ex p Dellit [1987] Qd R 303. Glanville Williams, “Requirements of a Valid Arrest” [1954] Crim LR 6 at 11 summarised the law as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “An imprisonment, or deprivation of liberty, is a necessary element in an arrest; but this does not mean that there need be an actual confinement or physical force. If the officer indicates an intention to make an arrest, as, for example, by touching of the suspect on the shoulder, or by showing him a warrant of arrest, or in any other way by making him understand that an arrest is intended, and if the suspect then submits to the direction of the officer, there is an arrest. The consequence is that an arrest may be made by mere words, provided that the other submits.” 
         
        
        
       The difficulty of the field is illustrated by the fact that Glanville Williams’ example of “touching” is, while not “physical force”, nonetheless technically a battery unless it is otherwise justifiable. It is also possible to effect an arrest without using words of arrest, though it is desirable to use them if possible ( 
       R v Hoare 
        [1965] NSWR 1167).  
        
        
       The First Stage: Events Before the Arrest 
       
     39    The question is whether, when Constable Boyd took the plaintiff by the wrist, he committed the tort of battery rather than lawfully using force while effectuating an arrest he was entitled to make. In answering that question it is necessary to examine whether Constable Boyd’s and Constable Caldwell’s reactions were within the range of reactions of a reasonable police officer faced with the circumstances with which each of them was faced. Counsel for the plaintiff conceded that it was “undoubtedly open to conclude that [the plaintiff] became agitated and upset and possibly even in his manner appeared aggressive in the course of the interaction, that he was unwilling to agree to a search of his car and with the benefit of hindsight that he told at least one deliberate lie to the police, [but] at no time in the interaction preceding the injury did he attempt to strike the police, insult them, swear at them or decamp from the scene” (transcript page 2 lines 23-31). He submitted that all threats from either the knife or the nunchakus had ceased, and there was no reason to suppose that the plaintiff could not have been arrested by a simple polite command that he enter the police car and accompany the officers to the police station.  
      
       
     40    The events can be divided up as follows.  
      
       
     41    The first event was the formation by the police of the belief that the plaintiff had been driving at 96 kilometres per hour in a 60 kilometres per hour area, that belief being based on the microwave speed detector unit in his vehicle (Red 26.9-27.1; Blue 2/7, 13, 16, 19 and 26; Suppl Tab 31 para 4; Black 6/1149, 1206, 1211 lines 2-4; Black 7/1313 lines 36-56).  
      
       
     42    Secondly, that unit caused them to conclude that the plaintiff’s car had been fitted with a radar detector device which was on, but which was turned off at the moment when the plaintiff's vehicle stopped after the police signalled to the plaintiff that he should do so (Red 27.7; Blue 2/7, 13, 16, 19 and 26; Suppl Tab 31 para 5; Black 6/1150-1151 line 22; Black 7/1313 line 56-1314 line 9, 1336 lines 53-55).  
      
       
     43    Thirdly, when the plaintiff was asked to produce the radar detector, the plaintiff said he did not have one (Red 28.3; Blue 2/7, 13, 16 and 20; Suppl Tab 31 para 7; Black 6/1152 lines 30-44; Black 7/1314 lines 38-53). The making of this statement was in substance admitted by the plaintiff: see Red 20.1. That statement was a lie, on the plaintiff’s own later admission: he pleaded guilty to a charge that he did have a radar detector. A police search conducted later that evening located the radar detector (Black 6/1166 lines 54-1167 line 30; 1209 lines 55-57). 
      
       
     44    Fourthly, when the plaintiff produced his driving licence, which had expired, to the police officers, Constable Boyd observed that he was holding in his hands a set of keys with a pocket knife attached. He felt the plaintiff was threatening him with that knife, and he told the plaintiff to put it on the floor of the car (Red 28.5). It was an eight centimetre lock knife (Black 2/7, 13 and 16; see also 20 and 26; Suppl Tab 31 para 7; Black 6/1152 lines 44-55; 7/1265 line 55-1267 line 5). Constable Boyd said (Black 6/1173 lines 4-5): 
      
       
        
         
         “I believe that he had threatened me or held it in a threatening manner, the implement, that is the knife” 
         
        
        
       The following then appears (Black 6/1173 lines 6-18): 
        
         
         “Q. When you say you believe that he had threatened or held it in a threatening manner would you be kind enough to explain to the members of the jury what it was that led you to that belief? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It is the total the circumstances. The fact that Mr Woodley was agitated, that he was on edge, that he had, in my opinion, lied blatantly to police. He was holding the knife in such a position as to - in clear sort of view of me but at me and I was a very short distance from Mr Woodley at that time. I held the belief that he was in some way trying to intimidate me and that’s why I asked him to put the keys on the floor of the vehicle.” 
         
        
        
       In cross-examination Constable Boyd said (Black 6/1215 lines 42-44): 
        
         
         “A. Certainly. The keys he had in the palm of his hand with the knife coming through between the fingers and the thumb so as to project knife forward.” 
         
        
        
       Later he said (Black 6/1216 line 29-1217 line 26): 
        
         
         “Q. Well he didn’t ever make any move before you touched him, to strike you did he? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And he didn’t make any move to kick you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Or to hit you with any object? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And yet you tell us do you that you formed the view that he was for example in some way threatening to you in the way that he held the knife? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That’s absurd isn’t it constable? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No sir. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now just tell us how tall you are? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Six three. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what do you weigh? 
         
        
        
         
         A. In excess of 100 kilos. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you’re telling us you felt threatened by the way this man held the knife attached to his car keys? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It wasn’t the car keys I was concerned with sir, it was the knife, 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You could see from where you were that this was a folding pen knife? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It’s a large pocket knife sir. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It wasn’t a flick knife to your observation was it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No that’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It would have required another hand to move over and pull the blade out wouldn’t it. It was obvious to you at that time? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well I don’t know, I didn’t know at that stage whether the - you can modify knives sir in all sorts of circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well subsequently when you examined this knife it wasn’t modified was it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And right up until the time Mr Woodley was conveyed away in the ambulance he’d never tried to do anything threatening with it other than the thing that you’ve just described, the way he held the knife in his hand? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. And yet do you say that you had a belief in its offensive nature that justified in your view taking the matter to the stage of a charge being laid against him? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Correct.” 
         
        
       
     45    Constable Caldwell regarded the knife as “offensive”, and as held in a way which “posed a potential threat”; it appeared that it could have been the plaintiff’s intention to use it; he was “holding it in a threatening manner” (Black 7/1349 line 41-1350 line 26, 1351 lines 11-28). At the second trial Constable Boyd said (Black 2/446 lines 3-4): 
      
       
        
         
         “He was holding the keys basically in the palm of his hand with the knife protruding through the fingers.” 
         
        
        
       He said, after the keys had been placed on the car floor: 
        
         
         “what I perceived to be a threat or an intimidatory action by Mr Woodley had ceased” (Black 2/447 lines 56-57).  
         
        
        
       The evidence continued (Black 2/448 lines 1-30): 
        
         
         “Q. You say intimidatory action. He didn’t push the knife or the keys towards you in a way that suggested he wanted to strike you, did he? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Just had them in his hand? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What is intimidatory about that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It is the total circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, we haven’t got to the total circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
         SAIDI: Your Honour, I am not sure the witness completed his answer. 
         
        
        
         
         GREY: Q. Did you want to add something to the total circumstances? 
         
        
        
         
         A. The circumstances are the fact that Mr Woodley was - appeared to be very agitated, that he had just blatantly lied to what I perceived to be a complete lie to us, he seemed very displeased to be in the position that he found himself in and that he was holding, as I said, the knife was out in front, I found it to be intimidatory if you like. I wasn’t sure what - it’s not something that I had struck that much before if you like. You can only treat the circumstances how you find them. The alarm bells as far as I was concerned were starting to ring and that is why I asked him to separate himself from the keys which he did.” 
         
        
       
     46    Fifthly, Constable Caldwell then removed, and Constable Boyd saw him remove, the nunchakus from the car (Red 28.6; Blue 2/7, 13, 14, 20 and 26; Suppl Tab 31 para 7; Black 6/1152 line 56-1153 line 5 and 1155 lines 11-17; 7/1314 line 58-1315 line 3). 
      
       
     47    Sixthly, Constable Boyd perceived the plaintiff to be agitated and on edge, obviously not pleased to be in the position he found himself in. He thought he appeared to be very nervous (Red 28.8). Constable Boyd perceived the plaintiff to be “very agitated and on edge” according to his notebook (compiled at 5.15 am on 19 December 1991: Blue 2/7 and 13) and according to his statement of 21 March 1992 (Blue 2/220). So did Constable Caldwell (Suppl Tab 31 para 8). Constable Boyd perceived the plaintiff to be “very agitated” according to the report he made to his patrol commander on 19 December 1991 (Blue 2/16) and to the fact sheet he signed on 10 January 1992 (Blue 2/26). See also Black 6/1155 lines 19-31. Constable Caldwell “noticed that Mr Woodley was becoming agitated and on edge”. He was asked: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. What led you to form that belief? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Just by his manner. He was - appeared nervous” (Black 7/1315 lines 16-20). 
         
        
       
     48    Seventhly, the plaintiff was asked for a second time to produce the radar detector. For the second time, as the police officers would have perceived and as was the case, he lied in denying that he had one (Red 28.9; Blue 2/8, 13, 16 and 20; Suppl Tab 31 para 8; Black 6/1156 lines 1-5; 7/1315 lines 21-28). Constable Boyd “firmly believed that [the plaintiff] had a radar detector” (Black 6/1156 line 24).  
      
       
     49    Eighthly, the plaintiff asked whether the police had a warrant and Constable Boyd said: “No, I don’t need one. I have already found a prohibited weapon in your car, this gives me the power to search your vehicle” (Red 29.2; Black 7/1315 lines 35-39). In cross-examination Constable Boyd gave the following evidence (Black 6/1215 lines 21-30): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Now Mr Woodley you said seemed agitated and I think you said aggressive? Is that correct, about this point? 
         
        
        
         
         A. At which point? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The point at which there was a discussion about whether he needed - whether you needed a warrant and you telling him, I don’t need one? 
         
        
        
         
         A. After that point it appeared to me that he became more agitated and yes it is my opinion that he adopted an aggressive manner about him.” 
         
        
        
       The word “him” appears to be a transcription error for “then”.  
        
       
     50    Ninthly, after Constable Boyd had told the plaintiff that he had power to search the vehicle because he had found a prohibited weapon in it, the following events happened: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff then slammed shut the bonnet of his vehicle and hurried around to the driver’s side and reached in and grabbed the keys from the floor, closed and locked the driver’s side door and placed the keys of the vehicle in his right rear trouser pocket, and in performing these actions he appeared to be agitated and becoming aggressive towards the Police” (Red 29.4-.5; Black 6/1156 line 46-1157 line 6 and 1219 line 35-1220 line 11).  
         
        
        
       The police officers’ evidence was that the plaintiff: 
        
        
       (a) “slammed shut the bonnet” (Blue 2/20.9; Suppl Tab 31, para 8; Black 6/1156 line 48; 7/1315 lines 40-43; 2/452 line 57) in a “deliberate way” (Black 6/1157 line 3); 
        
        
       (b) “rushed” or “hurried” or “walked in a quick manner” from the bonnet to the driver’s door (Blue 2/8, 13, 20.9 and 26; Suppl Tab 31 para 8; Black 6/1156 line 49, 1157 line 4; 7/1315 line 44; 2/452 line 57-453 line 9); 
        
        
       (c) “grabbed” his keys from the floor (Black 6/1156 line 50); and 
        
        
       (d) “closed the door” in an aggressive way (Black 6/1157 lines 4-5). 
        
        
       In these actions the plaintiff “became aggressive”, “became more upset and aggressive”, “appeared to become even more upset and became aggressive in his manner” (Blue 2/8, 13, 16, 21.1 and 26; Suppl Tab 31 para 9), “appeared to get more aggressive in his manner” (Black 7/1315 line 49), “was becoming very aggressive” (Black 7/1339 line 9; 2/332 line 59); “getting agitated [and aggressive]” (Black 2/333.2), “raising his voice” (Black 2/333.2) or “appeared to be more - more agitated, and he appeared to become aggressive towards the police” (Black 6/1156 lines 54-58). He was aggressive in the “manner in which he looked at us” (Black 2/333.5). He did so in “a threatening manner” and was “becoming very agitated” (Black 2/334 lines 16-45). In cross-examination Constable Boyd was asked (Black 6/1216 lines 14-28): 
        
         
         “Q. Constable you must deal with many many people in your work as a highway patrolman where people feel they are being [un]justly accused of speeding or upset because they’re going to get fined or because they’re late for some appointment that they’re going to be [late] for, where they demonstrate behaviour like that. Isn’t that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Motorists demonstrate all sorts of behaviour.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. I mean there’s nothing out of the ordinary given what Mr Woodley was being asked to do, in slamming the bonnet or walking quickly or the manner in which he closed the door was there? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That doesn’t take away from my belief that he was agitated and had started to become aggressive.” 
         
        
       
     51    Tenthly, after Constable Boyd had complied with the plaintiff’s request to show him his speed on the radar equipment, and Constable Boyd had said he was now going to search the car for any other prohibited weapon, the following happened. 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff then reached into his rear trouser pocket and turned and threw his keys into the paddock on the western side of the Pacific Highway. The plaintiff then turned back to Boyd and yelled ‘You cannot search my car’ in a very much raised tone of voice” (Red 29.8-.9; Blue 2/9, 13, 21 and 26; Black 6/1157 lines 20-28; 7/1316 lines 5-6).  
         
        
        
       Constable Boyd said the plaintiff “yelled” that the police officers could not search his car (Blue 2/16; Black 6/1157 line 25; 2/443 line 25 and 455 line 7) in “a very much raised tone of voice” (Black 6/1157 line 27; “it probably wasn’t as loud as he could possibly yell, but it was certainly a raised voice” (Black 2/458 lines 23-24); it was “loud” (Black 2/438 lines 41-42). Constable Boyd gave the following evidence in relation to the point of time when he told the plaintiff he was going to search the car (Black 2/456 line 39-458 line 11): 
        
         
         “Q. … it is no surprise to you that people do not want you going through their vehicle if they don’t have to allow you to? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. No? 
         
        
        
         
         A. But to be upset, to seem to be so upset and so sort of agitated was unusual. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, you say he was so upset and so agitated. At this stage, that is before the moment when he threw his keys away, just describe what you mean by agitated? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, it’s very hard to put it into words. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Please try? 
         
        
        
         
         A. He was visibly upset in the fact that he was - he appeared to me to be that agitated that he was almost to the point of physically shaking. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So he wasn’t actually shaking? He was almost at the point of shaking, you say? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. He wasn’t uncontrollable - he wasn’t shaking uncontrollably if that is -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I gathered from what you were saying that in fact he wasn’t shaking at all; is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, no. I don’t think that is quite right either. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Shaking a little bit? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. Extremely nervous. It’s very hard to put into words what you observe and what your impressions are. Now, if I said to you that I saw a person that was upset or was sad or was happy you can tell certain things just by their body language, by their physical sort of expression. It’s very hard to relay that in just merely words, but it is an impression that you have at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. All right. So his body language and appearance conveyed to you that he was nervous? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He conveyed that he was agitated? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. To the stage where perhaps he was a little bit shaky? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But he wasn’t shouting at you at that stage, was he? 
         
        
        
         
         A. At which stage are we up to now? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. This is before he threw his keys in the paddock? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. He had raised his voice when he asked to see his speed on the radar detector, but he -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Wasn’t shouting? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And he wasn’t swearing at you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He wasn’t making any threatening kind of motion towards you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And to the extent that you gained this impression that there was something in the car he didn’t want you to see? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. As I put to you earlier, it is not at all unusual in your experience that people would be reluctant on many occasions to let you see things that they were entirely lawfully in possession of? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Could I have that question again? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, what I am suggesting to you is that insofar as he conveyed the impression to you that there may have been something in the car he didn’t want you to see, you would have been familiar with situations at that stage where people who had nothing in their possession that they were not lawfully entitled to have in their possession would also be nervous or reluctant about letting you look at things? 
         
        
        
         
         A. The only thing I can say in relation to that is that people when you stop motorists on the side of [the] road, they react in all different sorts of ways. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. So that this man reacted in a way that suggested he was nervous, agitated and didn’t want you to search his car? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
       
     52    Eleventhly, the arrest then took place. According to the trial judge (Red 29.9-30.1): 
      
       
        
         
         “Boyd said ‘You are now under arrest for a prohibited weapon’ and took hold of the plaintiff’s right arm around the wrist area to control the situation which was the plaintiff’s agitated state. He did not wish to give the plaintiff any chance of assaulting Senior Constable Caldwell or himself and he did not wish Mr Woodley to walk away from the situation” (Blue 2/9, 14; Black 7/1316 lines 9-10). 
         
        
        
       In his report to his patrol commander on 19 December 1991, Constable Boyd said that he took hold of the plaintiff’s right arm “because of his very aggitated [sic] and aggressive state” (Blue 2/16). The facts sheet which he signed on 10 January 1992 said the same (Blue 2/27). In his statement of 21 March 1992 Constable Boyd said he took hold of the plaintiff’s right arm near the wrist “due to his aggressive manner” (Blue 2/21). At the first trial he said (Black 6/1157 lines 31-46): 
        
         
         “Q. What happened then? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I said to Mr Woodley ‘You are now under arrest for possession of a prohibited weapon’ and I took hold of the - I took hold of Mr Woodley’s right arm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Around what area? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Around the wrist area. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And why did you take hold of his right arm at that point? 
         
        
        
         
         A. To control the situation. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what was the situation which you believed needed to be controlled? 
         
        
        
         
         A. His agitated state. I didn’t wish to give the person any chance of assault[ing] either Senior Constable Caldwell or myself, and equally I didn’t wish the - Mr Woodley to be able to walk away from that situation.” 
         
        
        
       Constable Boyd was cross-examined as follows (Black 6/1223 line 9-1224 line 44): 
        
         
         “Q. Why was it that you decided at that moment to arrest him for possession of nunchakus? 
         
        
        
         
         A. To inform he was going to be arrested? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yeah, at that moment, why did you do it at that point? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, things were escalating out of control. I mean the act of throwing the keys away, he was becoming more and more agitated, I decided at that stage to place him under arrest. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He had now removed the keys and the knife from his possession? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And for all you know it was going to be a simple matter for Constable Caldwell to go and do what he subsequently did, that is, go into the paddock and retrieve the keys and the knife, open the car and have a look inside? 
         
        
        
         
         A. You have an extremely agitated and aggressive man standing beside you, he has done something which I consider to be, to say the least, out of the normal -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say he was extremely agitated, again, we’ve heard some observations from you about his slamming the bonnet, the way in which he closed the door, the hurried walk -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was there anything else? 
         
        
        
         
         A. He was almost to the point of - it’s very hard to describe what - he was almost sort of to the point where he was physically shaken. You find that a person gets to the point where they’re sort of - and I can only describe that as an extremely agitated state. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you think of saying to him, ‘Are you all right, are you feeling all right, do you want to have a sit down there while we get the keys and have a look around?’ Did you think of dealing with it another way? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You thought that the fact that he was shaking and agitated meant that was the time to arrest him? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That was the time for me to try and control the situation. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, hang on Constable, you say control the situation. As I understand your evidence, all you’ve got is a man who’s slammed a bonnet lid, closed the door in a particular way, walked hurriedly and was almost shaking with agitation. Why was the situation out of control? 
         
        
        
         
         SAIDI: Your Honour, that’s not correct. Plus a man who had thrown keys over into the paddock.  
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         GREY: Q. The keys in the paddock was a matter where they were sitting there, someone could go and get them, wasn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, they were thrown from sight. I didn’t know where they were. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Apart from the keys being in the paddock, the situation was as I just described it to you, wasn’t it? It wasn’t out of control is what I’m putting to you? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I don’t think, with respect Mr Grey, he said it was out of control, he said it was getting out of control. 
         
        
        
         
         GREY: Q. Well, it was not getting out of control, I’m suggesting to you Constable? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It hadn’t got out of control because I didn’t let it get out of control. At some stage with dealing with [defendants] you have to make a judgment in relation to which way you want to deal with them. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Constable, at that stage you weren’t dealing with [a] defendant, you were dealing with an ordinary citizen going about his business. What I’m saying to you is, there was nothing in that man’s behaviour that was indicative of anything other than he was agitated. That’s correct isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I perceived a definite threat from the man in relation to his actions and what I observed his mood or behaviour to be. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At the time he’d thrown his keys away of course, he had removed from his possession the one offensive implement, apart from the nunchakus that you already had that was visible, hadn’t he? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He’d made no effort to strike you or kick you or run from the scene or anything of that sort, had he? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, but just because he hadn’t done it at that stage doesn’t mean that he’s capable of doing it at any second.” 
         
        
        
       The sense of the answer is that for “capable” should be read “incapable”. There was further cross-examination as follows (Black 6/1224 line 53-1226 line 23): 
        
         
         “Q. The nunchakus had been removed by you or Constable Caldwell, that’s right isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. By Senior Constable Caldwell, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So I take it if there was some - I mean, those were in your possession at that time? 
         
        
        
         
         A. They were in police possession, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Mr Woodley had thrown away his keys to which was attached the knife that you had regarded as a threatening piece of hardware? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, that’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At that point he was facing you with nothing in his hands, that’s correct isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And he wasn’t making any move that suggested to you that he was going to hit you or strike you or kick you or anything of that sort? 
         
        
        
         
         A. He made no threat towards me, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And all you saw was a man who was agitated, very severely agitated. 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you think that he might have been agitated because he was genuinely afraid for example? 
         
        
        
         
         A. He exhibited no signs of being afraid. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, did you think he might have been agitated because he was unwell? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You didn’t think about that at all? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Your immediate reaction was then just to arrest him, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. To control the situation. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, at the moment, he’s just standing there agitated. 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Immediately before you told him he was under arrest, I’m talking about. You didn’t think of any other way that you might calm him down, ask him to take a seat, deal with him in a more sympathetic manner, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You’re solution was ‘You’re under arrest’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. He’d committed certain offences.” 
         
        
        
       In further cross-examination he said (Black 6/1226 line 55-1227 line 10): 
        
         
         “Q. Did you ask him whether he would be prepared to accompany you to the police station, did you do that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No sir. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see, here you had a man who was agitated. Why didn’t you say to him ‘Sir, we wish you to come with us to the police station’. Why didn’t you tell him that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Because I was going to arrest him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes, I appreciate you were going to arrest him, Constable, but you had not at this stage established whether this very agitated man was prepared to accompany you without any force being applied to him, had you?” 
         
        
        
       The last question was rejected, but it underlay the plaintiff’s contention on appeal that to take hold of the plaintiff’s wrist was a battery. So did the following evidence (Black 7/1274 lines 19-25): 
        
         
         “Q. … until you placed your arm on his, on Mr Woodley’s arm, having told him he was under arrest, until that moment Mr Woodley had given no indication to you, verbally or otherwise, that he was not prepared to accompany you to the station for the purposes of dealing with the matters that you had some concern about, had he? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct.” 
         
        
        
       The cross-examination continued (Black 7/1274 line 36-1275 line 19): 
        
         
         “Q. … until you placed your hand on his arm there was no reason for you to think, I suggest, that he would not comply with the a direction to get in the police vehicle and accompany you back to the station? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t think I would agree with that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see, what I suggest to you, Constable, is what Mr Woodley resisted was the fact that you were applying force to him, that’s what he resisted, isn’t that the case? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that you had no reason until you applied force to him to believe that he would not, if told he was under arrest, accept that and go with you to the station?  
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I don’t agree with that statement. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But it’s the case, isn’t it, that neither you or Constable Caldwell asked him - I withdraw that. After you said you were under arrest, and I appreciate you say you also indicated a charge at that point, after that point neither you nor Constable Caldwell asked the plaintiff to get into the police vehicle for the purposes of accompany[ing] you to the station before you took hold of him, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And at no point up until the time you indicated that he was under arrest or, sorry, up until the time you took hold of him did he attempt to flee from the scene? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Indeed, at the point when you took hold of him his keys were, of course, in the paddock, that’s correct, isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So that if he had attempted to flee from the scene it would have been on foot? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You saw nothing, did you, that indicated to you that he might be about to do that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I disagree with that statement.” 
         
        
       
     53    At the second trial Constable Boyd said that he “was unsure of [the plaintiff’s] intentions: (Black 2/471 lines 56-57). He wished to “take control of the situation so that it wouldn’t get out of control” (Black 3/508 lines 56-57).  
      
       
     54    Constable Caldwell’s evidence was (Black 7/1360 lines 46-56): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. So that when the statement was made ‘You are under arrest’ there was no discussion, I take it, before Constable Boyd put his hand on Mr Woodley, about whether any restraint of Mr Woodley was required in order to get him to accompany you to the police station: 
         
        
        
         
         A. That was the impression that one got, that to restrain him, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But there was no discussion with him about whether any restraint was going to be required?  
         
        
        
         
         A. No. No.” 
         
        
        
       Constable Caldwell was also “of the opinion that … he wouldn’t have … come to the police station of his own accord” (Black 7/1379 lines 46-47). He also said (Black 7/1380 lines 1-10): 
        
         
         “Q. You did not give Mr Woodley a chance to indicate any position on his part as to whether he would or would not accompany you to the police station peaceably, after being told he was under arrest? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Through his manner, that he was very aggressive towards police, towards us, and it was obvious to me that he wasn’t going to come to the station peaceably. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I see. Nonetheless you never asked him? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is correct.” 
          
         
        
        
       The First Stage Evaluated 
       
     55    No criticism was made of the police conduct up to the moment of the arrest. It was, at least until then, polite and restrained. Criticism commences from the moment of the arrest. At the time when Constable Boyd decided to place his hand on the plaintiff’s right arm, he and Constable Caldwell: 
      
       
        
       (a) knew that the plaintiff had been speeding; 
        
        
       (b) knew that the plaintiff had been driving with an expired licence; 
        
        
       (c) knew that the plaintiff had a concealed radar device in his vehicle; 
        
        
       (d) knew that the plaintiff had twice told a “complete” lie on that subject, and “blatantly” so; 
        
        
       (e) perceived the plaintiff to have attempted to intimidate them with a knife in such a fashion as to cause “alarm bells” to begin ringing; 
        
        
       (f) knew that the plaintiff had a dangerous weapon, nunchakus, in his possession; 
        
        
       (g) perceived the plaintiff to be behaving in an unusual fashion - in an increasingly aggressive, very nervous, very severely agitated but not afraid, upset, on edge, rushed, noisy fashion; perceived him not to be pleased in the position he was in; and perceived him to be a little bit shaky and threatening in his manner;  
        
        
       (h) perceived the situation to be moving out of control; 
        
        
       (i) observed the plaintiff throw his keys away into the nearby paddock in an eccentric fashion - “to say the least, out of the normal”; 
        
        
       (j) regarded the plaintiff as capable of attacking or fleeing from the police.  
        
       
     56    A reasonable police officer in the position of Constable Boyd was entitled to conclude, as Constable Boyd did, that precautions needed to be taken to make it clear to the plaintiff that he was under arrest, to protect himself and Constable Caldwell from attack, to prevent the plaintiff from running away and in general to bring some order and control into what was happening. That conclusion is not nullified or undercut by the fact that the threat from the knife and the nunchakus had ceased, or by the fact that the plaintiff had not yet actually attacked the police officers, or by the fact that no flight had yet been attempted, or by the fact that any flight could only have been on foot. The point is that though the plaintiff’s intentions were unclear, he did not appear to be afraid, but he did appear to be upset, aggressive and abnormal, and he did not appear willing to come to the police station peacefully. A perception of a risk of attack or flight cannot be described as unreasonable. The degree of force which Constable Boyd used in relation to the plaintiff’s arm was as gentle as it could have been once it was decided to effect a physical touching: “I took hold of his right arm with my right hand” (Black 2/459 line 40).  
      
       
     57    The plaintiff submitted, after referring the court to Zecevic v DPP (Vic) (1987) 162 CLR 645 at 662-4 and R v Thomas (1992) 65 A Crim R 269 at 272, that force could not have been applied lawfully to him unless he had brought about a situation where there was “some reasonable basis to believe that the application of force is necessary” (transcript page 20 line 37). If that is a relevant test, it was satisfied in the present circumstances.  
      
       
     58    If the test stated in R v Turner [1962] VR 30 at 36 is applied, Constable Boyd used that degree of force which he actually believed to be necessary to effect his purpose, namely to maintain control over the situation, prevent flight and prevent an attack by the plaintiff. That was a reasonable belief. And a reasonable person in his position would not consider the placing of a hand on the plaintiff’s wrist as disproportionate to the evils to be prevented.  
      
       
        
         
        
       
     59    Initially the plaintiff did not contend that Constable Boyd had breached the law by placing a hand on the plaintiff (transcript page 18 line 54 and page 20 lines 9-10). Indeed his counsel conceded that at trial issue had not been taken “with the basic act of touching but only with what followed” (transcript page 48 lines 46-47). In due course, after some debate with the court (transcript page 21 lines 16-18), the plaintiff appeared to criticise the touching. Counsel for the defendant complained that if the point had been taken at the trial, the police officers would have been given an opportunity to explain why they took the plaintiff by the arm, and there was a procedural unfairness in taking the point on appeal. This complaint is invalid: it is difficult to conceive of a more exhaustive examination of the events in controversy, and every nuance of the police conduct was so closely examined that, assuming the touching were held unlawful, any additional answer they may have given on that subject could not have affected the outcome. In any event, the touching has been held not to have been unlawful.  
      
       
        
       Second Stage: The Decision to Apply a Wrist Lock 
       
     60    The trial judge found that the following happened after Constable Boyd took hold of the plaintiff’s right arm (Red 30.1-.2): 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff tried to pull his arm away from something between a tug of war and an arm wrestle.  
         
        
        
         
         Shortly after this struggle commenced Boyd placed a wrist lock on Woodley ….” 
         
        
       
     61    Constable Boyd said that after he took hold of the plaintiff’s right arm “he began to struggle violently”, Constable Caldwell took hold of his left arm and he, Constable Boyd, applied an arm lock (Blue 2/9, 14, 16, 21 and 27; Suppl Tab 31 para 10). He “commenced to struggle and try and pull away … I tried to retain hold of the defendant’s arm and he began to struggle violently” (Blue 1/19 and 21). He attempted to pull his arm away very “sharp” (Black 2/410 line 26). Constable Caldwell “took hold of his left arm and [the plaintiff] continued to struggle pulling his arm from my grip. I again took hold of his left arm and attempted to place his arm behind his back to stop him from striking at Senior Constable Boyd” (Suppl Tab 31 para 10) or himself (Black 7/1316 lines 10-15; 2/319 lines 3-5). The plaintiff “resisted” Constable Caldwell “by attempting to break free of [Constable Caldwell’s] grip and pull his arm away from [Constable Caldwell’s] hold” (Black 7/1318 lines 50-51). At Black 6/1157 lines 47-59 Constable Boyd said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And, as you took hold of his right arm, what happened then? 
         
        
        
         
         A. He tried to pull his arm away from mine. He tried to release himself from my grip, and he began to struggle. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I know it may be difficult, but can you indicate the actions which constituted the struggle? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It was a bit like a tug of war, he’s trying to pull his arm back away from mine, I’m trying to - to retain it in that position. I - it’s a cross, suppose, I think, between a tug of war and an arm wrestle, if you like.” 
         
        
        
       “He tried to move his arm in a very quick, jerky movement so as to break himself free, with as much force as he could” (Black 6/1231 lines 18-19). Constable Boyd was attempting to re-establish control of the plaintiff (Black 7/1274 line 34).  
        
        
       Third Stage: The Decision to Apply an Arm Lock 
       
     62    The trial judge summarised Constable Boyd’s evidence that the purpose of the wrist lock was to cause acute pain “which is usually enough to control a person and if the person continues to struggle more pressure could be applied” (Red 30.4). The trial judge continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “Boyd explained that the plaintiff continued to struggle after the application of the wrist lock either because he had not applied it correctly or had not got the pressure to actuate the nerve pain. The plaintiff continued to struggle and pull away.  
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff said ‘What am I being arrested for?’ Boyd said “I have already told you for possession of the nunchakus’. A short time after that Boyd decided to swap from a wrist lock to a full arm lock to control the plaintiff who was still trying to pull away” (Red 30.5-30.8).  
         
        
       
     63    Constable Boyd said that the plaintiff “continued to struggle violently” trying to release himself from our grip (Blue 2/9 and 14). The plaintiff “continued to resist violently, tried to free himself from our grip, so that I then placed an arm lock on the [plaintiff’s] right arm (Blue 2/16-17 and 21). Constable Boyd said (Blue 1/29.4 and .8): 
      
       
        
         
         “I was having problems with his strength to try and get his arm straight. The wrist lock wasn’t on properly as far as I was concerned. My experience in the past is when a wrist lock is in place properly then the pain becomes so acute that the defendant ceases to struggle. … 
         
        
        
         
         As I said I had trouble with the wrist lock in the fact that he was still struggling violently. It was still a case of I didn’t have the hold. In my opinion he was still capable of getting out of the hold and assaulting me.” 
         
        
       
     64    Constable Boyd said (Black 6/1161 lines 7-14): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. As you placed the wrist lock on his right arm what happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mr Woodley continued to struggle and it appeared to me that the wrist lock was either having very little effect or that I hadn’t placed it on correctly or hadn’t got the pressure point to actuate the nerves. In any event he was continuing to struggle and trying to pull away.” 
         
        
        
       Constable Boyd moved to a full arm lock in “an attempt to control” the plaintiff (Black 6/1161 line 22; 7/1274 line 34). He was then asked (Black 6/1161 lines 24-29): 
        
         
         “Q. What was he doing when you attempted to control him? 
         
        
        
         
         A. He was still trying to pull away from my grip. I didn’t think at that stage that I had him sufficiently under control, basically I was going to plan B if you would like to put it that way. I was going to put the arm lock on in an attempt to control the situation.” 
         
        
        
       The plaintiff was “struggling violently” (Black 6/1231 line 54).  
        
        
       Fourth Stage: The Decision to Handcuff the Plaintiff 
       
     65    The trial judge made the following findings about what happened when Constable Boyd decided to handcuff the plaintiff (Red 30.8-31.1): 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff continued to struggle and tried to shift his weight around to try and straighten his arm out and release himself from the hold and he was applying a great deal of force. He described the plaintiff as a strong man.  
         
        
        
         
         Boyd then said to Caldwell ‘I am going to handcuff him’.” 
         
        
       
     66    Constable Boyd had recent experience as at 1991 of the dangers of taking an arrested person who was not handcuffed and was sitting in the back of a vehicle being driven by a police officer (Black 7/1301 lines 2-10 and 22-28). There were no barriers between the rear seat and the front seat (Black 7/1390 line 40-1391 line 9).  
      
       
        
       Fifth Stage: From the Decision to Handcuff the Plaintiff Until the Plaintiff’s Arm Broke 
        
       
     67    The trial judge found that after Constable Boyd said he was going to handcuff the plaintiff the following happened: 
      
       
        
         
         “He took his handcuffs out and started to put them on and the plaintiff shouted ‘You are not putting them on me’ and then made a sudden move of his body both forwards and down and a snapping sound was heard by Boyd. Boyd described this as a move with as much force as the plaintiff could muster, a sudden and violent move. He did not move forward that much bearing in mind that Boyd had a firm grip and that Caldwell had a grip on the other side” (Red 31.1-.3). 
         
        
       
     68    The plaintiff “tried to pull away by moving forward and down” (Blue 2/9 and 14), “attempted to pull away once more by moving forward in a downwards motion” (Blue 2/21 and 27), “pulled away” (Blue 2/17) or “suddenly pulled away moving forward and in a downward motion” (Suppl Tab 31 para 10; Black 2/319 lines 13-14). “He made a sudden move and he went forward and down” (Black 6/1182 lines 50-51). He did so with “as much force as he could muster, that’s my understanding at the time, it was sudden and it was a violent move” (Black 6/1163 lines 3-5). He “lunged forward and down in a violent motion” (Black 2/443 lines 41-42). The plaintiff “dropped his weight, whole body weight on Constable Boyd’s hold” (Black 2/416 lines 37-38).  
      
       
        
       Stages 2-5 Evaluated 
       
     69    Again the plaintiff submitted in relation to stages 2-5 that the trial judge had failed to appreciate his argument that even if the police officers’ evidence was preferred to his, it did not justify a conclusion that the force had not been excessive, and that the trial judge had failed to analyse it or give reasons for rejecting it. Even if that criticism is sound, the plaintiff’s arguments must fail as a matter of substance.  
      
       
     70    The plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff had not created circumstances where there was some reasonable basis for the police officers to believe that the application of force was necessary. But once it is concluded that there was a power to arrest not used for a collateral purpose, and that it was lawful for Constable Boyd to exercise that power by grasping the plaintiff’s wrist and uttering words of arrest, the plaintiff’s case enters an area of difficulty. From that moment on the plaintiff’s actions were in resistance to a lawful arrest. Those actions started a sequence of events culminating speedily in the breaking of the arm. The “struggle was a continuous one” (Black 6/1162 line 1) in which the plaintiff applied a “great deal of force” (Black 6/1162 line 8). As Constable Boyd said, “I told him he was under arrest and placed my hand on him. And what ensued, ensued. There was no - one thing led to another” (Black 6/1227 lines 37-39). If the arrest was lawful when the plaintiff’s wrist was grasped, all his actions were actions in resistance to that arrest which the police officers were entitled to bring under control by force.  
      
       
     71    So far as the plaintiff submitted that excessive force was used because the purpose of applying the wrist lock and the arm lock was to cause pain, the submission should be rejected. The purpose was not to cause pain for its own sake, but rather to reduce the plaintiff’s resistance, for pain was only caused to him so far as he offered resistance.  
      
       
     72    The plaintiff submitted that the extent of the violence being employed by him was exaggerated: he submitted (transcript page 23 lines 17-24): 
      
       
        
         
         “We have two policemen attempting to push both arms up behind the appellant’s back and all we have is that he’s moving his upper body and arms and he may have been shuffling his feet. One might have thought that a violent struggle would involve a melee of some sort where the appellant was kicking, pushing out his feet towards the car, something of that sort.” 
         
        
        
       This submission does not grapple with the evidence of the police officers, accepted by the trial judge, about their difficulties in handling the plaintiff, his strength, and their perception of it as involving violence by the plaintiff.  
        
       
     73    The plaintiff submitted that just before Constable Boyd said that handcuffs would be used, the plaintiff was under control and there was an opportunity “to try and say are you prepared to be reasonable, are you going to go quietly, are you going to calm down?” (transcript page 24 lines 16-17). The plaintiff submitted that the use of handcuffs was excessive force which he was entitled to resist by seeking to free himself by the manoeuvre which caused his arm to break. It was submitted that it was “absurd to suggest that any person conveyed to the Police station in a Police vehicle has to be handcuffed for safety reasons”. Far from the handcuffing of the plaintiff being “absurd”, it seems reasonable. A person who, it was apprehended, might behave violently in a police vehicle who was not handcuffed might be a source of danger to the police officers and to himself both because of the risk of striking them and because of the risk of interfering with the safe driving of the vehicle. By the time it was decided to handcuff the plaintiff, the police officers were entitled to assume that the plaintiff would not respond to mere persuasion, and the trial judge accepted their evidence that handcuffs were necessary to control the situation.  
      
       
     74    If the test stated in R v Turner [1962] VR 30 at 36 is applied to stages 2-5, the police officers used that degree of force (taking the plaintiff’s left arm, applying a wrist lock, then applying an arm lock, and then deciding to use handcuffs) which they actually believed to be necessary to effect their purposes, namely to prevent the plaintiff fleeing or attacking them and to resist the violence he was employing in resisting arrest. It was a reasonable belief, and a reasonable person in their position would not consider the successive forms of force as disproportionate to the evils to be prevented. 
      
       
     75    Grounds 1 and 3 are rejected.  
      
       
     76    So far as grounds 1 and 3 complain of failing to consider and give reasons for rejecting the plaintiff’s submissions, they need not be specifically dealt with; for, assuming but not deciding that the submissions were not fully considered, had they been fully considered, the trial judge would have come, and would have been justified in coming, to the same conclusions for the reasons expressed above.  
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
       
     77    This ground is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “2. His Honour erred in finding that the injuries sustained by the Appellant were caused by his “violent and irrational” reaction to the process of putting him under handcuffed arrest.” 
         
        
       
     78    The plaintiff’s written submissions were as follows (paras 3.2-3.4): 
      
       
        
         
          “3.2 It is submitted that the evidence outlined above simply cannot, and does not, sustain a finding that the Appellant reacted in a ‘violent and irrational’ way, even if other members of the public may have been more meek and acquiescent when faced with assertions of what they perceived as heavy-handed Police authority. The Appellant was certainly upset, but in the circumstances, that is hardly ‘irrational’ behaviour, bearing in mind that he was [being] arrested and handcuffed as a result of possessing a pair of nunchakus and a radar detector, both of which were  
         entirely legal 
          where he came from (which was after all, not a foreign country, but somewhere only a few hours drive away). At very least, a citizen had the right to expect that the Police might exercise greater restraint in the case of a person who, had the same events occurred in the ACT, would have been potentially guilty of nothing but speeding (had that charge been proven, which is was not). 
         
        
        
         
         3.3 Even putting aside the question of rationality, the Police evidence properly analysed cannot support a finding that the Appellant was ‘violent’ in any fashion that justifies the objective use of that word by a judge. Neither Police officer alleged he had been struck, or threatened, or verbally abused, and the physical component of the ‘struggle’ apparently did not even cause the Appellant to do more than move his upper body vigorously to free his arm from a painful lock and ‘shuffle’ his feet backwards and forwards over a small distance, such that none of the parties involved even lost his balance. 
         
        
        
         
         3.4 The question of whether the finding that the Appellant was ‘violent and irrational’ is correct is not just a minor semantic quibble. It was central to the basis on which the Police actions towards the Appellant were justified by his Honour. If that factual finding is wrong, then the decision is anchored on a false premise and cannot stand.” 
         
        
       
     79    The trial judge’s findings about the plaintiff’s behaviour just before his injury were set out in relation to the second-fifth stages. So was the evidence on which they were based. That evidence, and in particular the evidence relating to the fifth stage, strongly supports the trial judge’s acceptance of Constable Boyd’s description of the plaintiff’s movement as “sudden and violent”. A movement by the plaintiff which was sufficiently sudden and violent to break his own bone can correctly be called “violent and irrational”. The plaintiff’s mind may have perceived it to be desirable to continue struggling, but whether or not that be so, it was objectively irrational on any view to do so to the extent of breaking his own bone.  
      
       
        
       Grounds 4-5 
       
     80    These grounds are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “4. His Honour erred in failing to provide adequate reasons for his rejection of the evidence of the Appellant and other lay witnesses called in support of the Appellant’s case. 
         
        
        
         
         5. In his rejection of the evidence of the Appellant and other lay witnesses called in support of the Appellant’s case, his Honour erred in taking into account - 
         
        
        
         
          (a) irrelevant considerations; and 
         
        
        
         
          (b) conclusions of fact unsupported by the evidence.” 
         
        
        
       
     81    The plaintiff’s submissions were as follows (paragraphs 4.1-4.6): 
      
       
        
         
         “4.1 His Honour gave a number of reasons as to why he found the Appellant a person ‘in whom the court could place no credence whatsoever’: Red AB 35-37. The first of these was based on the opinion of Dr Lee that ‘at the relevant time’ the Appellant was a ‘diagnosed psychopath with paranoid features focused [sic] towards Police in general’: Red AB 36. Dr Lee had last seen the Appellant in March 1990,  
         a year and nine months 
          before the ‘relevant time’: Black AB 338.48. He did not know, could not know, did not purport to know, what the position was in December 1991: Black AB 358.34-59. In any event, at no stage in his evidence did Dr Lee describe the Appellant as a ‘diagnosed psychopath with paranoid features’ focussed on the Police or anyone else: see e.g. Black AB 348.30-40. 
         
        
        
         
         4.2 It is true that Dr Knox (the other psychiatrist who saw the Appellant prior to the incident of 18 December 1991) made a diagnosis of ‘intermittent explosive disorder’ (a diagnosis not made by Dr Lee, who thought the Appellant had a depressive disorder): Blue AB 84. However, Dr Knox had also not seen the Appellant since September 1990, or  
         15 months 
          before the ‘relevant time’, and conceded there may have been a change: Black AB 245.7-13, 250.4-254.1. Dr Knox was not entirely comfortable about using the word ‘paranoid’ except in lay terms: Black AB 242.5. He was prepared to agree with counsel for the Respondents that the Appellant had a ‘psychopathic personality’ in the sense that he suffered from an antisocial personality disorder, but the context of his evidence shows he was not using the adjective ‘psychopathic’ in the pejorative manner his Honour used the noun ‘psychopath’: Black AB 242.43-535. Both Dr Lee and Dr Knox agreed that the Appellant was a man not comfortable with being angry and violent and wanted help with his fears that he might lose control: Black AB 246.12-33, 347.53-348.13. Neither doctor had ever observed the Appellant lose control in his presence. 
         
        
        
         
         4.3 To the extent that His Honour relied on a mistaken view of Dr Lee’s evidence in assessing the credibility of the Appellant, his Honour erred. In any event, the evidence of Dr Lee and Dr Knox, whatever it meant, was [it] is ultimately not relevant to the issue of liability because nothing in the Police evidence supported a conclusion that the Appellant had had a ‘rage attack’ or exhibited any manifestation of an ‘explosive disorder’ on 18 December 1991, or that the Police knew anything about this past history that might have led them reasonably to fear him and react pre-emptively. To the extent that his Honour allowed the psychiatric evidence to influence his conclusions on credibility and liability, his Honour erred in two ways. First, he impliedly concluded that Dr Lee and Dr Knox were expressing views about the mental state of the Appellant ‘at the relevant time’, when they were clearly not in a position to do so, and second, he relied on an attribution of a diagnosis to Dr Lee that was not only wrong, but had no relevance to the sequence of events that took place by the road at Taree. 
         
        
        
         
         4.4 His Honour’s conclusion that the insistence of the Appellant on seeing his own speed on the radar display was ‘entirely inconsistent’ with his own version of events is also simply not correct: Red AB 36. The point was that the Police alleged they had recorded him travelling at 96 kph in a 60 kph zone. At that moment, there were two possibilities consistent with the Appellant’s own version of the facts. Either the Police had not recorded that reading at all, or they had recorded the reading in the 100 kph zone. It is hardly surprising that the Appellant (as someone not inclined to accept Police as habitually truthful) would want to see solid evidence of the reading itself. “Show me the evidence’ would be the first reaction of many people who feel unjustly accused of speeding. 
         
        
        
         
         4.5 His Honour’s reference to the Appellant’s use of the word ‘accident’ as a ‘Freudian slip’ also suggests that his Honour has drawn a conclusion that such usage was evidence that the Appellant secretly believed that the injury was an accident, and somehow the use of that word that meant the Police were not at fault in any way: Red AB 37. It is submitted that this usage (accidental or otherwise) has no probative value whatsoever, but even if it did, it can hardly be any basis for a credibility finding against the Appellant. It was never the Appellant’s case that the Police  
         deliberately 
          broke his arm, but that the arm was broken as a result of the unjustifiable application of unauthorised and excessive force. In that case, the injury was correctly described as an ‘accident’, and no adverse conclusion could be drawn from its use. 
         
        
        
         
         4.6 His Honour referred globally to the other lay witnesses in the Appellant’s case: Red AB 37. There is no analysis or discussion of any of the evidence of Ms Meyburn or Mr Smith, or what is was about what they said or their demeanour that caused His Honour to reject them, as he clearly must have done. That is an error of the kind referred to in  
         Earthline 
         : see also  
         Soulemezis v Dudley Holdings Pty Ltd 
          (1987) 10 NSWLR 247. Similarly, his Honour’s brief reference to the evidence of Susan Bryce, the Appellant’s de facto spouse, does not provide any basis for the Appellant to understand exactly what it was in her evidence that his Honour thought supported the conclusion that she was ‘happily there to support his claim in the most obviously biased fashion despite the fact that she more than anyone is aware of the [Appellant’s] violent and irrational nature’: Red AB 37.” 
         
        
       
     82    The defendants’ written submissions were as follows (paras 8-13): 
      
       
        
         
         “8. There was a mountain of evidence to suggest that the appellant suffered from a serious psychiatric condition, not merely at the time of incident, but for a period of some years before, and right up till the date of trial. See paragraphs 12 to 14 of prior submissions of respondents as to this evidence. Dr Lee recorded a history given to him by the appellant and his de facto wife on 20 November, 1989 (Black book P 342 line 10 to P 344, and Blue Book P 143- 150). Whilst Dr Lee did not make the actual diagnosis of the appellant being a psychopath with paranoid features (and the trial judge does not say that he did) there is clear evidence supportive of such a diagnosis being given by other psychiatrists (Dr Petroff: Blue book P 114, Dr Knox: Blue book P 82 and P 92, Dr Berenson: Black book P 844 at line 8) to suggest that the appellant was not suffering from a severe psychiatric disorder, a psychopathic personality, paranoia or otherwise is to fly in the face of the evidence presented. The appellant himself conceded in his evidence that he was pursuing a disability pension throughout 1991 to early 1992, with such application being based upon his uncontrollable violent temper, becoming aggressive when provoked, unable to take orders from a superior in an employment situation without being subject to rage attacks, and in the course of 1991 was afraid that he would lose control if irritated by anyone (Black book P 604 - P 630). Such anxiety based symptoms existed throughout the entire period of 1988 to 1992 per Dr Berenson - Black book P 847 lines 15 - 30). 
         
        
        
         
         9. The relevance of his psychiatric condition is as follows: 
         
        
        
         
          (a) His suffering from such a condition at the time may explain firstly, the likelihood of the appellant acting in the irrational and violent manner which he did, and the reasons why such conduct was undertaken. 
         
        
        
         
          (b) The fact that the appellant was less than forthcoming in revealing this psychiatric condition prior to the commencement of his cross-examination affects his credibility generally. 
         
        
        
         
          (c) The fact that the appellant was evasive in his answers when confronted with the seriousness of his pre-existing psychiatric condition also is capable of affecting his overall credibility. 
         
        
        
         
         10. Para 4.4: The appellant maintained at trial that the police had recorded his speed whilst he was outside the 60 mph zone, and in the 100 zone. He was told by the police at the time, on his version that he was doing about 85 kilometres per hour in a 60 zone. (Black book, P 557 - line 40 to P 558). If the appellant were to have been travelling at 60 kilometres per hour by the police, one would expect an immediate denial from the appellant, rather than his merely disbelieving the police as to his stated speed, with his wanting to check for himself as to what speed was shown on the police recording unit. (Black book P 555 line 5-15, and P 557 line 45 to P 558). The actions of the appellant, in this sense, are entirely inconsistent as the trial judge noted. Whilst the appellant may wish to argue that there are other possible explanations for the appellant’s conduct, it is clear which view the trial judge accepted as being the most acceptable one. This is in a background of the appellant not being able to tell, on his own estimate, whether or not his radar detector went off when he was travelling at 65 or 95 km per hour, and relies upon his alleged reading of 83 km per hour, as recorded on the police unit, as his estimate of speed. (Black Book, 723 Line 19 - line 55). Of course, the police evidence was that a recorded speed of 96 km per hour was the reading in the police car (Exhibit 14). 
         
        
        
         
         11. Para 4.5: It was the appellant’s case that the police did  
         deliberately 
          break his arm. Indeed, in the factual contest, the respondents had to rebut the suggestion that not merely did the police use excessive force, but that a torch was used to hit him at the time when the arm was broken. See the Further Amended Statement of Claim (and paragraph 6(d) (Red Book at P 3 pt 7) and particulars provided, which clearly alleged that the appellant was struck with a torch or similar object. (Blue book P 49 at pt 2). See also the appellant’s evidence in chief at Black book P 562 line 35 to P 20. Dr Berenson gave supportive evidence as to the proposition that a torch may have been used (Blue book P 1 point 4 - point 6) and this was consistent with the history given to him by the appellant (Black book, P 799 lines 30 - 40). The appellant also maintained in his evidence that he had been ‘brutalised’ by the police. In the context of these clearly serious allegations, one would hardly expect an appellant to refer to such an incident as an ‘accident’. The appellant was cross-examined on this aspect at Black book, Page 41 line 25 to P 43. Given the pleadings, and the allegations made by the appellant, one could not conceivably mis-describe the police actions as an ‘accident’. The only possible interpretation of an ‘accident’ from the appellant’s point of view is that his own actions in resisting were not intended to lead to his breaking his own arm. 
         
        
        
         
         12. Para 4.6: There was much cross-examination of the appellant and his witnesses. Time after time, inconsistencies in the evidence were put to them, their evidence was contrasted with the objective evidence of the doctors, the inconsistencies in the evidence between each of the witnesses was highlighted in the cross-examination, and the fragile credibility of the witnesses became obvious to anyone following the evidence. Taken in conjunction with the trial judge’s assessment of the demeanour of each of the witnesses, the trial judge’s findings are unassailable. Indeed, the appellant does not point to any independent, corroborative or objective evidence which is capable of resurrecting the credibility of the appellant or his witnesses. The objective evidence is all one way. Neither the appellant or his witnesses are capable of belief. 
         
        
        
         
         13. Further, it is [to] be remembered that there were no lay witnesses to the relevant incident itself, only the appellant and the two police officer respondents. Hence, this ground of appeal in reality relates to the damages claim, though it is recognised, is capable of affecting the plaintiff’s overall credibility, though to a much lesser extent.”  
         
        
       
     83    So far as Dr Lee and Dr Knox are concerned, any error made by the trial judge in attributing a wrong diagnosis to Dr Lee or assuming that diagnoses they made of the plaintiff at times other than December 1991 were applicable in December 1991 appears to have been an immaterial error. The evidence does support the view that the plaintiff had strong tendencies towards uncontrollable rages. And any error does not affect the overall soundness of the trial judge’s conclusions on the plaintiff’s credibility in relation to his narration of the events of 18 December 1991. The police officers had made contemporary notes. For the most part their evidence was internally coherent and consistent. On the other hand, there were numerous obstacles to accepting the plaintiff’s evidence. To read it is to share the trial judge’s scepticism about it. It gives a strong impression of imprecision, unreliability and evasiveness. There were specific problems relating to his credibility. The plaintiff lied twice to the police on the question of whether he had a radar detector. He lied once to the court on whether he knew that radar detectors were unlawful in New South Wales (he was charged with having committed that offence on 29 June 1991 and was about to attend court to answer that charge on 6 February 1992: Black 1/33-38). A dispute between the plaintiff (who said that the police vehicle was a white vehicle marked “Police” with attachments on the roof) and the police officers (who said it was unmarked) caused the plaintiff to allege a police conspiracy to fabricate their story, to destroy or conceal police vehicle use diaries which might have damaged it, and to persuade Sergeant Scotcha to give different evidence in the second trial from the evidence which he gave to the magistrate that the car was unmarked. Once Sergeant Scotcha‘s explanation was accepted - and no reason has been advanced by the plaintiff for doubting the trial judge’s acceptance of it - the conspiracy theory became suspect on that ground and on other grounds as well, and so did the plaintiff’s evidence supporting it.  
      
       
     84    Further, the plaintiff shifted ground even within his own story. In his answer on 14 September 1994 to the defendants’ request for particulars dated 7 September 1993, he unequivocally asserted that “one of the [defendants] … struck the plaintiff in the area of the right humerus with a torch or similar object. The plaintiff’s right arm was then broken” (Blue 49). The defendants submitted that he did not positively testify that he had been hit, but the fact that he solemnly propounded the allegation that he had in particulars was adverse both to his reliability and his credibility. 
      
       
     85    So far as the arguments based on the plaintiff’s insistence on seeing his own speed are concerned, there was an arguable inconsistency in the plaintiff’s position, and the trial judge was entitled to treat it as significant. The same is true of the plaintiff’s use of the word “accident”, especially since his stand as taken in the particulars was to contend that the bone was broken by a deliberate blow with a torch.  
      
       
     86    That leaves the plaintiff’s submission about Ms Mayburn, Mr Smith and Ms Bryce. Again, whether or not the trial judge was correct in not accepting these witnesses as credible, they were witnesses on damages issues, and what matters in this appeal is what happened between the plaintiff and the two police officers. The trial judge had ample grounds for preferring the evidence of the police officers to that of the plaintiff.  
      
       
     87    The defendants have gone to considerable lengths to support the aspects of the trial judge’s findings which are attacked in relation to grounds 4 and 5. In the circumstances it is not necessary to evaluate these submissions.  
      
       
        
       Notice of Contention 
       
     88    The defendants sought to rely on a Notice of Contention which alleged that there were many items of evidence not referred to by the trial judge supporting his conclusion. In view of the rejection of the plaintiff’s attacks upon the trial judge’s reasoning, it is not necessary to consider the arguments employed by the defendants in support of their Notice of Contention. 
      
       
        
       New Trial 
       
     89    If the plaintiff’s substantive arguments on Grounds 1 or 3 had succeeded, the 
      
       
       plaintiff would have been entitled to a verdict. So far as any of the grounds of appeal based on a failure to give full reasons are concerned, and so far as Grounds 4 and 5 in general are concerned, the only result of success for the plaintiff’s arguments would be an order for a new trial. Part 51 rule 23(1) of the Supreme Court Rules provides that this Court is not to order a new trial unless it appears “that some substantial wrong or miscarriage” has occurred. In view of the trial judge’s credit findings, their acceptance by the plaintiff for some purposes, and their overall soundness, it does not appear that any substantial wrong or miscarriage has occurred even if there had been a failure to give reasons for any conclusion. It is accordingly not necessary to discuss whether adequate reasons were given. For the same reasons, no new trial should be ordered even if Grounds 4 and 5 were made out.  
        
        
       Orders 
       
     90    The plaintiff stressed more than once that it was part of the “great compact” between citizen and state that: 
      
       
        
         
         “where a citizen alleges that the process of law enforcement has gone beyond the limits explicitly or impliedly placed upon it that the justice system will treat the allegation seriously and carefully and with respect, because there is probably no greater injury that can be done to a person in a society like ours than one done under colour of the authority of the state” (transcript page 2 lines 4-11).  
         
        
        
       He submitted that in such cases there was a particular entitlement on the part of the citizen to a careful analysis of the issues and a full statement of reasons. Whether or not the plaintiff’s criticisms of the trial judge for failing to analyse the issues or state reasons fully is valid, the analysis conducted above demonstrates that his conclusions were sound. It is always a matter for alarm, and for inquiry, when a citizen receives a serious injury while in the custody of the state. The injury in this case, however, was not the result of tortious conduct on the part of the defendants. 
        
       
     91    In my opinion the following orders should be made: 
      
       
        
       1. Appeal dismissed. 
        
        
       2. The appellant is to pay the costs of the defendants. 
        
       
     92    DAVIES AJA: I have had an opportunity to read the reasons for judgment of Heydon JA. I agree with them and with the orders proposed but I would make some additional observations of my own. 
      
       
     93    Counsel for the appellant has contended that the learned trial Judge failed to deal or to deal adequately with two issues which, in counsel’s submission, were crucial to the appellant’s claim below. The issues were, first, whether the appellant’s arrest had been unlawful being effected to achieve an unauthorised purpose and, secondly, whether, in the course of the arrest, undue force was used. 
      
       
     94    The first point inevitably fails because, although there was some cross-examination below of the respondents which was relevant to the point, the issue itself was not squarely put to them. An issue of ulterior purpose must be plainly raised and plainly put to the relevant witnesses so that they have a fair opportunity to turn their minds to it and to give express evidence about the matter or matters which actuated their actions. In the present case, that was not done. The issue cannot now be raised. 
      
       
     95    The second point also fails. As Heydon JA has pointed out, an arrest is made when the arresting officer indicates that he is making an arrest and the suspect submits. In the present case, when Senior Constable Boyd placed his hand on the appellant’s wrist, the appellant did not submit. He resisted. To counter his resistance, a wrist lock and then an arm lock were applied. Ultimately, the appellant threw himself forward in an attempt to break the arm lock. This movement, his own resistance to the arrest, caused his arm to break. It cannot be said that the police officers were using undue force. They were using standard wrist and arm locks in an attempt to force the appellant to submit to the arrest. The application of force was rendered necessary by the appellant’s refusal to submit, by his resistance. 
      
       
     96    It may have been arguable that the first step taken by Senior Constable Boyd, that of taking hold of the appellant’s wrist, was unnecessary and provocative and that the appropriate course would have been to ask the appellant to step into the police car, next to which he was standing. However, no such contention was put to the trial Judge or tested by cross-examination. It is too late to raise the matter at this stage. 
      
       
     97    I agree with Heydon JA that the trial Judge did not fail to deal with issues with which he ought to have dealt and that, having regard to the findings of the trial Judge, the appeal must fail. 
      
       
     98    FOSTER AJA: I agree with the orders proposed by Heydon JA and with his Honour’s reasons.

     JUDGMENT 
    1    HIS HONOUR: Following arraignment, but before the empanelling of the jury, a number of matters have been canvassed relating to the admissibility of evidence. I will deal first with the objections to evidence on behalf of the accused Phuong Canh Ngo set out in Ex. X1 on the voir dire. The first objection is to the ballistics evidence of Messrs Roach and Pfoser on the basis that its probative value is outweighed by the prejudicial value. 
    2    The Crown alleges that the murder weapon was a 1935 .32 calibre Beretta pistol recovered from under water at Voyager Point nearly four years later on 10 June 1998 in a rusted condition. Because of such rusted condition no ballistics expert can express a firm opinion as to whether or not the firing pin matched the markings on the spent cartridge cases found at the scene of the killing. 
    3    The objection is taken that, in the absence of firm proof that it is the weapon, the evidence is such that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice within the terms of s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (""the Act"") and it is also objected to on the ground that the evidence of a technical witness, Mr Pfoser, whose methodology will be challenged in a highly technical manner, may be given greater weight than it deserves by the jury because he will be coming all the way from Germany to give his evidence. 
    4    The Crown case in relation to the identity of the weapon is circumstantial. There is evidence that the murder weapon was a .32 calibre pistol and one of the alleged co-offenders, TVT, who will give evidence for the Crown, says that the accused David Dinh had such a weapon in the car on the night of the killing, and there is some evidence that after the shooting it was handed by Dinh to Ngo at a service station. Sergeant Roach is expected to give evidence that the markings on the firing pin found on the rusted pistol recovered at Voyager Point is consistent with the markings on the casings found at the scene. Mr Pfoser says that it was ""more probably than not"" the same firing pin used. There is also evidence of the use of a mobile phone in the possession of the accused Ngo at the relevant time indicating that he was travelling in the direction of Voyager Point. There is evidence of how rare this particular model of gun was generally, and in Australia in particular, and the very unusual pin impression of that model. In addition persons who had handled the gun, such as the witnesses TDN and TVT say, as I understand it, that it was similar to the gun used in earlier attempts on the life of John Newman. 
    5    In my opinion, based on all these matters, taken together, it would be open to the jury to conclude that the weapon used in the shooting was the weapon recovered at Voyager Point. Circumstantial cases do not depend on each individual circumstance, but on the totality of circumstances taken together and each circumstance does not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt:  Shepherd v The Queen (1991) 170 CLR 573 at 580. Indeed, the fact that this was the murder weapon is itself merely one of the circumstances, and so does not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  
    6    The fact that one of the experts has travelled from Germany is irrelevant. The jury will have to judge his evidence on its cogency, the data on which it is based, his methodology and its relationship to the other evidence. There is no basis for suggesting that they may give added weight to his opinion because the expert witness comes from overseas. 
    7    Likewise the fact that the defence intends to challenge the witness' methodology on technical grounds is no reason to exclude evidence under ss 137 or 135. It will be the responsibility of counsel to put the questions including the technical ones to the expert witnesses in a form which the jury can understand, and I would expect the State's Senior Crown Prosecutor and its Senior Public Defender would be able to do this. The probative value of the evidence, if accepted, is very high and I cannot see any unfair prejudice to the accused. I will admit the evidence. 
    8    The second matter to which objection is taken is the evidence of PD. There are a number of problems about this evidence and I note that following lengthy argument and submissions, the Crown will not open her evidence and it has been agreed that I should defer ruling on this point. 
    9    The third objection is to the evidence of the reading of the evidence of a witness. In this respect the Crown Prosecutor informs me that he does not now see the need to read the evidence of CC in this trial. CC cannot presently be located and if located the Crown will lead his evidence viva voce and not seek to read it. 
    10    The fourth objection is to the reading of the evidence of Shirley Barrett given in the second trial of the accused Ngo and Dao. Ms Barrett is now deceased. Her evidence relates to calls from the mobile telephone allegedly in the possession of Ngo on the night of the murder, shortly after the murder, and relates to the alleged disposal by Ngo at Voyager Point of the alleged murder weapon. It is said by the Crown to be relevant for two purposes. She can identify the caller as the accused Ngo, as the result of which, in conjunction with evidence from Telstra regarding the operation of mobile telephone towers, his route and location at that time can be identified, and the Crown claims it can be established that he was travelling in the direction of Voyager Point. 
    11    Moreover, in the second of these conversations the accused Ngo says that he was then on his way home. The Crown intends to prove that he was not on his way home at the time but travelling towards Voyager Point, and seeks to rely on this evidence as a lie showing a consciousness of guilt. 
    12    In my view the evidence is admissible under s 65(3) of the Act and this is conceded by Mr Nicholson SC on behalf of the accused Ngo in relation to the first point, namely, the identification of the caller as the accused Ngo, but he objects to evidence of the content of the second conversation which the Crown seeks to rely on as a lie. 
    13    Before moving on to that point the evidence proposed to be read is the evidence in what has been referred to as the second trial of the accused Ngo and Dao. The accused Dinh was not an accused in that trial. Consequently his counsel did not have the opportunity to cross-examine, but Mr Hoenig informs me that he does not oppose admission of the evidence against his client if it is otherwise admitted. 
    14    Mr Nicholson's objection to the content of the second conversation said by the Crown to constitute the telling of a lie by the accused Ngo is based on the provisions of s 82(1) of the Act. He submits that evidence of a lie comes within the definition of an ""admission"" as defined in the Dictionary to the Act, being a previous representation adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of proceedings. This point must be conceded. It is established by the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442, following R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426. 
    15    But he submits that if the evidence is admitted pursuant to s 65 it is not evidence given orally by a person who heard the admission being made. He concedes that if Ms Barrett were still alive and present she could give the evidence, but because she is deceased and her evidence will be adduced by the reading of the deposition under s 65 it is not evidence given orally by her and accordingly, and in light of s 82, it is not admissible. 
    16    That result, absurd as it may seem, may have been the consequence of the Act in its original form when s 82 provided that s 81 did not prevent the application of the hearsay rule to evidence of an admission unless it was given orally by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the admission being made. But the section was amended by Act No. 53 of 2000, the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, Schedule 1 paragraph 11, which omitted the word ""orally"" from s 82(a) so that section now reads: 
     
      
       
       ""Section 81 does not prevent the application of the hearsay rule to evidence of an admission unless it is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the admission being made."" 
       
      
      
    17    Ms Barrett was a person who heard the ""admission"" being made. She gives the evidence, although not orally but by deposition under s 65, and accordingly s 82(a) is not applicable, and the whole of her evidence is admissible. 
    18    The object of s 82 both in its original and amended form is to prevent second-hand hearsay. That is not the issue here. The evidence of Ms Barrett is her evidence and it is first hand, and it is given by her, although it was as I say given by deposition and not orally. 
    19    The fifth objection relates to evidence which the Crown Prosecutor informs me will not now be led, so I move on to the sixth objection, which is the leading of evidence in chief from TVT and TDN as to matters affecting their credit only. 
    20    TVT and TDN are accomplice witnesses who have been given indemnities and/or undertakings. It is alleged that they were engaged at various times in the common purpose with the accused Ngo and others to kill John Newman and consequently a warning concerning their evidence will be necessary under s 165. It is conceded that the evidence in chief can include evidence of the giving of the indemnities and/or undertakings.  
    21    I am informed that when they first spoke to the authorities they disclosed some matters of which they now seek to give evidence, but not others. The Crown wishes to lead in chief, evidence from them when they first went to the authorities, and why they did so, and also the reasons for them not disclosing all material information at that stage. The evidence is objected to on the grounds that it is forbidden by s 102 of the Act, the credibility rule. That section at the beginning of Part 3.7 is as follows:  
     
      
       
       ""Evidence that is relevant only to a witness's credibility is not admissible.""  
       
      
      
     There follows a number of exceptions including cross-examination as to credibility (s 103) and re-establishing credibility (s 108). 
      
    22    It has often been considered good advocacy for counsel who has a problem witness to confront the problem head-on as early as possible, and if there are going to be questions raised about previous inconsistent statements, to lead evidence as to the reasons or excuses for such inconsistent statements during the evidence in chief, rather than wait for an attack to be made on the witness in cross-examination. However, it would appear that such evidence, strictly speaking, would not be admissible in evidence in chief at common law, and that the position would appear to be reinforced by the provisions of the Act. 
    23    Credibility of a witness is defined in the Dictionary as meaning, ""the credibility of any part or all of the evidence of a witness..."" Although in my experience such evidence has in the past not infrequently been led in these circumstances, the words of the section appear to be clear, and this view is confirmed by the learned authors of Cross on Evidence, Australian edition at para [19005] who state: 
     
      
       
       ""The Cth Evidence Act 1995 and NSW Evidence Act 1995 provide that evidence that is relevant only to a witness's credibility is not admissible: s 102. There are exceptions for cross-examination (ss 103-104), for rebuttal of certain denials by a witness (106) and for evidence re-establishing credibility (s 108), but there are no exceptions in relation to evidence in chief, save s110(1) permits an accused person who is testifying to give evidence of good character."" 
       
      
    24    The evidence to which objection is taken falls squarely within the definition and therefore cannot be led except pursuant to the exceptions referred to. Mr Nicholson SC referred to the need for leave under s 108(3) to lead such evidence, even in re-examination; but s 108(1) is in my view quite separate from s 108(3) and if the credit of a witness is attacked, evidence from that witness relating to his credit is admissible in re-examination under s 108(1) without leave. 
    25    The Crown referred me to the judgment of McHugh J in Palmer v The Queen (1998) 151 ALR 616, but that case is distinguishable for two main reasons: firstly, the case was not concerned with leading evidence relating to credibility as evidence in chief but with the cross-examination of an accused as to whether a complainant in the sexual assault case had a motive to lie or fabricate allegations, and secondly, the discussion by his Honour concerning the distinction between evidence relating to facts in issue and evidence only going to credibility was concerned mainly with the finality rule by which other evidence cannot be led to contradict evidence going only to issues of credit, and was concerned with the difficulty in defining the boundary between the two. In any event, his Honour dissented on the relevant issues in the case, and his comments are only dicta. 
    26    I am therefore satisfied that the two witnesses can give evidence in chief that they were charged and at a later stage went to the authorities and were later given indemnities or undertakings but their reasons or motives for going to the police and their previous inconsistent or incomplete statements cannot, or their reasons for such discrepancies cannot, be led as part of their evidence in chief but only in re-examination, provided the anticipated attack on their credit is made. 
    27    The learned Crown Prosecutor therefore then submits that he would seek to refer to these matters in his opening address. Mr Nicholson SC, supported by Mr Cusack SC for the accused Dao, objects and submits that they are not proper matters for an opening and will take away the ""thunder"" of the defence attack. I can see no valid objection to the course proposed by the Crown. The object of the opening is to outline the Crown case to the jury so that they will understand the Crown case as individual witnesses are called. 
    28    It is clearly proper for the Crown to tell the jury that they are alleged accomplices, that the jury will be warned that their evidence may be unreliable and the reasons why it may be unreliable in that context. I cannot see any reason why the Crown cannot say that their credibility will be attacked and that one of the anticipated grounds of the attack will be that initially they only told the authorities part of their current evidence, but that they will give reasons for that and for later going further and what those reasons were. 
    29    Evidence intended to be led by the Crown in re-examination (to rebut a telegraphed attack on the credibility of an intended witness) is just as much evidence to be led by the Crown as evidence intended to be led from the witnesses in chief. There is no principle of which I am aware, and I have not been referred to any authority, to the effect that the defence is entitled to the tactical advantage or ""thunder"" of first raising the issue of credibility of a witness. The issue of their credibility will be raised by the need for a warning concerning their evidence under s 165, and the evidence will all be before the jury at some stage. However I am also satisfied that the Crown should deal with these matters only in general terms and not proceed too far into the specifics of the differences in the various statements, but merely that there were differences, and it is anticipated that they will give explanations for such discrepancies in due course. 
    30    The seventh objection relates to the Crown allegedly making continual requests for the non-publication orders in the presence of the jury. The matter has been resolved and the Crown has indicated that he will make such applications in the absence of the jury. 
    31    The eighth objection is to the Crown making any reference in its opening or in evidence in chief to Lucy Wang which seems to seeks to impute her credit insofar as her initial observations of the motor vehicle used by the gunman to escape the scene. 
    32    I am informed that Lucy Wang will give evidence that the deceased's assailant got into the front seat of a dark green car. TVT says that he was a passenger in the vehicle and that the assailant, whom he identifies as the accused Dinh, got into the near side rear seat. The objection apparently is to Ms Wang saying that she thought he got into the front seat, when her evidence will be that he got into the front passenger seat. Apparently the front near side door of Dao's car did not work, and so he could not have got into the front passenger seat, if it was Dao's car, as alleged. 
    33    The other objection is to the Crown proffering a suggestion as to why she might have got it wrong, such as shock, et cetera. 
    34    I must say this all seems rather trivial and nitpicking to me but defence counsel assure me that it is of ""crucial importance"". The Crown has indicated that he will not open to the jury that she ""thought"" that the assailant got into the front seat, and will not proffer a comment as to how she may have been affected by shock, although of course he reserves the right in his closing address to make any comments properly available to him in the light of the evidence at that stage. 
    35    The ninth objection is to the Crown relying on any evidence from TDN or TVT of any activities or conversation which is not in furtherance of the alleged joint enterprise between them and Phuong Canh Ngo. As a general proposition this objection is clearly valid, but the objection is taken to specific pieces of the evidence which is claimed do not come within the furtherance of the alleged joint enterprise. 
    36    The first piece of evidence objected to is summarised at p 51 of the transcript of this hearing and relates to evidence from the witness TDN of a nocturnal visit to his premises, so it is said, by the accused Ngo, who takes TDN from his bed and drives him to the vicinity of the Mekong Club where TDN is requested to remain in the car whilst Ngo speaks to Dinh and TVT some distance away from the car, they both being employees of the Mekong Club. At the conclusion of that conversation Ngo returns to the car and returns the witness TDN to his home. 
    37    This is evidence of association between some of those allegedly involved in the common purpose, and it is also evidence that TDN was prepared to do Ngo's bidding, to get out of bed and to sit in a car and then go home, all as directed by Ngo and for no apparent purpose. 
    38    It was submitted that there may be an innocent explanation for it all and that may be so; but prima facie it is unusual conduct on the part of both Ngo and TDN. There is no evidence that Dinh was involved in the common purpose at that stage. I am satisfied that the evidence is admissible against Ngo and Dao, and Dinh is entitled to have the jury warned that there is no evidence of his involvement in any common purpose at that stage. 
    39    The next objection relates to evidence from TVT and TDN of a conversation, or possibly two conversations between them, when each of them says to the other words to the effect that Ngo had asked him to kill John Newman (or to kill someone). Mr Nicholson SC concedes that each of them may give evidence of the conversation in which Ngo made the request to the witness, but submits that they cannot give evidence that they told each other of the request. 
    40    This meeting, or these meetings, were when they discussed getting a gun, and he rightly concedes that that part of the conversation is in alleged furtherance of the common purpose but he submits that this reference to Ngo's request is not, and cannot be, in furtherance of the common purpose, but is merely narrative of what has already occurred. 
    41    TDN's version of the conversation is set out in the current transcript at p 61. 
    42    True it is neither of them expressly says that the reason he wants to get a gun is because Ngo has asked him to kill someone, but in the context of the conversation the implication is at least open, if not irresistible, that the reason that he wanted a gun was to help Ngo kill John Newman; and other evidence shows that the gun or guns, when purchased, were passed on to Ngo, and the Crown claims that one of the guns purchased by these two accomplices, or either of them (it does not matter for present purposes) was in fact the murder weapon.  
    43    Both the witnesses were working for Ngo, both were involved in the common purpose with him, but this is the first time, as I understand the Crown case, that they came together to join in the common purpose with each other, the reference to Ngo's request was part of the process of them sounding each other out, and the passage objected to identifies the common purpose in which they joined with each other, namely to help Ngo kill John Newman.  
    44    People do not seek to buy guns for no reason and this conversation in its context identifies the reason why they wanted to buy the guns. Stripped to its bare essentials the conversation amounts to this,  
     
      
       
       A says B wants me to help him kill X. A says do you know where I can get a gun?  
       
      
      
     Obviously in this context he wants a gun to help B kill X.  
      
    45    TVT's version is somewhat different. It is set out in the transcript at p 64, and puts that part of the conversation objected to after they had got the gun, that is the gun they have got at Ngo's instigation, but then they discussed the ultimate object of the common purpose, namely to help Ngo kill John Newman. That discussion as to the object of the common purpose would in my view be in furtherance of such common purpose and identifies the common purpose. I will admit both versions of the conversation. 
    46    The tenth and eleventh objections relate to portions of the ERISPs of the accused Ngo and the giving of evidence by video link. It is agreed that both of these matters may be resolved without the necessity for me giving a ruling thereon, and they can in any event be deferred for the time being. 
    47    In addition, Mr Hoenig, counsel for the accused David Dinh, seeks a ruling in advance that certain evidence identified in the schedule to his written submissions is not admissible against his client. That evidence may be described in general terms as evidence of declarations and acts of the others said and done prior to 5 September 1994 in furtherance of what the Crown alleges was common purpose to kill John Newman at the instigation of Phuong Ngo. Mr Hoenig submits that as his client is charged as a principal in the first degree, as the actual shooter, rules relating to criminal complicity such as common purpose and the associated evidentiary rules under which the acts and declarations of each of the participants in furtherance of the common purpose are admissible against each of them are not relevant. 
    48    These issues have already been canvassed before me in an application to set aside an order for a separate trial. R v Ngo, Dao, Dinh [2000] NSWSC 964, and in the Court of Criminal Appeal on appeal from that decision [2000] NSWCCA 536. The Court noted they were only interlocutory judgments, as is the present one. 
    49    As I said at para [40] in my earlier judgment,  
     
      
       
       ""It follows that the acts and declarations of the other alleged participants in the common purpose are admissible to prove the nature of the enterprise, not the accused Dinh's participation in it"",  
       
      
      
     and I referred to a number of cases. 
      
    50    This statement of principle was upheld by the majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal at para [52], and it was also said at para [49]: 
     
      
       
       ""The fact that a person enters into a joint criminal enterprise at a time after the enterprise has already commenced does not mean that the joint enterprise changes its nature or that a new joint enterprise commences merely by reason of the involvement of the new person in that enterprise. Nor is evidence of what occurred during the course of the enterprise before the person entered into it necessarily inadmissible against the person lately joining the enterprise."" 
       
      
      
       
      
     and their Honours referred to 
       
     R v Bilick and Stark 
      (1984) 11 A Crim R 452 at 462. The Court of Criminal Appeal also pointed out at para [54] that the admissibility of the evidence does not depend on the part played by the particular accused in the joint enterprise, for example, as principal in the first or second degree or accessory etc.  
      
    51    Although the Crown case against the accused Dinh depends on the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he actually fired the fatal shots, the fact that the Crown has no evidence that he joined the enterprise prior to 4 September 1994 does not render the previous acts and declarations of the other participants in the common purpose inadmissible against him; although as both the Court of Criminal Appeal and myself have emphasised it is only admissible to show the nature of the common purpose and not admissible to show the participation in it of the accused Dinh. This latter element must be proved by other evidence. 
    52    The evidence is admissible on this basis but the accused Dinh is entitled to a clear direction to the jury of this limitation on the use of such evidence. 
    53    Moreover, a lot of evidence proposed to be led of events prior to 5 September 1994 is also admissible against Dinh on another basis, namely to show the surrounding circumstances in which it is alleged he was recruited by Ngo to carry out the killing. 
    54    Evidence of surrounding circumstances is generally relevant to show why parties may have acted as they did, to put the facts in their context and to enable a proper understanding of the evidence e.g. Wilson v The Queen (1970) 123 CLR 334; Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590 at 630; R v Dinh in the Court of Criminal Appeal at para [56]. 
    55    Such evidence is often relevant in cases of sexual assaults, as evidence of events taken in isolation may seem incredible, but understood in the context of the surrounding circumstances and other events, they take on a very different quality: R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 515, R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 708. 
    56    Just as shootings do not occur in a vacuum, recruitment of shooters does not occur in a vacuum. As the Crown case is that Dinh acted at the request of Ngo it is correctly conceded that evidence that Ngo had a motive to have John Newman killed is relevant and admissible. 
    57    In my opinion evidence tending to show that Ngo had expressed a desire to have him killed, that he had requested TDN to shoot him and that he had asked TVT to find him a shooter, that he had arranged the purchase of guns for the purpose and had possession of at least one of the guns, that he had instigated three previous unsuccessful attempts on Newman's life, that he was seen driving in the streets near Newman's house two nights before the killing, and that persons previously recruited to carry out the killing had either withdrawn or proved incompetent is all relevant to show the circumstances in which Dinh was allegedly recruited.  
    58    Ngo had (according to the Crown) the motive, the guns, the address, the car, and everything except the shooter. Those facts rendered it more likely that he would, on 5 September 1994 try to obtain a shooter, and therefore more likely that a shooter would be recruited. Without those facts the jury might wonder why he would recruit a shooter at the last minute and therefore consider it less likely that Dinh or anyone else would be recruited. The evidence is such that if accepted it could rationally affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue, namely the recruitment of Dinh into the enterprise. It is therefore relevant (s 55) and admissible (s 56). 
    59    For these reasons I am satisfied that most, if not all of such evidence is admissible to show the circumstances that existed at the time the Crown alleges Dinh was recruited by Ngo to shoot Newman. It is also admissible to show the nature of the enterprise which Dinh allegedly joined, but not to show that he did join it or participate in it. There may be some pieces of the evidence in the schedule which go to neither of these issues, and I would be prepared to consider them separately when the time came. 
    60    Subject to that I will admit the evidence indicated against the accused Dinh. 
    61    HIS HONOUR: The other point was the character evidence and Mr Cusack I understand you to be happy to defer that for the time being? 
     
     CUSACK: Yes your Honour.

      REGINA v ROSS AARON ROBINSON 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1   MEAGHER JA: This is an application by Mr Robinson for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him by Hidden J on 15 October 1998. His sentence was twenty years penal servitude, comprising a minimum term of fifteen years and an additional term of five years. The offence immediately involved was murder and, if I may say so, murder of a particularly nasty kind.2   In addition to the murder, there were also, as part of the initial proceedings, no less than ten charges of armed robbery.3   The victim of the enterprise was a gentleman called Mr Cusumano, who was the manager of The Gamesmen computer store in Forest Road, Penshurst. Mr Robinson and two accomplices had planned for some time to rob this store. They arrived there late on late shopping night a few days before Christmas.4   Mr Robinson was armed with a silver revolver, which he had gained possession of through an armed robbery about a week before. His two accomplices and he travelled on motor bikes, which were somewhat disguised from their normal kind and from which the registration plates had been removed. The faces of the three gentlemen had also been disguised. The robbery, from any point of view, must be considered to have been very carefully planned and intended.5   When they arrived they ordered the staff and customers to lie on the floor. Mr Robinson's brother, Mr Seldon Robinson, menaced one of the staff with a shotgun and demanded that she open the till. He took money from the till and put it into a bag which he was carrying. He then ordered her to take him to the store's safe, which was in an office at the rear. Mr Aaron Robinson also went to the rear of the store where he confronted the unfortunate Mr Angelo Cusumano. He ordered him and some of his staff to lie on the floor. He demanded portable computers. Mr Cusumano, ostensibly in compliance with that demand, led him down some stairs to the basement. In that area apparently stock was kept and computers were assembled. 6   There were members of the staff in the basement and Mr Robinson ordered them also to lie on the floor. He repeated his demand for computers and Mr Cusumano invited him to follow him upstairs again. At the side of the stairs were two heavy metal grates which could be placed across the stairwell to seal it off. When Mr Cusumano reached the top of the stairs he dropped one of those grates into place and it struck Mr Robinson, who was about halfway up the stairs at the time. Mr Robinson then stumbled down the stairs and it seemed that Mr Cusumano jumped from the grate back on to the stairs and followed him. When Mr Robinson regained his footing, Mr Cusumano was about a metre away. At that point he shot Mr Cusumano twice, one bullet penetrating his body from back to front just above the waist and the other entering the top of his head and lodging in his neck. By the time assistance arrived he was dead.7   The three men then escaped from the store according to a pre-ordained plan. They took the trouble to divide all stolen property equally between the three of them. 8   The grounds of appeal are, first, that the sentence imposed by his Honour did not give to the applicant sufficient benefit for his plea of guilty.9   I find this an unattractive submission, for various reasons. One is because the plea of guilty was not the result of any initial contrition. The division of the proceeds of the robbery is inconsistent with any real contrition otherwise the money concerned would have been returned to the victims. It is also unattractive because the plea of guilty arose at a point where a confession made by Mr Robinson was tendered and its admissibility disputed. It was only when the Court decided that the confession was admissible that Mr Robinson bowed to the necessity of confessing his guilt. If the judicial conclusion as to the admissibility of the document were otherwise, no doubt no plea of guilty would have been obtained.10   In those circumstances, I do not see how any moral responsibility is attached to the plea of guilty. It is a simple case of bowing to the inevitable.11   The next ground is that the sentence imposed on Mr Robinson is excessive, having regard to the specific finding made by the Judge that there was no intent to kill the victim.12   Assuming that to be his Honour's finding - and it is not quite his Honour's finding - again it does not seem to me to matter very much. This Court decided in April 1995 in R v Mills (unreported, NSW CCA, 03/04/95) that one must look at the objective criminality of an individual rather than speculate about the intention in his or her mind. In particular, that one must not draw a distinction between felony murder and murder with a pre-ordained intention.13   In the present case, I find it difficult to see why Mr Robinson should be treated any more favourably than if he had intended from the beginning to murder Mr Cusumano. If he had thought about the matter at all, he would have realised that the only point of taking an armed revolver into the store was to use it if it were necessary to do so. If he did not think about it before then, he was reckless to a degree that is hard to imagine.14   In those circumstances, it seems to me that in this case also the fact that the Judge found that there was a limited intention to kill simply does not matter.15   The third ground, which goes to penalty only, is that the minimum term specified by his Honour is excessive because of special circumstances. This I found equally unattractive.16   In the first place, as the submissions of the Crown put it, special circumstances are considered not for the purpose of determining whether a lesser minimum term is justified, but considered only for the purpose of determining whether there is any justification for an additional term that exceeds one-third of the minimum term. That necessarily involves a discretion in the learned sentencing judge. In the present case there was such a discretion in his Honour and his Honour exercised it in a way which is obvious from the sentence he has imposed.17   There can not be a suggestion that his Honour overlooked some point which he should have taken into account or gave improper effect to some point which he did take into account.18   In those circumstances, I am of the view the appeal should be dismissed.19   HULME J: In my view also the appeal should be dismissed. I would add, however, some reasons of my own.20   Firstly, the applicant's sentence was imposed not only for his offence of murder but also some nine offences of armed robbery committed at the same time and also for a quite separate offence of armed robbery committed one week earlier which, in itself, merited some years of imprisonment, even having regard to and once allowance is made for the principle of totality. It is quite wrong to compare, as counsel for the applicant sought to do, the sentence imposed with statistics for cases of murder.21   The answer to the second ground of appeal is provided by what the Court said in Mills, where the proposition that a case of felony murder involved a lower level of culpability than cases of murder involving an intention to kill was rejected. 22   So far as the third ground is concerned, the existence of special circumstances purely enlivens the discretion to adjust the usual relativity between the minimum and additional terms. There were no grounds in this case why that relativity needed adjustment.23   SMART AJ: I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. The extent of the criminality revealed by the facts in this case compelled the sentences that were imposed.24   MEAGHER JA: The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.

    - 7 -IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL60748/00SPIGELMAN CJSPERLING JCARRUTHERS AJFriday 9 March 2001 Regina v John Paul BryantJUDGMENT1    SPERLING J: Prior to 4 February 1999, the appellant’s criminal history included convictions for property offences, drug offences, assault and driving offences. As at February 1999, he was 36 years of age and had received four prison sentences varying from one month to one year of actual imprisonment. One would have hoped that, at his age and with his experience of gaol, the applicant would have learnt his lesson by then, but that was not the case.  
      
       
        
       
     2    It seems that the applicant has been addicted to alcohol and drugs, including heroin for a long time. This is a personal tragedy, a life that is just being wasted. But, sympathetic as one may be, society cannot stand by and watch such an individual abuse the rights of other people. 
      
       
        
       
     3    On 4 February 1999, the applicant attacked another man over money, allegedly owed by the victim to the applicant’s friends. He was indicted on one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to which he pleaded guilty. He had initially been charged with a more serious offence but the Crown did not proceed with that. Whether the Crown was in a position to prove the more serious offences is unknown. I mention the circumstance only in order to make clear that the sentencing hearing proceeded on the facts put before the sentencing judge in support of the offence for which the appellant was indicted and only on those facts. That applies also to this application for leave to appeal. 
      
       
        
       
     4    It was on 14 December 1999 that the applicant came before the District Court at Coffs Harbour for sentence. The agreed facts put before the Court were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “At about 3pm on 4 February 1999 the victim, Trevor Fitzpatrick, (31 years of age) went to a house at 98 Park Beach Road, Coffs Harbour. In the house were the accused and two other persons. 
          
         
         
          
          The accused pushed the victim onto a lounge and an argument erupted over the accused’s claim that the victim owed money to friends of the accused. 
          
         
         
          
          The accused elbowed the victim to the left eye, grabbed him in a headlock and dragged him down the hallway into a bedroom. He pushed the victim on to the bed. The argument over the money allegedly owed by the victim continued. The accused punched the victim to the mouth with his fist. 
          
         
         
          
          When the accused left the room briefly the victim left the house through the bedroom window. He ran into a nearby coffee shop and asked the proprietor to call the police. 
          
         
         
          
          The accused was arrested later that day. He entered into an interview wherein he claimed that the altercation between himself and the victim had remained at a verbal level. 
          
         
         
          
          The victim was examined the same day by Dr Barry Cross. He had superficial lacerations on his left lower lip, left upper eyebrow and the bridge of his nose. Police took photographs of the victim’s injuries.” 
          
         
        
       
     5    The sentencing judge deferred passing sentence. He imposed a recognisance to be of good behaviour for five years and to come up for sentence if called upon for breach. The conditions included that the applicant was to subject himself to the supervision of the Parole and Probation Service and was to obey their directions. The judge warned the applicant that if he breached the recognisance he would go to gaol. 
      
       
        
       
     6    The applicant did breach his recognisance. About one month after the sentence, on 17 January 2000, the applicant stole 12 vinyl records from an acquaintance and sold them to a second-hand dealer for $12. On 25 February 2000, the applicant was convicted for that offence at Coffs Harbour Local Court and also for obtaining money by deception. In relation to that episode he was fined. There was further breach of the recognisance by failing to attend at the probation service on two occasions and attending late on two further occasions. 
      
       
        
       
     7    The applicant received notice requiring him to present himself at Coffs Harbour District Court for sentence. He was to attend on 14 August 2000. He failed to do so. A bench warrant was issued. He presented himself on 29 August 2000. He was taken into custody on that occasion. Bail was refused on 31 August 2000. He has been in custody since 29 August. 
      
       
        
       
     8    On 6 November 2000, the applicant was sentenced for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed on 4 February 1999. The sentencing judge reviewed the history of the proceedings relating to that offence, including the deferral of sentence, the recognisance, the subsequent offence constituting breach, and the applicant being called up for sentence.  
      
       
        
       
     9    In his remarks on sentence, the judge said: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “I take into account the need for general deterrence and particularly deterrence for Mr Bryant. I take into account the fact that he has a relationship with Kerry who is in business; that he has two children, one who is aged nine of Kerry and another, his child by an earlier union, aged fifteen. I take into account that he has been on a disability pension. I take into account that he has been in custody since 14 August when he did not appear in respect of this breach report and a bench warrant issued and he was arrested and he has been in custody since his arrest on 14 August. 
          
         
         
          
          The record of Mr Bryant goes back to the Moruya Children’s Court in Bodella in 1978. Since then there have been various offences of dishonesty and alcohol matters and drug matters and matters of assault and robbery in 1985 in Canberra, assault female at Bega Local Court in 1987. And I take into account as I did before that Mr Bryant has spent time in gaol. Again referring to my remarks on sentence, I noted at that time he was in gaol for false pretences in 1984 and in respect of serious assaults in 1989. He was given eighteen months hard labour, twelve months non-parole period in that. And I take into account the background including his schooling; that he has been involved in work. But I particularly note that he has been given a chance on more than one occasion particularly by me and I take into account also that the maximum penalty for this offence is five years imprisonment.” 
          
         
        
       
     10    As I have mentioned, the applicant had, in fact, been in custody since 29 August, not 14 August. 
      
       
        
       
     11    His Honour went on to say that a period of imprisonment was appropriate. He sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a period of two years commencing on 14 August 2000 with a non-parole period of one year expiring on 13 August 2001. The error in the date favoured the applicant. 
      
       
        
       
     12    There was no finding of special circumstances to justify a non-parole period shorter than would have accorded with the statutory formula. The appellant can have no complaint about that. 
      
       
        
       
     13    The appellant has now been in custody for something over six months. Notwithstanding the applicant’s poor criminal history, the sentence was, in my view, unreasonably excessive, having regard to the objective features of the crime on the agreed facts. 
      
       
        
       
     14    I have taken into account the plea of guilty for its utilitarian value only, there being no reason to believe that there was any prospect of successfully defending the matter. It is unnecessary to specify the quantification of the discount I have allowed, in the special circumstances of the present case. 
      
       
        
       
     15    I would grant leave to appeal, quash the sentence and substitute a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment of six months commencing on 29 August 2000 and expiring on 28 February 2001. The effect of such an order would be that the applicant is entitled to be released from custody immediately. 
      
       
        
       
     16    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. 
      
       
        
       
     17    CARRUTHERS AJ: I also agree.

        REGINA v Leonie Maree HARRISON 
         
         
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 from a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Moore at the Wollongong District Court on 20 October 2000. 
      
       
     2    The Respondent, Leonie Maree Harrison, pleaded guilty to two counts of break enter and steal contrary to s112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and three counts of receiving contrary to s189 of the Crimes Act 1900. Judge Moore sentenced the Respondent to two years imprisonment to be served by periodic detention, with a non-parole period of eighteen months. 
      
       
     3    A legal error appears on the face of his Honour’s judgment. His Honour imposed only one sentence without differentiating in any way between the two sets of charges. Such a differentiation is required (see Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610). Section 112 carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. Section 189 carries a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment. The difference in the criminality of the two offences is clear. Nothing in his Honour’s remarks on sentence indicate that his Honour considered the specific criminality involved in the two kinds of offences. His Honour imposed a single global sentence for all the offences, notwithstanding the significant disparity in the maximum penalties available and in this his Honour erred. 
      
       
     4    His Honour's error was manifest when he said in his reasons: 
      
       
        
         
         “The offences occurred over a short period, 5 May to 6 June 2000. The first of them were committed whilst she was just still within her parole period following her previous conviction for offences of a similar nature. That parole expired on 27 May 2000. Although that was the expiration of a total three-year sentence, it is still an aggravating feature that the parole was still running when those offences were committed.” 
         
        
       
     5    His Honour was applying the well-known principle that when further offences are committed whilst the offender is on conditional liberty, that constitutes an aggravating circumstances. (See eg Re Attorney-General’s Application [No 1]; R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 at 337). 
      
       
     6    The Crown relied on this finding, which counsel for the Respondent challenged. It was submitted to us that his Honour had erred with respect to the date of the first offence being 5 May 2000. His Honour indicated, in the passage quoted, that the parole had expired on 27 May 2000. The two break enter and steal counts were committed on 5 and 6 June 2000. His Honour identified the earliest offence as occurring on 5 May 2000, and if his Honour was in error, that does not appear in the materials before us. However, it must have been a reference to property, the subject of one of the receiving counts. One of those counts referred to property received on 5 June 2000. However, property was found relating to break enter and steal offences which had occurred, according to his Honour's judgment, over the previous two weeks. His Honour’s inference was that the date on which the property had been received by the Respondent from one of these offences was 5 May 2000. 
      
       
     7    Accordingly, the circumstance of committing a further offence whilst on conditional liberty is an aggravating aspect, if the facts were as his Honour put it, only for one of the receiving counts. It is not an aggravating aspect for either of the break enter and steal counts. As the latter are the more serious charges, it will not be, in any event, a significant factor. His Honour’s failure to comply with the requirement to identify sentences separately for each offence, in accordance with the High Court's authority in Pearce, is manifest in his Honour’s statement that he would take this matter into account as an aggravating feature with respect to all of the offences. 
      
       
     8    The Court retains a discretion, notwithstanding the identification of the error, to refrain from intervening. Whether it should intervene in this respect is, of course, subject to the well-known restrictions on the circumstances in which Crown appeals should be upheld. 
      
       
     9    The two counts of break enter and steal occurred at Bulli and Coledale on 5 June 2000 and 6 June 2000 respectively. On each occasion, the modus operandi was the same. The Respondent drove a co-offender, Benjamin Watego, to the respective residential premises. He entered the premises while she remained as a lookout. The Respondent then drove the vehicle away. During the offence at Bulli, the two offenders were disturbed and only succeeded in removing jewellery. A significant quantity of electrical items, which had been placed near the garage, was left behind. After the offence at Coledale, the police stopped the car and discovered a quantity of stolen electrical items in the boot and on the back seat. They arrested both the Respondent and Watego. 
      
       
     10    During the course of a search executed on 6 June 2000 at the Respondent’s home, the police discovered property that had been stolen on other occasions. These were the subject of the three counts of receiving. With respect to a video camera, it appears that the co-offender Watego had taken that item of property whilst the Respondent and Watego were present at a house in Thirroul on 5 June 2000. The Respondent asserted that it was taken without her knowledge, but when she received it from Watego, she knew that it was stolen. In addition, property from a number of other break and enter offences, which had occurred, it appears, over some previous period, about two weeks, was discovered at her home. 
      
       
     11    The Respondent is now 36 years of age. A significant factor in the exercise of the sentencing discretion was the long list of previous convictions dating back to 1982. These included one count of break enter and steal, for which she was sentenced to six months in April 1987; a series of offences including one count of break enter and steal and a count of stealing for which she was sentenced to a fixed term of three months commencing on 7 June 1990; a conviction of stealing and other counts on 5 December 1994 for which she received 150 hours of community service; a conviction for a range of offences including twelve counts of break enter and steal, four counts of obtaining financial benefit by deception and counts of receiving and of stealing for which she was sentenced to a minimum term of twelve months commencing on 26 September 1995 and an additional term of four months; a conviction on three charges of break enter and steal for which she received a minimum term of sixteen months to commence on 2 May 1997 and an additional term with conditions of twenty months. 
      
       
     12    It has long been recognised that prior convictions must be taken into account on sentencing for property offences. This has specifically been applied to the offence of break enter and steal in this Court's guideline judgment with respect to the offence. (See Re Attorney General's Application (No 1); R v Ponfield supra). 
      
       
     13    The objective circumstances of the offence, in the context of this record of persistent infringement, was such that, subject to subjective considerations and having regard to s5 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999, only a full-time custodial sentence can be regarded as appropriate in the circumstances of this case. 
      
       
     14    Over a long course of criminal conduct the Respondent has shown complete disrespect for her fellow citizens and their property. She has intruded on the privacy of the homes of her fellow citizens in a persistent and determined course which has inflicted substantial justifiable anguish and suffering on many members of the community. Only the most compelling of subjective cases could, after a history of this character, have led to a non-custodial sentence for the offences for which she stood charged on this occasion. 
      
       
     15    His Honour had very little material upon which to assess the subjective features of the Respondent. She gave no evidence. There was a pre-sentence report of limited scope. A number of assertions were made from the bar table. 
      
       
     16    The substance of his Honour’s reasons for affording a degree of leniency are set out in his reasons as follows:  
      
       
        
         
         “I do however feel that it is appropriate in the present case to come to the conclusion that she was not in real ethical content as criminally liable as the co-offender. It does seem that he was more of a moving party than she. She had been mixing with a number of undesirable associates for some time, and in fact she was anxious to disassociate herself from them and so anxious that she even initially was proposing to move out of an area where she would be eligible for alternatives to full time custody. 
         
        
        
         
         The pre-sentence report when her life time history indicates that she is a follower and not a leader, and that she has had a fairly stressed life and from her earliest years when her upbringing was marred by severe emotional deprivation, her later years have been characterised by frequent conflict with undesirable associates. Her own assessment of things extracted by the probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report is that she has feelings of being trapped and powerless in relationships and that her routine method of extricating herself from a relationship is to go along with illegal activity, thereby getting herself back into gaol where she can sort herself out. That is a combination of the pre-sentence report and what Mr Haesler has put after his conference with her and the probation officer. 
         
        
        
         
         She has received a very sympathetic report from the probation officer and the Court places considerable reliance on those without abandoning its own obligations to form an independent view, and once again that comes not only from the pre-sentence report itself which is clearly favourable, but also from the statements of Mr Haesler as to that conference which I mentioned a moment ago and where I accept what he puts. Miss Harrison had to be talked out of simply abandoning herself back into gaol again and encouraged to live in an area where she could be eligible for periodic detention. I observe that Mr Haesler informed her that there was by no means any assurance that that was likely to be the result. But simply he was making her eligible or informing her of ways in which she could be eligible for the alternative. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         She has three children aged fourteen, seven and six, and although she has her long history of convictions and custody her instructions to Mr Haesler this time are that she's never been so ashamed of the behaviour that she has recently exhibited when she feels that it is now gravely affecting her two younger children. Again, although that is not given on oath, I am prepared to give recognition to that statement from the bar table when I look at the pre-sentence report. There is also a measure of persuasion coming from her age, an age when the court is accustomed to persons with criminal histories finally wishing to make something out of their lives.” 
         
        
       
     17    As can be seen, his Honour relied on the pre-sentence report which he described as “very sympathetic” and “clearly favourable”. In addition, there were submissions put to him on instructions, particularly relating to the decision of the Respondent not to move from Wollongong to Braidwood. It appears that persons residing in Braidwood are not able to be accommodated in the periodic detention program. 
      
       
     18    In addition to whatever was put by Mr Haesler on instructions to his Honour, the issue is considered in the original pre-sentence report of 19 October 2000 and in an updated report of 20 October 2000. The latter indicated that as the Respondent no longer planned to move to Braidwood, therefore, alternatives to full-time custody became available. 
      
       
     19    The basis of his Honour’s reference to the Respondent wishing to be placed in custody is set out in the first pre-sentence report under the heading “Drug Usage” as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The offender has had a dependency on heroin since the age of fourteen. During current pre-sentence inquiries the offender revealed her pattern of engaging in heroin usage to block the above mentioned feelings of powerlessness which she experiences in her relationships. Paradoxically, by engaging in a behaviour which she cannot control she exacerbates those feelings and claimed to commit offences in order to be placed into custody where she can break from her addiction and partner. Ms Harrison indicated that this was the reason behind her current offences.” 
         
        
       
     20    His Honour concluded that the original intention to move to Braidwood was for the somewhat perverse purpose of avoiding the possibility that the Court could exercise leniency in her favour and sentence her to either periodic detention or to serving a community sentence order. It appears that his Honour made such a finding on what was put to him from the bar table. His Honour ought not to have done so. 
      
       
     21    The pre-sentence report, which was the only evidence before him in this respect, contradicts the proposition. The report states: 
      
       
        
         
         “The offender revealed that one of the major reasons behind her projected move from Wollongong were threats on her life from co-offenders.” 
         
        
       
     22    Furthermore, under the heading of “Periodic Detention Orders” the report said: 
      
       
        
         
         ”Ms Harrison declined to be assessed for periodic detention as she stated that she wanted to spend any free time at the weekends with her children.” 
         
        
       
     23    Similarly under the heading of “Community Service Orders” the report said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The offender stated that as she planned to be working seven days per week she would have no time available for community service work.” 
         
        
       
     24    The updated pre-sentence report indicated that she no longer intended to move to Braidwood and that she did wish to be assessed for periodic detention and community service orders. 
      
       
     25    His Honour had no proper basis for inferring that the reason why she had earlier refused to be assessed for alternatives to a full-time custodial sentence was because of a desire to be placed in custody in order to break from her addiction and partner. The reasons she gave to the probation officer for declining to be assessed for a periodic detention or for a community service order were inconsistent with any such proposition. They suggested an objective of being released on recognisance, no doubt relying on the fact that she had two dependent children. 
      
       
     26    The references in the pre-sentence report are not entirely reconcilable or logical. Nevertheless, this only highlights the inappropriateness of his Honour relying, as his Honour appears to have done, on assertions from the bar table. 
      
       
     27    His Honour also relied to a substantial extent on the pre-sentence report which, as I have noted, he described as “very sympathetic” and “clearly favourable”. I am unable to agree with his Honour that the report can appropriately be so classified. 
      
       
     28    The first thing to notice about the report is that it refers to the Respondent having been under supervision briefly pursuant to a parole order in Western Australia. However, that order was revoked because of the commission of further offences in that State. It says that she returned to Western Australia to serve the ten month balance of an additional term. There is no other information before the Court as to her pattern of offending in Western Australia. Nevertheless, it indicates that the history with respect to prior convictions is even worse than appears from the record tendered before his Honour with respect to New South Wales offences. 
      
       
     29    The effect of his Honour’s reasoning was a conclusion that the Respondent was at a “cross roads” in her life which justified extending leniency, notwithstanding the objective circumstances of the offences and the long list of prior convictions. The classic statement of this principle is to be found in the judgment of King CJ in the Supreme Court of South Australia in the case of R v Osenkowski (1982) 30 SASR 212 at 212-213, which has frequently been referred to in this Court. 
      
       
     30    Moore DCJ said in a crucial passage of his reasons on sentence: 
      
       
        
         
         “I do feel that this is a matter where one must make a firm decision either to have a substantial period of imprisonment or to exercise the type of leniency which is recognised for example in  
         Osenkowski 
          in South Australia and  
         Hall  
         in New South Wales. I stress that this is absolutely an unusual way of dealing with a sentence of this nature where the objective features are so serious, objective features not only as to the crime itself but as to the criminal history.” 
         
        
       
     31    The issue for this Court is whether or not it was open for his Honour to make a finding that leniency of this character should be afforded to the Appellant. In my opinion, it was not open to his Honour to so find. Accordingly, the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
     32    As indicated in the lengthy passage of his reasons quoted above, his Honour primarily relied in this regard on statements made from the bar table on instructions, to the effect that the Respondent had “never been so ashamed” of her behaviour and she felt it was “now gravely affecting her two young children”. His Honour indicated that there was “a measure of persuasion” in this regard coming from her age of about 36, his Honour finding that to be an age of which persons reach such a “cross roads”. It may be that some persons who reach their mid 30’s, after a life time of offending, come to a cross roads in the relevant sense. That does not mean that anybody at that age has reached such a cross roads. His Honour’s acceptance of the submissions from the bar table was influenced by the pre-sentence report. His Honour did not identify any part of the pre-sentence report on which he relied in this respect. I am not able to identify any part which justifies a conclusion of this character. 
      
       
     33    It may be that his Honour had in mind the passage of the report which identified the problem expressed to the Probation and Parole Officer by the Respondent, together with the statement in the report that she had recognised the problem. 
      
       
     34    The first passage was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Ms Harrison stated that her interpersonal relationships have been characterised by emotional abuse. She claimed that her partners have all attempted to dominate her and when she attempts to end these relationships her partners would not allow her to do so. This results in feelings of being trapped and powerless which she is unable to express effectively”. 
         
        
       
     35    In the concluding summary part of the report the officer said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Ms Harrison seems to have engaged in heroin abuse and offending in order to assist her in dealing with and subsequently severing emotional attachments. It would appear that she had not previously revealed the issues underlying her drug usage and has not made attempts to deal with these issues because of her perception that therapy would make no impact on such an ingrained pattern of behaviour.” 
         
        
       
     36    This, in my opinion, is an entirely inadequate basis for any conclusion to the effect that Ms Harrison was at a cross roads in her life. 
      
       
     37    The only aspects of the report that appear to me to be relevant to this question is the fact that in January 2000, after dependency of heroin dating back to the age of 14, Ms Harrison had entered a methadone program. However, it was noted that notwithstanding her attendance at the program, two urine samples had tested positive to morphine and codeine. 
      
       
     38    In my opinion, there was no evidence on the basis of which it was open to his Honour to find that Ms Harrison was at a point of time in her life where extending leniency, rather than imposing punishment, would be more likely to lead to rehabilitation than earlier in her career and that, accordingly, the interests of the community would be best served by giving less weight than would otherwise be appropriate to the objective gravity of the offence. In my opinion there was an inadequate foundation in the evidence for drawing any such conclusion. 
      
       
     39    The Respondent filed an affidavit in this Court indicating that she had been studying at TAFE with a view to becoming a seed collector. She noted that her youngest children, aged seven and eight, lived with her and were attending a local school and that if she was sent to gaol her children would have to change schools again. She refers to her Housing Commission location. 
      
       
     40    For the first time, she gave evidence of a change in her conduct in the following form: 
      
       
        
         
         “Since prior to being sentenced I changed the people I associate with, I have maintained this and spend most of my time with my children and with an elderly lady in my neighbourhood.” 
         
        
       
     41    She also purported to advance an explanation for her failure to give evidence before Moore DCJ in terms of her feeling scared and distressed, by reason of the presence in the courtroom of a number of what she described as “my previous associates”, together with the fact that she had said goodbyes to her family, including her children. 
      
       
     42    She also indicated in the affidavit that she had continued to take methadone, was reducing her dosage and that urine sample tests had been negative. She concluded her affidavit with the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “When I was sentenced I felt that I had been given a chance to stay with my children and make a better life for all of us. I have embraced this chance and done everything in my power to complete the weekend detention set for me and to stay out of all further trouble. I am achieving these goals and would really like a chance to continue.” 
         
        
       
     43    Accordingly, in this Court there is some evidence of a change in lifestyle. It remains, however, a wholly inadequate foundation for an inference that the interests of the community would be best served by giving so persistent an offender yet another chance to reform. 
      
       
     44    The affidavit consists of self-interested assertions of a character which makes them almost impossible to check or test, particularly when served the day before the hearing. In the absence of any independent verification of her alleged behaviour, state of mind or of tangible expression of contrition, (there is not even an expression of remorse, albeit such would often appear glib), to treat this evidence with anything but scepticism would represent a triumph of hope over experience. 
      
       
     45    There is, in my opinion, taking into account s5 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999, no basis on which a non-custodial sentence can be justified in this case. 
      
       
     46    In the course of his remarks on sentence, Moore DCJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “One must be very careful not to be swayed by sympathy in cases of this nature, and especially where it may be that in passing a sentence which is, if it were to turn out to be unduly sympathetic, could result in false hopes to the offender, being dashed if the matter is corrected on appeal.” 
         
        
       
     47    His Honour’s reference to such “false hopes” may very well be a reference to earlier remarks in this Court on appeal from other judgements of his Honour. 
      
       
     48    In R v Horne [1999] NSWCCA 391 in a Crown appeal from a sentence by his Honour in which his Honour had not paid regard to this Court's guideline judgment on armed robbery offences in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, Mason P said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Judges who turn the blind eye to an applicable guideline judgment must realise that a Crown appeal is very likely to succeed, with the consequence that the offender is placed into custody or returned to custody. The hardship that this imposes upon a young offender is manifest yet it is a necessary consequence of giving effect to proper sentencing principles. Misguided judicial kindness thus becomes unintended cruelty.” 
         
        
       
     49    To similar effect are the observations of Grove J in R v Webster [1999] NSWCCA 313, a case in which Moore DCJ, in purported accord with this Court’s guideline judgment in R v Henry supra imposed a four-year term for an offence of armed robbery, but it was comprised of a minimum term of only six months with an additional term of three and a half years. By the time the matter came to the Court of Criminal Appeal the offender had served the minimum term. Grove J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It will be a distasteful task for this Court to recommit a young man to prison in the circumstances which were outlined in the preceding judgment. The necessity to do so is as a direct result of the failure of the District Court to discharge its clear duty to impose a sentence which was compatible with recognisable and well established principle and guidelines. The sentence imposed at first instance was, so far as the calculation of the minimum term component was concerned, I regret to say a departure from the expected standards of the responsible exercise of jurisdiction.” 
         
        
       
     50    The Court now finds itself again in the position where the wholly unjustified expectation induced by the inadequacy of a sentence imposed by Moore DCJ will exacerbate the impact of incarceration upon a Respondent. 
      
       
     51    I have identified eighteen Crown appeals from sentences imposed by Moore DCJ over the course of the last five years. Eleven of such appeals were allowed (R v Field (NSWCCA, 2 May 1996, unreported); R v Hood (NSWCCA, 9 July 1997, unreported); R v Eldridge (NSWCCA, 22 April 1998, unreported); R v Cooper (NSWCCA, 13 July 1998, unreported); R v Galway (1998) 103 ACrimR 35; R v Douglas (1998) 29 MVR 316; R v Webster [1999] NSWCCA 313; R v Khamas (1999) 108 ACrimR 499; R v Mastronardi (2000) 111 ACrimR 306; R v Lilley (2000) 111 ACrimR 468; R v King [2001] NSWCCA 18. 
      
       
     52    Furthermore, six appeals were dismissed in the exercise of the residual discretion of the Court with respect to Crown appeals. In five of those cases the Crown expressly found that the sentence was inadequate (R v L (NSWCCA, 17 June 1996, unreported); R v Gitt (NSWCCA, 18 May 1998, unreported); R v Cacciola (1998) 104 ACrimR 178; R v Horne [1999] NSWCCA 391; R v Taylor [2000] NSWCCA 442). In one case in which the Court dismissed the Crown appeal in the exercise of its residual discretion, no view was expressed as to the correctness or otherwise of the sentence (R v DWD (NSWCCA, 2 March 1998, unreported). In one case the Crown appeal against sentence was dismissed (R v Yerkovic [2000] NSWCCA 281). 
      
       
     53    In the light of this pattern of leniency it is necessary to treat with circumspection the submission of the Respondent that the Court should approach a Crown appeal from his Honour on the basis of the authorities that indicate that such appeals should be rare. 
      
       
     54    Nothing in the subjective circumstances that have been presented to this Court suggest that anything other than a full-time custodial sentence is appropriate, given the objective criminality of these offences in the context of the sustained history of criminal behaviour by the Respondent. 
      
       
     55    The pre-sentence report and the Respondent’s affidavit do indicate an attempt to escape from her dependence on heroin and a new perception that therapy may assist her to avoid involvement in abusive relationships. I accept that this may justify a longer than usual period of supervision. I accordingly find that there are special circumstances in this case. 
      
       
     56    The Respondent pleaded guilty. That has a significant utilitarian value. She admitted guilt immediately upon her arrest and entered the plea at the earliest possible opportunity. It has no further value as there is no suggestion anywhere in the materials of contrition on her part. But for the plea, I would have been minded to impose a head sentence of four years, but I reduce that to three years. Her co-offender who, it appears, was to some extent more culpable, was sentenced to three years and nine months with a non-parole period of two years and nine months. Furthermore, I propose to backdate the sentence to commence from the original date so that for a period of some months she will have been serving a custodial sentence by way of periodic detention. 
      
       
     57    There are no distinguishing features between the two break enter and steal counts or amongst the three receiving counts. Nevertheless, there is a significant difference between the two sets of counts. In the light of the sentence I propose for the break enter and steal counts, a fixed term is appropriate for the receiving counts. I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1 Appeal allowed. 
        
       2 Sentence imposed by Moore DCJ on 20 October 2000 is quashed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
     The appellant was convicted of one count of aggravated break and enter and commit a robbery and one count of robbery in company. He was sentenced to eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years for the first count and to a concurrent fixed term of imprisonment for four years in relation to the second count. The appellant appeals against the conviction under s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on the ground that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence. Proof of finding the appellant’s fingerprints and palmprint on the doors of the house and their recency was crucial to the Crown case. The appellant argued that the prints had been left there by him on the occasion of a lawful visit to the house more than nine months before the robbery. The evidence given by the owner of the house and by her son as to the regular cleaning of the doors, in a way that would have removed the appellant’s fingerprints had they been deposited at the time he suggested, was lacking in credibility. On this basis the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. Held: (Appeal dismissed and conviction and sentence confirmed):Ground 1: Verdict of the jury unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidenceThis is a case which depended entirely upon an assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and particularly on matters such as demeanour, which the jury were best placed to judge. The Jury had a distinct advantage over the Court of Criminal Appeal in that they saw and heard witnesses and were able to make their own impression of them. A doubt of relevant kind was not established. Jones v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 48 distinguished.

       JUDGMENT 
       
        
     1   WOOD CJ AT CL: On 19 July 2000 the appellant was convicted, after a trial before Sides DCJ and a jury, of one count of aggravated break and enter and commit a robbery and one count of robbery in company. He was sentenced in relation to the first count to imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of four years, and to a concurrent fixed term of imprisonment for four years in relation to the second count. 
     2   He now appeals against these convictions upon the single ground arising under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) namely, that the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence. 
      
       
      The Evidence 
       
     3   On the night of 10 September 1998, Mrs Ha Thy Nguyen went to bed in her house at 42 Silverwater Crescent, Lansvale. She locked all the doors of the house but neglected to activate the security alarm. She was awoken some time time later by a loud banging on her bedroom door. She heard someone shouting in Vietnamese, ""open the door, open the door. I need to take your money"". She tried to contact a neighbour using her mobile phone. Whilst speaking to him, the door was slammed vigorously before being pushed open.  
     4   An intruder, whose face was covered, entered and asked where her money was. He was armed with a steering wheel lock or similar implement. She replied that all of her money had been previously robbed, there having been such an event at her home in 1996. The intruder ransacked her room, taking a wallet containing her credit cards, five bags and a school bag. These facts gave rise to Count 1. 
     5   In the course of these events, Mrs Nguyen yelled out to her adopted son Cuong. Cuong, who was alerted by this cry for help, unlocked his door and saw two men whose faces were covered standing outside the bedroom door of Mrs Nguyen. They appeared to be hitting the door with a steering wheel lock and to be speaking in Vietnamese. He closed his door but when he reopened it in response to Mrs Nguyen's continuing calls for help, he was struck on the back by one of the two intruders. Demands were made of him as to where the money was. 
     6   Mrs Nguyen, at this point, ran from the house and went to the home of a neighbour to raise the alarm. One of the two intruders went into Cuong's room. They both fled when the alarm from the neighbour's house was activated. Cuong later discovered that $800 in cash had been stolen from the wallet that he kept in his bedroom. These facts gave rise to Count 2. 
     7   Police attended the scene and found that damage had been occasioned to the front external door and to the door to Mrs Nguyen's bedroom. That room had been obviously ransacked. Detective Kirby gave evidence that he had located three fingerprints on the bedroom door which were identical with the fingerprints of the appellant. He also found a palmprint just below those fingerprints that was also identical with the print of the appellant's left palm. 
     8   As a result of the absence of any admissions from the appellant, who declined to participate in an interview with police, and as a result of the inability of the victims to see the faces of either of the intruders, or to identify them otherwise than by reference to the fact that they were speaking in Vietnamese, proof of the finding of the fingerprints and of the palmprint and of their recency was crucial to the Crown case. This was made abundantly clear to the jury in the summing-up. 
     9   It was the case for the appellant, who gave evidence in the trial, that he had visited the house on about three occasions before the offences, as a guest of Mrs Nguyen's son Nam. On one such occasion, but on only one such occasion, he said that he had gone upstairs, with Nam's permission, to change out of some wet clothing. This had occurred when they returned to the house after jet skiing on a lake across the road. On this occasion he said that he had tried a couple of doors before finding a room that was unlocked in which he could change.  
     10   It was his evidence that he had met Mrs Nguyen briefly on one occasion and that he had been introduced to Cuong once at the home, and again at a nightclub. This aspect of his evidence was, however, disputed by each of those witnesses. The appellant also gave evidence of the layout of the house and of its contents, and spoke of his knowledge that Nam had owned a yellow 800 CC jet ski. 
     11   A man, Tuan Luu, gave evidence that the appellant had in fact been a friend of Nam and that he had seen him at Mrs Nguyen's house. Tuan Luu, it was established, had been living with Nam at Canley Heights before the departure of the latter for Vietnam. Immigration records disclose that Nam had left for that country on 27 November 1997 and had not returned to Australia after that date.  
     12   Accordingly, if the explanation offered by the appellant, for the presence of his fingerprints and palm print on the bedroom door, was to be of any practical assistance to him, his visit to the house on the occasion of the jet skiing had to precede that date, and to leave open at least a reasonable possibility that he had left prints on the door that had endured until the time of the offences. 
     13   Detective Kirby acknowledged that forensic investigative techniques could not date the prints. The chemical composition of a fingerprint, he explained, was an important factor in determining its durability. An oil or sebaceous-based print, he said, lasts a lot longer than a water-based print, while those exposed to the elements tend to last for a lesser time than those that are not so exposed. He also acknowledged that there had been reported cases of fingerprints being found two years after contact, and that prints left on glossy surfaces, such as a door, could last for longer than two years. 
     14   Critically, for the present case, Det Kirby said that wiping a surface on which a print has been left with water or a cleaning agent would remove it, although dusting would not necessarily do so. It is upon this last-mentioned aspect that this appeal turns because of Mrs Nguyen's evidence that she cleaned all of the doors and windows of the house each weekend.  
     15   The process of cleaning she described as one that involved dusting the wooden surfaces, spraying them with a special product and then, after thirty seconds or so, wiping them clean with a cloth. She said that she was accustomed to using a ladder to reach the higher points of the doors and windows. It was her evidence that the cleaning of the house occupied a good part of one day and that, whilst she attended to the doors and windows, Cuong cleaned the bathrooms. She added that she would not allow Nam's friends to go upstairs in her house to get changed, although she acknowledged that she was not at home all the time. 
     16   Her evidence as to the cleaning of the doors and windows was challenged upon the basis that, as a busy and wealthy person who ran a business employing up to ten people, it was improbable that she would do this kind of work herself, and upon the further basis or that she would not be so fastidious or obsessive as to do it religiously every weekend, particularly if the home was occupied only by herself and Cuong or if the upstairs area was excluded to outsiders.  
     17   It was also suggested that she had not told the truth when asserting that she did not have the money to pay for a cleaner, and that her evidence was, in some respects, inconsistent with that of Cuong. While Cuong did confirm that he and Mrs Nguyen cleaned the house, usually on a weekend and that it would take about a day to do so, he said that the doors were not always cleaned. Their cleaning, he said, occurred when they were dirty, sometimes once a week but otherwise every two or three weeks. He also said that the cleaning process involved applying a liquid spray to a cloth and then wiping the door with it, and using a feather duster to remove any dust. According to him, Mrs Nguyen used a chair or something else to reach high places on the windows or doors. 
      
       
      Was the conviction unreasonable or unsupportable upon the evidence?  
       
     18   When directing the jury as to the pivotal point in the Crown case, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
        ""Crucial to the Crown case is the evidence about the regular cleaning of the door. That circumstance is critical to the Crown case. It is a critical link in the chain of the Crown case. You could not find the accused was present participating in the joint criminal enterprise unless you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the honesty and reliability of the evidence about the regular cleaning of the door"". 
        
       
        
     19   This direction was, in a sense, unduly favourable to the appellant. As I have observed, it was his case that the prints had been left on the door at some date before 27 November 1997. Since it was accepted that he had not been to the house in the company of Nam after that date, the Crown, in fact, did not have to go so far as proving that the door had been cleaned every weekend, or even that the door had been regularly cleaned after that date. It would have been sufficient for it to prove that the bedroom door had been cleaned at least once after 27 November 1997 using the process described either by Mrs Nguyen or by Cuong. 
     20   The point sought to be made upon appeal, however, was that the acceptance and non acceptance of the truth of her evidence, as to whether she cleaned the door as regularly as she claimed, was important for an assessment of her credibility. Hence, it was a matter to be taken into account in determining whether the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. 
     21   The assessment of her evidence, as well as that of Cuong, was quintessentially a matter for the jury, who were also entitled to bring to the matter their commonsense, and their experience of life as to what might have been expected in relation to house-cleaning in the domestic circumstances in question (see Mitchell (2000) NSW CCA 188 per Sperling J para 41). 
     22   I am not persuaded that the suggested inconsistencies between the evidence Mrs Nguyen gave and that given by Cuong were of any great moment, or that there was any reason to doubt that the doors and windows were cleaned on at least a regular basis between November 1997 and the time of the offence. Whether Mrs Nguyen stood on a chair or on some other object to reach the upper levels, and whether the sequence followed in the dusting and cleaning process was that described by her or by Cuong appear to me to be matters of little consequence. 
     23   Similarly, I am unpersuaded that it is improbable that a home owner who is house-proud would clean windows and doors on a regular basis, or that a person who has financial means would inevitably pay someone else to do that kind of work. Mrs Nguyen's evidence as to being unable to afford a cleaner to do the inside of the house is not, to my mind, incapable of acceptance. Such a matter no doubt depends upon personal priorities as to expenditure, and it is to be considered also in the light of her evidence that she did employ people to clean the exterior glass.  
     24   Moreover, I am unable to see any real significance in the cross-examination of Mrs Nguyen in relation to whether the door had been replaced and cleaned after the first robbery, or in relation to her recollection as to whether Nam had left to go to Vietnam before or after its replacement. 
     25   The explanation she gave as to an earlier incorrect statement that Nam had left Australia before the door was replaced may well have been based upon difficulties with translation, a circumstance in fact corroborated by the difficulty which police said they had in obtaining a statement from her. Moreover, it is the fact that Nam made several trips to Vietnam between January 1996 and November 1997. 
     26   The remaining matters relied upon as throwing doubt upon her credibility also do not, to my mind, take the matter any further. For example, the nature and source of the brown smudges evident upon the rear laundry door, which appear in the photograph tendered in the trial, are ambiguous. Whether they were present before the robbery, or whether they were placed upon the door in the course of forensic testing, is not evident. Other possibilities do arise, including the possibility that they were marks left by the family dog and the possibility that they were marks which were not removable by the cleaning process.  
     27   In substance, what was missing in this regard was evidence that the marks were dirt marks that had been present before the offences. In that regard, it is not unimportant that similar brown marks can be seen upon the light switch, which clearly were the result of forensic testing. What is also important is the fact that the photographs of the bedroom door, which were also tendered in evidence, do not show any similar brown marks or signs of dust. 
     28   Additionally, it seems to me improbable in the extreme that a palm print or fingerprint placed on a door, used as frequently as a bedroom door, would not have been covered over many times by prints deposited upon that door by others, over the period of at least nine months between Nam's departure from Vietnam, and the date of the offences with which this trial was concerned. 
     29   The test to be applied in relation to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is now well settled by the decisions in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487; Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439; Gipp v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106; Fleming (1998) 197 CLR 250 and Giam No 2 (1999) 109 A Crim R 348. 
     30    As was observed by Mason CJ, Deane and Toohey JJ in M: 
      
       
        
         
        ""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" (See  
        Whitehorn v the Queen 
         (1983) 152 CLR 686; 
         Chamberlain v the Queen 
         [No 2] (1984) 153 CLR 532; 
         Knight v the Queen 
         (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 504-505; 511).  
        
       
     31   But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. (Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] (1984) 153 CLR 621). 
     32   Later their honours observed: 
      
       
        
        ""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and set aside a verdict based upon that evidence"". ( 
        Chamberlain v the Queen 
         [No 2] (1984) 153 CLR at 618-619; 
         Chidiac v the Queen 
         (1991) 171 CLR 432 at 443-444). 
        
       
        
     33    In Jones, Brennan CJ referred to the basic principle upon which the function of an appellate court is determined, when considering this ground of appeal, namely that it is the jury which is the ""constitutional arbiter of guilt"" (at p 442). His Honour continued: 
      
       
        
         
        ""An equation between a reasonable doubt entertained by a court of criminal appeal and a doubt which ought to have been entertained by a reasonable jury is valid only if the capacity for evaluating the cogency of a witness's evidence and the worldly wisdom of a court of criminal appeal are no less than the collective endowments of a jury."" 
        
       
       
        
       
     34    In the same case, Kirby J observed (at 94): 
      
       
        
         ""The conventional assumption of the trial system in Australia, in both civil and criminal trials, is that the evaluation of truth telling is ordinarily to be performed by the tribunal of fact. It is that tribunal which sees witnesses and hears the entirety of the trial whereas the Appellate Court typically reads transcript and is taken by the parties to selected parts of the evidence, commonly read out of sequence, as the extracts seem best suited of supporting their respective arguments."" 
        
       
     35   These observations have particular relevance for this appeal. The present is a case where the attention of the jury was focused by the summing-up upon a single critical issue - whether the door had been cleaned after 27 November 1997 in a way that would inevitably have removed any fingerprints or palm prints placed upon it before that date. It is a case which depended entirely upon an assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and particularly on matters such as demeanour, which the jury were best placed to judge. (See Mayberry (2000) NSW CCA 531 at para 137). 
     36   In each of those respects, the jurors had a distinct advantage over the members of this court in that they saw and heard the witnesses and were best able to make their own impression of them. To my mind, nothing has been shown which points to the conclusion that the evidence of the two critical witnesses, which were substantially corroborative of each other, lacked probative force or was otherwise tainted. The case is not one, to my mind, equivalent to Jones where the jury could be safely assumed to have disbelieved the critical witness on one aspect, yet believed her on others. This is a case clearly where the critical witnesses were believed. 
     37   In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that a doubt of the relevant kind has been established. I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the conviction and sentence below.38   IPP AJA: I agree39   SIMPSON J: I also agree.40   IPP AJA: The order of the court will be as Wood J as indicated.

        REGINA v Robert John PARIS 
        
       
      
      
        
      Judgment 
      
      
       
       SIMPSON J :  
        
       
     1    On 4 December 2000 the defendant pleaded guilty to a charge that, between 3 and 4 August 1999, he threatened to use offensive weapons with intent to prevent a member of the police force from investigating an act or circumstance that reasonably called for police investigation. He asked that two counts of assault be taken into account pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"".) 
      
       
     2    The charge on the indictment was laid under s 33B of the Crimes Act 1900, which imposes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twelve years for the offence. Pursuant to s 10 of the Sentencing Procedure Act Goldring DCJ discharged the respondent on condition that he enter into a bond for a period of two years, further conditioned upon the respondent, during the currency of the bond, appearing before the court if called upon to do so at any time, being of good behaviour, and advising the clerk of the court of any change in his residential address. The Crown appeals against the asserted leniency of the sentence. 
      
       
     3    The offence arose out of serious matrimonial discord between the respondent and his wife, Mrs Anna Paris. The accused lived with his wife and two children in Narooma. There were conflicting accounts given by the respondent and his wife of what had preceded the events of 3 and 4 August, and particularly what had occurred in the 24 hours or so before 3 August, which was a Tuesday. In a statement tendered to the court Mrs Paris accused her husband of physically attacking her while they were in bed on the morning of Sunday 1 August; again on the morning of Monday 2 August and of threatening in the early hours of Tuesday 3 August to kill himself and the children. 
      
       
     4    In an interview on 4 August the respondent claimed that his wife had assaulted him and that he had responded in self-defence by kicking her out of bed. The sentencing Judge did not attempt to resolve these factual issues. It was not necessary for him to do so. 
      
       
     5    The respondent wrote a note which he attached to a cushion which, in turn, he hung on the door knob of the main bedroom. By this time he was the sole occupant of the bedroom. His wife was sleeping in the bedroom of one of the children. The note clearly suggested that the respondent had committed suicide. Early on Tuesday morning Mrs Paris read the note and drew the intended inference. She called out to the respondent but he did not answer. She telephoned her sister and two friends who arrived shortly after. One friend took the children away, the other telephoned police. They opened the bedroom door. The respondent was lying motionless on the bed, but his eyes were flickering. One of Mrs Paris's friends shook him but he did not respond. There was another note on the bed, also indicating that the respondent had committed or attempted to commit suicide. 
      
       
     6    Shortly after 8.20 am an ambulance officer arrived and entered the bedroom with an oxygen container. As he placed the container on the bed the respondent jumped up and shouted at him to leave. He rummaged under the mattress and produced a piece of wood about a foot long which he waved at the ambulance officer, ordering him out of the house. 
      
       
     7    Another ambulance officer arrived, followed by police. The respondent emerged from the house and stood at the verandah, with his hands behind his back. He then produced a knife which he pointed towards police, using threatening language. He re-entered the house. Police asked him to come to the door but he told them to leave him alone. He shouted at them, again intimating that he was going to kill himself. He continued to hold a large knife. Police treated the incident as a siege. They surrounded the house. They continued to attempt to communicate with the respondent. They cut off the electricity supply and a telephone line. However, as the respondent was a member of the local fire brigade and captain of it, an additional line linked with the fire station had been connected to his home. This was not disconnected. The respondent used the telephone line to maintain communication with police and with others. He made a number of telephone calls, some to local journalists and several to an inspector of police. He threatened to shoot police at his house. 
      
       
     8    The siege continued during the whole of the night. Police negotiators maintained contact with the respondent by repeatedly telephoning him and engaging him in conversation. He participated in these conversations but frequently abruptly terminated the calls. He continued to threaten to harm himself and also threatened to shoot or otherwise harm police. He claimed to be in possession of a double-barrelled shotgun (which later proved to be untrue) and of nine molotov cocktails (which proved to be only partly true: he had two bottles, one containing mineral turpentine and one containing methylated spirits, each fitted with a wick such as to transform the bottles of liquid into explosive devices). He threatened to ignite these. He also made a threat directed to the children of one of the negotiators. All conversations between the respondent and the negotiators were recorded and the transcripts were in evidence. They show, among other things, that the respondent repeatedly asked for the electricity supply to be restored. He was firmly told that this would not happen. 
      
       
     9    The respondent eventually emerged from the house at 9.32 am on Wednesday 4 August. He complied with police instructions to lie on the ground and was arrested. Police asked the respondent if there was any danger to any person entering the house but he declined to give any such information. On entering the premises, police found the two homemade bombs but no evidence of any firearms. 
      
       
     10    The respondent remained in custody until 25 August 1999 (that is, exactly three weeks) when conditional bail was granted. 
      
       
     11    Within two hours of his arrest the respondent was interviewed by police, and the interview was electronically recorded. He claimed to have no recollection of the events of Tuesday morning until the time when he made a cup of coffee, looked outside, and saw that the house was surrounded by police. He claimed to have no recollection of making any threats to or against any person. He said that the bottles of flammable fluid had been prepared with a view to burning off some garden refuse later in the day. 
      
       
     12    The respondent entered his plea of guilty on the morning of 4 December, which appears to have been the day fixed for trial. During the sentencing hearing the following subjective matters emerged. The respondent was born on 15 January 1960. He was, accordingly, 39 years of age at the time of the offence. He gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings of a troubled early life. He was the eldest of four children. Family life had been reasonably happy until, when the respondent was 8 or 9 years of age, his parents separated. His mother took up employment and the respondent became responsible for looking after the younger children. 
      
       
     13    A year or two later the respondent's mother formed a relationship with another man who the respondent described as a ""moronic maniac"", who used violence as his principal means of disciplining the children. He was also violent to the respondent's mother. The respondent was declared a neglected child and placed in a church boys' home, and apparently various other institutions thereafter. From the age of 13 he effectively fended for himself. He had various forms of employment and ran a number of small businesses of his own. For a short time, at the age of 15 or 16, he returned to his mother's household but this lasted only a month. His stepfather was still physically abusing the respondent's sisters and attempted also physically to abuse the respondent. The respondent reciprocated and was charged with assault. He left the house, and resumed living alone in a boarding house. One sister has since died of a drug overdose. 
      
       
     14    The respondent has had significant physical illnesses. At the age of 24 or 25 he suffered ""burnout"" and a collapsed lung. He subsequently suffered chickenpox which caused a recurrence of the collapsed lung and a similar problem in the other lung. This was in about 1997. Since then he has been on different forms of medication, including antidepressants. 
      
       
     15    At the age of 31 he met and later married his wife, and two daughters were born in 1994 and 1996 respectively. The family lived for a time in Condobolin and then moved to Narooma. 
      
       
     16    From about the age of 12 the respondent has been involved as a volunteer fire fighter, initially with the Bush Fire Brigade and later with the New South Wales Fire Brigade. For this he was paid a monthly retainer. By about 1997 he had attained the position of station commander. This work had involved him, on ten or more occasions, in dealing with fatalities. He received no counselling. 
      
       
     17    In his evidence the respondent repeated that his first recollection of the events constituting the offence was of walking onto the verandah with a cup of coffee and seeing the police with guns directed at him. He said the evening before he had taken eight or ten sleeping tablets after he had found himself unable to sleep. He denied that he had been contemplating suicide or any other form of self harm and said that he had intended moving out of the house. He had no recollection of writing the suicide notes, but accepted that one of them, at least, was in his handwriting. He said that he had been stressed and very, very upset because of the situation with his wife. He denied that he had ever intended to use the molotov cocktails to injure police or himself. He claimed to have no idea why police were present. 
      
       
     18    There was surprisingly little before his Honour by way of psychiatric or psychological evidence. Such evidence as there was was limited to a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Koller, a visiting psychiatrist in the Corrections Health Service. Dr Koller examined the respondent on 9 August 1999, while he was in custody. The resultant report is succinct; Dr Koller found the respondent not to be a suicide risk and considered that the problem was essentially a matrimonial one and should have been managed as such. 
      
       
     19    By the time the respondent came to be sentenced, he had moved to a small town near Goulburn. He had undertaken voluntary work with Mission Australia, supervising developmentally disabled workers at a meatworks. He had, for 10 years, been involved with children suffering from cancer, in an organization called Camp Quality. For many more years he had been an active member of the Lions Club, also doing community work. He had been suspended from his position in the New South Wales Fire Brigade and recognized that it was unlikely that he would be able to engage in this volunteer work in the future. This was a significant personal loss. 
      
       
     20    The respondent had some criminal record. He had been convicted of assault in 1978 (presumably the assault on his stepfather, although the date would suggest that his recollection of his age at the time of that event was erroneous), of supplying Indian hemp, and goods in custody (on separate occasions in 1981) and stealing in 1983. Most significantly, he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 1989. For this offence he was fined $500 and subjected to a bond to be of good behaviour. Thereafter he had no convictions. 
      
       
     21    In his remarks on sentence Goldring DCJ characterised the offence as, ""really a domestic upset gone wild which led to a most unfortunate situation"". Goldring DCJ recounted the subjective material that had been placed before him and the facts of the offences. He noted that the threats made by the respondent to others were confined in that he only threatened them if they attempted to enter his house and remove him. He was somewhat critical of the negotiating tactics adopted by the police. He thought their techniques ""were not calculated to dampen the situation down"" and he observed, in a critical tone, that police did not make any concessions to the respondent. Although he acknowledged that a number of the police involved were general duties police, untrained in the specialised area of negotiating in a siege situation, he observed that the techniques used had caused ""a reaction in Mr Paris which I cannot criticise"" and that, while what was said to him was probably not intended to incite or inflame him, that was its effect and led to ""a stalemate"". 
      
       
        
       His Honour then said: 
        
        
        
         
         ""I find the offence proved but under s 10 of the 
          Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         , having regard to the extenuating circumstances, I am satisfied that it is expedient to release the offender on a good behaviour bond."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     22    The principal submission advanced on behalf of the Crown was that the sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate. The Crown sought to support this contention, not only by reference to the sentence itself, but also to errors it asserted could be identified in the remarks on sentence. 
      
       
     23    Firstly, the Crown relied upon a passage in the remarks on sentence which reads: ""The Crown says this is not a case that calls for a custodial sentence and I certainly agree with that."" 
      
       
     24    This calls for some examination of what, in fact, occurred and what was said during the course of the sentencing proceedings. At an early stage, the judge having been given quite voluminous documentary material, the Crown Prosecutor said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""If it assists your Honour's deliberations in this matter can I indicate from the outset that the Crown's position in this matter is one that it would not be necessary for your Honour to impose a  
         full-time 
          custodial sentence on this prisoner. But that is the Crown's position from the outset."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       I emphasise the words ""full-time"" and note that emphasis is added. 
        
       
     25    Thereafter the transcript records only that ""counsel addressed on penalty"". It does not disclose whether any more was said on behalf of the Crown to assist his Honour in the determination of the appropriate sentence. Given what was said by his Honour it is, I think, a reasonable inference that no more was said about the appropriate penalty. 
      
       
     26    The statement made by his Honour was, as the Crown properly submitted, a misstatement of what had, very fairly, been conceded by the Crown Prosecutor. The Crown argued that: 
      
       
        
         
         ""It was certainly not the Crown's position that custody of any form was unwarranted, the Crown concession being limited to it not seeking full-time custody."" 
         
        
       
     27    One answer made by the respondent to this proposition is that it was incumbent on the Crown's representative clearly to enunciate the distinction, had it truly been his intention to make a concession about full-time custody, but to leave open the possibility of, or the need for, some lesser custodial sentence. 
      
       
     28    Initially, I found this response unattractive but on further examination I consider that it has some merit, although that is limited. As I have said, I infer that nothing specific was said by the Crown about alternative penalties and the matter was left to his Honour. Had it been the Crown's position that his Honour should at least have considered alternative penalties, in my view it would have been preferable that that was expressly drawn to his Honour's attention. Of course, a sentencing Judge is not bound by any concession made by the Crown. He or she retains an overriding obligation to impose a sentence that properly reflects the criminality, taking into account subjective circumstances. Nor is this court bound by such a concession but where a party, whether Crown or offender, in a criminal case makes a concession that is accepted by a judge, it is difficult for the subsequent representative of that party to resile from that concession on appeal. The Crown does not here attempt to take that course, acknowledging that it ought not now argue for a sentence of full-time custody. It does not accept that it is precluded from arguing for a lesser custodial penalty. 
      
       
     29    A second answer made on behalf of the respondent concerned the identification of alternative custodial penalties that the Crown now argues were available. These are periodic detention and home detention, now provided for by ss 6 and 7 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. Either order may only be made in specified circumstances, including the provision of a favourable assessment for such an order. There was no such assessment and there is nothing in the transcript to indicate either party invited his Honour to make an order for such an assessment. 
      
       
     30    This was undoubtedly a very serious offence. Once the Crown had conceded that full-time custody was not called for, and that concession was accepted by his Honour, proper sentencing procedure called for an assessment of alternatives other than the bond that was ultimately imposed. There are a number of intermediate possibilities, such as those I have mentioned and also Community Service orders. 
      
       
     31    The question which now arises encompasses not only whether his Honour was in error in misunderstanding the Crown concession and in acting on this misconception and in failing to consider alternatives falling short of the s 10 bond, but also whether the Crown participated in or was responsible for any such error in such a way as to preclude it now relying upon the error.  
      
       
     32    I make it clear now that, in my view, there was error in his Honour's misunderstanding of the concession made by the Crown Prosecutor, in his reliance on that misconception and also in his failure to consider alternative sentences. Less clear is whether the Crown should accept any responsibility for that error such as to preclude present reliance upon it. 
      
       
     33    In matters of sentencing, the Crown does have an obligation to draw to the attention of the judge all relevant sentencing options and to ensure that appropriate options are not overlooked. In my opinion there is room for the conclusion that this obligation was not, in this case, fully discharged. I am reluctant to be too critical of the Crown who exercised a legitimate discretion and did so in the best traditions of the Crown: that is, in acting fairly to an offender. The Crown's role is not to secure a conviction at any cost, nor is it the Crown's role to secure the heaviest available penalty. A Crown Prosecutor is not ordinarily to be criticised for encouraging a merciful sentence in appropriate circumstances, even if minds may differ about the extent of the leniency that is appropriate. In this case, in my opinion, it would have been better if the Crown had expanded on the Crown's position in order to put beyond doubt that it sought either periodic detention, home detention, or some other penalty. What was in the mind of the Crown and what was the submission of the Crown in this respect is not entirely clear. However, as I have said, the real issue in relation to this aspect of the appeal is whether, by its conduct of the case at first instance, the Crown has forfeited the right to complain on appeal that the sentencing process miscarried in this respect. A sentencing judge is entitled to expect a full measure of assistance from both counsel. An offender might lose the right to complain if relevant facts and circumstances are not brought to a trial or sentencing judge's notice. The Crown is in no different position. 
      
       
     34    After considering all of those matters, on balance I have concluded that the Crown conduct was not such as to preclude it now taking the point. Properly analysed, the concession did not exclude alternative sentencing options more severe than that provided for by s 10. 
      
       
     35    The second matter argued on behalf of the Crown involved an assertion that his Honour failed to give due weight to an important principle concerning sentencing where police officers, acting in the execution of their duty, are the victims of crime. It relied upon a passage in the judgment of this court in the Queen v Hamilton (1993) 66 A Crim R 575, also dealing with an offence against s 33B, which reads: 
      
       
        
         
         ""It is incumbent on the court to show an appropriate measure of support for police officers who undertake a difficult, dangerous and usually thankless task."" 
         
        
       
     36    Similar sentiments were expressed in R v Smith (1982) 7 A Crim R 253 and R v Myers, unreported, CCA 13 February 1990. In one aspect of this argument the Crown drew attention to the criticisms made by his Honour of the negotiators and characterised these as unfair. I agree that the criticisms were unfair. There was no evidence about the appropriate or preferred method or methods of negotiating in the particular circumstances that had arisen, or indeed in any circumstances. I am prepared to assume that negotiating in a siege situation requires a degree of training and skill and the exercise of judgment. It is a field of specialised expertise. In the absence of evidence about the extent of adherence on this occasion to accepted practices, it was quite unfair to criticise the negotiators. It is another question altogether whether those criticisms played any part in the determination of the sentence. Unless they did, I would not regard those remarks as demonstrative of relevant error. During the course of his observations about the police, his Honour said: ""The effect of some of those techniques was to cause a reaction in Mr Paris which I cannot criticise"". Later he said, ""it shows that domestic situations and the mental anguish that people go through when they are involved in domestic differences do escalate."" 
      
       
     37    These remarks are open to the interpretation that the judge regarded the respondent's culpability as somewhat diminished by reason of the negotiating techniques of which he disapproved. Counsel for the respondent pointed out that the remarks were prefaced and interspersed by observations that most of the police involved were not trained negotiators, the obvious intention being to soften the effect of the criticism. But this is not the point. The point is whether his Honour erroneously assessed the respondent's culpability by reason of his opinion of police authorities. I think he did. 
      
       
     38    Further, it remains the case that his Honour made no reference, explicit or implicit, to the principles stated in Hamilton. General deterrence is an important aspect of this principle. His Honour made no reference to that principle, either in general terms or by special reference to the Hamilton dictum. Despite his Honour's observation that the only threats made by the respondent to police were made in the context of his anticipation that they would enter the house, the fact remains that he threatened the police with a weapon (which he did not possess) and with others (which he did possess) and he expressly threatened the family of one police officer. 
      
       
     39    The siege continued over a continuous period of 24 hours. In my opinion, his Honour gave inadequate weight to these important circumstances. 
      
       
     40    The third aspect argued on behalf of the Crown related to the use of the provisions of s 10 of the Sentencing Procedure Act.  
      
       
        
         
         ""10. Dismissal of charges and conditional discharge of offender. 
          
           
          
         (1) Without proceeding to conviction, a court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make either of the following orders: 
          
           
          
         (a) an order directing that the relevant charge be dismissed, 
          
         (b) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding 2 years. 
          
           
          
         (2) An order referred to in subsection (1) (b) may be made if the court is satisfied: 
          
           
          
         (a) that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment (other than nominal punishment) on the person, or 
          
         (b) that it is expedient to release the person on a good behaviour bond. 
          
           
          
         (3) In deciding whether to make an order referred to in subsection (1), the court is to have regard to the following factors: 
          
           
          
         (a) the person's character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition, 
          
         (b) the trivial nature of the offence, 
          
         (c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed, 
          
         (d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider."" 
         
        
       
     41    All his Honour said was: 
      
       
        
         
         ""I find the offence proved but under s 10 of the 
          Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         , having regard to the extenuating circumstances, I am satisfied that it is expedient to release the offender on a good behaviour bond."" 
         
        
       
     42    Subs 3 requires the court to have regard to the four factors listed. This is not intended to preclude the court having regard to any other relevant factors but it does require express regard to those matters identified. All that his Honour expressly mentioned in his conclusion were the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed. True it is that he had, in his earlier remarks on sentence, outlined matters related to the respondent's character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition but he did not clearly relate these to his views of s 10. He did, of course, set out at some length the circumstances of the offence and was therefore fully aware of its nature. On no view of it could it have been regarded as trivial. It is not necessary to the application of s 10 that the offence be characterised as trivial; the four factors mentioned in subs 3 are, in my view, intended to be disjunctive and nonexhaustive. 
      
       
     43    In my opinion, the Crown's argument about s 10 is made good. In particular, the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed appear to have overshadowed other important matters such as the nature of the offence. There was, regrettably, only the scantiest evidence about the respondent's mental condition, but his Honour appears to have made certain assumptions about it. It may be doubted whether an offence of the nature of this one could ever properly be brought within the bounds of s 10 but, if that were to be done, it would be necessary for a sentencing judge to pay very careful regard to all of the subs (3) matters. In my view, this is manifestly not a case for the application of s 10. 
      
       
     44    There was one final matter on which the Crown relied. At the commencement of the proceedings a document detailing the s 33 offences (two counts of assault, one on the ambulance officer and one on the friend of Mrs Paris who entered the respondent's bedroom) was put before his Honour. He mentioned this at the commencement of his remarks on sentence but did not specifically mention it again in a consequential way when finally imposing sentence. I would not be prepared to infer that his Honour did not have regard to these offences. In my opinion, the view he took encompassed all the relevant behaviour of the respondent which was before him. 
      
       
     45    The effect of what I have said is that a number of errors have been established in the sentencing process. As a fall-back position, counsel for the respondent urged that the court would exercise its discretion to dismiss the Crown appeal, even where error has been established. Against the possibility of resentencing, the court received an affidavit sworn by the respondent on or about 12 March. He deposed to the continuation of his community work, his work with developmentally disabled people which is for nine hours a day, five days a week. His only payment is by way of food vouchers. He is on several kinds of medication, including medication for depression, painkillers for a back injury and desensitisation medication for his lung condition. 
      
       
     46    I am of the opinion that the contents of this affidavit can be taken into account, not only against the possibility of resentencing but also in relation to the exercise of the residual discretion the court retains in relation to Crown appeals. Notwithstanding these matters, I have concluded that this is not a case that warrants the exercise of that discretion. I would not, however, make an order that would have the effect of returning the respondent to full-time custody - that is, in the absence of further offences. 
      
       
     47    The order I propose would be a suspended sentence under s 12 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. I propose that the respondent be sentenced to prison for two years but that execution of the sentence be suspended for the whole of that term and I would direct, in accordance with the section, that the respondent be released from custody on condition he enter into a good behaviour bond for the whole of the term of the sentence. 
      
       
     48    IPP AJA: I agree with everything Simpson J has said, save that I wish to comment as to the effect of s 10(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In my view section 10(3) sets out what may be termed as criteria to be borne in mind in deciding whether or not to make an order referred to in subs 1. While none of these criteria is conclusive, all are to be taken into account 
      
       
     49    WOOD CJ AT CL: I agree with the proposed judgment of Simpson J and with the qualification additional thereto suggested by the Presiding Judge. 
      
       
     50    IPP AJA: The orders of the court will be as proposed by Simpson J and the conviction of the respondent will be entered.

      REGINA v Janos SZELENCZY 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1    IPP AJA: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence. On 25 August 2000 the applicant pleaded guilty before Mahoney DCJ to a charge that, at Sydney, between 15 and 23 December 1999, he imported into Australia not less than the trafficable quantity of cocaine, contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901. 
      
       
     2    A trafficable quantity of cocaine for the purposes of the Customs Act is between 2 and 2000 grams. The total weight of the substance imported was 953.3 grams. The cocaine was found to be 65 percent pure, meaning that the weight of pure cocaine imported was 614.4 grams. 
      
       
     3    The maximum sentence for the offence is 25 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $100,000. (S 235(2)(d)(i) of the Customs Act.)  
      
       
     4    The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. 
      
       
     5     I shall set out in summary form the facts in relation to the commission of the offence. 
      
       
     6    On 19 November 1999 a co-accused of the applicant, Toni Cerullo booked for the applicant and his wife to fly from Sydney to Budapest then to Frankfurt and then to return to Sydney on 23 November 1999. The applicant flew alone on that journey that day. Before embarking on his flight in Sydney he met with another co-accused, Jim Soukoulis. 
      
       
     7    Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that Cerullo and Soukoulis were the moving lights in the drug transaction that followed, and have a higher degree of responsibility in that transaction than the applicant himself. I accept that submission. 
      
       
     8    On 17 December 1999 the applicant arrived in Sydney by air from Europe. Customs searched his belongings and found a DHL shipping label for a parcel of documents sent from Frankfurt to himself in Rose Bay. 
      
       
     9    Over the next few days the applicant exchanged telephone calls with a number of people including Soukoulis and Cerullo in which the lack of developments in relation to the arrival of a parcel in Sydney were discussed. They were mainly concerned with the fact that the parcel had not arrived. 
      
       
     10    On 21 December DHL employees discovered a DHL parcel consigned to the applicant at his Rose Bay address from a Joseph Kovac of 3 Essington Street, Frankfurt. The parcel had been mistakenly diverted to Austria from Frankfurt instead of being delivered to Australia. This was the cause of the delay that had given rise to such anxiety on the part of the applicant and the others. 
      
       
     11    Soukoulis and Cerullo on 22 December met in Sydney and travelled to the applicant's Rose Bay unit. That night, the parcel, which had arrived in Australia, was located in DHL and x-rayed by Customs. It was found to contain a large hard covered bible. Inside the hollowed out core of the bible was a wax covered block of cocaine wrapped in tape and covered in gel. 
      
       
     12    Later that day the parcel was delivered to the applicant at his Rose Bay unit. Soukoulis and Cerullo were with him when it was delivered. Those persons left the applicant's unit and they were arrested. 
      
       
     13    Shortly afterwards, the police entered the applicant's unit and found him with $1,000 in cash in each hand, with the parcel unopened on a coffee table. 
      
       
     14    It was submitted by senior counsel for the applicant in this Court that the $1,000 in cash in each hand was the only payment which the applicant had received for the transaction. There was no evidence (or argument) to this effect before the learned sentencing judge. The submission now raised was based solely on inference. It was said that the inference should be drawn from the mere fact that the applicant was found with this quantity of money as I have described.  
      
       
     15    I am not persuaded by the submission. In any event, I do not regard the degree of remuneration that the applicant received as being of much significance in this particular case, although I do accept that it may have a bearing on the degree of his responsibility with regard to the transaction as a whole. 
      
       
     16    After he had been arrested the applicant denied he knew Cerullo but admitted that he sent the parcel to himself from Frankfurt. He said at first that he met Joseph Kovac there, and Kovac asked him to convey the bible to Australia. The applicant said that he had the bible air freighted because he had bought too many books for himself. 
      
       
     17    Later it was found that the Frankfurt address and telephone number given for Kovac on the air freight documents did not exist. The applicant admitted completing these documents. That is to say, in effect, he admitted putting the false address and telephone number on the air freighted documents. 
      
       
     18    A primary argument raised on appeal was directed to the following remarks of the learned sentencing judge: 
      
       
        
         
         ""It was put to me by his learned senior counsel, that he ought to be regarded as having nothing more than a lowly role and that the arrival of Ms Cerullo in Europe just happened to occur while this offender was there as well. The coincidences and the unlikelihood of Ms Cerullo going to Europe in mid-winter for purposes other than associating with the importation is so unlikely as to make me reject the second portion of the proposition. Bearing in mind that the sender of the package was this offender, that he used an alias, that he used a false address in Frankfurt and a false telephone number, I am satisfied that puts him on the hierarchy at a higher level than what is sometimes referred to as a 'mere courier'."" 
         
        
       
     19    It was submitted on the applicant's behalf that this finding was not justified and involved mere speculation. It was said that the applicant should not be regarded as a person any higher than someone low in the hierarchy of the organisation importing the cocaine. 
      
       
     20    This submission was directed to the guideline judgment of R v Wong and Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 where a sentencing guideline was expressed as being intended to apply to couriers and persons low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation. According to this guideline the suggested sentence for low level trafficable quantity (being between 200 grams to 1 kilogram of cocaine) was 6 to 9 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     21    On this basis, having regard to the guilty plea and the other mitigating factors that are applicable, it was said that the period of imprisonment of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years was too severe. 
      
       
     22    In considering this submission it is important to bear in mind that, as Gleeson CJ and Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ said in R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 277, the identification of the precise nature of the accused's involvement in an act of importation of prohibited imports is not an essential aspect of the sentencing process, although in individual cases that kind of categorisation may be helpful. Their Honours pointed out (at 278): 
      
       
        
         
         ""Very often prosecuting authorities (and a sentencing judge) will have only the most limited and imperfect information about how it was the accused person came to commit an offence for which he or she stands for sentence. Especially is that so where the accused has pleaded guilty and where the offence which the offender admits is one which had its genesis outside this country. Very often then it will not be possible to say, with any certainty, what exactly was done or intended by a person apprehended in the act of importing narcotics into Australia."" 
         
        
        
       These remarks are particularly apposite in the present case. 
        
       
     23    Gleeson CJ and Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ stressed (at 279): 
      
       
        
         
         ""it is always necessary, whether one or several offenders are to be dealt with a single importation of drugs, to bear steadily in mind the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. Characterising the offender as a ""courier"" or a ""principal"" must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did."" 
         
        
        
       In the end what the applicant  
       did 
        is determinative of the sentence to be imposed in this case. 
        
       
     24    Significantly in R v Olbrich, their Honours went on to discuss the onus and standard of proof in sentencing. They said at 281: 
      
       
        
         
         ""It may be accepted that if the prosecution seeks to have the sentencing judge take a matter into account in passing sentence it will be for the prosecution to bring that matter to the attention of the judge and, if necessary, call evidence about it. Similarly, it will be for the offender who seeks to bring a matter to the attention of the judge to do so and, again, if necessary, to call evidence about it."" 
         
        
        
       Their Honours then noted that in the proceedings before the primary judge the prosecution did not submit that the sentence should be increased because the appellant was a ""principal"". Rather, it was the respondent who submitted that the sentence should be mitigated because he was a ""courier"". In that event, their Honours said, ""the respondent bore the burden of proving this fact. The judge was not persuaded of it."" 
        
       
     25    It is apparent that, in the present case, the same situation obtained. Mahoney DCJ noted in his sentencing remarks: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was put to me by his learned senior counsel, that he ought to be regarded as having nothing more than a lowly role and that the arrival of Ms Cerullo in Europe just happened to occur while this offender was there as well."" 
         
        
        
       His Honour did not accept these submissions. The learned judge found that the criminal culpability of the applicant had to be determined by reference to his participation in the importation and, in particular, by reference to the fact that he apparently worked together with Ms Cerullo in Europe, that he sent the package with the cocaine from Europe to himself, that he used an alias, that he used a false address in Frankfurt and a false telephone number. In the result, his Honour found that the applicant played a significant role in, in fact, importing the narcotic drug into Australia. In effect, Mahoney DCJ applied the approach laid down in  
       R v Olbrich 
        to the letter.  
        
       
     26    In this Court, senior counsel for the applicant similarly submitted that in bringing in the cocaine the applicant was doing what he was told; he was a mere foot soldier occupying a very low rung in the hierarchy. The submissions made on behalf of the applicant hinged on the proposition that, as it was put, the applicant was a mere ""courier"". It was said that his participation in the transaction was minor, and should not mask the fact that he was a mere ""courier"". 
      
       
     27    There is little utility, however, in describing the appellant as a mere ""courier"", and then attempting to ascribe the degree of criminal culpability attaching to his conduct by simply by reference to the allegedly minor extent to which it could be said that he departed from this role. 
      
       
     28    The fact is that the applicant played a critical part in the transaction. This is demonstrated by the means he used to disguise his identity and to bring the cocaine into this country. The importation scheme was not unsophisticated and his role in it was significant. He was actively involved in the attempt to set up, as it were, a mirage of false facts so as to conceal from the authorities the importation of the drug. It is these matters to which the Court has to have regard when measuring the criminal responsibility for which the applicant is to be sentenced. 
      
       
     29    Senior counsel for the applicant then turned to the case of R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231, and based a series of arguments on it. He pointed out that in Ferrer-Esis the applicant was sentenced on a similar charge to 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 and a half years. That it was said had to be compared with the substantial higher sentence imposed in this case. He drew attention to the fact that the quantity of pure cocaine in Ferrer-Esis was three times more than the quantity involved in the present case and rightly submitted that quantity is a significant factor in the sentencing exercise. He pointed out that in Ferrer-Esis the Court considered that there was no warrant for a discount for the plea of guilty whereas in the present case there was nothing to detract from the usual practice. So, he submitted, the respondent in Ferrer-Esis had displayed culpability greater than that of the applicant in this case.  
      
       
     30    I accept that the matters on which reliance was placed all carry weight. I am not persuaded by them, however, for the following reasons.  
      
       
     31    Firstly, and importantly, the respondent in Ferrer-Esis, in committing the crime of which he was charged, was found solely to have brought in a suitcase containing cocaine into this country. He did not otherwise participate in the transaction. This is to be contrasted with the far more significant role played by the applicant in this case.  
      
       
     32    Secondly, Ferrer-Esis is not the single touchstone against which all sentences in cases of this kind are to be compared. Since Ferrer- Esis, the case of R v Wong and Leung has established guidelines against which criminal conduct can be measured, even though the conduct concerned might not fall directly within that to which the guidelines are expressed to apply. Moreover, there have been several cases since R v Wong and Leung which bear on the issue. 
      
       
     33    Thirdly, due regard has to be had to the fact that Ferrer-Esis was a Crown appeal.  
      
       
     34    In the notice of the appeal the applicant claimed that Mahoney DCJ did not take into account the fact that hardship would be caused to the applicant because his family reside in South Australia. This submission was rejected by the learned judge, and in my opinion entirely correctly. I would simply paraphrase what I said in Heryadi (1998) 98 A Crim R 578 at 584. The applicant made a deliberate choice to participate in the criminal distribution in New South Wales of drugs, the trade known universally as being the cause of great harm and misery. He was content to import the drugs into this State, in the knowledge that the citizens of this State would suffer the consequences of his criminal acts. In these circumstances, to complain that he would be incarcerated in New South Wales and not in South Australia and he would miss his family is, in my view, futile. 
      
       
     35    Senior counsel for the applicant drew attention to the fact that the respondent is in a serious state of ill health, both physical and psychological. He is an alcoholic, and a compulsive gambler. Submissions were also made concerning the applicant's deprived upbringing, and the violence and abuse he had received as a child. 
      
       
     36    While these are undoubtedly factors of some relevance, I do not regard them as being of particular weight. In Quach v R [1999] WASCA 210 I said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The prevalence and seriousness of criminal heroin use make deterrence the principal consideration in sentencing for heroin related offences. The terrible consequences to the community of trafficking in this drug are notorious. Where an offender consciously and deliberately, knowing full well what harm will be done thereby, participates (no matter in what capacity) in the heroin trade for commercial gain, it is ordinarily futile. 
          
         To argue that personal circumstances and antecedents have significant mitigatory force see, for example,  
         Darwell v R 
          (1997) 1994 A Crim R 35,  
         Heryadi v R 
          (1998) 98 A Crim R 578 and  
         Musarri v R 
          unreported CCA S Ct WA, Library No 980662, 17 November 1998."" 
         
        
        
       These comments apply equally to trafficking in cocaine. 
        
       
     37    Senior counsel for the applicant drew attention to various other matters relating to the applicant's personal antecedents, including that he has a supportive and stable relationship with his wife and no relevant prior convictions. These matters are all covered by the remarks I previously made. While relevant, they too are not of particular weight. 
      
       
     38    In any event, the learned sentencing judge indeed expressly took into account several mitigatory factors relating to the applicant's personal circumstances. His Honour had regard to the applicant's early plea of guilty he had remorse and contrition. He had regard to the fact that the applicant sought treatment for drug and alcohol problems while in custody and is making genuine efforts to resolve his problems. His Honour noted that the applicant had strong family support and the applicant would obtain benefit from senior counselling and supervision. 
      
       
     39    The applicant committed the offences for monetary gain. It was said on his behalf, ""The respondent was ill treated as a child which led to his alcohol and gambling addictions, which in turn led to financial difficulties, which again in turn led to the commission of the offence."" Senior counsel for the applicant said that these matters should be taken into account in the same way as Simpson J is said to have suggested in the R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR (at 346 at 337 and 338). As I understand her Honour's remarks, however, they were substantially directed to the will of an individual being overborne or undermined by drug addiction. In my view, nothing said in that respect is comparable to the case where a person imports narcotic drugs into Australia for financial gain. There can be no question of the free will of the offender being overborne merely because he was in financial difficulty. The proposition merely has to be stated to be rejected. 
      
       
     40    Finally, it was submitted in general terms that, when all the relevant circumstances are taken into account, the sentence imposed was excessive as it substantially exceeded the guidelines in R v Wong and Leung. The present case, however, is not one to which the guidelines directly apply because it was not established that the applicant was a courier, or a person ""low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation."" The sentence, nevertheless, bears appropriate relation to the guidelines laid down.  
      
       
     41    All in all I am not persuaded that Mahoney DCJ made any error in principle, nor that the sentence imposed by him falls outside a sound sentencing discretion.

      JUDGMENT 
     The respondent pleaded guilty to being knowingly concerned in the importation of a trafficable quantity of cocaine pursuant to s 233BC(1)(d) Customs Act 1901. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of eighteen months. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions appealed under s 5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed on the grounds that it was manifestly lenient and sought to correct an error in the formulation of the sentencing order. Held: (Appeal allowed by majority of Wood CJ at CL and Ipp AJA. Simpson J in dissent):1. Departure from Guideline Judgment without sufficient reasons or justification with regard to subjective factsIn departing from the range suggested as appropriate for a mid range trafficable quantity, the sentencing Judge observed that the decision in Wong & Leung was “merely to be used as a guideline”. This was to understate its effect as a considered pronouncement of the Court. It is true that guideline judgments are not meant to be applied rigidly or to lay down binding precedent from which there is never to be a departure,;however, they are intended to be indicative of the range of sentence that is regarded as appropriate following a considered examination by the Court of the authorities and of sentencing principle. While a sentencing Judge does retain a discretion within the guidelines, including a discretion to depart from them if the particular circumstances of the case justify, the Court expects the reasoning for such a departure to be articulated with some precision and justified by reference to the subjective facts.Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209; Chua (2001) NSWCCA 50 applied. 2. His Honour overstated the caseThe sentencing Judge fell into error by the generalisation that the respondent was “at the very low end of the importation” without specifically considering what it was that he had done. Olbrich (1999) 108 ACrimR 464 applied.3. His Honour was at risk of mis-applying the decision in Fernando The propositions enunciated in Fernando were not intended to mitigate punishment of a person of Aboriginal descent, by reason of their aboriginality alone; rather their purpose was to highlight those circumstances that may explain or throw light upon the particular offence, or particular offender, that are referable to their Aboriginality, particularly in the context of offences arising from abuse of alcohol. This was not such a case. The principles should not be elevated so as to create a special class of persons for whom leniency is inevitably to be extended, irrespective of the objective or subjective circumstances of the case.Fernando (1992) 76 ACrimR 58 distinguished.4. Undue weight given to subjective circumstancesThe sentencing Judge gave undue weight to the respondent’s youth, good character and the effect of the respondent’s sentence upon his brother. While youth and a prior clean record are of relevance, they are of less significance in drug trafficking and importation offences then in other cases. It remained important for the sentencing Judge to maintain a reasonable proportionality between the sentencing order made and the circumstances of the offence viewed objectively, and not to allow for the subjective circumstances to outweigh its established seriousnessLawson, Wu and Thapa (1997) 98 ACrimR 463; Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594; Readman (1990) 47 ACrimR 181; Dodd (1991) 57 ACrimR 349 applied.5. Double allowance for the subjective circumstancesWhere allowance is made for subjective factors, by reducing the term of the total sentence for the mitigating circumstances additional leniency should not be extended by reducing the non parole period for the same circumstances.ORDERS PROPOSED(1) Appeal allowed.(2) Sentence quashed and respondent sentenced to four and a half years

      JUDGMENT 
     1   WOOD CJ at CL: On 6 October 2000, the respondent pleaded guilty, in the District Court, to a charge under s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Commonwealth) for being knowingly concerned in the importation of a quantity of cocaine, being not less than the trafficable quantity applicable for that substance. Following that plea, he was sentenced by Solomon DCJ to a term of imprisonment of three years, with a non-parole period of eighteen months. 
     2   The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions now appeals against that decision pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, upon the grounds of leniency and also to correct an error in the formulation of the sentencing order, so far as non-parole period was fixed rather than the recognisance release order that was required by s 19AC of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth). 
     3   On 18 January 2000, a package addressed to the respondent was intercepted at the Australia Post Mail Handling Unit at Mascot. Concealed within a teddy bear, inside this package, was an amount of cocaine powder with a pure net weight of 344.4 grams, the street value of which was estimated to be between $137,000 and $172,000.  
     4   On 21 January, Australian Federal Police Agents arranged for a controlled delivery of the package to the respondent. When they later executed a search warrant at his home, the package, and the teddy bear which had been removed from it, were located.  
     5   In a recorded interview, the respondent admitted that he had signed for the package and had removed the teddy bear from it. He also admitted that he had known something was coming, that he had received two telephone calls that day relating to it, and that he had suspected that there were drugs in the bear, as well as in other toys contained within similar parcels that he had received on several prior occasions.  
     6   He acknowledged that he had received payments in the sum of $50 for receiving these packages and for holding them until they were picked up. He also acknowledged that he had remitted to the United States of America monies provided by the people who ultimately collected the packages.  
     7   Although uncertain of the number of times on which this had occurred, he acknowledged that sums in the order of $9000 had been involved in the various bank transfers that he had arranged. Whether on this occasion he had remitted monies for the consignment was not shown. In his favour, the matter may be properly approached upon the basis that his role for this transaction was confined to receiving and holding the package until collected from him. 
     8   In his remarks on sentence, Solomon DCJ correctly noted that the offence was serious, a circumstance reflected in the penalty provided by the Customs Act. His Honour also noted that there was a need to deter others by indicating that those, who deal in the trafficking of cocaine, would be severely dealt with and that cocaine causes many problems to the community. So much is self-evident and it has been the subject of consistent judicial pronouncement. 
     9   His Honour acknowledged the guideline judgment of this Court in Wong and Leung (1999) 108 A Crim R 531, but decided, it would seem by a reference to the subjective circumstances of the respondent, that this case fell ""clearly outside"" the guideline.  
     10   The guidelines in Wong and Leung, it is to be observed, were set primarily on the basis of existing sentencing patterns, and were intended to apply to couriers and persons low in the hierarchy of importing organisations. In relation to mid level traffickable quantities (200 grams to one kilogram), a range within which the present case falls, the guideline was one of imprisonment for six to nine years. A schedule of 133 decisions provided by the appellant in this appeal supports the sentencing pattern identified. 
     11   The guideline, it may be noted, takes into account the absence of remissions in this State, a matter requiring adjustment in accordance with s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914: See Harvey (2000) NSW CCA 253 and Irusta (2000) NSW CCA 391.  
     12   It is not entirely clear, so far as his Honour observed in his closing remarks on sentence, that he had made allowance on this account, whether these decisions were fully appreciated. If by this remark he meant that he had further discounted the guideline by reason of s 16G, then there would have been an error in principle.  
     13   In departing from the range suggested as appropriate for a mid range traffickable quantity, his Honour observed that the decision in Wong v. Leung was ""merely to be used as a guideline"". This is to understate to some degree, its effect as a considered pronouncement of this Court. It is true that guideline judgments are not meant to be applied rigidly in every case or to lay down binding precedent from which there is never to be a departure. They are, however, intended to be indicative of the range of sentence that was regarded as appropriate by this Court following its considered examination of the authorities and of sentencing principle. See Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 220, and Chua (2001) NSW CCA 50 at par 19 per Heydon J. 
     14   While a sentencing Judge does retain a discretion within the guidelines, including a discretion to depart from them, if the particular circumstances of the case justify (see Wong and Leung per Spigelman CJ at 555-556), this Court does expect the reasoning for such a departure to be articulated with some precision.  
     15   It also expects such a departure to be well based in fact and to pay respect to proper sentencing principles. It is not to be overlooked that an important purpose of a guideline judgment is to promote greater consistency in sentencing, and that an equally important purpose is to promote the general element of deterrence: See Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 359, and 386 to 387; and see also Cadd (1997) 94 A Crim R 466 at 511. 
     16   This latter consideration is of particular significance in narcotics cases (see Wong v. Leung at 553), having regard to the consistent line of authority as to the need for sentences, in such cases, to reflect both individual and general deterrence. That line of authority goes back as far as Tait (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 399, and has been taken up in decisions such as Benais (1999) NSW CCA 236; Stead (1999) NSW CCA 41; Laurentiu and Becheru NSW CCA 1 October 1992; Manchukingkan NSW CCA 20 December 1990; Budiman NSW CCA 8 September 1998; and El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370. These decisions also confirm the point that no particular leniency is to be extended to those who perform lesser tasks in the importation chain since, without their active co-operation and assistance, the trade in narcotics would collapse. 
     17   Before parting from the indicative effect of guidelines in Wong and Leung, it is necessary to acknowledge that it applies to cases dealt with following conviction, as well as those dealt with upon a plea of guilty. No assumption was made one way or another in that regard. See Karacic (2001) NSW CCA 12 at par 50, and in Ngui (2000) 111 A Crim R 593 at par 17. They do recognise explicitly that there will be cases such as Chua (2001) NSW CCA 50, where the plea of guilty is entered in circumstances sufficient to justify a sentence below the range.  
     18   The present case is, however, quite unlike Chua, in that the respondent's conviction was inevitable, and while his plea did have a significant utilitarian value, it was not a case of him providing admissions or assistance that were essential to the prosecution case. 
     19   The critical question, it seems to me, in the light of these decisions, and of the significant departure from the guideline, is whether that departure was sufficiently explained and justified by reference to the subjective facts. In my view, it was not justified, and I can only assume that his Honour allowed himself to be unduly swayed by an overly sympathetic view of the respondent's background, and also failed to give proper effect to the need for general deterrence. 
     20   The respondent did have a deprived background, and had suffered an undeniable personal tragedy relating to the use of drugs by his parents, which resulted in their deaths when he was only eleven years of age. It was, however, to my mind, a considerable over-statement for his Honour to have described the case in terms suggesting that it involved a tragic background that was absolutely unique so far as he was aware.  
     21   It was certainly proper for his Honour to have taken into account, and to have given appropriate weight to the subjective circumstances referable to the applicant, including: 
      
      (a) His early plea; 
       
      (b) The existence of the remorse that was apparent from the interview; 
       
      (c) The fact that he had undertaken the responsibility of caring for his young brother and for a time, his young cousin, despite his relative youth; 
       
      (d) his not unfavourable criminal antecedents and his attempts to work, although I note that his Honour's description of him having performed ""sterling work in the community"" appears to have had no factual basis; 
       
      (e) The assessment of Mr Taylor, a clinical psychologist, that he suffers from a condition which he described somewhat vaguely as a ""rather depressive and passive-aggressive personality adjustment"" as well as symptoms of an anxiety disorder that Mr. Taylor thought reactive to his current legal situation;  
       
       
      (f) The fact that he had received some injuries in a motor vehicle accident at the age of nine years, which were said to have left him with asthma and headaches, and the suggested fact that he had an increased susceptibility to influenza; 
       
      (g) His deprived formative years, including a lack of proper parenting and social training, or of educational and vocational guidance; 
       
      (h) The trauma of his parents' death and his early exposure to their anti-social lifestyle and illicit use of drugs; and 
     (i) The likely effect of the sentence upon his younger brother.22   These matters do, however, need to be kept in context. In that regard, it appears to me that the extent to which a responsible attitude to life was demonstrated by the fact of his assumption of care for the younger brother, needs to be qualified by the fact of his involvement in drug trafficking, an activity which poses such an obvious and significant risk for every young member of the community. 
     23   Those matters also needed to be considered in the light of the wider sentencing principles applicable to those engaged in serious trafficking in narcotics. 
     24   What his Honour appears to have significantly overlooked was the fact that this was not an isolated lapse by the respondent. He had lent himself to an ongoing system of importation in which he played an important role in the reception of the drugs once they arrived in this country and their delivery to those whose interest was to place them in the marketplace. Although, as I have observed, it was not shown that he had actually handled the monies involved in this case in the purchase and postage of the drugs involved, on his own admission, he had performed that task in relation to other importations.  
     25   His involvement in this activity was not due to any personal addiction to drugs, but it was one undertaken purely for financial gain, albeit in a paltry sum, to supplement the welfare payments that he was receiving for himself and his younger brother. 
     26   Of course, he is not to be sentenced for any wider criminality than that to which he pleaded guilty, but equally, the present case cannot be dismissed as an isolated lapse on his part. 
     27   As was made clear in Olbrich (1999) 108 A Crim R 464, it remained relevant to have regard to what it was that the evidence disclosed as to the respondent's activities in respect of this importation. It was important in particular that his Honour avoid falling into the trap of categorising him in a way that risked obscuring that assessment. In this case, it seems to me, his participation in the importation was essential to its success.  
     28   His Honour seems to have overlooked these several important considerations and to have fallen into error by the generalisation that the respondent was “at the very low end of the importation” without specifically considering exactly what it was that he had done. 
     29   Next, it appears to me that his Honour was at risk of mis-applying the decision in Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, referred to with approval in Stone (1995) 84 A Crim R 218. As I endeavoured to explain in Fernando, the eight propositions there enunciated were not intended to mitigate the punishment of persons of Aboriginal descent, but rather to highlight those circumstances that may explain or throw light upon the particular offence, or upon the circumstances of the particular offender which are, referable to their Aboriginality, particularly in the context of offences arising from the abuse of alcohol.  
     30   The present is not such a case, nor is it one which needs to be understood as having occurred in a particular local or rural setting, or one involving an offender from a remote community for whom imprisonment would be unduly harsh because it was to be served in an environment that was foreign to him or her.  
     31   That Fernando is not to be regarded as a decision justifying special leniency, merely because of the Aboriginality of the offender, was recognised in Hickey NSW CCA 27 September 1994 where Simpson J noted that the first of the propositions stated by me in that decision ""is that sentencing principles are non-discriminatory in that they apply to all accused without differentiating by reason of the offender’s membership of a particular racial or ethnic group”. This proposition is however varied by the recognition that those factors which constitute the disadvantage, and which may arise by reason of membership of the particular group, may have a role to play in the sentencing determination. 
     32   The principles stated should not be elevated so as to create a special class of persons for whom leniency is inevitably to be extended, irrespective of the objective and special circumstances of the case. To do so would itself be discriminatory of others. 
     33   In the instant case, I am unable to see the existence of any factor arising from the fact that the respondent's grandfather was part aboriginal, that would, in accordance with Fernando, attract special consideration. That does not mean that his subjective circumstances were to be ignored or diminished. It simply means that Fernando did not require the application of any consideration additional to those applicable in every case of an offender with a deprived background.  
     34   It also appears to me that his Honour attached undue weight to the respondent's youth and good character. Again, it is not to be overlooked that youth and the possession of a prior clear record, while of relevance, are of less significance in drug trafficking and importation offences, than in other cases: as to youth, see Lawson, Wu and Thapa (1997) 98 A Crim R 463 and as to prior character see Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 at 236. 
     35   Regrettably it is often the case that organisers within the drug trade will deliberately recruit young people and people of prior good character to perform the overt acts that are required for a successful importation so as to reduce the risk of detection of the operation. For that reason the deterrence aspect is important. 
     36   It next appears to me that his Honour gave undue weight to the effect of the respondent's sentence upon his brother. While this is a matter to be taken into account by reason of s 16(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914, it is not a provision which alters the Common Law principle that the effect of a sentence upon an offender's family is relevant only in exceptional circumstances. See Adami (1989) 42 A Crim R 88; Sinclair (1990) 51 A Crim R 418 at 430; and Carmody (1998) 100 A Crim R 41 at 45. 
     37   As Gleeson CJ pointed out in Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 at 515, there is nothing unusual in sending to prison offenders who are bread winners or who have the responsibility for the care and support of children. See also Chan (1999) NSW CCA 103, and Bednarz (2000) NSW CCA 533 where Simpson J observed that the Common Law rule was no meaningless incantation, and that it was essential that third party hardship be taken into account only in cases that were truly exceptional. 
     38   I can in fact see no such hardship in this case given the age of the respondent’s brother and the fact that he has left school and is in receipt of welfare benefits on his own account. 
     39   Finally, it appears to me that his Honour may have made a double allowance for the subjective circumstances by reducing the term of the total sentence for the mitigating circumstances, and by then fixing what he referred to as a “non-parole period” of eighteen months, equivalent to only fifty per cent of that term. By reason of the length of the head sentence which he fixed, the case was one that would have required a recognisance release order at the end of the period of eighteen months rather than the fixing of a non-parole period.  
     40   Irrespective of that error, I can see no good reason for a departure from the usual range for a non-parole period of between sixty and sixty-six per cent, that being the range suggested as appropriate in El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370; Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44 at 49; and Pang (1999) 106 A Crim R 474.  
     41   The instant case was not one in which the respondent required help to overcome a problem of drug or alcohol addiction. Nor was it one where there were present features such as special hardship attributable to the manner in which the sentence would be served, or where there was a special need for post-release supervision, or any other circumstance that would justify the fixing of a non-parole period less than sixty per cent of the overall term.  
     42   A sentencing Judge must not overlook the fact that release on parole has a special significance and purpose. It is not intended merely as a method of extending additional leniency for mitigating circumstances, that are more properly taken into account in fixing the head sentence.  
     43   It remained important for his Honour, in this case, to maintain a reasonable proportionality between the sentencing order made, and the circumstances of the offence viewed objectively, and not to allow the subjective circumstances to outweigh its established seriousness:  Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594 at 597-598; Readman (1990) 47 ACrimR 181 at 185; Dodd (1991) 57 ACrimR 349 at 354; and Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 79. 
     44   In summary, I can only assume that his Honour lost sight of this important consideration, and failed to give effect to the sentencing policy that requires deterrence sentencing for serious drug offences, and also allowed his assessment of the subjective circumstances to distract him both in fixing the head sentence and the non-parole period. Manifest leniency and failure to give effect to the sentencing principles to which his Honour noted at the outset have in my view been shown. 
     45   The extent of the leniency is such that this Court should, in my assessment, refrain from exercising the discretion which is available to it to allow a sentence, even though erroneous, to stand. 
     46   I accept that the subjective circumstances were such as to permit some departure from the low end of the guideline but nowhere near as great a departure as that involved in the sentencing order here. The principle of double jeopardy applies that requires this Court on a Crown appeal to impose ""the least sentence that could properly have been imposed upon the respondent at first instance"":  Rose NSWCCA 23 May 1996 at 3; Howland (1999) NSWCCA 10 at para 7.  
     47   Clearly, a sentence of full time custody was required that was of a severity appropriate to all the circumstances of the case and, in particular, to those specified in S16A (2) of the Crimes Act 1914, the relevant ones of which have been mentioned above. 
     48   I would propose that the sentence below be quashed and that the respondent be sentenced, for the offence to which he pleaded guilty, to four and a half years imprisonment to date from 6 October 2000 and to expire on 5 April 2005. I would fix a non-parole period of two years and nine months, similarly to date from 6 October 1990 and to expire on 5 July 2003. 
     49   IPP AJA: I agree. 
     50   SIMPSON J: I disagree. No doubt, guideline judgments play an important role in achieving consistency in sentencing. Regrettably the circumstances in which offences are committed, and the circumstances of offenders, lack consistency. For this reason, it has been repeatedly emphasised that guideline judgments are to be applied flexibly. They are not intended to operate as a strait-jacket on a sentencing judge. They are not intended to override the discretion and, indeed, the obligation a sentencing judge has to balance all the competing factors that go into a sentencing decision. See R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 220 C - 221 E (per Spigelman CJ); R v Henry and Others [1999] NSWCCA 111, 12 May 1999; 46 NSWLR 346 at paras 169-170, 175, 210, 270-271; R v Wong and Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420; 48 NSWLR 340 at para 141. 
     51   These passages are not formulaic, empty incantations. They have true substance and content. Exceptional cases are to be treated exceptionally. I accept that drug offences are serious and need to be treated seriously. Notwithstanding those observations, the circumstances of this case are exceptional, and this case should be treated exceptionally. 
     52   Having regard to the views of the other members of the Bench, it is appropriate to state those factors that make this an exceptional case. 
     53   First: the youth of the respondent. He was barely 20 at the time of the offence. Youth is a factor that, in appropriate circumstances, may be taken into account in a sentencing decision. I appreciate that special considerations apply when youthful offenders commit drug offences. They are not, however, deprived of the opportunity to rely on their youth. Here, the respondent's youth must be taken into consideration, in conjunction with the circumstances of his life to date - to which I will shortly refer - and the remarkable absence of any significant criminal history.  
     54   Despite the most inauspicious of beginnings, he has in the past been found guilty only of maliciously destroying property, for which a bond was imposed; driving with a suspended driver's licence, for which he was fined, and disqualified; and having custody of a knife in a public place, in respect of which no conviction was recorded. In the circumstances of his life, that is a quite remarkable record. Subsequent to this offence he was involved in an assault whilst acting in protection of his young brother. 
     55   Second: the respondent's personal background and circumstances. He grew up in extreme poverty. He was the eldest child of drug-addicted parents. The relatives with whom he was placed were his grandparents. His grandmother died when he was 10 years old. Within the next year, in separate events but within a couple of weeks of one another, both parents died of drug overdoses. He witnessed both of these deaths. Prior to their deaths, he had witnessed a number of overdoses and, on two occasions, had called ambulances for his parents. On another occasion, he witnessed his grandfather using CPR to revive his father. When he was 14, his grandfather died. 
     56   Both parents were imprisoned on a few occasions because of their drug addictions, and his mother worked as a prostitute. He witnessed serious physical violence between his parents. Unsurprisingly, these circumstances impacted upon his emotional wellbeing and on his behaviour as a child. His education suffered. This combination of circumstances is available to be taken into account in mitigation of the respondent's criminal culpability not because he is Aboriginal, but because, in the manner outlined by Wood J, as he then was, in R v Fernando (1992) 76 ACrimR 58, of the combination of circumstances of deprivation. 
     57   Third: given the circumstances, the respondent has shown a surprising level of responsibility. He does not consume alcohol to excess. He does not use drugs, although he has used some cannabis in the past. For more than a year as at the time of sentencing, he had taken on quasi-parental responsibility for his young brother; for even longer, he had provided a home to a young cousin (aged 12) who was rendered homeless by the imprisonment of his father.  
     58   Ironically, the Crown has argued that the respondent’s very resilience operates against him. In my view, he deserves credit for his conduct and responsibility to date. It seems that, on the Crown case, he would have been better off had he earlier succumbed to the tragic circumstances of his background. 
     59   Fourth: although the motivation for the crime was financial this was no case of greed, as is sometimes seen in this court. The respondent was, as the sentencing judge accepted, to be paid a sum of $50 for his part in this offence. He was living and supporting his brother in poverty. $50 represented a considerable sum to him. It was described by the Crown Prosecutor in this Court as ""paltry"", and the very paltriness of the sum that he was to receive reflects his circumstances at the time. In my opinion, it also reflects his role in the importation. 
     60   Fifth: I have already referred to the respondent's prior relatively good record but it stands as an independent factor for which he is entitled to credit. 
     61   Sixth: the evidence of his psychological and physical condition - the respondent described himself emotionally as ""a wreck"", and this is hardly surprising in the circumstances I have briefly recounted. A psychological report suggested, again unsurprisingly, that he was suffering from an anxiety disorder resulting from the drug charge, and some instability in his personality functioning, as a result of the family dysfunction in his formative years. He was described as vulnerable and impulsive, with poorly developed behavioural and emotional controls. He suffered significant injuries at the age of nine in a motor vehicle accident, and still suffers asthma and severe headaches as a result. He has undergone surgery for a number of bone fractures. 
     62   Seventh: the respondent gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings, which the sentencing judge obviously accepted as truthful. It is consistent with what was contained in the reports and referred to in the judgment. 
     63   Eighth: the sentencing judge, who is a very experienced judge, twice described the respondent's background as the most tragic he had ever seen. In my opinion, this Court should not lightly depart from such a finding nor its implications. In a shorthand fashion, it evokes the Fernando principles. 
     64   Ninth: the court was dealing with a single instance of an offence only. True it is, there was some evidence of a course of conduct, but that is relevant only to negate any possible claim that there was an isolated occurrence. No such claim was made in the District Court or in this Court. 
     65   Tenth: the statement of facts, put before the sentencing judge by the Crown, demonstrates that the respondent played a limited role in this importation. 
     66   Eleventh: the respondent pleaded guilty at an early stage. If he were being sentenced as a state offender, on the authority of R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, he would be entitled to a discount of up to 25 percent of the sentence imposed. While that judgment does not apply to Commonwealth offenders, it is of some assistance in determination of the appropriate weight to be given to an early plea of guilty. In this respect, I appreciate that the case against the respondent was overwhelming, but that is not a matter that affects the Thomson and Houlton decision. 
     67   The next matter I wish to refer to concerns Crown appeals. It is well established that Crown appeals should be rare and should only be lodged after the DPP has had regard to all relevant factors: Griffiths v R (1977) 137 CLR 293, at 310 per Barwick CJ, p329 per Murphy J; see also R v Tait and Bartley (1979) 46 FLR 386; R v Osenkowski (1982) 30 SASR 212; R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561; R v Crowdey [1999] NSWCCA 24, unreported 5 March 1999; R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85, unreported, 17 March 2000. 
     68   In the last mentioned case (Baker) Spigelman CJ drew attention to the particular difficulty that confronts the Crown in presenting an argument that depends upon the weight given or not given to particular relevant circumstances. That is this case. The essence of the Crown’s argument was that excessive weight was given to the subjective circumstances. It was from that, and from the departure from the guideline sentences promulgated in Wong and Leung, that the Crown sought to have the Court conclude that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. In my opinion, on proper analysis, the Crown submission depended upon too rigid an application of the guideline without appropriate regard to the flexibility that necessarily accompanies the application of guideline judgments. 
     69   In  R v Lattouf (unreported, CCA, 12 December 1996) Mahoney JA said: ""If justice is not individual, it is nothing."" This was an exceptional case that warranted, and indeed called for, individualised justice. In my opinion, the sentencing judge is not only well within the limits of his legitimate discretion in sentencing the respondent; the sentence imposed was, in all the circumstances, eminently fair and reasonable. As I understand the Crown's submissions - and certainly the oral submissions - no challenge was made to the proportion between the head sentence and the non-parole period and, accordingly, I make no comment on that. 
     70   Subject only to the appropriate adjustment to the non-parole period stated in the sentence, I would dismiss the Crown appeal. 
     71   IPP AJA: The order of the Court will be as indicated by Justice Wood.

        REGINA v Darren Tahu HURA 
         
        
        
        
       Daren Tahu Hura (the Appellant) was indicted on five counts before the District Court. The Appellant plead guilty to the first count which was assault occasioning bodily harm to his de facto wife. The remaining four counts were assault occasioning actually bodily harm to his son, an act of indecency, and two charges of sexual intercourse without consent. The Appellant pleaded not guilty to each of these four counts. 
        
        
       During the course of the Crown evidence, the Appellant changed his plea such that he plead guilty to all five counts on the indictment. Pursuant to s399A of the  
       Crimes Act 
        1900 (now s91 of the  
       Criminal Procedure Act 
        1986) the Appellant was rearraigned and he pleaded guilty to all counts. The judge accepted all of the pleas of guilty and discharged the jury accordingly. The judge proceeded with a hearing on sentence. That hearing was adjourned until a later date. 
        
        
       At the further proceedings on sentence, the Appellant indicated that he wished to withdraw his plea of guilty in relation to the last four counts on the original indictment. Graham DCJ determined that by virtue of s91(2) of the  
       Criminal Procedure Act 
       , he had no jurisdiction to allow a withdrawal of the guilty pleas. The Appellant appeals this decision and also alleges a miscarriage of justice by virtue of his entering the guilty pleas.

       Jurisdiction of District Court 
        
        
       The word “finding” in s91(2) should not be given an overly technical meaning. His Honour’s acts in accepting the pleas of guilty, discharging the jury and commenting that there was no longer a need for a trial and that the pleas were “all that the law requires in order to establish his guilt” were sufficient to constitute a “finding” in the relevant sense. His Honour was correct to determine that he had no jurisdiction to entertain the application for withdrawal of the guilty pleas.

        JUDGMENT 
         
         
        
        
        
         
        
       
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant faced five charges before the District Court relating to incidents that occurred at his family home at North Parramatta on 14 June 1999. 
      
       
     2    The first count in the indictment asserted that he had assaulted Ms Quire Menzies, his de facto wife, occasioning actual bodily harm to her. To this charge he pleaded guilty from the outset and never changed his plea. 
      
       
     3    With respect to the other four charges he initially pleaded not guilty. He changed his plea to guilty in the course of the trial but subsequently sought to resile from the guilty plea. The four charges were alleged to have occurred on 14 June 1999 at North Parramatta. They included a charge alleging assault occasioning actual bodily harm to his son Joshua; a charge alleging an act of indecency towards his de facto by unzipping his pants and urinating on her; and two charges of sexual intercourse without consent by requiring her to perform fellatio and by penile vaginal penetration, in each case in circumstances of aggravation by reason of threatening her with actual bodily harm. 
      
       
     4    When first called upon to do so, the Appellant pleaded not guilty to each of these four counts. On 15 February 2000 the Crown opened and the complainant was called. She gave evidence concerning the alleged offences. It appears that her evidence was substantially complete. The Crown Prosecutor asked for a short adjournment to have a conference with a medical witness who had just arrived, before completing examination in chief of the complainant. 
      
       
     5    During the course of this adjournment the Appellant indicated to his legal representatives that he wished to change his plea. His Honour adjourned the matter so that full instructions could be given. After the adjournment, counsel for the Appellant indicated that the instructions had been confirmed. His Honour’s attention was directed to the provisions of s399A of the Crimes Act 1900, which has now been re-enacted as s91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and which I will hereinafter set out. 
      
       
     6    His Honour indicated that s399A did apply in the circumstances before him. His Honour proceeded to have the accused rearraigned and the indictment read to him. The Appellant pleaded guilty to the further four counts. The following then occurred in the absence of the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: ‘Is there any reason why I should not accept the plea in those circumstances?’ 
         
        
        
         
         BOYD: ‘Not that I can put.’ 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: ‘No your Honour.’ 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: ‘In those circumstances I am satisfied that the Court should accept those pleas of guilty and I propose to discharge the jury under s399A of the  
         Crimes Act 
         .’ “ 
         
        
       
     7    The jury was then recalled and his Honour explained to them what had happened. In the course of his remarks to the jury his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The charges from 2-5 have been read to him again and he has now pleaded guilty in respect of each of those charges. So it follows that for all of the charges on the indictment the accused has now pleaded guilty. That means that there is no longer any need either for a trial or for a jury.” 
         
        
       
     8    His Honour also said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The accused has now formally and publicly admitted his guilt in respect of each of those charges and that is all that the law requires in order to establish his guilt because I have accepted those pleas. It follows that the court is obliged to discharge the jury. There is, in any event, nothing left for you to decide.” 
         
        
       
     9    His Honour proceeded on that same day with a hearing on sentence. A criminal history in both New Zealand and Australia was tendered. Furthermore, a Statement of Facts was tendered which related to a prior occasion on which he had assaulted his de facto. Counsel for the Appellant indicated that an adjournment was needed to obtain a pre-sentence report and, perhaps, some expert evidence on the Appellant’s alcoholism. The matter was set down for further hearing on sentence. 
      
       
     10    When the proceedings on sentence recommenced on 30 March 2000 counsel appearing for the Appellant indicated that he had received instructions that morning from the prisoner that he wished to change his plea. Withdrawal of the plea related only to Counts 2-5 of the original indictment. The legal representatives of the Appellant were given leave to withdraw. 
      
       
        
       Jurisdiction of District Court 
        
       
     11    When the matter returned before his Honour Judge Graham on 16 June 2000, a preliminary issue arose as to whether or not his Honour had any jurisdiction to continue to hear the matter by reason of the application of s91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That section relevantly provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “91(1) If an accused person pleads ‘guilty’ to an offence at any time after having been given into the charge of a jury, and the court accepts the plea, the court is to discharge the jury from giving a verdict in the matter and to find the accused person guilty of the offence. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) The finding has effect as if it were the verdict of the jury, and the accused person is liable to punishment accordingly.” 
         
        
       
     12    The issue was whether, by reason of s91(2), his Honour could take any steps once there has been a deemed jury verdict. The case for the Appellant before his Honour was that s91(2) had not come into effect because nowhere in the transcript was there an express finding in the terms of the final clause of s91(1) i.e. “… to find the accused person guilty of the offence”. I quoted the transcript above. As there appears, his Honour expressly referred to the court ‘accepting the plea’ and to ‘discharging the jury’, but there are no words, in terms, stating that the accused was ‘found’ to be guilty. 
      
       
     13    It is authoritatively established that once the jury has returned a verdict the trial judge has no discretion to permit the accused to withdraw a plea of guilty. (See R v Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 226-227). The contrary was not argued before his Honour or in this Court. 
      
       
     14    Counsel who appeared for the Appellant before his Honour submitted that the occasion for the application of s91(2), which was conceded to have the same effect as the common law position to which I have referred, had not arisen. Section 91(2) commences with the words “The finding has effect …”. The reference to “the finding” is a reference to the final clause of s91(1) i.e. “to find the accused person guilty of the offence”. The submission below, and in this Court, was that as there had been no such “finding”, s91(2) did not operate. 
      
       
     15    His Honour concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “It seems to me, in the present case, that there was not only an acceptance of a plea but that the court had acted upon it so as to constitute an implicit finding of guilt. That occurred in two ways. In the first place by taking the next step under s91, having formally accepted the plea, of discharging the jury and secondly, by then proceeding to commence the sentencing hearing. The first of those events is antecedent to the finding of guilt, in the language of the section, though it seems that, conceptually, they are simply two parallel consequences which flow from the court’s acceptance of the plea of guilty. There arises, at that point, a duty to do two things, not necessarily sequentially. Although, for reasons of constitutional propriety and in recognition of the importance of the jury system, no doubt the ordinary form of procedure would be to discharge the jury and then to return a formal finding of guilt, but, in the ultimate analysis, the two events are concurrent rather than sequential upon each other. 
         
        
        
         
         In other words, once the pleas of guilty are accepted and the next step taken under s91, then it seems to me implicit in the discharge of the jury that there was also a finding of guilt. That is confirmed and perhaps independently supported by the conduct of the court thereafter in proceeding to consideration of the question of sentence.” (114-115) 
         
        
       
     16    His Honour went on to hold that he had no jurisdiction to entertain the accused’s notice of motion to set aside or withdraw his plea of guilty. His Honour went on to “for more abundant caution”, as he expressed it, to make an express finding of guilt in relation to these matters. 
      
       
     17    In reaching this decision his Honour relied on the judgment of Dawson and McHugh JJ in Maxwell v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 501 at 509 where their Honours said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Thus whilst a plea of guilty is a confession of guilt, it does not itself amount to a conviction. A conviction does not occur until there is an acceptance of the plea amounting to a determination of guilt by the court. The determination of guilt forms part of the judgment of the court but it can occur otherwise than by the formal entry of the plea upon the record of the court. Of course, the formal entry of the plea upon the record may afford the clearest evidence of a determination of the court, and the determination may otherwise occur when the court acts so as to indicate unequivocally its acceptance of the plea.” 
         
        
        
       
     18    Their Honours also said at 507: 
      
       
        
         
         “The question of what amounts to a conviction admits of no single, comprehensive answer. Indeed, the answer to the question rather depends upon the context in which it is asked. On the one hand, a verdict of guilty by a jury or a plea of guilty upon arraignment has been said to amount to a conviction. On the other hand it has been said that there can be no conviction until there is a judgment of the court, ordinarily in the form of a sentence, following upon the verdict plea. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         The context in which the question arises for present purposes is that of autrefois convict and in that context it would seem clear that a verdict or plea of guilty is insufficient of itself to constitute a conviction. That accords with the principle lying behind the plea of autrefois convict which is that a person should not be punished more than once for the same matter.” 
         
        
       
     19    Their Honours went on to refer with approval to a passage in the judgment of Gibbs J in the Supreme Court of Queensland in R v Jerome & McMahon [1964]Qd R 595 at 604. With respect to the facts in that case, Gibbs J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the present case the court has done nothing upon the plea of guilty to indicate a determination of the question of guilt. The court might do that by imposing a punishment; by discharging a prisoner on his own recognisance; by releasing him upon parole; or even perhaps by adjourning the proceedings to enable information relevant only to the question of sentence to be obtained. Nothing of that kind occurred in the present case. The pleas of guilty, it is true, were said to be accepted, but they were never acted upon in such a way that the court finally determined the guilt of the accused person.” 
         
        
       
     20    The passage in the reasons of Gibbs J which states that “perhaps” a sufficient step would be taken if a court adjourned proceedings to enable information relevant only to the question of sentence to be obtained, is directly pertinent to the present case. 
      
       
     21    In Maxwell Dawson and McHugh JJ referred to the reasoning of the majority of the court in Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 and in particularly to the judgment of Aickin J in that case. In Griffiths at 335-336 Aickin J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was argued for the applicant that, before there was a conviction, the trial judge must use some express words to indicate the situation, such as ‘I convict the accused’. I can see no reason why conviction may not occur by indirect words or by conduct. If a trial judge does some act consistent only with there being a conviction, I do not consider that he must utter some formula to make that action effective.” 
         
        
       
     22    In Griffiths itself, reliance was placed on the fact that not only had the applicant in that case adhered to his plea of guilty, but the trial judge had accepted the plea and went on to hear evidence in relation to determination of sentence. 
      
       
     23    In Maxwell, Gaudron and Gummow JJ also referred with approval to the passage of Gibbs J in Jerome & McMahon and to the majority judgments in Griffiths v The Queen. Their Honours said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The nature of the exercise involved in the rejection of a plea and then the grant of leave to withdraw a plea is such, in our view, that it must be concluded that conviction only occurs when the court does some act which indicates that it has determined guilt or, which is the same thing, that it has accepted that the accused is criminally responsible for the offence in question.” 
         
        
       
     24    In Maxwell the court was concerned with the issue of what constitutes a “conviction” for the purposes of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. A number of authorities indicate that the word “conviction” takes its colour from its context. (See eg Director of Public Prosecutions v McCoid [1988] VR 982 at 987; Della Patrona v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (No 2) (1995) 38 NSWLR 257 at 265. 
      
       
     25    In the present case the Court is concerned with what constitutes a ‘finding’ to the effect that an accused person is “guilty of the offence”. Authorities on the word “conviction” are helpful but not determinative in this regard. 
      
       
     26    In the Second Reading Speech for the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Procedure) Act which introduced s399A into the Crimes Act 1900, the Minister said: 
      
       
        
         
         “(s399A) amends a somewhat formal procedure. Currently once the accused is placed in the charge of the jury only the jury may bring down a verdict and thereby end a trial. Accordingly if the accused changes his or her plea from not guilty to guilty during the course of the trial, the accused must be rearraigned and plead guilty before the jury. The judge thereupon directs the jury to bring down a verdict of guilty. This procedure is rather time wasting and, no doubt, sometimes a little confusing for jurors. The amendment vests a power in the judge to accept a plea of guilty in the course of the proceedings without the involvement of the jury. The judge can discharge the jury from giving a verdict and find the accused guilty. It is important to note that the finding of a judge will have the same effect as if it were the verdict of the jury.” 
          
         
        
       
     27    The difficulties to which the Minister referred had been highlighted in this Court’s decision in R v Ross, NSWCCA, 20 April 1994 (unreported). 
      
       
     28    The objective of the legislation was to avoid an excessively formal procedure that was devoid of substance. In such a context, the words “to find the accused person guilty of the offence” should not be given an overly technical meaning. It is sufficient if, in substance, there has been a finding of the relevant character. There does not, in my opinion, have to be a finding to this effect in express terms. 
      
       
     29    The crucial decision for the Court under s91(1) is the decision of the Court to ‘accept the plea’. Once an act of acceptance has occurred - as happened in this case in express terms - the statutory formulation states that “the court is to discharge the jury … and to find the accused person guilty …”. The mandatory terms of this provision also suggest that no express advertence is required. Once the Court has formulated an act of acceptance, the obligation is to perform the other two steps. In this formulation the word “and” means “and” not “or” or “each”. Both steps are obliged to be taken. They are, as his Honour put it “concurrent” rather than “sequential”. 
      
       
     30    In his remarks to the jury, following upon his Honour’s express acceptance of the plea, his Honour said “there is no longer any need either for a trial or for a jury”. The reference to the absence of the need for a jury may be seen as referable to that part of s91(1) which refers to the discharge of the jury. However, the express reference to the fact that there was now no longer a need for a trial of any character, is a clear indication that the trial judge had made a finding of guilt. To similar effect is his Honour’s reference to the fact of the admission of guilt as “all that the law requires in order to establish his guilt”. These two references, together with the formal commencement of proceedings on sentence, constitute “an unequivocal indication” that the accused had been found guilty - to adopt the terminology of Aiken J in Griffiths supra at 336, applied by Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Maxwell at 531-532. 
      
       
     31    In my opinion his Honour made a finding of guilt. His Honour was correct to conclude that, as a result of the application of s91(2), he had no jurisdiction to entertain the application for withdrawal of the plea. 
      
       
        
       Miscarriage of justice 
        
       
     32    The second ground of appeal alleges a miscarriage of justice. There are exceptional cases in which this Court will set aside a conviction following a plea. The relevant authorities have recently been considered in this Court in R v Toro-Martinez [2000] NSWCCA 216. A number of circumstances have been identified when this Court will act, notwithstanding a plea of guilty: 
      
       
     · Where the Appellant “did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered” (R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 ACrimR 231 at 233. 
      
       
     · Where the plea was not “a free and voluntary confession” (R v Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 220 D-E). 
      
       
     · The “plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt” (R v Murphy)  [1965] VR 187 at 191). 
      
       
     · Where there was “mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt” (R v Sagiv (1986) 22 ACrimR 73 at 80). 
      
       
     · Where the “plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the applicant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty …some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt” (R v Cincotta NSWCCA 1 November 1995 (unreported)). 
      
       
     · The “plea of guilty must either be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt” (Maxwell v The Queen (supra) at 511. 
      
       
     · If “the person who entered the plea was not in possession of all of the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt” (R v Davies NSWCCA 16 December 1993 (unreported)). See also R v Ganderton NSWCCA 17 September 1998 (unreported) and R v Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320). 
      
       
     33    Particularly pertinent for the present case is a frequently cited passage in the judgment of Badgery-Parker J in R v Davies (supra) where his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the plea was not entered into with full knowledge of the facts and as a genuine recognition of guilt, and if the material before the Court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused, then the proper course must be to set aside the plea of guilty, to quash the conviction and to order a new trial.” 
         
        
       
     34    The issue is whether or not the material before this Court suggests anything of this character. 
      
       
        
       The Appellant’s Case 
        
       
     35    The Appellant advanced two reasons for his plea of guilty. The first can be quickly disposed of. He suggested that he was influenced by his legal representatives’ indications that he would receive a discount on the sentence that would otherwise be imposed if he pleaded guilty. The solicitor who represented him at the trial gave evidence. She said that she would have advised the Appellant, as a matter of standard procedure, that a plea of guilty would result in the Court showing some leniency. 
      
       
     36    This is entirely proper and accurate advice. It is advice that the Court encourages legal representatives of accused persons to give. Nothing in the Appellant’s version of the way in which this advice was conveyed would suggest that there was any element of pressure on the part of his legal representatives, or any other aspect of their conduct in this regard, which could induce a person who genuinely believed that he or she was not guilty of an offence to plead guilty. 
      
       
     37    The second reason given for the change of plea was expressed by the Appellant in terms of his response to the evidence that his de facto gave against him in Court. It was in the immediate wake of her giving the substantive evidence of the events in June 1999, establishing each of the five counts, that he gave instructions to change his plea. 
      
       
     38    In his affidavit he indicated that the complainant had visited him in prison on the Friday before the trial. In successive paragraphs of this affidavit he gave two versions of this conversation. 
      
       
     39    He first said that she said to him: “Don’t worry darling I will tell the Court the truth that I lied in my statement.” This being a reference to her police statement which, if she retracted, would have favoured the accused at the trial. 
      
       
     40    In the next paragraph of his statement he says that what she said to him was:  
      
       
        
         
         “Darling I will tell the truth to the Court when I give evidence next week. 
         
        
        
       This statement does not necessarily assist the Appellant. 
        
       
     41    On the basis of these statements he formed an impression, according to his affidavit that the complainant would tell what he asserted to be “the truth”. 
      
       
     42    In this Court the Appellant maintained his innocence of the four charges. His solicitor at the trial gave evidence and she affirmed that he had asserted his innocence until the point of time during the trial that he instructed her and his counsel to change his plea. This was an instruction which he gave to her in writing. She confirmed that he was very distressed at the time that he gave these instructions. 
      
       
     43    In his affidavit the Appellant said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I entered the plea of guilty at court after Ms Menzies gave her evidence because I was shell shocked. I could not believe that she had not told the truth in the witness box. I called my solicitor over and I said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Just pull the pin.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         I was shattered and I could not believe what was happening. I was not thinking clearly or logically. I was shocked that Ms Menzies could be railroaded into telling lies the way she did. At the time I thought that if I plead guilty the children would not be taken away from Ms Menzies. 
         
        
        
         
         Now that I’m thinking clearly and I realise that Ms Menzies lied in court because she was scared of losing her children, but they would probably not be taken away from her I want to prove my innocence. I only pleaded guilty because I was very upset and because I was told by my representatives that if I did not I would lose the discount on my sentence. This is the reason I asked this honourable court to allow me to change my plea to Not Guilty.” 
         
        
       
     44    On 15 February 2000 the complainant was called to give evidence before lunch. During that period she gave evidence only about the first count, namely the count to which the Appellant had always pleaded guilty and from which plea he has never resiled. 
      
       
     45    It was after lunch when the complainant returned to the witness box that she gave evidence about the four counts to which, at that point, he had pleaded not guilty. 
      
       
     46    The plea occurred immediately after Ms Menzies had given the substance of her evidence in chief which, if it had been accepted by the jury, would have led to the conviction of the Appellant on all charges. The Appellant contends that he had an expectation at the time that Ms Menzies would not give such evidence and that the shock of listening to her actual evidence was such that he agreed to enter a plea notwithstanding a continuing belief in his innocence. 
      
       
     47    If that evidence were accepted by this Court then in accordance with the appropriate tests to which I have referred above, there would have been sufficient doubt as to the bona fide nature of the plea for this Court to allow the appeal and direct a new trial be held. In my view this evidence should be rejected. I am quite satisfied that the plea did represent a genuine consciousness of guilt on the part of the Appellant as at the time it was entered. 
      
       
     48    In his affidavit the Appellant said: 
      
       
        
         
         “During the luncheon break my father’s partner Karen Tiki (I think that is what her surname is) overheard a conversation between the Prosecution and Ms Menzies. They were standing outside the court when the court adjourned for lunch and my mother told me that Quire Menzies said to her that the Prosecutor said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘If you don’t give the same evidence that you made in your statement we will have to have you psychologically assessed.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         I am aware that Ms Menzies was terrified of losing her children. I believed that the pressure placed on her by the Prosecution induced her to lie to the court. Ms Menzies said to me on several occasions: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘I am terrified that DOCS will take my children away from me. I can’t let them do that.’ “ 
           
          
         
        
       
     49    In an affidavit filed in these proceedings the Crown Prosecutor said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I deny that I ever said this or anything like this to Ms Menzies. I deny attempting in any way to influence the evidence Ms Menzies gave in the matter.” 
         
        
       
     50    An officer of the Department of Community Services said in her affidavit: 
      
       
        
         
         “I note in particular the claims of the appellant in the affidavit and submissions in which it is alleged that DOCS officers made certain statements to Ms Menzies to the effect that if Ms Menzies dropped the charges against the appellant the Department would take her children away from her. In response, I deny that I ever told Ms Menzies what evidence she would give in court or whether she should continue to press the charges against the appellant. My recollection is that I said to Ms Menzies words to the effect that if she decides to continue to live with the appellant the Department would have to intervene because of the concerns the Department had for the welfare of the children.” 
         
        
       
     51    I note that the alleged conversation during the luncheon adjournment was said to be overheard by a person described as the Appellant’s father’s partner. That person has not given any evidence in this regard. 
      
       
     52    The denials of the Crown prosecutor and of the DOCS officer should be accepted. No such threat or inducement was proffered to Ms Menzies. 
      
       
     53    Ms Menzies gave evidence in this Court and was cross-examined by the Appellant himself, he having been denied legal aid. In her affidavit she affirmed that the evidence that she gave in the District Court was true. She denied that, on the occasion that she visited him in prison just before the trial, she had said: “Don’t worry darling I will tell the court the truth that I lied in my statement”. She also denied that the Prosecutor had said anything to her to the effect that: “If you don’t give the same evidence that you made in your statement we will have to have you psychologically assessed”. She said in her statement that representatives of the Department of Community Services did tell her that if she continued to live with the Appellant or drop the charges against him they would remove her children from her care. She added: “However, the pressure from the Department did not induce me to tell lies to the court. My evidence to the court was the truth”. 
      
       
     54    The complainant referred to an affectionate letter she had written to the Appellant (and on which he had relied) in which she said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Well darling I still love you I always will and yes we miss you heaps but I don’t want to feel like you are going to blame me for what happened. I don’t know how long you’ve got but I’m sorry I didn’t help you but there was a reason for me not to tell them what you would have wanted me to do.” 
         
        
       
     55    In his affidavit, the Appellant suggested that she could not tell what he called “the truth” because of the threat to her having her children taken away. However the passage is entirely equivocal in this respect. 
      
       
     56    However, Ms Menzies said in her affidavit: 
      
       
        
         
         “I meant by this statement that there was a reason why I did not lie to the court as the appellant requested.” 
         
        
        
       I accept this evidence. 
        
       
     57    In the course of her oral evidence before the Court, Ms Menzies emphasised on a number of occasions that the Appellant had asked her to give false evidence, which she had not done. She produced to the Court a document, in the handwriting of the Appellant, which the Appellant confirmed to be such, that set out in detail the precise evidence that she should give. The thrust of the evidence was to inculpate him with respect to the first count - being the charge to which he had pleaded guilty, without any question, from the outset - but to withdraw her statements with respect to the other charges and to indicate that the incidents upon which the four charges were based had not in truth occurred. At the foot of this two page detailed statement, drafted by the Appellant to be expressed by the complainant in her own name, the Appellant had written: 
      
       
        
         
         “If they ask you anything babe. Just stick to this please and we will be back as a family again soon.” 
         
        
       
     58    This document undermines the Appellant’s case. It shows that he sought to induce the complainant to give evidence in his favour in an orchestrated manner, inconsistent with this version being the truth. Its existence explains the basis of his hope or expectation that Ms Menzies may not give evidence in accordance with her original police statement. 
      
       
     59    The Appellant tendered some documents and directed a number of submissions designed to attack the credit of Ms Menzies. Indeed, at one stage in her cross-examination by him, she admitted that she had lied in the past, although maintaining that she was not lying in any respect relevant to these proceedings.  
      
       
     60    The Appellant tendered a statement signed by Ms Menzies which constituted a withdrawal of her original complaint to the police in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “I Quire Menzies have made a complaint to police relating to an assault and a sexual assault committed upon me by my de facto husband Darren Hura. I now wish to retract my complaint. I will not attend court and give evidence against Darren Hura and I want no further police action taken in this matter.” 
         
        
       
     61    This statement was timed and dated 3.00pm 2 July 1999. It is noteworthy that in this statement she does not deny the truth or accuracy of her original allegations, including the allegation of sexual assault. She simply says she wishes to “retract my complaint”. 
      
       
     62    Some time after this withdrawal of complaint, an officer from the Department of Community Services visited their home. After that visit, the Appellant said in his affidavit, that the complainant told him: 
      
       
        
         
         “Darren DOCS have been here and they are going to take my children off me.” 
         
        
        
         
         and  
         
        
        
         
         “They told me that if I dropped the charges against you they’ll have to take my children away from me because these are very serious charges.” 
         
        
       
     63    The Crown tendered a subsequent statement made on 20 July 1999 to the police, also signed by Ms Menzies, where she said: 
      
       
        
         
         “On the 16 June 1999 I made a statement to Detective Senior Constable McNabb about a report of a sexual assault upon myself by my husband Darren Hura. About the 6 July 1999 I made a retraction statement to Detective McNabb that I did not wish to proceed with the charges for this matter. I retracted this because I was in fear of my life and the lives of my children. 
         
        
        
         
         My husband came back to stay at my house last week. The police have been to see my last week and Darren has told me he seen the police here. Last night (19 July 1999) he came home drunk and he was being verbally abusive to me. He was saying to me not to speak with the police not to go out of the house and that he would be watching me. 
         
        
        
         
         This has caused my fears to be worsened about him and I now ask the police to take further action about when he raped me back on the 14 June 1999. I do not with to add or retract from my original statement which I made on 16 June 1999.” 
         
        
       
     64    In her evidence in this Court, Ms Menzies confirmed that she made the original retraction statement out of fear and that her first statement to the police was an accurate statement of the truth. 
      
       
     65    I formed the opinion that her evidence in this respect should be accepted. No doubt, if a trial had occurred, this course of events would have led to cross-examination on credit. It does not however suggest anything which casts even a shadow of doubt on the integrity of the plea. 
      
       
     66    The Appellant directed a number of other submissions to matters which may have been used by a cross-examiner to test the complainant’s credit. These included a reference in a hospital report to her consent to the oral sex which occurred on the day, contrary to the charge; the absence of any reference by the son in a conversation which occurred the day after the assault to any injury to himself, in contrast with the son pointing out the injury to the mother; and evidence from a third party about the alleged proclivity of the complainant to tell lies. None of this evidence makes me doubt in any respect the accuracy of the account which Ms Menzies has given to this Court. 
      
       
     67    I accept her evidence that she had not given the Appellant any basis for believing that she would give evidence contrary to her statement. I accept her evidence that he had sought to have her give evidence in a way that would exculpate him from the four charges to which he originally pleaded not guilty. 
      
       
     68    The Appellant gave the appearance of, and such of his prior history as is before the Court confirms he is, a man who expects that the women in his life will succumb to his will. Perhaps for that reason he harboured some hope, even an expectation, that when it came to the ultimate act of giving evidence in Court, Ms Menzies would fail to tell the truth. When this hope was dashed on the day, he decided to plead guilty in order to obtain such advantage on sentence as he could obtain at that time. No doubt he was upset and agitated, but not to a degree which clouded his judgment in this regard. 
      
       
     69    In my opinion there is no reason to doubt the integrity of the plea. The plea represented a genuine recognition of guilt. There is no real question about the guilt of the Appellant. 
      
       
     70    The appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     71    SIMPSON J: I agree with the order proposed by Spigelman CJ and with his reasons therefor. 
      
       
     72    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree with the judgment of Spigelman CJ.

      RAMADAN v LEDA HOLDINGS PTY LIMITED 
      
     FACTSThe appellant alleged that she had slipped and fallen on steps at the respondent’s premises in Hunter Street, Sydney. The Statement of Claim in respect of this accident was filed out of time. The trial judge found that the plaintiff had not adequately explained her delay in the filing of the Statement of Claim, and that the defendant would be prejudiced by an extension of time, and dismissed the proceedings. ON APPEALHELD per Giles JA (Handley JA agreeing):(i) The appellant submitted that she was denied a proper hearing as to delay. The trial judge’s early observation that he believed the appellant’s onus had been discharged with respect to delay, when properly considered in light of the evidence as it was fully exposed and the submissions of the parties, did not indicate that the matter of delay was no longer in issue.; (Meagher JA agreeing)(ii) There is no indication that the trial judge exercised his discretion in an arbitrary fashion. Although his reference to past appellate reversals was inappropriate, it is impossible to see in these remarks abandonment of the exercise of a judicial discretion or proper regard to authority. Per Meagher JA:There was no exercise by the trial judge of any discretion which was in any way capricious. (iii) No miscarriage of justice occurred on the basis of a failure by the trial judge to address a particular of negligence. The particular of negligence in question was an unhelpful generality which did not materially add to the preceding particulars, and as such the trial judge did not fail to address such.Per Meagher JA:The trial judge did address all particulars of negligence, but of greater importance, was not obliged to do so once it became apparent that the plaintiff’s application had to fail.(iv) Any error that was made by the trial judge as to the medical-related prejudice to the respondent does not undermine the dismissal of the application for extension of time. The evidence permitted the finding that individual cleaners could not be found, and the view that there was prejudice arising from this contributed to the prejudice to the respondent on which the trial judge’s discretion was exercised.Per Meagher JA:The trial judge’s factual error with respect to medical evidence was not part of any step essential to his reasoning.ORDERSAppeal be dismissed with costs.THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOURT OF APPEAL

      RAMADAN v LEDA HOLDINGS PTY LIMITED 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1   MEAGHER JA: This is an appeal by a plaintiff from a decision by Christie DCJ refusing an application to extend the period allowed under the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) in order to bring proceedings in which she alleged negligence against the defendant, the present respondent. It was a “slipping” case. She was alleged to have slipped at a place called the Hunter Connection.  
     2   The application was brought under ss 60C and 60E of the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW).  
     3   The accident took place on 7 June 1995; the period of limitation expired on 7 June 1998; the plaintiff filed her Statement of Claim on 11 June 1998, four days out of time; the Notice of Motion seeking an extension of time was filed on 4 September 1998.  
     4   The issues in the case were 1) whether the plaintiff had adequately explained her delay in filing the Statement of Claim, and 2) whether the defendant would be prejudiced by an extension. His Honour found adversely to the plaintiff on both issues. I think that, on any view of the law, his Honour was quite right.  
     5   In analysing the case, his Honour placed great reliance, as is proper, on the judgments of the High Court in Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor (1996) 186 CLR 541, and, as subsequent events (particularly the decision of this Court in Holt v Winter [2000] 49 NSWLR 128) make clear, on the judgment of McHugh J in that case.  
     6   In this regard, his Honour vigorously disregarded the fact that the Statement of Claim was filed only four days late. Before Taylor’s case the New South Wales Court of Appeal held that the statutory tests amounted to asking whether the defendant was any worse off than it would have been if the action had been commenced within time but towards the end of the limitation period. That, we now know, is a wrong approach. In the present case it is a delay of 3 years and 4 days which has to be explained, not merely a delay of 4 days. And it is prejudice to the defendant as at the date of the filing of the Statement of Claim which must be examined, no matter what was the date of its origin.  
     7   A vital witness in the action would have been a Miss Braithwaite, and, although she was discovered towards the end of the limitation period her memory of the incident (which she had witnessed) had evaporated; and this was also the situation of another eye-witness, Miss Ashland. Moreover, the cleaner on duty on that day could not be located, nor was his identity known. The cleaning company by which he was employed could not discover its contract to clean the premises, and Westpac’s employment records had vanished.  
     8   Moreover, her medical state attributable to the fall at the Hunter Connection was, relevantly, difficult to analyse, as it was complicated by a later fall at or near a Franklins store, and also by two earlier accidents.  
     9   These being the relevant facts, how could the defendant have expected a fair trial if an extension were granted? How could it not have been prejudiced, and significantly?  
     10   I shall now deal with the four specific grounds of appeal, although it is apparent from what I have said that none of them has anything to do with contradicting the absence of any rebuttal of delay or prejudice. The first was that at some stage earlier in the hearing of this motion his Honour indicated that the delay had been satisfactorily explained, leaving only the alleged absence of prejudice to be explained. It is true that his Honour did make such an indication to that effect, but it must have been only a passing indication of what he was thinking at that moment. This is made clear by his subsequent conduct of the case. The plaintiff’s solicitor was cross-examined on that very topic after his Honour’s remark, and both sides addressed his Honour on the subject of delay in their final submissions to him.  
     11   The second ground of appeal concerns some semi-jocose remarks his Honour made on the fickleness of discretionary judgments. But there is no exercise by his Honour of any discretion which is in any way capricious.  
     12   The third ground of appeal was that his Honour dealt with only three of the four acts of negligence alleged by the plaintiff. In my view, reading his Honour’s remarks as a whole, I think he did deal with all four. But, what is perhaps of greater importance, his Honour was not obliged to do so once it became apparent that the plaintiff’s application had to fail, whatever the precise acts of negligence alleged.  
     13   The fourth ground of appeal arises out of a remark which the judge made in his judgment: 
      
       
        
        “all of the medical evidence so far made available by the plaintiff to the defendant relates to conversations with doctors obviously after the incident of 7 June 1995 but also after the incident that is said to have taken place in Franklins in March 1998.” 
        
       
     14   His Honour’s remark is factually wrong. The defendant’s counsel concedes this. However it does not matter, because it was not part of any step essential to his reasoning. This is made plain by his Honour when summarising the plaintiff’s case. He said: 
      
       
        
        “ 
        Even without considering that 
         (sc, the medical evidence) I do not think the plaintiff has established why it would be that the Court should exercise discretion in her favour even though the period of time involved is comparatively minor.”  
        
       
     15   The appeal should be dismissed with costs. 16   HANDLEY JA: I agree with Giles JA.17   GILES JA: On 11 June 1998 the appellant brought proceedings in the District Court, alleging that she had slipped and fallen on steps at the respondent’s premises in Hunter Street, Sydney on 7 June 1995 and claiming damages. The proceedings were four days out of time. On 29 July 1998 the respondent filed a notice of motion claiming an order that the proceedings be dismissed. On 4 September 1998 the appellant filed a notice of motion claiming an extension of time within which to bring the proceedings until 12 June 1998. On 2 March 1999 Christie DCJ dismissed the appellant’s notice of motion and, either pursuant to the respondent’s notice of motion or because the appellant acknowledged that her claim must then fail, dismissed the proceedings.  
     18   In this appeal the appellant claimed orders setting aside his Honour’s orders and remitting her application for an extension of time to the District Court for re-hearing. 
     19   The appellant’s application was made under s 60C of the Limitation Act 1969, by which a court may extend a limitation period if it decides that it is just and reasonable to do so. By s 60E, in exercising that power the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, and without affecting the generality of that requirement is to have regard to a number of enumerated matters to the extent that they are relevant to the circumstances of the case. The first two enumerated matters are - 
      
       
        
        “(a) the length of and reasons for the delay; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the extent to which, having regard to the delay, there is or may be prejudice to the defendant by reason that evidence that would have been available if the proceedings had been commenced within the limitation period is no longer available.” 
        
       
       
     20   In the application before Christie DCJ the parties concentrated on these two matters. His Honour correctly proceeded on the basis that the appellant had to satisfy the court that it was just and reasonable to extend time, there being a discretion to grant and a not a discretion to refuse an extension of time (Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor (1996) 186 CLR 541;  Sydney City Council v Zegarac (1998) 43 NSWLR 195;  Holt v Wynter (2000) 49 NSWLR 128). As to delay, he was “of the view very marginally that the plaintiff has not … discharged an onus of explaining why it was not until three years four days after the incident that this statement of claim was filed”. As to prejudice to the respondent, he took Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor to establish that prejudice to the respondent was not confined to prejudice occasioned by the four days, and said that even if he were wrong as to delay he would be “of the view that the prejudice demonstrated by the defendant at this stage is prejudice of significance”. It is tolerably clear that his Honour regarded the unexplained delay and the prejudice to the respondent as independent bases for his not being satisfied that it was just and reasonable to extend time.  
     21   There were four grounds of appeal, the last of which was really two grounds. The grounds of appeal did not raise whether Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor established that prejudice to the respondent was not confined to prejudice occasioned by the four days, cf Sydney City Council v Zegarac at 197, 200 per Mason P.  
      
       
      Ground 1: Denial of procedural fairness 
       
     22   The appellant submitted that Christie DCJ denied her a proper hearing as to delay. Even if that were so, his Honour’s conclusion as to prejudice to the respondent stood as an independent basis for his decision, sufficient in itself (see Holt v Wynter at 147). But I do not think the appellant was denied a proper hearing.  
     23   The notices of motion came on for hearing on 4 February 1999. It seems they were reached late in the day, and the hearing was adjourned to 5 February 1999. After some further evidence was taken, on the appellant’s application the hearing was again adjourned so that the appellant could inquire into the whereabouts of a witness to the slipping incident. The hearing resumed and concluded on 1 March 1999.  
     24   A number of affidavits were provided to his Honour on 4 February 1999. They included an affidavit of the Ms Maria Bechara sworn 3 September 1998. Ms Bechara was the appellant’s solicitor, and deposed to steps taken to obtain reports from medical practitioners and to brief counsel to advise and draft “relevant documentation”. Counsel for the respondent indicated that he wished to cross-examine all the deponents, including Ms Bechara.  
     25   When the hearing of the motions resumed on 5 February 1999 his Honour suggested to counsel for the respondent that his “major complaint will be prejudice because you have lost a witness”. Counsel agreed, adding “more than one”. It seems before Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor was recalled to his mind, his Honour questioned whether being four days late could give rise to prejudice. He asked counsel for the respondent what his position would be as to prejudice if the appellant had commenced her proceedings six days earlier. Counsel replied that that was not the case, apparently meaning that his Honour’s question was founded on an erroneous approach to assessment of prejudice.  
     26   The transcript then records - 
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Well it is isn’t it if we get to prejudice because I think the lady can otherwise discharge the onus. She appears to have instructed the solicitors almost straight away and there appears nobody seemed to want the brief to do the statement of claim. Eventually it went through about 18 hands by the look of it. But its really only an accident of history that the thing is three or four days late isn’t it?” (sic) 
        
       
       
        
       
     27   After remarks by his Honour to which I will return in relation to ground of appeal 2, there was reference to Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor and the onus it placed on the appellant. In the course of this his Honour said, “I just started this conversation on the basis that I think the plaintiff is going to discharge that onus”.  
     28   The appellant submitted that in saying what he did his Honour indicated that he thought delay had been explained and the appellant’s onus discharged on that issue; that his Honour thereafter gave no indication that he was reconsidering or had resiled from that view; and that procedural fairness required that his Honour make known to the appellant that explanation for the delay was still a matter in issue. She said that there was a miscarriage of justice insofar as his Honour had disposed of her application for an extension of time on the basis of unexplained delay. 
     29   I am prepared to accept that in what he said his Honour did convey a preliminary view - indeed, a preliminary view extending to the issue of prejudice to the respondent, albeit without full appreciation of Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor. However, just as the issue of prejudice to the respondent was nonetheless canvassed by the parties in evidence and submissions, so also did the parties canvass the issue of unexplained delay. I consider that what his Honour said was at the time seen as what it was, no more than thinking aloud and always subject to proper consideration in the light of the evidence as it was fully exposed and the submissions of the parties.  
     30   Later on 5 February 1999 counsel for the appellant informed his Honour that Ms Bechara was present for cross-examination if desired, and the transcript records - 
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: What possible purpose would there be in -- 
        
       
       
        
        HOOK[counsel for the respondent]: Firstly the fact that nothing was done to timely prosecute the actual way … (not transcribable) from the affidavit -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: She can make submissions on the contents of her affidavit, is there anything in her affidavit you wish to test is the test as to whether you need to cross-examine her. I mean are you going to suggest that it’s wrong or something because the submissions you want to make about it will be apparent from the affidavit won’t they? 
        
       
       
        
        HOOK: Yes, that’s -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Unless there’s something you wish to contest. 
        
       
       
        
        HOOK: No your Honour.” 
        
       
       
        
       
     31   The transcript is incomplete and perhaps corrupt. But makes it plain that the respondent still considered explanation for delay a live issue, because counsel wished to cross-examine in relation to failure in timely prosecution of the appellant’s claim. And his Honour still anticipated that both parties would be putting submissions on that subject. Counsel for the appellant can not have been of a different view. 
     32   On 1 March 1999 counsel for the appellant informed his Honour that he understood that Ms Bechara was not required for cross-examination. The evidence concluded almost immediately thereafter, and the parties embarked on submissions. The submissions were not transcribed in full, but the record includes his Honour saying in the course of the submissions of counsel for the appellant, “The issue here is why the lady didn’t commence within time and if she’s out of time which isn’t by much whether that disentitles her, whether she can explain the delay”. Clearer confirmation, and notice to the appellant, that unexplained delay was exercising his Honour’s mind it would be hard to find. 
     33   This ground of appeal fails. 
      
       
      Ground 2: Arbitrary exercise of discretion 
       
     34   The ground of appeal took up some remarks made by Christie DCJ in the course of the hearing and some observations in his judgment, and in the words of the notice of appeal was that his approach to exercising his discretion “is arbitrary, subjective, idiosyncratic and does not accord with the objective principles governing the proper exercise of judicial discretion”.  
     35   Immediately after the exchange set out in para [10] above, the transcript records - 
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: If I were to refuse this application you’d be in the Court of Appeal before sunset, indeed before they had lunch. 
        
       
       
        
        HOOK: It wouldn’t trouble us your Honour on the authorities. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’ve knocked a few of these back over the years and the Court of Appeal will just find some reason to allow them. When did you last win one of these? I’m talking quite frankly. I knocked back a couple that I thought were outrageous and Mr Justice Kirby as he then was found some way to get the punter home.” 
        
       
       
        
       
     36   A little later in the discussion which followed counsel for the appellant observed that “we seem to be going on a debate about the matter before the evidence is complete”, and his Honour replied, “That’s because I always put the cart before the horse”. Counsel said that he did not want to be “cut off in regard to any evidence that I might wish to call your Honour”. 
     37   His Honour’s reasons delivered on 2 March 1999 included in relation to prejudice to the respondent - 
      
       
        
        “Consequently I think I encapsulate all that the defendant says about prejudice when I say that they cannot allegedly locate the cleaner because they cannot find the cleaning contract. They are prejudiced, they say, because Ms Braithwaite and Ms Ashland appear to have suffered some significant loss of memory or are in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. In any event they certainly do not seem to have any recollection of these events and I think I have made sufficient mention of the matter concerning the medical reports. 
        
       
       
        
        All of those things taken singularly I think have some importance, taken together, that is lumped together, I think they assume what Mr Justice McHugh described as the proportions of some prejudice of significance. So that, one bears in mind that it is not simply the question of prejudice that decides these matters. I have to look at that prejudice in the light of the overall situation presented by the plaintiff’s evidence whilst being careful, as has been pointed out in  
        Brisbane South Region v Taylor 
        , whilst being careful not to attempt to weigh one prejudice against the other so to speak and to draw some sort of comparison with a view to perhaps attempting to decide where the least injustice would occur. Because that is not really one’s duty in exercising the type of discretion available to a judge at first instance as, of course, Mr Justice McHugh makes perfectly clear. The limitation periods are enacted because the legislature makes a judgment that the chance of an unfair trial occurring after the limitation period has expired is sufficiently great to require the termination of the plaintiff’s right of action at the end of the period. 
        
       
       
        
        I confess that I find it difficult to exercise discretions this way. Sometimes I do it one way, sometimes the other, sometimes the Court of Appeal disagrees with me, sometimes they agree with me but when all is said and done it is for me to exercise my discretion in the manner which I see fit and not in a manner which I perceive some other jurisdiction might see fit.” 
        
       
       
        
       
     38   On the appellant’s argument, the early remarks and the observations in the last paragraph in this passage showed that his Honour exercised his discretion otherwise than judicially and otherwise than as required by Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor.  
     39   His Honour’s remarks and observations could have been better expressed, and even better not expressed at all. But I do not think they indicate an arbitrary exercise of discretion.  
     40   In his first remarks his Honour was addressing counsel for the respondent, and as I have earlier accepted was conveying a preliminary view that the appellant would satisfy him that an extension of time should be granted. His Honour inappropriately adverted to past appellate reversals, it seems in order to suggest that the respondent’s tasks in opposing the appellant’s application was not an easy one. But his Honour went on to find facts and apply legal principles to them in a proper way, and it is impossible to see in these remarks abandonment of the exercise of a judicial discretion or proper regard to authority. Indeed, the exercise of a judicial discretion brought his Honour to a conclusion the opposite of his preliminary view.  
     41   The remark about putting the cart before the horse was of no significance. There was discussion before the evidence was complete, as is not uncommon in order to explore or reach common ground upon what a hearing involves. There is no suggestion that the appellant was denied the opportunity to put before his Honour all the evidence on which she wished to rely. The remark was no more than a jocular aside.  
     42   The observations in his Honour’s reasons must be seen in context. The law had fluctuated in relation to weighing competing prejudices or concentrating on the prejudice to the defendant, and I am inclined to think that his Honour was rather wryly referring to the difficulties encountered by a trial judge in such circumstances. Be that as it may, his Honour was firmly and correctly stating that the discretion was his to exercise, and that he would not exercise it in a particular way for fear of reversal on appeal. He was not espousing an arbitrary exercise of discretion, but as the preceding paragraphs in the passage I have set out and the balance of his reasons show when exercising his discretion was seeking to direct himself in accordance with Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor in particular.  
     43   Although not comprehended by the ground of appeal, in the appellant’s written submissions it was also submitted that Christie DCJ had failed to give proper reasons for the manner in which he had exercised his discretion. It is enough to say that it is apparent from the reasons why his Honour came to the views I have earlier noted in relation to unexplained delay and prejudice to the respondent, and apparent from the reasons that having come to those views he was not satisfied that it was just and reasonable to extend the limitation period. 
     44   This ground of appeal also fails. 
      
       
      Ground 3: Failure to address all particulars of negligence 
       
        
       
     45   The appellant submitted that there had been a miscarriage of justice because Christie DCJ failed to address a particular of negligence as to which there was no or no material prejudice to the respondent telling against an extension of time. Putting aside whether there could be an extension of time for a claim founded on one particular of negligence but not on others, even if this were so his Honour’s conclusion as to unexplained delay was an independent basis for his decision. But I do not think the ground of appeal is well founded. 
     46   In para 3 of her statement of claim the appellant alleged that she was “walking on the steps to the food court … when she slipped on a substance which had been dropped on the floor, and fell down the stairs suffering injury loss and damage”. In para 4 of the statement of claim she then alleged - 
      
       
        
        “4. The injuries, loss and damage referred to in paragraph 3 above were caused by the negligence of the defendant, its servants or agents. 
        
       
       
       Particulars of Negligence 
       
       
        
        (a) Failure to institute and/or maintain any or any adequate system of inspection, reporting and cleaning of spillage’s. 
         
         
        (b) Failure to detect and clear the spillage. 
         
         
        (c) Failure to warn visitors to the premises such as the plaintiff of the presence of the spillage on the floor. 
         
         
        (d) Exposing the plaintiff to a risk of injury of which the defendant, by its employees or agents knew or ought to have known existed.” 
        
       
       
        
       
     47   As appears from the passage from his reasons set out in para [21] above, his Honour accepted that there was prejudice to the respondent in the inability to locate the cleaner on duty at the time because the cleaning contract could not be found; in the effect of the passage of time or a medical condition on two witnesses (being witnesses who had inspected the relevant area after the incident); and in a deficiency in relation to medical reports. The appellant submitted that notwithstanding that particulars (a), (b) and (c) were premised upon a spillage, particular (d), was not. So, it was said, the appellant could conduct a case such as slipping on negligently designed or constructed stairs to which the evidence of the cleaner and the other witnesses was not material, as to which the respondent was not relevantly prejudiced.  
     48   There would remain any prejudice in relation to medical reports, (although that prejudice was the subject of ground of appeal 4.1), and the submission rather generously assumed that a case of slipping on negligently designed or constructed stairs could not otherwise involve prejudice to the respondent. But the defect in the submission is more fundamental. Read in the light of para 3 of the statement of claim, the allegation of negligence was of negligence in allowing the substance on which the appellant slipped to be on the floor. Particular (d) was an unhelpful generality, regrettably of a kind not infrequently encountered, of little or no meaning in itself and having such meaning as came from particulars (a), (b) and (c). It did not materially add to the preceding particulars.  
     49   I do not accept that there was a separate case within particular (d) which his Honour failed to address. This ground of appeal also fails. 
      
       
      Ground 4.1: Error as to evidence 
       
     50   The appellant submitted that Christie DCJ was in error in saying in his reasons that the appellant had not seen any medical practitioners between 7 June 1995 and a subsequent accident at Franklins on 26 March 1998, and that this error “infected and tainted” his view as to prejudice to the respondent.  
     51   His Honour’s reasons included a passage to the effect that it was often said that a defendant suffered natural prejudice because the defendant did not have a timely medical examination of the plaintiff, or timely reference to the plaintiff’s medical records (described as “seeing medical records between the time of an alleged incident and the time that they actually learn that they are about to be sued”).  
     52   His Honour then said - 
      
       
        
        “But the defendant points out that  
        the doctors seen by the plaintiff were seen by her after a subsequent accident that occurred at Franklins 
        . Apparently she had a fall of some description at Franklins in March 1998. In addition it is pointed out that as it turns out from various histories and so on and from cross-examination of the plaintiff here, she was also involved in two earlier accidents pre-dating the alleged incident on 7 June 1995. So that in this particular instance it is said that this is the third of four incidents involving the plaintiff and it is pointed out on the information available, that the injuries allegedly sustained at Franklins in March 1998 appear to relate to identical parts of the body as might be alleged were injured in this particular incident in June 1995. So that any perceived prejudice or presumed prejudice in regard to medical records and the ascertainment of symptoms and so on at particular times, appears to carry some little more weight in a case in which two earlier incidents have been finalised and in which some of the injuries relate to the same parts of the body as here. A subsequent matter involving Franklins is apparently in the stages of litigation or about to become so, and that [sic]  
        all of the medical evidence so far made available by the plaintiff to the defendant relates to consultations with doctors obviously after the incident of 7 June 1995 but also after the incident that is said to have taken place at Franklins in March 1998 
        . I regard that matter of prejudice as being somewhat in common with what I would describe as presumed prejudice in relation to any delay in this type of matter of any other.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
        
       
     53   It is necessary to distinguish between the appellant consulting doctors and the appellant (in reality her solicitors) providing reports of consultations with doctors. The appellant had given evidence that she started seeing Dr Amin and Dr Giurgis after her fall at Franklins on 26 March 1998. It did not follow that the appellant had not consulted doctors after 7 June 1995 and before the fall at Franklins, and the respondent conceded that the appellant had in fact consulted doctors after 7 June 1995 and before the fall at Franklins. Consistently with that, however, the appellant might have provided to the respondent reports only of consultations with doctors after the fall at Franklins. 
     54   Given the introductory passage to which I have referred, in my view his Honour was focussing on the provision of reports of consultations with doctors. Read as referring to Drs Amin and Giurgis, the first emphasised part of the paragraph I have set out was correct. There were differing contentions in the appeal as to the evidence before his Honour showing what medical reports had been provided to the respondent. In the second emphasised part of the paragraph his Honour said that the reports were only of consultations with doctors after the fall at Franklins, and I am not persuaded that this was incorrect. The prejudice to the respondent in the nature of a presumed prejudice seen by his Honour was absence of timely reference to any medical reports of consultations with doctors after 7 June 1995 and before the fall at Franklins. He did not say that, or find prejudice to the respondent in that, the appellant had not seen any medical practitioners between 7 June 1995 and the fall at Franklins. The error asserted was not made: whether a different error was made in seeing the prejudice to the respondent was not the subject of a ground of appeal.  
     55   In any event, his Honour made it plain enough that the exercise of his discretion would have been the same even if the medical-related prejudice to the respondent were put aside. His Honour had referred to the importance of the matters earlier identified “taken singularly” and the proportions they assumed “lumped together”: see para [21]. At the conclusion of his reasons he said - 
      
       
        
        “Quite frankly to have one witness who does not recall the matter at all, to have another witness who does not recall it even though some conversation she had about the matter is recorded, I regard as significant prejudice to the defendant. When one marries that to the difficulties in relation to the medical evidence as I would perceive them, complicated as they are by a subsequent fall and alleged injuries to similar parts of the body, I think that prejudice of itself would have been sufficient to make the defendant’s opposition to this application successful. But I am of the view that  
        even without considering that 
        , I do not think the plaintiff has established why it would be that the Court should exercise discretion in her favour even though the period of time involved is comparatively minor.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
        
       
     56   Any error as to the medical-related prejudice to the respondent therefore does not undermine the dismissal of the application for extension of time. This ground of appeal also fails. 
      
       
      Ground 4.2: Further error as to evidence 
       
        
       
     57   The appellant initially sought to support this ground of appeal in a number of ways, differing between a narrative in the notice of appeal and the written submissions in support of the appeal. In the end the appellant came down to the submission that Christie DCJ had erred in finding that the cleaner could not be identified because the cleaning contract could not be found, and had erred because the affidavit of Theodore Grossman sworn 4 February 1999 did not permit that finding.  
     58   I have already referred to his Honour’s apparent acceptance of prejudice because “they cannot allegedly locate the cleaner because they cannot find the cleaning contract”: see para [21] above. Earlier in his reasons his Honour had said - 
      
       
        
        “The defendant also says that the actual cleaning contract has been mislaid or cannot be found in any event thereby depriving the defendant, so it is said, of the possibility of issuing a third party notice or cross claim in respect of whatever allegations are made by the prospective plaintiff regarding the cleanliness of these premises at The Hunter Connection. The identity of the cleaner, it is said, cannot be now ascertained. I suppose that follows as night follows day, if the cleaning contract itself cannot be located.” 
         
        
       
     59   Mr Grossman had been the manager of the respondent’s premises as at 7 June 1995. His affidavit included - 
      
       
        
        “9. On 4 February 1999, I had a conversation with the current centre manager of the premises, Sean Baker. Mr Baker informed me, and I verily believe, that the cleaners contracted to clean the premises in June 1995 were a company called Kennedy’s. Mr Baker also informed me, and I verily believe, that since the time of the alleged incident, Kennedy’s have been bought out by another company. 
         
         
        10. I do not have a copy of the cleaning contract for the relevant period. I am informed by Mr Baker, and do verily believe, that he has not been able to locate the cleaning contract. 
         
         
        11. I do not know the names of the individual cleaners who worked in the centre at the time of the alleged incident.” 
         
         
        
       
     60   It is evident that Mr Grossman was no longer the manager of the premises, although when he ceased to be manager was not revealed. There was no elucidation, in chief or by cross-examination, of whether he would have been expected to have a copy of the cleaning contract. The hearsay from Mr Baker was admitted without objection. One would expect the records under the control of the current manager, Mr Baker, to include the cleaning contract for the relevant period. On the hearsay evidence, it could not be found. One would expect the company called Kennedy’s to have had a copy of the cleaning contract for the relevant period. Perhaps Kennedy’s still had it, perhaps it had gone to the company which bought out Kennedy’s, and perhaps the company which bought out Kennedy’s could have been identified. None of these matters was explored. 
     61   Although his Honour apparently accepted this prejudice to the respondent, it is not clear from the passage at the conclusion of his reasons (see para [39]) that in the end it was material to the dismissal of the application for an extension of time. The reasoning and expression of reasons in relation to identification of the cleaner is perhaps unsatisfactory. The cleaning company was known, a company called Kennedy’s. It could have been joined as cross-defendant, although if it had been bought out by another company Kennedy’s may not have been a worthwhile target. The individual cleaners were not known, and identifying them would have been important for the evidence they could give rather than because they could have been joined as cross-defendants. It may be thought unlikely that the cleaning contract would include the names of the individual cleaners. Confusion of thought appears to have exacerbated an inadequate evidentiary investigation. 
     62   Nonetheless, the essential matter was that the individual cleaners could not be identified. Inability to identify the individual cleaners, so that they could give evidence of their cleaning programme and its implementation, even of what they saw and did on 7 June 1995, was of self-evident significance to the respondent. Despite the unsatisfactory reasoning and expression of reasons, this can I think be seen in what his Honour said. 
     63   Mr Grossman did not know the names of the individual cleaners. There was nothing to suggest that Mr Baker would have known their names. If the cleaning contract could have provided the names, Mr Baker could not find it, and (whether or not one would expect him to have it) Mr Grossman did not have it. Perhaps further investigation could find the contract or employment records identifying the individual cleaners in the possession of Kennedy’s or of the company which bought out Kennedy’s, but that sort of investigation to an uncertain result was itself an element of prejudice to the respondent (see Holt v Wynter at 146, citing earlier authority to the effect that a defendant must place in evidence sufficient facts to lead the court to the view that prejudice would be occasioned, and the plaintiff must then show that the facts do not amount to material prejudice).  
     64   In my view the evidence permitted the finding that the individual cleaners could not be identified, and the view that there was prejudice in this respect contributing to the prejudice to the respondent on which his Honour’s discretion was exercised. This ground of appeal also fails. 
     65   In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

      JUDGMENT 
       
     The appellant was found guilty of three counts of obtaining a valuable thing by deception, contrary to s 178BA Crimes Act 1900. During the trial one of the jurors requested permission to withdraw from jury duty. The trial judge discharged the juror and informed the jury that one of their number had been discharged. No formal order was sought by trial counsel. At the end of the summing up, the trial Judge indicated that if the jury was unable to reach a decision that day they should notify the Sheriff’s Officer that no verdict had been reached and leave without returning to the Court. They could then resume their deliberations the next morning. The appellant seeks leave to appeal against the conviction on the sole ground that there was a fundamental failure of procedure going to the root of the trial process in that (1) his Honour failed to make an order in express terms pursuant to s 22 Jury Act when discharging the juror; (2) his Honour failed to make an order in express terms pursuant to s 54 Jury Act when allowing the jury to separate.Held: (Appeal dismissed):Ground 1: Trial judge failed to give a formal order in compliance with s 22 Jury ActWhile it would have been preferable for orders to have been made in express terms, his Honour clearly gave consideration to the question as to whether the juror should be discharged and whether the remaining jurors should be allowed to continue the trial. His Honours remarks amounted to an implied order. However, in future, trial judges should exercise care to consider the questions that arise concerning the potential discharge of a juror and possible continuation of the trial. The consideration of such questions should be recorded and reflected informal ordersWu (1999) CLR 99 applied. Maher (1987) 163 CLR 99 distinguished.Ground 2: Trial judge failed to give a formal order in compliance with s 54 Jury ActWhat occurred here amounted to an implied order under s 54 Jury Act. The trial judge gave adequate consideration to the issues before announcing that the jury could separate. It should be regarded as proper practice in the future, that an express order for separation be made in the presence of the jury, so that it becomes a matter of record upon the face of the transcript. It would also be highly desirable at that point for the trial judge to remind the jury of the need to refrain from discussing the case outside the confines of the jury room. Wu (1999) CLR 99 considered. Maher (1987) 163 CLR 99 distinguished.ORDERS PROPOSED(1) Leave to appeal granted. Appeal dismissed.(2) Conviction and sentence confirmed.

       REGINA v WARTHA RADJU 
       
        
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1   WOOD CJ AT CL: On 13 September 1999, the appellant was indicted before his Honour, Judge Shadbolt QC and a jury of twelve in the Sydney District Court, on three counts of obtaining a valuable thing by deception, contrary to section 178 B A of the Crimes Act 1900. Later that day the first jury was discharged and the appellant was reindicted before a second jury.  
     2   At the commencement of proceedings on 23 September 1999, it became known that one of the 12 jurors empanelled for the trial had requested permission to withdraw from duty during the following week. The transcript records that the request was dealt with in respect of this juror, in the following way: 
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: One of our jurors wishes to be excused next week because he has commitments overseas. He has written to me to say: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'I regret to inform you that due to my business commitment I have to travel overseas at the end of this week to attend to urgent matters. It will therefore not be possible for me to continue with my jury duty next week. I sincerely request the court to allow me to withdraw from the jury of the case being heard in this court. I apologise for any inconvenience caused.' 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        He has accompanied that with a fax from the Viva Steamship Company Limited which says: 
         
         
          
          ""Due to recent earthquakes in Taiwan it is of utmost importance that you should return to Hong Kong immediately so you can visit Taipei and Kaohsiung to attend to our business investments, and find out whether losses have been incurred by the earthquake."" 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
        I think the Sheriff's Officer will correct me, the Sheriff's Officer perhaps showed some surprise at this. It was pointed out to him by the juror that the trial was put down for two weeks, not two weeks plus. I quite agree with that. He came along quite willingly to give his time over what was the proposed time, and the case has run over. 
         
         
        My own view is that I should discharge him, not on Friday, but now, because he is not going to sit on any further. It also relieves the jury of any tension which such a jury member might express in the jury room. Although it is my decision, I appreciate anything that you have to say about it. 
         
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I don't have anything to say your Honour. 
         
         
        KING: I have got no objection to following that course your Honour. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: I will just call him in. I will just speak to him as a witness."" 
         
        
       
     3   It was obviously common ground between all concerned that, in the event of the juror being discharged, the trial should continue with the remaining eleven jurors.  
     4   His Honour brought the juror in question back before the Court. The transcript reveals that the matter was dealt with in the following way: 
      
       
        
        ""IN THE PRESENCE OF THE JUROR 
         
          
         
        HIS HONOUR: We have received your letter. I have spoken to counsel. I apologise for the fact that the case has taken as long as it has taken, so that it will exclude you from the resolution of the matter. We have really wasted your time. These things occur. 
         
          
         
        Both counsel and I agree that you should not sit on any longer, and that you should make such arrangements as you obviously need to make. I would just like to thank you very much for your attention to this case. I am sorry that it has turned out like this. 
         
          
         
        JUROR: I apologise for the inconvenience caused. I apologise I have to leave. 
         
          
         
        HIS HONOUR: Not at all. We held you for a fortnight. If we cannot keep to that, that is our bad luck. If you would like to go with the Sheriff's Officer, he will show you out. As far as your payment is concerned, that should occur this morning. That is what should happen. Whether it will or not, I don't know. 
         
          
         
        JUROR: There is no rush, that is fine."" 
        
       
     5   When the remainder of the jury were returned to Court his Honour gave them the following explanation as to what had happened in the trial: 
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: First of all, ladies and gentlemen you will see that I have discharged one of your number for reasons which no doubt you have been aware of so that he can conduct his business next week."" 
        
       
     6   The trial then continued before the remaining jurors. At the conclusion of the summing-up, late in the afternoon of 30 September 1999, his Honour gave consideration as to whether to send the jury out that afternoon. The transcript records that the matter was dealt with in the following way: 
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: Now ladies and gentlemen it is a matter for you whether you want to retire and start considering your verdict or not. You are able to leave at any time you want to, if you wanted to go out now you would be able to leave at any stage that you felt that you would like to draw a stance to the afternoon. You might like to come back tomorrow, it is a matter entirely for you. 
         
          
         
        Mr Foreman have you taken any kind of straw poll on it? 
         
          
         
        FOREPERSON: Yes, your Honour, if we retired now for deliberations would the Court still be here in one hour's time, we didn't know whether you went home. 
         
          
         
        HIS HONOUR: Yes of course, we wait upon your return, but if you were to tell the Sheriff's Officer at some stage that you had enough of the afternoon then you just leave without coming back into the Court and return again tomorrow at half past nine and deliberate only when the eleven of you are together. 
         
          
         
        FOREPERSON: I think we'd like to go and deliberate now and see what happens. 
         
          
         
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, yes. 
         
          
         
        FOREPERSON: If nothing comes out then we'll be back tomorrow. 
         
          
         
        JURY RETIRED TO CONSIDER ITS VERDICT AT 3.46PM"" 
        
       
     7   Again there was no opposition by trial counsel to this course of events. The jury thereafter retired to consider their verdict at 3.46pm. Although the transcript does not disclose when it was, that afternoon, that they separated it is clear that they did do so, and that they not return to Court until the following day. 
     8   There was no objection raised by trial counsel to the jury having separated overnight. The transcript records in this respect: 
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: The jury have retired for the afternoon and they've gone home and I'll (sic) return tomorrow at half past nine. I haven't brought them back to tell them that and the Court will assemble at ten and the accused will go into custody, bail refused."" 
        
       
     9   It is probable that in this last passage the expression ""I'll return tomorrow at half past nine "" is an error for “they'll return tomorrow at half past nine"". In the context of the exchange that would make more sense indeed it would be consistent with his Honour's expectation, announced earlier that day, that they would return on the following morning, at half past nine, if they did decide to cease deliberations for the day. 
     10   The transcript does not record whether in fact a message was sent to his Honour in Chambers informing him of the jury’s wish to separate, nor does it show whether any order was made in Chambers, that is in the absence both of counsel and of the jury.  
     11   On the following morning, that is 1 October 1999, the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of all three counts on the indictment.  
     12   It is now contended by Mr Wendler, for the appellant, as the sole ground for an appeal against conviction, that there was a fundamental failure of procedure going to the root of the trial process requiring that the convictions be quashed. This is based upon the submission that his Honour did not make orders in express terms, first, when the juror was discharged, secondly, when the trial continued with the remaining eleven jurors, and thirdly, when the jury separated on the afternoon of 30 September. 
      
       
      Discharge of Juror and Continuation of Trial 
       
     13   The Jury Act provides: 
      
       
        
        ""19. The jury in any criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or the District Court is to consist of 12 persons returned and selected in accordance with the Act. 
         
         
         22. Where in the course of any trial or coronial inquest any member of the jury dies or is discharged by the court or coroner whether as being through illness incapable of continuing to act or for any other reason, the jury shall be considered as remaining for all purposes of that trial or inquest properly constituted if: 
         
          
         
        (a) in the case of criminal proceedings, the number of its members: 
         
          
         
        (i) is not reduced below 10; 
         
          
         
        (ii) is reduced below 10 but approval in writing is given to the reduced number of jurors by or on behalf of both the person prosecuting for the Crown and the accused or each of the accused; or 
         
          
         
        (iii) is reduced below 10 but not below 8 and the trial has been in progress for at least 2 months; 
         
          
         
        (b) in the case of civil proceedings, the number of its members is not reduced, in the case of a jury of 4, below 3 or, in the case of a jury of 12, below 8; or 
         
          
         
        (c) in the case of a coronial inquest, the number of its members is not reduced below 4, 
         
          
         
        and if the court or the coroner, as the case may be, so orders"". 
        
       
     14   The closing words of section 22 are obviously important for the resolution of this appeal. 
     15   The point which arises as to the need for an order to be made, in express terms, for the discharge of a juror also arose in Wu v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 99, a case decided in the High Court after the verdict in the present proceedings. There, over objection, a juror was discharged, on the tenth day of the trial, after a report was received that he was unwell and would probably not be able to attend Court for two days. No formal order was made to continue the trial with eleven jurors, although the trial judge did say to the balance of the jury ""I think time is running on so we will carry on with eleven"". 
     16   When, in the High Court, the appellant sought to enlarge the argument to encompass a suggested irregularity in the continuation of the trial by reason of the lack of formal order, leave was refused to raise that ground. The appeal was accordingly confined to the correctness of the decision to discharge the juror. However, in dealing with that matter, some observations were passed of relevance for the present case.  
     17   As appears from the judgment of Kirby J at 114 and 118, section 22 of the Jury Act does not expressly confer upon the Court a power or discretion to discharge an individual juror. That is assumed as a common law or implied or inherent power. What it does is to relieve the Court of the common law mandatory obligation to discharge the entire jury, and to permit the continuation of the trial if the Court so order: see the judgments of Gleeson CJ and Hayne J at 106 and 107, McHugh J at 107 and Kirby J at 112 and 114. 
     18   As was also made clear, the decision to discharge the juror, and the decision to order a continuation of the trial with the remaining jurors, are separate matters and depend upon separate considerations. 
     19   The desirability of both matters being dealt with expressly, and by formal order consequent upon considered reasons, is obvious. Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in their joint judgment said in this regard at 103: 
      
       
        
        ""It is plainly desirable that a judge exercising the power to discharge a juror and the power to proceed with a jury of less than twelve members does so in unmistakable terms. Ordinarily that will be done by the trial judge making two separate orders: an order discharging the juror and an order that the trial proceed before the jury constituted by the remaining jurors. It might fairly be said that, in the present case, the judge's orders discharging the juror and directing continuation of the trial before the remaining jurors were not expressed but are to be  
        inferred 
         from what he said and the course that the trial took thereafter"". 
        
       
     20   Kirby J, who dissented on the point argued at the appeal, said (at 121): 
      
       
        
        ""There is another difficulty with the passage of transcript which occurs in the presence of the jury and which therefore alone represents the record of the formal discharge of the juror. The passage proceeds on an apparent assumption that the juror has already been discharged. But that could not lawfully have been done in the absence of the jury. Accordingly, it is necessary to infer from the words '[w]e can carry on with eleven' a judicial decision and order to discharge the juror in question. Whilst I am prepared to  
        imply 
         into the words used such an order, the passage is certainly elliptical. What is undoubtedly missing is an order, as s 22 contemplates, that the residual jurors should be considered as remaining' for all the purposes of that trial...properly constituted'"". 
        
       
     21   His Honour continued, at 121: 
      
       
        
        ""Neither at trial, nor in the Court of Criminal Appeal, did the appellant, by her counsel, object to the failure of the trial judge to make an order in terms of the closing words of s 22 of the Act. Yet it is clear that only 'if the court...so orders' will the remaining jurors be entitled to continue as the jury properly constituted for the trial of the accused. This is a condition of the exercise of the power to continue which the Act permitted but which the common law resolutely denied"". 
        
       
     22   His Honour further observed at 122: 
      
       
        
        ""...in my view, the order required by s 22 is not legally redundant or surplusage. It addresses the judge's attention to an important question which has to be decided. This is not, as such, whether the individual juror should be discharged. It is assumed that this has been done. Rather, it is what then follows. Is it (as at common law) that the entire jury must likewise be discharged? Or is it that the remaining jurors will be taken as properly constituting the jury for the trial? Involved in that decision are considerations quite separate from a decision to discharge an individual juror"". 
        
       
     23   Callinan J said at 124: 
      
       
        
        ""It is appropriate that a trial judge, confronted with a situation in which he or she has to make a decision about a reduction in the number of jurors not do so hastily, without as full an inquiry as is practicable and reasonable, and without making explicit orders as s 22 requires, as to the reduction in number and the continuation of the trial with the reduced number. Adherence to such a procedure (which the Act demands) has the effect not only of ensuring an unambiguous record of what has taken place but also of focusing the trial judge's attention upon the necessity to weigh up whether a juror's or jurors' absence should require the trial to be aborted or whether it should continue with the reduced number. Here I take what Judge Flannery said and ruled to involve at least  
        implicitly 
         consideration of, and orders covering these matters. This was not therefore a case of the kind considered in 
         Maher 
         v 
         The Queen 
         (125) where what occurred was directly relevant to and affected the constitution and the authority of the jury trying the case contrary to the statutory provisions governing these matters"". 
        
       
     24   In accordance with history and statute, leaving aside those cases where there is an election for a trial by judge alone, a criminal trial in this State must commence with a jury of twelve persons. It should ordinarily remain as such unless and until a juror is discharged for good and sufficient cause. 
     25   It was necessary, in the present case, for the appellant to be tried by a properly constituted jury in accordance with those principles and for the trial to continue with a properly constituted jury. For that reason, despite the purely technical nature of this submission, and despite the fact that no point was taken below, I would grant leave to argue the ground. That follows from the circumstance that, if the jury were not properly constituted, then it could hardly be said that any error made was not one that went to the root of the trial process.  
     26   While it would have been preferable for orders to have been made in express terms, his Honour clearly gave consideration to the question, first, whether the juror should be discharged; and next, whether the remaining jurors should be allowed to continue the trial. 
     27   The terms in which his Honour dealt with both matters made it clear, in my view, that he regarded himself as having reached a decision to discharge the juror and to continue the trial with the remaining jurors. It is also clear that his Honour regarded the parties as concurring with each of those two events. That, to my mind, is clear from the passage in which his Honour noted that it was his view that he should discharge the juror that day, rather than on Friday, and also noted that by doing so that would relieve the remaining members of the jury “of any tension” which the released juror might otherwise have expressed in the jury room. 
     28   Those remarks are consistent only with a decision having been made that the juror should be discharged that day, and that the trial should continue. The case was accordingly, in my view, stronger than WU, where the discharge of the juror was opposed, an event which called for a considered decision with reasons for the course taken. 
     29   Consistently with the views expressed obiter in Wu, concerning the circumstances in which orders might be inferred or implied, I am of the view that his Honour's remarks may here be treated as having amounted to implied orders of the kind required by the Act. 
     30   I would add, for completeness, that no question whatsoever arose, in this case, as to the sufficiency of the reasons which arose for the discharge of the juror, in view of his overseas commitments and in view of the fact that the trial had overrun its estimate. It was not a case of any great complexity, nor was it one involving any unique issue of public interest, such that it might have benefited from as comprehensive a community input as was possible. There was every reason to continue the trial in the interests of efficiency, and the saving of costs and inconvenience to all concerned. 
     31   Once the policy decision had been taken by the Legislature, in this State, to authorise the continuation of trials with jurors comprised of less than twelve jurors, the present case, in my view, was one in which that might properly have occurred. 
     32   Moreover, the case was one in which the trial began with twelve jurors, regularly empanelled and authorised to determine the guilt or otherwise of the appellant. Had the attention of his Honour been brought to the need for an order, framed in express terms, for the discharge of the juror and for the continuation of the trial, there is no doubt whatsoever that the orders would have been made and by consent. 
     33   Finally, I note that reference was made in the course of argument to the decision of the High Court in Maher v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 221 and in particular to the passage in the joint judgment at 233 to 234 where it was said: 
      
       
        
        “The provisions of the Jury Act and of the Code which govern the constitution and authority of the jury as the tribunal of fact in a criminal trial are mandatory, for the entitlement to trial by jury which s604 of the Code confirms is trial by a jury constituted in accordance with the Jury Act and authorised by law to try the issues raised by the plea of not guilty. A failure to comply with those provisions may render a trial a nullity, at least in the sense that the conviction produced cannot withstand an appeal: see  
        Crane v Public Prosecutor 
         [1921] 2 AC 299. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The principal is clear. A jury must be sworn to try the issues joined between the Crown and the applicant on a count then appearing in an indictment. Here the jury found the applicant guilty of the offence charged in count 20, though it had not been sworn to try the issues on that count. A conviction founded on that verdict cannot stand. There was a failure to observe the requirements of the criminal process in a fundamental respect.” 
        
       
     34   Maher was a case where the failure to comply with a mandatory provision governing the constitution and authority of the jury from the outset, meant that a conviction founded on the verdict could not stand. The relevant failure concerned the addition of counts to the indictment after the jury had been sworn resulting in a situation in which they were asked to try issues on counts which they had not been sworn to try. While the principle it establishes for the need for a trial to commence, and to continue before a properly constituted jury, cannot be questioned it does not itself throw any additional light on the present case. 
     35   I am, accordingly, not persuaded that this ground has been made good. However, for the future I would underline the observations made in Wu that trial judges should exercise care to consider the questions that do arise, when occasion is presented for the potential discharge of a juror, and for a possible continuation of the trial. The consideration of such questions should be recorded and reflected in express orders, with reasons. 
     36   If it has been a practice in this State, as was suggested in Wu, to deal with those events somewhat informally, that is without express order and reasons, then that practice should be henceforth abandoned. 
      
       
      Separation of the Jury  
       
     37   It is provided by the Jury Act 1977 section 54: 
      
       
        
        ""54. The jury in criminal proceedings: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) shall, unless the court otherwise orders, be permitted to separate at any time before they retire to consider their verdict; and 
         
          
         
        (b) may, if the court so orders, be permitted to separate at any time after they retire to consider their verdict"". 
        
       
     38   Section 54 again alters the common law rule that, once a jury retired to consider its verdict, it should be sequestered and not allowed to separate. The Act now reserves for a trial judge a discretion to permit the jury to separate. There will naturally be exceptional cases where that should not occur, as there will routinely be cases where it might be expected that the jury would be allowed to separate. 
     39   It was submitted that the procedure followed by his Honour amounted to an impermissible delegation of authority to a Sheriff's Officer to permit the separation of the jury. This it was similarly submitted, despite the absence of opposition to the course proposed, was a procedural error going to the root of the trial process. 
     40   For similar reasons to those identified earlier, in relation to continuation of the trial, I am of the view that what occurred here amounted to an implied order that the jury could separate when they decided that they had spent sufficient time, that afternoon in considering their verdict, and elected to return on the following morning. That in particular emerges from the observations by his Honour which made it plain that they would be able to leave when they thought it appropriate to do so, after having commenced their deliberations. 
     41   Having regard to the entirety of the relevant passages in the transcript an implied order was, in my view, made permitting them to separate, the timing of which alone was left to their convenience, it being the expectation of all concerned, and particularly of the trial judge, that when that did occur they would notify the Sheriff's Officer. 
     42   I agree that had a decision as to whether they could separate or not been left to the Sheriff's Officer, then that would have amounted to an impermissible delegation of the discretion or power reserved under the Act. I also agree that the making of an express order, at the time of separation, would have been preferable but I am not persuaded that that the separation occurred here in an impermissible way, that is, in the absence of an order which is to be inferred or implied from the passage that I have extracted. I am accordingly not persuaded that this ground has been made good. 
     43   For reasons similar to those expressed in relation to the first ground, I would regard it as proper practice henceforth for an express order for separation to be made in the presence of the jury, where it is thought necessary to allow them to separate, so that it becomes a matter of record upon the face of the transcript. It would also be highly desirable at that point for the trial judge to remind the jury of the need to refrain from any temptation to discuss the case outside the confines of the jury room, and in particular to exercise care to keep the terms of the jury deliberations to themselves. 
     44   I would accordingly propose that leave should be granted to argue the points sought to be raised. The appeal should, however, be dismissed and the convictions and sentence below confirmed. 
     45   GILES JA: I agree. 
     46   SIMPSON J: I also agree. 
     47   GILES JA: Those will be the orders.

The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence on the grounds that (1) although he made it clear to his legal representatives that he wished to challenge some of the facts alleged in the statement of facts, he was inappropriately advised and consequently sentenced upon a basis involving a greater degree of objective criminality; (2) the sentencing Judge erred in taking into account the component of individual deterrence; (3) the sentencing Judge erred in failing to sufficiently take into account his age; (4) the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.Held: (Leave to appeal granted with regard to count 1, ie sentence imposed for conspiracy to import):Ground 1: Applicant was inappropriately advised on his ability to challenge the factsAlthough it was not an easy issue to resolve, there was a potentially serious risk that the applicant, through an omission on the part of his legal advisers, was sentenced on the basis of an incorrect set of facts to which he did not agree. The applicant was not advised that he could invite the sentencing Judge to examine the material tendered, so far as it threw light upon the matters potentially in issue, or that he could have required the relevant witnesses to attend for cross examination on those aspects of the facts that he disputed. Where the applicant faced a possible life sentence, these matters should have been explicitly and carefully raised by the applicant’s legal advisers.Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 applied.Ground 2: Sentencing judge erred in the way he took component of individual deterrence into accountThe instant case was clearly one which called for an element of specific deterrence as well as general deterrence. Having regard to the age at which the applicant became involved in and pursued the criminal enterprise, and in the absence of any evidence of rehabilitation, there was no reason to suppose he would have been unable to resume such activities. Jeffery NSWCCA 16 December 1993; Paul John Casey NSWCCA 6 June 1996 applied. Ground 3: Sentencing judge failed to look sufficiently at applicant’s ageThe age of a person standing for sentence needs to be taken into account, however, this cannot give rise to an expectation that the elderly can offend with relative impunity. The sentence imposed must remain one that is commensurate with the seriousness of the criminality involved and accords with the general moral sense of the community.Burnett (1994) 70 A Crim R 469; Sopher (1993) 70 A Crim R 570; Foulstone NSWCCA 18 July 1990 applied.Ground 4: Sentence was manifestly excessive If the facts placed before the sentencing judge were correct then the sentences imposed were manifestly correct. Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 followed.ORDERS PROPOSED(1) Leave to appeal against sentence granted.(2) Sentence for count 1 quashed and proceedings remitted to District Court for redetermination.Appeal otherwise dismissed.

      Regina v Lawrence McLEAN 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
     1   BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.2   WOOD CJ at CL: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon the applicant in the District Court, following a plea of guilty to four counts, three of which were contained in one indictment, and the fourth of which was the subject of a separate indictment. They comprised first, a count of conspiracy to import into Australia a quantity not less than commercial quantity of cannabis (S 233B(1)(cb) Customs Act 1901), secondly and fourthly counts of conspiracy to engage in the offence of money laundering (S 81 Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 and, S 86(1) Crimes Act 1914), and thirdly, a count of arranging a marriage to assist in the acquisition of a visa: (S 240(1) Migration Act 1958). 
     3   The sentences imposed were as follows: 
      
       
      a) Count 1 16 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 11 years 
       
       
      b) Count 2 5 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 3 years 
       
       
      c) Count 3 Fixed term of 3 months 
       
       
      d) Count 4 5 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 3 years. 
       
       
      All of these sentences were directed to be served concurrently. 
       
     4   The facts giving rise to these offences were found by his Honour to have been as recorded in a lengthy statement of facts dated 7 August 1998, annexed to the reasons for sentence. In substance they record that the applicant was the leader of a cannabis importation and money laundering syndicate with members in Australia, the Philippines, Thailand, Germany and the United Kingdom. The syndicate was divided into cells whereby different members, who were said to be subservient to the applicant, and reliant upon him for their income, performed the various roles needed for the importation of the cannabis, its landing, and distribution, and the laundering of the proceeds of sale. It was in the course of this activity that the various offences for which the applicant was sentenced occurred. The essential facts relating to each, based upon this statement of facts, may be briefly noted. 
      
       
      Count 1 
       
     5   The statement of facts asserted that, pursuant to an understanding with a number of syndicate members, the applicant had organised the importation of approximately 11 tonnes of cannabis which had arrived in South Australia from South East Asia, on or about 6 January 1996, aboard the vessel “Neptune Wind”. This cannabis had been trucked to Victoria and New South Wales for bulk sale and distribution. Part of the proceeds of the sale of this cannabis it was asserted had been shipped to the Philippines, and then deposited in various bank accounts or converted into assets around the world. Monies had then been repatriated to Australia for investment. 
     6   It was asserted that plans were made, following this successful importation, for the importation of a further 10 tonnes of cannabis during the period December 1996 to January 1997. This was again to be achieved by sea transport from South East Asia, arriving in Australian waters, in the vicinity of Kangaroo Island, South Australia, followed by road transport to the Eastern States.  
      
       
     7   The Australian Federal Police investigation, which led to the applicant’s arrest, commenced after it learned of the 1996 importation, and it involved a sustained operation including the use of telephone interception and listening devices. 
     8   In the course of this operation, the AFP learned that the applicant depended, to a significant degree, upon the assistance of one Martin Waldemar Jonsson, referred to as “the Captain”, since it was he who, through the Panamanian registered Springfield Corporation, controlled the operation of the vessels used to transport the drugs and the money through South East Asia and Australian Waters. It was through him that the “Neptune Wind” had taken on board the compressed cannabis that had arrived in Australian waters in late December 1995, and that had landed in January 1996.  
     9   The operation, according to the statement of facts, had been exceedingly sophisticated, extending to the use of coded messages, the re-naming of the vessel mid voyage, the assembly of an “off-load” crew in South Australia, the transfer of the cargo to a smaller vessel, and its further transfer to even smaller craft, prior to landing under cover of darkness on the Fleurieu Peninsular south of Adelaide. Once unladen, the cannabis had been stored at various locations in Melbourne before being disposed of in Melbourne and Sydney. 
     10   According to the statement of facts, one such delivery to Sydney, in April 1996, had been effected by the applicant who, together with a companion, drove a campervan containing 900 kgs of cannabis to its destination in Balmain. Conversations occurring during the trip had touched upon the depth of the applicant’s involvement and the source of the cannabis as Thailand. It had also revealed details of the reception and storage arrangement in Sydney. The statement of facts recorded that another 55 boxes containing 1100 kgs. had been delivered to Sydney by the applicant, employing a similar method, in June 1996. 
     11   Details of the planning for the second importation were gained through conversations between the applicant and syndicate members, in the course of which reference was made to the successful operation in January, and to the modus operandi that had then been employed. Arrangements for the further importation were discussed, which included the assembly and move of the applicant’s group to South Australia, and for their merger into the local community so that they would not look out of place, when moving the drugs in. 
     12   In one conversation, it was asserted, the applicant spoke of paying $1m to a person in Thailand, and indicated that there were ten members in the crew to be used for the next importation. The arrangements discussed included the roles to be performed by the crew in the operation of the boats and trucks needed, the need for counter surveillance, the search for suitable landing places, the need for some trial runs, and the identification of rendezvous points. At one point, concern was expressed when some video filming of members of the crew was noticed, it being feared, correctly as it turned out, that this might have involved police surveillance. Steps were discussed, in response to this observation, that might be taken in order to test whether these fears were well based. The job was later closed down when a listening device was discovered under the car of one of the alleged co-conspirators in Adelaide.  
     13   Even so, it was asserted, discussions continued in relation to the possible purchase of a boat in Singapore to use in the transhipment of the cargo, from the larger vessel that would bring the drugs from South East, and in relation to the collection and later delivery of the cargo in smaller consignments. 
     14   The wholesale value of the cannabis, he subject of the January 1996 importation, was said to be between $66m and $77m, while that for the planned importation was said to be between $60m and $70m. 
     15   The available penalty in relation to this count, is imprisonment for life. 
      
       
      Count 2 
       
     16   This offence related to the planned transportation out of Australia, of $5,126,300 in cash aboard the vessel “Neptune Wind”, representing, so it was asserted, apportion of the proceeds of the sale of the cannabis that had been imported in January 1996. In the course of one conversation, the applicant spoke of the “Captain’s” ability to transport cash on board one of his ships from an Australian port and to deliver it to a bank in the Philippines. The method described involved the vacuum packaging of slabs of money that were kept in freezers, and then taken onto the outgoing vessel along with the frozen food which was delivered to it.  
     17   The moneys involved in this count were said to have been taken from the Bunyip Inn, at Berry, to the home of Jonsson near Grafton and later to Yamba, where they were taken upon board the “Neptune Wind” in about March 1997. To make this pick up the vessel had been diverted from its intended route from Lae to Singapore. However, the money was found during a police search of the vessel in late March 1997, the occurrence of which, it was asserted, caused the applicant to abandon a plan to leave Australia upon the vessel when it sailed. A search of Jonsson’s house at the same time led to the discovery of a further $440,590, which it was asserted had also come from the applicant. 
     18   The total sum of money that had been held at the Bunyip Inn in January 1997, it was asserted was $6.5m. In the course of a police surveillance operation, the applicant was also detected collecting $3.5m from Stanley John Smith, who was said to be the Sydney distributor for the cannabis which the applicant had imported.  
     19   The available penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years, or a fine not exceeding $200,000 or both.  
      
        
       
      Count 3 
       
     20   The applicant, it was asserted, arranged for one Rodger John Thorne, a member of the “off-load” crew, to marry Yan (Debra) Zhang, to enable the latter, to obtain permanent residence in Australia. This occurred after she had been refused an Australian visa in China upon the grounds of “immigration tendency”. By travelling to Hong Kong on a Malaysian visa, and then to the Phillippines, she obtained entry to Australia on 3 July 1996 on a one month business visa. This visa was twice extended.  
     21   A number of conversations followed, which the statement of facts asserted, show that the applicant and Zhang were making efforts to find a husband for her, in order that she might obtain permanent residence. Arrangements were then made by the applicant, and by Thorne and Zhang, to present a contrived appearance of a genuine relationship. This was followed by a marriage ceremony conducted at Coolangatta, after which an application for permanent residency was lodged, containing, so the statement of facts asserted, an entirely false “history” of their relationship.  
     22   In a conversation after the marriage ceremony, the applicant was said to have spoken unequivocally of his participation in arranging the marriage, of its purpose, and of the fact that it was a sham marriage. 
     23   The available penalty for this offence is imprisonment for ten years or a fine of $100,000 or both. 
      
       
      Count 4 
       
     24   This offence involved the entry by the applicant into an alleged arrangement with the co-conspirators for the application of $850,000, a portion of the proceeds of the January 1996 importation, to the purchase of the Bunyip Inn Guest House at Berry. The arrangements made, so it was asserted, included the use of those funds to purchase the Inn as a legitimate business, and to hold and operate it with the assistance of the co-conspirators.  
     25   It was asserted that, in the performance of this conspiracy, the parties variously assisted in bidding for the property; in receiving transfers of the funds needed from overseas accounts under the applicant’s control; in obtaining a small mortgage to lend an appearance of legitimacy to the transaction; and in entering into a purported partnership agreement. The applicant at one stage, it was said, complained of the business being successful, since it was not intended to make a profit. He was recorded as observing that the purpose of the purchase of the business was to get the “group” into the country, and for its use to “give it (the money) a once through, through the wash”.  
     26   A vault in the Inn was used, it was alleged, to store the proceeds of cannabis distribution, including the $6.5m previously mentioned and a further $927,000 that was found hidden in the roof of the premises following the applicant’s arrest. 
     27   Solomon DCJ concluded, from the material placed before him, that the applicant had been “the leader of a sophisticated cannabis importation syndicate”, and assessed the “magnitude of the actual and planned importations (as) enormous”. He categorised the applicant as a person involved “in a great degree of criminality” and as one had who “set out to break the law for the sole purpose of making huge illegal profits”. These findings were unchallengeable, upon the face of the material tendered upon sentence. 
     28   In the applicant’s favour, his Honour recorded that he had pleaded guilty to all charges “at an early stage,” and noted that “this had saved the community the very considerable cost of bringing him to trial.” The pleas of guilt, his Honour accepted, “contained within them a degree of contrition”. 
     29   His Honour took into account the age of the applicant, 67 years at the time of being sentenced, and noted that it was a circumstance that meant the sentences imposed would be more onerous than they would have been for a person of lesser years. Additionally in relation to hardship, his Honour took into consideration the applicant’s A2 classification, and the fact that his mother was over 90 years of age and a resident of a nursing home. His Honour expressly took into account the contents of a report from a psychologist, tendered upon his behalf, but did not accept the submission that he had been rehabilitated, there being no evidence of that before him. 
     30   His Honour appropriately recorded that he had applied the principles of totality and parity in sentencing the applicant, and said that it was necessary to impose a sentence reflecting both individual and general deterrence. The applicant’s prior lengthy criminal record for offences of robbery in company, larceny, false pretences, assaults and various street offences dating back to 1953, was taken into account, although his Honour noted that this record did not include any convictions for drug supply offences.  
     31   The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence on several bases, namely that: 
      
       
      a) although he made it clear to his legal representatives that he wished to challenge some of the facts alleged in the statement of facts, he was inappropriately advised in relation to that matter, with the result that he was sentenced upon a basis involving a greater degree of objective criminality than was the true position; 
       
       
      b) his Honour erred in the way that the component of individual deterrence was taken into account; 
       
       
      c) his Honour erred in failing sufficiently to take into account his age; and that 
       
       
      d) the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
       
       
     32   In order to deal with these grounds it is necessary to turn to the circumstances in which the statement of facts came to be placed before his Honour, and in which the sentencing proceedings were concluded, as now emerges from various affidavits and statements prepared for the purposes of this application. The events they reveal are as follows: 
     33   The applicant first appeared before the District Court on 11 May 1998, on which date he entered a plea of guilty to the fourth count.  
     34   He next appeared in that Court on 17 July 1998, on which date he pleaded guilty to the remaining three counts. On this occasion, he was represented by Mr. Des Anderson QC, instructed by Mr. David Baker. It would seem from the affidavits of Giles Tabuteau of Counsel, and from his instructing solicitor Mr. Brocks, as confirmed by a statement from Mr. Anderson QC and by an affidavit from Mr. Baker, that the latter informed the Crown that his instructions were to dispute the quantity of cannabis that had been imported, as contained in the proposed statement of facts. Following conversations with Federal Agent Fletcher, and Mr. Baker, it was agreed that the Crown, and the applicant, would accept a reduced quantity of 11 tonnes. 
     35   Mr. Brocks has, in his affidavit, acknowledged that the quantity of cannabis which was the subject of the conspiracy count could not be directly calculated since that involved in the first importation was never seized, and since the second proposed importation did not proceed. However, the quantities involved were estimates based upon inference from the terms of the intercepted conversations, and from information and intelligence available to Federal Police. 
     36   The statement of Mr. Anderson QC, and the affidavit of Mr. Baker, disclose that the original statement of facts had been read over to the applicant in the interview room, and that he agreed to the reduction to 11 tonnes, although he remained somewhat unhappy with the reduced weight. Mr. Anderson QC said that he has no recollection of whether he advised the applicant of his entitlement to contest the facts, or the way in which that could occur, although he would have been surprised if he had not done so. 
     37   Mr. Baker, however, recalled that there was some discussion, on this occasion, as to whether the applicant would give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. It was his recollection that the applicant maintained the position that he had expressed, on a number of prior occasions, that he did not want to give evidence lest he be asked about the other people involved in the conspiracy. 
     38   On 6 August 1998, an amended statement of facts, together with a copy of the Crown’s submissions on sentence, was forwarded by facsimile transmission to Mr. Anderson QC, in which the quantity of cannabis the subject of the first importation, was reduced from 13 tonnes to 11 tonnes. Upon that basis the applicant stood to be sentenced for conspiring to import 21 tonnes of cannabis. 
     39   On 7 August 1998, the applicant appeared before Solomon DCJ, again represented by Mr. Anderson QC, and by Mr. Baker. On this occasion the amended statement of facts, together with two volumes of statements and transcripts of intercepted conversations, were tendered, without objection. The matter was then stood over for sentence. 
     40   On 19 November 1998, the applicant appeared for sentence. Submissions were advanced by the Crown and by Mr. Anderson QC, based on the tendered material. While Mr. Anderson QC was addressing the Court, some handwritten notes, prepared by the applicant, were handed to Mr. Baker by a Corrective Services Officer. These notes were read by Mr. Baker, and then given to Mr. Anderson QC. During the adjournment, while his Honour considered the sentence, they had a conference with the applicant in the cells concerning this document, which had been addressed to the sentencing Judge, and noted, inter alia: 
      
       
        
        “When I pleaded guilty to all these charges no figures were mentioned to me. Phillips Fisher informed of him and I transporting (2) Ton from Melbourne to Syd. This was to be sold to pay for the Oz end of expenses. I pleaded guilty to handling the “off loading” here in Australia, and the monies found at the Bunyip Inn, and at Johnsons ship in Rockhampton TOTAL $6 plus million was the result, less some expenses, from the sale of this two ton. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        So the Crown’s figures are outrageous conjecture. These are the facts, but there are many interpretations. Sir the bigger the case is made the more important the players all of them - for different reasons become. I would never had pleaded guilty to the Crowns interpretation of the facts. Never! No one in their right mind would. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        I am guilty of “off loading” only, and receiving 2 Ton of material! To cover the Australian end. The police visited me (2) days ago at Long Bay and requested all my knowledge. I declined, as I have to get thru this and live amongst violent inmates. So “I’m looking after myself, hence their interpretation of events. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Your honour, before lunch you mentioned “MR BIG”.… The Crown appear to believe I have bulk money, but after over (12) months of monitoring before my arrest, and much seeking since they have discovered not one $ or accounts anywhere in the word - there is none They already found my loot! 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        There are no Mr Bigs but plenty of Mr Littles who each play their role - I am one of these! But only with grass. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The first I heard of these (21) tons was after my last appearance before you. I protested to my legals that these figures are ballistic. Only conjecture gathered with no material or money found to substantiate. Sentence me as a grass importer as a principle at the Australian end as I’ve pleaded guilty to.” 
        
       
       
        
       
     41   Mr. Baker agreed that, in this conference, Mr. Anderson QC informed the applicant that he could go back to Solomon DCJ and re-open the matter in relation to his role, but that he, Mr. Baker, in effect discouraged this, since it would leave the applicant open to cross examination. He also agreed that the applicant was not told that the evidence tendered by the Crown could be questioned, without him going into the witness box. Mr. Baker explained that prior to this date, he had examined the material tendered. Although he did not have a clear impression as to the quantity imported in January 1996, beyond the 2 tonnes which had been transported to Sydney, the intercept transcripts did suggest to him that the quantity the subject of the proposed importation was in the order of 10 tonnes. 
     42   Mr. Anderson QC, had a very limited recollection of this conversation. Indeed, it would seem that his recollection generally of the course which the proceedings took was limited, and confused as to the dates on which the various conversations with the applicant took place. He did, however, have a recollection that, in the notes, the applicant had expressed a wish to “reverse something that had been done”. He could not recall any advice that either he or Mr. Baker gave to him, although he acknowledged that there was no application by him to re-open the defence case, or to withdraw the defence plea. He said that he would have been amazed had he not advised the applicant in these respects. 
     43   In my view, if the facts were as placed before his Honour, then the sentences imposed were manifestly correct. His Honour did not overlook any material consideration, and his assessment of the seriousness of the objective criminality of the applicant upon the basis of the material before him, was indubitably correct.  
     44   The case was clearly one calling for an element of specific deterrence, as well as general deterrence. Having regard to the age at which, and to the apparent vigour with which, the applicant became involved in and pursued the criminal enterprise involved, and to the absence of any evidence of rehabilitation, there is no reason to suppose that he would have been unable to resume such activities, if so minded after release. Both general and specific deterrence remain of considerable significance in sentencing offenders for cases of this kind: Jeffery NSWCCA 16 December 1993, Paul John Casey NSWCCA 6 June 1996, El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370, at 377 to 378, and his Honour would have fallen into error had the sentence not respected that principle. Moreover, while the age of a person standing for sentence needs to be taken into account, as do any other circumstances such as the classification of the offender, or illness, that may make imprisonment more onerous, lest a punishment be imposed that is out of proportion to the objective and subjective criminality involved, this cannot give rise to an expectation that the elderly can offend with relative impunity.  
     45   The sentence imposed must remain one that is commensurate with the seriousness of the criminality involved, and is one that accords with the general moral sense of the community: Burnett (1994) 70 A Crim R 469, Sopher (1993) 70 A Crim R 570; and see also Foulstone NSWCCA 18 July 1990, Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554, Veen (No.2) (1988) 164 CLR 465; and Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 as well as S 16A(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), a provision which requires the sentence to be of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. 
     46   The critical question, however, is whether in the circumstances outlined, the applicant was, through omission on the part of his legal representatives, sentenced upon the basis of an incorrect set of facts to which he did not agree, and in that event, whether this Court should remit the matter for redetermination, so as to address a possible miscarriage of justice. 
     47   I do not find this issue easy of resolution, in view of the circumstance that, at least at one stage of the proceedings, the applicant did agree to the quantity of cannabis involved in the first importation, and did not at that stage, raise any question as to the nature or extent of his role in the enterprise giving rise to the offences charged. The issue that arises is not made any easier by the imperfect recollection of Mr. Anderson QC, as to whether any advice was given to the applicant in relation to the quantity of cannabis involved, and specifically in relation to the note handed over on 19 November. Whatever may have been previously accepted, with some reluctance, it does appear that this note did flag a desire upon the part of the applicant to change his instructions, and to place in issue at least the fact that the quantity of cannabis, involved in the first importation, exceeded 2 tonnes. 
     48   In Olbrich (1999) 73 ALJR 1550 the majority (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ) did not accept that the identification of the precise nature of the accused’s involvement in an act of importation was an essential feature of the sentencing exercise (para 13), and cautioned that any characterisation of the offender as a “courier” or as a “principal”, in determining his relative culpability, should not obscure the assessment of what he did (para 19). It confirmed that, in relation to the standard of proof for facts asserted during sentencing, a sentencing Judge may not take facts asserted into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the accused, unless they have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are circumstances which the Judge proposes to take into account in favour of the accused, it is enough if the circumstances are found by him on the balance of probabilities (para 27). 
     49   The majority confirmed that the sentence to be passed depended on what the accused had done, and who he was (para 24), taking into account, so far as “known to the Court, the nature and circumstances of the offence”, while pointing to the difficulties that can arise in determining that in the context of drug offences.  
     50   In the light of this decision, there was some importance for the appellant to test, if he so desired, the total quantity of the cannabis involved, and the extent of the role he played in the conspiracy charged in count 1. 
     51   He was at least entitled to have any dispute in relation to the statement of facts, that may have impacted upon his objective criminality, explored. The advice given to him, so far as the evidence discloses, was confined to the point that if he wanted to do that, then he would need to go into the witness box, and expose himself to cross examination in relation to the identity and roles of his co-conspirators. 
     52   It is questionable, if the issue had been confined to the quantity of drugs involved, that the Crown could have embarked upon the line of questioning that was obviously of concern to the applicant. The position would, however, have been otherwise, had he sought to say, on oath, that he was not the mastermind, or at least, a significant principal in the operation. Whether he wanted to also place this in issue, as distinct from suggesting that those behind cannabis importations are not as “big” in the drug trade as those involved in heroin or cocaine, is not at all clear. Whatever be the case, none of this seems to have been explored with him. Moreover, it seems that he was not advised that he could invite the sentencing Judge to examine for himself the material tendered, so far as it threw light upon either of these matters, or that he could have required the relevant witnesses, whose statements had been tendered, including the case officer, to attend for cross examination on those aspects of the facts that he disputed. 
     53   Exercising due care for the proper protection of the interests of a person facing sentence for a charge that attracted a possible sentence of life imprisonment, these matters should, in my view, have been explicitly and carefully raised by the applicant’s legal advisers. Whatever their private views may have been as to whether the material available supported the statement of facts, they should, in the face of the note, have carefully explored with him the issue or issues that he wished to ventilate, and then have obtained his formal instructions, preferably by reducing them to writing, and having them signed. It is important that Counsel exercise proper care in advising clients in relation to issues such as this, and in taking proper instructions upon the basis for the entry of a plea. That is expected of them by the Court, and a failure to exercise the requisite care may have adverse consequences for them professionally. 
     54   In these circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that this is a case where the principles discussed in Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685 apply. There Gleeson CJ said: 
      
       
        
       “A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates. 
       
       
       As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel are made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 
       
       
       However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or carrying, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention”. 
       
     55   In reaching this conclusion, I am also mindful of the observation of Hunt CJ at CL in Ignjatic (1993) 68 A Crim R 333 at 338 as follows: “It is not sufficient that the appellant may have merely lost a chance to raise various issues which were not raised at the trial. There was no miscarriage of justice unless it can be shown that there was at least a substantial chance that the appellant would have succeeded in relation to those issues.” 
      
       
      Earlier his Honour had observed:  
       
       
       “Counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to which witnesses should or should not be called, what questions should or should not be asked, which lines of argument should be pursued, which points should be abandoned and which of two or more inconsistent defences should be raised are all matters within the discretion of counsel, and they frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to the best tactics to be adopted. Neither disobedience of instruction of instructions nor even incompetence is sufficient of itself to attract appellate intervention. It is only when the error made was of such a nature in the circumstances of the case as to have led to a miscarriage of justice that this Court will interfere.” 
       
     56   The principles discussed in these decisions were cited with approval in Ella (1991) 103 FLR 8, in Guider 2000 NSWCCA 355, and applied in McIntyre 2000 NSWCCA 6. They have also been applied in sentencing proceedings, McKenna NSW CCA 16 October 1992, where the omission of Counsel to tender welfare and school reports favourable to the applicant was held to constitute a negligent oversight by Counsel sufficient to justify appellate intervention: see also Abbott (1984) 17 ACrimR 355, where as a result of incompetent representation the sentencing Judge was left to impose sentence without taking into account fundamental facts relevant to the offender’s subjective circumstances, an omission that was then corrected upon appeal. 
     57   Whether the applicant could, in this case, have successfully disputed the statement of facts, if given the chance to do so, by reference to the contents of the two volumes of statements and transcripts tendered, as supplemented by cross examination of the case officer and of the making of the statements, we cannot determine upon the limited material available to us. Nor can we determine whether he could have achieved the result desired by going into evidence himself, since we cannot know what might emerge if he was to be cross examined. Moreover, any challenge to the statement of facts could conceivably involve an extensive examination of documentary and oral evidence which for reasons of convenience, and preservation of further appeal rights, would best be conducted at first instance. 
     58   In the special circumstances of this case, our inability to explore the issue means that we cannot positively find whether a substantial miscarriage of justice occurred or not. I am of the view that the apparently inadequate response of the applicant’s legal advisers, means that there was an identifiable and potentially serious risk of that having occurred in relation to count 1 in the indictment. In particular, there is an identifiable possibility that the lapse of the applicant’s advisers meant that the sentencing Judge failed to consider a matter relevant to the determination of the applicant’s objective criminality. 
     59   It is of course conceivable that a closer analysis and testing of the material will only confirm the accuracy of the statement of facts. It may disclose that there was a larger quantity of cannabis involved than that alleged, or that the applicant’s objective criminality was greater than that asserted, or that the attempt which will presumably be made to dispute the statement of facts is of such a nature as to weaken the utilitarian value of the pleas, and to reduce the extent of any remorse or contrition displayed up to the time the sentence was passed. 
     60   It follows that the sentencing Judge to whom the proceedings should be remitted is not necessarily bound to the sentence previously imposed in relation to Count 1, but may sentence the applicant afresh upon the basis of the facts established in accordance with the decision in Olbrich. 
     61   No basis has been established in my view for challenging any of the remaining sentences, each of which, it appears, was set in conformity with the decision in Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610, as an appropriate sentence for the offences concerned. The principle of totality appears to have been recognised in the way in which the sentences were structured, rather than by any adjustment of the length of the sentences for those counts. In any event, they appear to me to have been individually appropriate and in accordance with principle. 
     62   Accordingly, I would propose that leave be granted to the applicant to appeal against the sentences imposed. I would allow the appeal only so far as it relates to the sentence imposed in relation to Count 1. The sentence for that count should be quashed, and the proceedings should be remitted pursuant to S 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (as that provision was interpreted in Histollo Pty Ltd v Director-General National Parks & Wildlife Service (1998) 45 NSWLR 661), to the District Court for determination of the appropriate sentence in relation to that count, after taking into account any evidence or material presented to that Court of relevance to the applicant’s objective criminality. Otherwise, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     63   GREG JAMES J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

      Regina v Wilkes 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
       
     The appellant was indicted on one count of murder. He pleaded not guilty. On the second day of the trial, his brother was cross-examined by the Crown pursuant to s 38 Evidence Act 1995. The brother gave evidence that he saw the appellant strike the deceased with a wooden paling. Following this evidence, trial Counsel advised the appellant that they would lose the case and suggested that he enter a plea of guilty to save some years off his sentence. Shortly after this conversation the appellant advised the Court he wished to change his plea, and a plea of guilty was formally entered. When the appellant next appeared for sentence he sought leave to withdraw his plea, having been advised in the meantime by trial Counsel that he considered his earlier advice to have been incorrect.The appellant appeals on the grounds that (1) the trial judge erred in refusing leave to withdraw the plea of guilty; (2) the plea was entered in circumstances amounting to a miscarriage of justice under s 6 Criminal Appeal Act.Held: (Allowing the appeal):Ground 1: the trial judge erred in refusing leave to withdraw the plea of guiltyThe announcement by the trial Judge that “I formally enter a verdict of guilty” constituted a finding that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged, within the meaning of s 91 Criminal Procedure Act. The course taken by the trial Judge constituted an acceptance of the plea and a finding of guilt, such that it was too late for the appellant later to withdraw the plea.Chiron (180) NSWLR 218 applied. Maxwell (1996) 184 CLR 501; Hura (2001) NSWCCA 61 considered.Ground 2: the plea was entered in circumstances amounting to a miscarriage of justice under s 6 Criminal Appeal ActA plea of guilty must be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt.. If a plea is not entered into as a genuine recognition of guilt, and if there is a real question about the guilt of the accused, the proper course is to set aside the plea of guilty and quash the conviction. A court may go behind a plea of guilty and allow it to be withdrawn in appropriate circumstances, or to entertain an appeal against conviction where it is too late to withdraw it. Among those circumstances are those of an accused who is persuaded to enter a plea of guilty by reason of the imprudent and inappropriate advice tendered by his legal representatives. In the instant case the advice given to the appellant was inappropriate. The evidence before the Court indicated that his plea was not attributable to a consciousness of guilt and there was a real question as to his guilt. Maxwell (1996) 184 CLR 501; Hura (2001) NSWCCA 61; Kouroumalos (2000) NSWCCA 453 Favero (1999) NSWCCA 320; Whitehead (2000) NSWCCA 400; Ganderton NSWCCA 17 September 1998 applied. ORDERS PROPOSED(1) Appeal against conviction allowed.(2) Conviction set aside and a new trial ordered.

       STEPHEN JOHN WILKES v REGINA 
       
        
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
        
       1   WOOD CJ AT CL: The appellant was indicted before Adams J at the Newcastle Supreme Court on 6 March 2000 with a count of murder. He pleaded that he was not guilty whereupon his trial began before Adams J and a jury of twelve. 
      
       
      The Background 
       
       
     2   On the following day, during the course of the evidence of his brother John Wilkes, the Crown sought and obtained leave to cross-examine that witness under section 38 of the Evidence Act. Leave was granted upon the basis that the witness had given evidence contradictory of his statement and as such, was regarded as adverse to the Crown. 
     3   Leave having been granted, the witness described seeing the appellant strike the deceased Thomas Dungay a couple of times with a wooden paling while he was lying on the ground, at the caravan park in Kempsey where the alleged offence occurred. Mr John Wilkes denied having been personally involved in the incident which led to the deceased dying of head injuries. 
     4   Following this development, the public defender appearing for the appellant, indicated that this was something that he had not foreshadowed since it had not been disclosed in any of the statements or documents provided to the defence. His Honour questioned the accuracy of that statement and said that the evidence should proceed. Within a few further questions the witness became distressed and the court then adjourned, as events turned out, until 2 pm. There was, relevantly, it would appear from the court record, a break between 12.25 and 2 pm. 
     5   During this period, Counsel spoke to the appellant twice in conference, together with his instructing solicitor. What occurred in those conferences has been set out in an affidavit from Counsel. In substance, he conveyed to the appellant that Mr John Wilkes' evidence meant that the case would be lost and that by pleading guilty, the appellant could save some years off the sentence that would be imposed. Counsel’s advice, accordingly, was that he should plead guilty since there was no effective way of defending the case. The appellant said in response to this advice, ""Well, if I've got no chance, I might as well plead guilty"". To the precise terms of the advice given, and of the appellant's instructions, I will return in a little more detail when I consider the relevant ground of appeal. 
     6   When the court resumed at 2 pm, his Honour was advised that the appellant had decided to change his plea. He was re-arraigned in the presence of the jury and pleaded guilty to the charge of murder. The transcript records that his Honour dealt with the matter at that point as follows: 
      
       
        
          
         
        ""HIS HONOUR: Ladies and gentlemen, in light of the plea of guilty, I am authorised to enter a conviction of murder against the accused, without taking a further verdict from you. 
         
          
         
        That is so, Mr Crown? 
         
          
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Indeed it is, your Honour. 
         
          
         
        HIS HONOUR: And accordingly, it is unnecessary, you having heard the admission of the accused to all the elements of the crime, for this trial to proceed. 
         
          
         
        JURY DISCHARGED. 
         
          
         
        HIS HONOUR: … in light of your client's plea, I formally enter a verdict of guilty."" 
         
          
        
       
     7    At the request of Counsel, the proceedings were then stood over to 12 May for sentence, and a pre-sentence report was ordered. 
     8   On 15 March 2000, Counsel went to Silverwater Gaol to see the appellant. There he said to him that he believed that he had given him the wrong advice concerning the entry of a plea of guilty and suggested that he should seek new legal representation. Three days later the appellant informed Counsel that he would like to follow that course. 
     9   When he appeared for sentence on 12 May 2000, the appellant was represented by Mr Scragg of counsel, who had been briefed in place of trial Counsel. Application was made on his behalf for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty. That course was opposed by the Crown Prosecutor upon the basis that, a verdict of guilty having been entered, section 91 of the Criminal Law Procedure Act 1986 meant that it was impossible for the plea to be withdrawn. His Honour accepted this submission which was in accordance with the decision of Lee CJ at CL in Chiron (1980) NSWLR 218 at 226 to 227. The application was accordingly refused. 
      
       
       Grounds Of Appeal 
       
        
     10   It is convenient to deal first with the ground of appeal concerning the application made on 12 May.  
      
       
      ""The trial judge erred in refusing leave to withdraw the plea of guilty"".  
       
     11   This ground was but faintly pursued to protect the appellant’s position. It was accepted that, on the basis of Chiron, the announcement by his Honour, ""I formally enter a verdict of guilty,"" and the notation in his Honour's bench book, ""Formally enter a verdict of guilty"", constituted a finding that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged within the meaning of section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     12   That it had such effect was in fact supported by the recent decision of this court in Hura (2001) NSW CCA 61 which held that the word ""finding"" in the section should not be given an overly technical meaning. Spigelman CJ, with whom Simpson J and Carruthers AJ agreed, rejected the view that there had to be a finding of guilt in express terms. In coming to that conclusion, his Honour had regard to the various observations in Maxwell (1996) 184 CLR 501, particularly in the joint judgments of Gaudron J and Gummow J at 531 and of Dawson J and McHugh J at 509, as to what was required for a determination of guilt by the Court. 
     13   In the light of these judgments, there can be no doubt that the course taken by his Honour constituted an acceptance of the plea, and a finding of guilt, such that it was too late for the appellant to withdraw the plea on 12 May 2000. This ground of appeal fails. 
      
       
      ""The plea was entered in circumstances amounting to a miscarriage of justice under section 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act"".  
       
     14   Although considered in the different context of an application to withdraw a plea, Hunt CJ at CL observed in Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 36, that leave will be given for that purpose where the applicant shows that there has been a miscarriage of justice. His Honour went on to say: 
      
       
        
         ""A miscarriage of justice may occur in many different situations if a prisoner is not permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty. Such a miscarriage will be established not only where the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the plea which he had entered but also, for example, if there was no evidence upon which he could have been convicted, or if he had not intended to admit that he was guilty or if his plea had been induced by fraud or threats or other impropriety, when he would not otherwise have pleaded guilty. The authorities are collected and discussed in 
         Chiron 
         (at 235), in 
         Sagiv 
         (1986) 22 ACR 73 at 80-81; 
         Bell 
         (1987) 8 NSWLR 311 at 314/315; and in 
         Davies 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 16 December 1993) at pp 2-5, 7-9. See also  
        Jupp 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 23 November 1993) at pp 2-3. As Badgery-Parker J said in 
         Davies 
         (at p 8), there must be shown to be some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt."" 
        
       
     15   His Honour made observations to similar effect in Cincotta NSW CCA 1 November 1995 at page 1, as did Scholl J in Murphy (1965) VR 187 at 191. In Maxwell Dawson J and McHugh J said at 510 to 511: 
      
       
        
         ""An accused is entitled to plead guilty to an offence with which he is charged and, if he does so, the plea will constitute an admission of all the essential elements of the offence. Of course, if the trial judge forms the view that the evidence does not support the charge or that for any other reason the charge is not supportable, he should advise the accused to withdraw his plea and plead not guilty. But he cannot compel an accused to do so and if the accused refuses, the plea must be considered final, subject only to the discretion of the judge to grant leave to change the plea to one of not guilty at any time before the matter is disposed of by sentence or otherwise. 
        
       
        
       
        
        The plea of guilty must however be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake or even the desire to gain a technical advantage. The plea may be accompanied by a qualification indicating that the accused is unaware of its significance. If it appears to the trial judge, for whatever reason, that a plea of guilty is not genuine, he or she must (and it is not a matter of discretion) obtain an unequivocal plea of guilty or direct that a plea of not guilty be entered. But otherwise an accused may insist upon pleading guilty. That is illustrated by 
         R v Martin 
         where the trial judge, the Chief Justice, suggested that the accused should enter a plea of not guilty. The accused declined to do so and insisted upon pleading guilty. Upon a case stated by the Chief Justice, the judgment of the court was delivered by Owen J, who said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'It has been said that a plea of not guilty should have been entered, but it appears to me that where a man who evidently knows what he is about insists upon recording a plea of guilty, the Judge cannot interfere. If there is any doubt as to the nature of the plea, or any reason to suppose that the accused is not thoroughly aware of what he is doing, a plea of not guilty should be entered; but I can see no reason why the Chief Justice should have taken that course in this instance.'"" 
          
         
        
       
       
        
       
     16   To similar effect were the observations of Toohey and McHugh JJ in Meissner (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 142. Moreover, in Davies NSW CCA 16 December 1993, a decision cited with approval in Ganderton NSW CCA 17 September 1998, Favero (1999) NSW CCA 320, Toro Martinez (2000) NSW CCA 216 and most recently in Hura, Badgery-Parker J, with whom the remainder of the bench agreed, said: 
      
       
        
        ""The need to accord finality to a plea of guilty because of its status as a solemn admission of all of the ingredients of the offence is postulated upon knowledge by the person entering that plea of all the facts (see the passage cited earlier from the judgment of Lee J in 
         Sagiv 
        ) and it is not necessary to be accorded such finality if there are circumstances which indicate that the plea 'was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt' (per Scholl J in 
         Murphy 
         supra). If the integrity of the plea is bona fide questioned because it appears that the person who entered that plea was not in possession of all the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt, then in my opinion the plea of guilty ought to be set aside and a new trial ordered if (but only if, and the onus lies on the appellant) it is clear that there is, in the words of Justice Scholl 'an issuable question of guilt' - to put it more simply, if there is a real question to be tried. If the plea was not entered into with full knowledge of the facts and as a genuine recognition of guilt, and if the material before the Court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused, then the proper course must be to set aside the plea of guilty, to quash the conviction, and to order a new trial."" 
        
       
     17   Conveniently in Hura at paragraph 32 and 33 Spigelman CJ summarised the circumstances in which the court will upon the authorities, set aside a conviction following a plea. 
     18   In Kouroumalos (2000) NSW CCA 453 I also had occasion to consider some of the circumstances in which this court will go behind a plea of guilty and allow it either to be withdrawn in appropriate circumstances, or to entertain an appeal against conviction where it is too late to withdraw it. Among those circumstances which were identified were those of an accused who is persuaded to enter a plea by reason of the imprudent and inappropriate advice tended by his legal representatives.  
     19   Illustrations of such cases can be seen in Favero (1999) NSW CCA 320, Whitehead (2000) NSW CCA 400 and Ganderton NSW CCA 17 September 1998. It is into that line of case that the present case falls. 
     20   The principles established by these decisions are now settled. As a consequence, the present appeal hinges upon three considerations: 
      
      a) whether the advice given to the appellant was or was not imprudent and inappropriate; 
       
      b) whether his plea was or was not attributable to a consciousness of guilt; and 
       
      c) whether the material before this court shows that there is or is not a real question about his guilt. 
       
     21   Before parting from these principles, I observe that in Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 Kirby P observed at 122: 
      
       
        
        ""For good reasons, courts approach attempts at trial or on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with caution bordering on circumspection. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence: see 
         O'Neill 
         [1979] 2 NSWLR 582; (1979) 1 A Crim R 59; 
         Sagiv 
         (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 81."" 
        
       
     22   That proposition was taken up by Hunt CJ at CL in Boag and the circumspection or restraint which their Honours noted does need to be respected. 
     23   The terms of the advice given by counsel, and the appellant's reaction to it in the form of instructions, appear from the affidavits filed in support of the appeal. The affidavits of trial Counsel reveal that, during the first conference which followed the evidence given by John Wilkes, he said to the appellant: 
      
       
        
          
         
        ""(i) 'John Wilkes' evidence and the way it has come out means you are going to lose this case.' 
         
          
         
        (ii) 'You should consider pleading guilty. It might or will save you at least two years in gaol.' 
         
          
         
        (iii) 'Your own brother is saying he saw you do it. The jury will believe him.' 
         
          
         
        (iv) There is no effective way of cross-examining him after what the jury has seen.' 
         
          
         
        (v) 'His evidence is going to confirm exactly the identification evidence which Mr and Mrs Slappendel are going to give (and be confirmed by it).' 
         
          
         
        (vi) 'It doesn't matter what other witnesses still to be called will say, even if they support your account of having been knocked unconscious.' 
         
          
         
        (vii) 'The idea that you were drunk/knocked out/can't remember doing anything like this won't help us because this piece of evidence is so strong.' 
         
          
         
        (viii) 'Although we can guess that in the future, in explaining this evidence to your family, John Wilkes will probably say that the police forced him to say it, that idea won't help us now.' 
         
          
         
        (ix) 'You can be virtually certain that you are going to be found guilty.' 
         
          
         
        (x) 'Although the decision is yours and although I will fight on if you want to, we are going to lose this case.' 
         
          
         
        (xi) 'If you are considering pleading guilty I think it is the right decision and it will definitely save you a couple of years in gaol.' 
         
          
         
        (xii) 'If you want more time, it is an important decision, I will tell the Judge that we are genuinely considering a plea of guilty and we need until 2.00 pm.'"" 
         
          
        
       
     24   The affidavit further discloses that the appellant responded to this advice as follows: 
      
       
        
        ""(i) 'John Wilkes would be lying. He and Scotty Payne are really close and they will cover up for each other.' 
         
          
         
        (ii) 'Won't the other witnesses say I was knocked unconscious back at the first van and that I wasn't there' (when the deceased was killed.) 
         
          
         
        (iii) 'What about what I said to the police in the first place, I was really drunk, then knocked out and I don't remember doing anything like this.' 
         
          
         
         (iv) 'If I knew/remembered doing this, I would have pleaded guilty from the start but as far as I know or remember I didn't do it.' 
         
          
         
        (v) 'Well if I've got no chance I might as well plead guilty.' 
         
          
         
        (vi) 'I would like more time to think about it.'"" 
         
          
        
       
     25   The affidavit filed by the appellant himself broadly conforms with that evidence so far as he states that his Counsel and solicitor talked to him about the likelihood of the success of his trial, in the course of which he was told that he would be found guilty. He went on to say that his Counsel said that, 
      
       
        
          
         
        ""The jury would believe my brother John Wilkes, and if I were to plead guilty, I would be looking at a couple of years less."" 
        
       
     26   He went on to say that, 
      
       
        
          
         
        ""My barrister said that after what had happened in court there was no effective way to cross-examine John Wilkes after what the jury had seen as my brother had been very obviously distressed in the witness-box.” 
        
       
     27   In consequence of that advice, the appellant said, 
      
       
        
          
         
        ""I felt that I didn't have a chance if I kept on running my trial and I felt that I was backed into a corner trying to defend myself against the witnesses. I considered my position and decided that I would be better to plead guilty to murder and take a lesser sentence. 
        
       
     28   Counsel suggested that the discussions in the first conference focused upon the issue of identification of the appellant as the person wielding the paling that was used to batter the deceased to death. The potential issues of provocation or intoxication were not, according to him, raised at that stage or, if they were raised, then they were dealt with only in passing. 
     29   In the second conference, however, Counsel said that those issues were expressly raised and dismissed. The conversation in relation to provocation was confined to the observation by Counsel that: 
      
       
        
         ""There is no evidence of the effect it had on you”. 
        
       
     30   The possibility of provocation which Counsel seems to have later considered open was, no doubt, related to the alleged presentation by the deceased of a knife during the course of an argument or scuffle in the caravan amongst the various persons present, including the appellant.  
     31   The conversation in relation to intoxication Counsel said was limited to the advice, 
      
       
        
         ""White juries will never let an Aboriginal accused off because they were drunk in my experience."" 
        
       
     32   Counsel said that he also advised the appellant that there was a difficulty, if not an impossibility, in the defence switching from one dependent on the issue of identification to some other, more limited defence. 
     33   At no time, he said, did he advise the appellant about the necessity of his Honour giving a warning to the jury in the course of the summing-up pursuant to section 165 of the Evidence Act, presumably concerning the possible unreliability of the evidence concerning identification, or of that coming from a person or persons who may have been criminally involved in the events. 
     34   He said, additionally, that he did not advise the appellant about the possibility of a verdict of manslaughter being returned in lieu of a conviction for murder. Nor did he discuss with the appellant possible avenues of cross-examination of John Wilkes, or of his friend Scott Payne who had provided a statement, and who allegedly had been seen at one point to be pursuing the deceased. In that regard I observe that there was material apparently available to the Crown, as disclosed in the affidavits placed before us, to suggest that two persons were seen pursuing the deceased prior to his death. 
     35   In his second affidavit, Counsel said that upon reflection, he had become concerned that he had not given the appellant any real choice as to whether he should plead or not, and that the appellant had not given him any instructions acknowledging that he had committed the offence. Moreover, it had occurred to him that there were a number of matters that he could have put to John Wilkes in cross-examination, including the fact of his prior inconsistent statement to the police, the presence of a cut to his hand inflicted by the deceased, as well as the presence of other marks or injuries on his body and of blood on his T-shirt. He added that there was also an opportunity, which he now saw, for cross-examining the various civilian eyewitnesses, some of whose recollections may have been affected by the alcohol that they, and others present at the caravan park, appear to have been consuming that day. 
     36   Similarly, he said that there was room to cross-examine the caravan park proprietor, Peter Slappendel, as to his ability to identify the attacker, as the appellant, from the distance that he was from the scene of the killing; and concerning an inconsistency between the description he gave of the attacker's clothing and that given by other witnesses. The identification of the appellant by Mr Slappendel's wife, Counsel suggested, was also open to question in the light of the appellant's claim not to have known her previously. 
     37   Next Counsel said the observations attributed to the appellant by police and the ambulance officers called to the scene, concerning the injuries he had suffered to his arms, ribs and nose, and that were relied upon as admissions were open to question as possibly having been related, not to the killing, but to the earlier altercation in the caravan, in the course of which the appellant claimed that he had been threatened with a knife. 
     38   Finally, he said that there was room to cross-examine the officer in charge of the case as to why there had been no testing of the blood found on the shirt of John Wilkes, or of the clothing worn by Scott Payne for comparison with the blood of the deceased; or any statement taken from Robert Wilkes who had also been at the scene and who, it was suggested, at some stage had been engaged in a fight with John Wilkes. 
     39   It is evident from the terms of the exchange deposed to by Counsel that the appellant did not acknowledge his guilt and, if anything, was protesting his innocence. The clear inferences that he was suggesting were that it may well have been his brother John Wilkes and Mr Payne who had been responsible for the killing, that they could be putting their heads together to attribute the blame to him; and/or if he had been involved in the killing, then he did not have any memory of it, due to the effects of the alcohol that he had consumed that day. In that latter regard, we have today been informed that there is evidence from the hospital records, supported by answers given in the ERISP, to the effect that the appellant was significantly affected by alcohol by the time that he was seen at the hospital. 
     40   Although no evidence was given by the appellant to us expressly asserting his innocence, the inference to be drawn from the entirety of the evidence before us is that the plea of guilty was entered solely because of the advice which he had received as to the likely outcome of the trial. That advice, as I have observed, Counsel now regards as having been incorrect and imprudent. Moreover, if the facts are as have been stated, then it must be accepted that the plea was not one attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt. 
     41   So far as any question exists as to whether there is a genuine question as to the appellant's guilt, that question needs to be considered in the context of the evidence that had been given, before the change of plea, by the four witnesses out of the thirty witnesses that the Crown had expected to call in the trial.  
     42   This evidence had revealed that DNA testing of the appellant's clothing had not shown up any blood consistent with that of the deceased; that DNA testing of the murder weapon was inconclusive; that photographs taken of the appellant's hand had not shown any injury to it; and that the two eyewitnesses Grahame Clenton and Karen Ridgeway who had been called were not able positively to identify the appellant as the man responsible for the killing. The former because his vision from the caravan had been limited, and the latter because, although she knew Payne and John Wilkes, she did not know the appellant. It may be observed that those witnesses did refer to the assailant as a big man, which would be consistent with the appearance of the appellant, and inconsistent with that of John Wilkes and Payne. However, it is not open to us to take that matter further in the absence of a full appreciation of the available evidence. 
     43   The existence or otherwise of a real question as to the appellant's guilt turns additionally upon what it was that the other witnesses may have been expected to say. In this regard we have received only a portion of the Crown brief. Of the various statements placed into evidence before us, it does appear that Mark Doyle would say that he saw the deceased pull out a knife at one stage of the afternoon when confronting the appellant. Dean Rutledge says, in his statement, that he had seen some injuries to the head and face of Scott Payne, and that he had also seen marks like blood on John Wilkes' T-shirt after the killing. Finally, it may be noted that amongst the various statements placed before us there was one from Ambulance Officer Clement. In that statement he noted that a person with whom he spoke at the scene, whom it would seem was the appellant, had said that the deceased, whom he had hit with his hand, had threatened his family. 
     44   In all of the circumstances outlined, we are not in a position to determine the manner in which the balance of the evidence would have emerged and, in particular, how Mr John Wilkes and Mr Payne would have fared under cross-examination. Nor are we able to predict what evidence might have emerged as to the quantity of alcohol consumed by the appellant on the day of the killing, or as to its effect upon him, so far as that may have been relevant for an offence requiring specific intent, as the present case required.  
     45   The limited material available does, however, leave it possible to say that the identification evidence could have been tested in the way that Counsel has now identified, that an issue could have arisen as to whether either or both John Wilkes and Payne had been involved either as principals in the first or second degree in the killing; and in so far as the evidence might have implicated the appellant as the offender, rather than those men, that a question could have arisen as to whether he acted under provocation, or in an alcohol affected state such that he lacked the requisite state of mind. 
     46   While the Crown case may, on one view, appear on the limited material provided to us, relatively strong, it cannot be said at this stage that questions of the kind mentioned could not genuinely arise which should be determined by a jury. 
     47   This court should, in my view, be reluctant to dismiss the confession by an experienced public defender that he made a mistake in his assessment of the merits of the case and in the advice given. In particular, I would not be prepared to do that by reference to what could only be a partial consideration of the prosecution brief, that is without the benefit of it being tested by examination and cross-examination, a matter which is properly reserved to a jury and which is simply not available to us. 
     48   In all those circumstances, not withstanding the respect which needs to be given to the finality of verdicts in criminal trials, a circumstance requiring very great diligence on the part of trial counsel, when advising as to the wisdom of entering a plea, I have reached the conclusion that this appeal should be allowed and the conviction set aside. I would order a new trial. 
     49   I would only wish to add that it was in the very best traditions of the bar for counsel to have taken the step that he did, to correct what he saw to be a serious error on his part, affecting the liberty of his client, and to frankly acknowledge that failing in the affidavits placed before us.  
     50   It should also be said that it was regrettable for advice to have been given, and a decision taken of such importance, in haste and without proper reflection since little was to be lost, in pragmatic terms, concerning the timing of the plea. The proper course, with hindsight, would have been to reserve any decision about a change of plea overnight, by which time a better appreciation may have been possible concerning the likely credibility of John Wilkes and Mr Payne, and during which time the appellant could have had the opportunity of considering his position without being distracted by the immediate pressures of a hearing that was about to resume. 
     51   I mention these matters not by way of criticism of trial Counsel, but to underline for the future the care needed when occasion arises for a possible change of plea mid trial. Not only should Counsel take the time needed for proper reflection, but so should they be allowed the opportunity if time is sought. 
     52   GILES J: For the reasons given by Wood CJ at CL I agree that the conviction should be set aside and that there should be a new trial. 
     53   SIMPSON J: I also agree. 
      
        
     54   GILES J: Those will be the orders. 
      
      Mr Game, I note that Mr Wilkes has had bail consistently refused. Any intentions in that regard I think should be raised before a single judge if it is to be raised at all.

        ALIREZAI v SMITH 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
        
        
       
     1    GILES JA: I agree with Heydon JA. 
      
       
     2    FITZGERALD JA: The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are set out in the reasons for judgment of Heydon JA.  
      
       
     3    The appellant is confronted with the usual problem which arises when exaggerated claims are rejected. The trial judge did not accept the appellant’s evidence that he would not have undergone the surgery if he had received any warning. Her Honour found that the appellant was warned before he underwent the surgery but that he was not given an adequate warning. That left the hypothetical question whether the appellant would have had the operation if he had been adequately warned. Because of the appellant’s exaggeration, there is no direct evidence on that issue. In any event, the trial judge plainly considered the appellant’s evidence unreliable. 
      
       
     4    The respondent should have warned the appellant not only that the surgery might not improve his condition but also that it might worsen his condition and provided him with appropriate information concerning the possible consequences. 
      
       
     5    The trial judge rejected the appellant’s claim because she was “… not satisfied that the [appellant] on the balance of probabilities had he been given a warning in adequate terms would have rejected the option of surgical intervention in favour of learning to live with his condition.” That conclusion was based upon a number of factors, one of which was “… the issue of the extent of the risk.” In dealing with that issue, the trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Although the evidence suggests that the risk was increased by the successive surgical interventions, it was still slight. According to Dr Weidman it was in the range two to 5 per cent.” 
         
        
       
     6    The “risk” referred to in that passage was the risk that the surgery might worsen the appellant’s condition. The trial judge did not refer to Dr Weidman’s evidence that there was only a ten per cent chance that the surgery would improve the appellant’s condition or the somewhat higher chance of success (up to almost 40 per cent) which might be able to be inferred from Dr Nade’s evidence. Her Honour did not quantify the surgery’s prospects of success. If Dr Weidman’s evidence was accepted, the surgery had a 10 percent chance of success and carried a risk of 2 to 20 per cent that it would worsen the appellant’s condition. 
      
       
     7    Further, her Honour did not refer in this context to the appellant’s “confidence” in the respondent, whom he “trusted .. implicitly” and to whom he “was prepared to travel from Queensland … notwithstanding there were specialists such as Dr Weidman available in Queensland.” Her Honour omitted to acknowledge the significance which an adequate warning would have had if it had come from the respondent because of the appellant’s confidence and implicit trust in him. She concluded that the appellant’s confidence and implicit trust in the respondent and the circumstance that he had “proceeded twice before to surgery [performed by the respondent] without incident” would have caused him to undergo the operation which caused a deterioration in his condition even if he had been adequately warned.  
      
       
     8    I am not persuaded that the trial judge’s conclusion that the appellant’s claim failed because he had not established that “… had he been given a warning in adequate terms [he] would have rejected the option of surgical intervention in favour of learning to live with his condition” can legitimately be read as a conclusion that the appellant would have undergone the surgery performed by the respondent even if the respondent had informed the appellant that the surgery had only a 10 per cent chance of success and there was a risk of up to 5 per cent that it would worsen his condition. 
      
       
     9    The appellant’s case has not been properly considered and there has accordingly been a “substantial wrong or miscarriage” within the meaning of Part 51R23 of the Supreme Court Rules. 
      
       
     10    The appeal should be allowed with costs and a new trial ordered. Since the other members of the Court propose to dismiss the appeal there is no purpose in my considering other issues. 
      
       
        
       
     11    HEYDON JA:  
      
       
       Background 
        
       This is an appeal from orders of Sidis DCJ made on 24 September 1999 after a trial on 20-21 September. She found a verdict for the defendant (“the respondent”). However, she assessed the damages of the plaintiff (“the appellant”), had he recovered a verdict, at $125,000. Both conclusions are challenged. 
        
        
       The Trial Judge’s Reasoning 
       
     12    The appellant suffered a back injury in 1975. From February 1980 to 1983 the respondent treated him. On 16 March 1983 the respondent carried out a disc excision and fusion at the L4/5 level.  
      
       
     13    The appellant then moved to Queensland. In 1990 he returned to Sydney to consult the respondent. On 4 July 1990 he underwent a second operation conducted by the respondent: the fusion was extended from the L5 to the S1 level.  
      
       
     14    A third set of procedures took place in June 1993, when screws inserted in the 1990 operation were removed. 
      
       
     15    On 29 March 1995 a third fusion operation took place. Since then the plaintiff has been experiencing numbness in the wrist-hip area on his left side and from his waist to various parts of his leg on the right side. This is because of cauda equina syndrome.  
      
       
     16    The trial judge found that the respondent had not been negligent in performing the surgical procedure and had not been negligent in post-operative care.  
      
       
     17    The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence (CAB 7P-R) that the respondent gave him no warning about the risks of the surgery or complications from it. She found that the appellant was given warnings in accordance with the respondent’s practice as follows (Red 23L-W): 
      
       
        
         
         “Effectively he said his practice was to advise his patients that if they decided not to proceed with surgery, their condition would not deteriorate and they would not be exposed to risks of surgery, namely paralysis or a wheelchair. He said he attempted to reassure his patients that if they did nothing, they would come to no greater harm. 
         
        
        
         
         He said he explained the general risks of surgery including the risks of anaesthesia, wound infection and deep veinous thrombosis. He said that he advised only of the risk of paralysis resulting in crippled or wheelchair bound conditions. He did not give a warning of consequences such as those suffered by the plaintiff. He said he told his patients that the risks which he identified were unlikely to eventuate. As I have already noted there are references in the correspondence which is in evidence to the discussion with the plaintiff of the alternatives namely to do nothing or to proceed with surgery.” 
         
        
       
     18    She also found (Red 29D-G) that Dr Weidman, who treated the appellant while he was in Queensland between 1985 and 1989, gave the appellant warnings along the following lines (Red 24E-L): 
      
       
        
         
         “He said he advised him against surgery, he recalled discussing surgery with him on several occasions and he had documented this in his records at the time. He said he generally gave the same advice and he could clearly recall giving advice to the plaintiff on more than one occasion, that further surgery to his back would have no more than a 10 percent chance of producing a worthwhile long time improvement and that the risks of surgery could possibly exceed any benefit. He said he could recall telling him that he could be paralysed after an operation, but he had no clear recollection of specifically mentioning bladder or bowel dysfunction.” 
         
        
        
       The appellant said he could not remember any advice from Dr Weidman. 
        
       
     19    However, the trial judge found that the respondent’s warnings were inadequate because they did not comply with what Dr Nade said was appropriate (Red 25H-N): 
      
       
        
         
         “Dr Nade was of the view that an appropriate warning would have dealt with the benefits and the complications of surgery and that as far as complications are concerned advice should have been given as to the general risks as well as those specific to the precise operation to be performed. Specific complications he said would include failure to relieve symptoms, bleeding, infection, perforation of the spinal theca, alteration and function of nerve roots emerging from the cauda equina, causing dysfunction in one or both of the lower limbs, bladder and bowel dysfunction leading to complications.” 
         
        
        
       That is a reference to Dr Nade’s evidence at CAB251P-V. 
        
       
     20    The trial judge then found that the failure to warn adequately was not causative of loss. She raised the question of whether the breach: 
      
       
        
         
         “was ineffective as a cause of the damage given that the event which occurred would probably have occurred in the same way even if the breach had not happened” (Red 28J-L). 
         
        
       
     21    She then said (Red 28M-29R): 
      
       
        
         
         “Firstly: I have already found that he did receive a warning in general terms only, not only on this occasion but on two prior occasions. He was also given advice by Dr Weidman as to the general possible complications of surgery. Secondly: having received this advice he had proceeded twice before to surgery without incident. Thirdly: he had confidence in Dr Smith. On his evidence he trusted him implicitly. He was prepared to travel from Queensland to continue to consult with the defendant, notwithstanding there were specialists such as Dr Weidman available in Queensland. Fourthly: he did have options. It was not essential that he proceed to surgery and there were alternative means available to him to relieve his pain and discomfort and I am satisfied on the evidence that those alternatives were explained to him by the defendant. 
         
        
        
         
         Although the plaintiff states he does not remember it, the evidence establishes that he was specifically advised by Dr Weidman against further surgery and of the limited prospects of improvement of his condition if he proceeded. 
         
        
        
         
         The material set out in the defendant’s letter of 8 March 1995 to the effect that he recommended that the plaintiff learn to live with his condition and give it some time is a contemporaneous note and not evidence given with the benefit of hindsight. 
         
        
        
         
         There is also the issue of the extent of the risk. Although the evidence suggests that the risk was increased by the successive surgical interventions, it was still slight. According to Dr Weidman it was in the range of two to 5 percent. 
         
        
        
         
         I am alert to the need as stated by Justice Kirby in Chappell that a breach of a duty to warn must be dealt with seriously. However taking these factors into account I am not satisfied that the plaintiff on the balance of probabilities had he been given a warning in adequate terms would have rejected the option of surgical intervention in favour of learning to live with his condition. On this basis therefore the plaintiff’s claim has failed.” 
         
        
       
     22    The appellant’s sole complaint relates to these causation findings.  
      
       
     23    The trial judge proceeded to assess damages at $125,000 (being general damages only). The respondent contends that the correct assessment would have been $60,000.  
      
       
        
       Grounds 3 and 5-7 
       
     24    These grounds are that the trial judge erred: 
      
       
        
         
         “3. in failing to find that the Respondent’s failure to warn adequately was causative of the damage suffered by the Appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         5. in finding that the Appellant would have proceeded with the option of further surgical intervention had he been adequately warned as to the risks. 
         
        
        
         
         6. in her application of the principles set out in  
         Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital 
          (1989) 17 NSWLR 553. 
         
        
        
         
         7. in failing to consider the added risk of the said operation, with respect to those earlier operations performed by the Respondent on the Appellant, when assessing the relationship that existed between the Appellant and Respondent and applying the principles as set out in  
         Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital 
         .” 
         
        
       
     25    The first submission which the appellant made related to the first two factors to which the trial judge referred (Red 28M-Q): 
      
       
        
         
         “Firstly: I have already found that he did receive a warning in general terms only, not only on this occasion but on two prior occasions. He was also given advice by Dr Weidman as to the general possible complications of surgery. Secondly: having received this advice he had proceeded twice before to surgery without incident.” 
         
        
       
     26    The appellant submitted (written submissions, paragraph 16): 
      
       
        
         
         “In the first 2 factors to which Her Honour refers, Her Honour notes that the Appellant had received a warning in general terms previously from both the Respondent and Dr Weidman yet proceeded to surgery. Yet such warnings were, on Her Honour’s findings, inadequate. To have agreed previously to surgery on the basis of inadequate information could not, in the Appellant’s submission, support a finding that the Appellant would have proceeded if adequately warned. Further, the third fusion was a different, more difficult operation. The stakes were higher and the success rate lower. The fact that the plaintiff agreed to more simple operations previously is of little weight in deciding whether he would undergo the third fusion.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     27    One error in this submission relates to the difference between the first two operations and the third. The summary of Dr Nade’s evidence given by the trial judge at Red 25H-N does not record the fact that it was given in answer to the question: “What advice should an orthopaedic surgeon have provided in relation to the surgery on 29 March 1995?” (CAB 251N-P). When discussing the failure to warn in relation to specific complications, Dr Nade said that the specific complications “would include … perforation of the spinal theca causing a leak of cerebrospinal fluid in view of the fact that it was the third operative procedure …” (CAB 251T-U). It follows that the strictures levelled by the trial judge against the respondent’s conduct in relation to the third operation based on Dr Nade’s evidence cannot apply fully to his conduct in relation to the first two operations. Similarly, so far as the strictures of the trial judge are based on Dr Weidman’s evidence, that evidence was directed to the third operation, not the first two. He said (CAB 272H-J): 
      
       
        
         
         “… in patients undergoing a third or fourth operation, I would emphasise to them the operation is technically much more difficult, and that the risk factors are somewhat higher. The risk of bladder or bowel impairment would be a material risk.” 
         
        
        
       That evidence was offered in answer to the question: “What are the risks which should have been made known to Mr Alirezai in relation to the surgery on 29 March 1995?” (CAB 271W).  
        
       
     28    In answer to the question “With what frequency do lumbar fusions, particularly a third one, fail to give relief of symptoms?” (CAB 273W), Dr Weidman said:  
      
       
        
         
         “The problem is not as straightforward as this. I would tell all patients that they are unlikely to be totally symptom free. I would class a success as a patient stating that the operation was worth their while. In a patient undergoing a further lumbar fusion, the chance of a patient being happy in the long term with the results from surgery would be in the vicinity of 50 percent. After a third fusion, the chance of longterm improvement after further surgery would be 10 percent” (CAB 274D-H). 
         
        
       
     29    A similar error appears in the submission contained in the appellant’s written submissions, paragraph 16, so far as Dr Weidman’s warnings are criticised. Dr Weidman was not involved in the third operation, and was not responsible for the defects in any warning on that occasion. His warnings were given in relation to the second operation, and the trial judge made no finding that they were inadequate.  
      
       
     30    In short, in evaluating whether notwithstanding the giving of a non-negligent warning before the third operation the appellant would have proceeded with the operation, the trial judge cannot be criticised for taking account of earlier warnings by the respondent and Dr Weidman, and in particular cannot be criticised for the inadequacy of those warnings. It is far from clear on the evidence, or from the trial judge’s findings with which it was closely linked, that the disparity between Dr Nade’s recommended warning for a third operation and the warnings given for the first two made the warnings given for the first two inadequate. 
      
       
     31    The third factor stated by the trial judge was (Red 28Q-T): 
      
       
        
         
         “Thirdly: he had confidence in Dr Smith. On his evidence he trusted him implicitly. He was prepared to travel from Queensland to continue to consult with the defendant, notwithstanding there were specialists such as Dr Weidman available in Queensland.” 
         
        
        
       The appellant submitted (written submissions paragraph 17): 
        
         
         “As to the third factor, Her Honour refers to the trust that the Appellant placed in Dr Smith. This implies that Dr Smith was actively recommending the surgery yet there is no evidence as to the extent to which Dr Smith did, if at all, recommend to the Appellant that he undergo the surgery (Grey 52K).” 
         
        
       
     32    The respondent did recommend surgery at least to the extent of discussing the “pros and cons as it were” in 1993 (CAB 52S). He told him of the “possible benefits” in 1995 (CAB 66G). On 8 March 1995, three weeks before the third operation, the respondent saw the appellant and in a letter written on that day said (CAB 75Q-76F): 
      
       
        
         
         “I have explained to Mr Alirezai that the functional base of his spine now is L3-4 and that it is uncommon, but nonetheless does occur, that symptoms develop from arthritic change at that level. Most do not find the symptoms severe enough to warrant surgery and that they can live with it. If this is not possible in his case, the third level could be incorporated into the fusion mass but this is totally elective on his part. 
         
        
        
         
         I have explained to him by way of x-ray whereby some people in the 40 to 60 age group with back pain can be diagnosed as having a three level problem from the outset and three level fusions are undertaken electively from time to time, however it is uncommon for this to be necessary. 
         
        
        
         
         Arthritic symptoms above L3 are very rare. 
         
        
        
         
         I tried to explain these various possible outcomes to Mr Alirezai and recommended that he learn to live with the condition and give it some time. 
         
        
        
         
         He has a traction machine at home which he could use from time to time and would also benefit from physiotherapy from time to time. 
         
        
        
         
         He is better off avoiding long term non steroidly (sic) anti-inflammatory agents.  
         
        
        
         
         I have left appointment making up to him.” 
         
        
        
       But the point of the trial judge’s reasoning is not that the respondent was urging the appellant to have the third operation, but that the appellant trusted the respondent. Nothing in the evidence is pointed to to suggest that he did not.  
        
       
     33    The fourth factor which the trial judge relied on was put thus (Red 28T-W): 
      
       
        
         
         “Fourthly: he did have options. It was not essential that he proceed to surgery and there were alternative means available to him to relieve his pain and discomfort and I am satisfied on the evidence that those alternatives were explained to him by the defendant.” 
         
        
        
       The appellant submitted (written submissions paragraph 18): 
        
         
         “Fourthly, her honour found that the Respondent explained to the Appellant the ‘alternative means available to him to relieve his pain and discomfort’. There is no evidence to support this finding in relation to the time of, or alternatives to, the third fusion.” 
         
        
       
     34    The 8 March 1995 letter reveals that the respondent did explain that the appellant could use his traction machine and would benefit from physiotherapy. The trial judge referred to that evidence (Red 20F-L and 29F-H).  
      
       
     35    The appellant further submitted (paragraph 19): 
      
       
        
         
         “Further, (Grey 48D) Her Honour refers to her finding that Dr Weidman had advised of the limited prospects of improvement. The implication is that the Appellant was already on notice of the low likelihood of success. Yet Dr Weidman had not seen the Appellant since 1989 (Grey 270N). At that time the Appellant had only had one fusion procedure. The warning given by Dr Weidman six years previously could hardly be held to be relevant to the knowledge of the Appellant six years later in the face of a more difficult and dangerous operation. Further, the statement of Dr Weidman at Grey 270T that he had told the Appellant about the 10% chance of success sometime in 1985-1989 contradicts the later part of his own report. The success rate of a second fusion (as was awaiting the plaintiff in 1989) was 50%, not 10% (Grey 274G).” 
         
        
       
     36    The warnings of Dr Weidman, even if not recent, cannot be described as not “relevant”. The weight to be given to those warnings was a matter for the trial judge. In any event, as is stated below, the use which the trial judge made of those warnings is different from the use attributed to her by the appellant. Further, criticism by the appellant of contradictions in Dr Weidman’s report does not come well from the appellant, because he tendered the report, and he did not seek to have the supposed contradictions cleared up by a second report or by oral evidence.  
      
       
     37    Counsel who presented oral argument for the appellant at the hearing of the appeal was different from the counsel who prepared the appellant’s written submissions. Not surprisingly, the focus of the oral submissions was somewhat different. In oral argument the appellant concentrated on the following passage in the trial judge’s reasons for judgment, which appeared just before the trial judge found that an adequate warning would have made no difference (Red 29J-L): 
      
       
        
         
         “There is also the issue of the extent of the risk. Although the evidence suggests that the risk was increased by the successive surgical interventions, it was still slight. According to Dr Weidman it was in the range of two to 5 percent.” 
         
        
       
     38    The appellant submitted that there were two relevant “risks” to be considered. One was the “risk” of failing to achieve relief of the appellant’s symptoms. Dr Weidman said that there was only a 10 percent prospect of success (i.e. a 90 percent chance of no long-term improvement): CAB 274G. Dr Nade said the risk of failure was “relatively high” (CAB 254Q); he also referred to literature suggesting a 62 percent success rate, but it was far from clear whether this was at a second fusion or otherwise or at a fusion at the same or a different level (CAB 254T). The second “risk” was the risk not of a failure to relieve symptoms, but of a positively detrimental outcome, worsening the patient’s condition. Dr Weidman said the risk of a post-operative epidural haematoma was no more than 1-2 percent, and that the “risk of a degree of neurological damage that would concern the patient would be in the vicinity of 5 percent”: (CAB 273F-K).  
      
       
     39    The basic position of the appellant in submissions was as follows. There were two key factors to consider, the risk of the operation failing, and the risk of a detrimental outcome. The appellant submitted that the trial judge either assessed both risks as “slight”, or ignored the former risk. If she assessed the former risk as slight, she erred in view of Dr Weidman’s 90 percent figure and Dr Nade’s 38 percent figure. If she ignored the former risk altogether, she left out a vital factor.  
      
       
     40    Did the trial judge ignore the former risk altogether? She referred to the evidence of Dr Weidman that he advised the appellant on more than one occasion before 1989 “that further surgery to his back would have no more than a 10 percent chance of producing a worthwhile long term improvement” (Red 24H-J; CAB 270T). The trial judge accepted Dr Weidman’s evidence on that matter (Red 29E-F). At one point the appellant submitted that it was “apparent, although not expressly made clear, that her Honour accepted Dr Weidman’s evidence of the facts and his opinion as to the likelihood of failing to receive symptoms occurring at a third fusion” (transcript page 6 line 57- page 7 line 3). However that may be, the trial judge’s attention appears to have been clearly focused on the risk of failure. She mentioned Dr Weidman twice in analysing the four factors at Red 28M-W. In the next paragraph she accepted Dr Weidman’s evidence about the limited prospects of improvement if he proceeded with surgery (Red 29D-F). In the next paragraph after that, she referred to the letter of 8 March 1995 from the respondent which did not say that surgery would succeed, and did say that the respondent “recommended that [the appellant] learn to live with the condition and give it some time” (CAB 75W; Red 29G-H). Since that letter did not refer to detrimental outcomes, the recommendation is inconsistent with any state of mind on the part of the appellant that surgery had good prospects of success.  
      
       
     41    It seems likely that the trial judge was weighing, in her estimation of whether the appellant would have undergone surgery had he been properly warned, the fact that the prospects of improvement could be as low as 10 percent. The paragraph which immediately follows those just discussed is that quoted above (Red 29J-L): 
      
       
        
         
         “There is also the issue of the extent of the risk. Although the evidence suggests that the risk was increased by the successive surgical interventions, it was still slight. According to Dr Weidman it was in the range of two to 5 percent.” 
         
        
        
       Here the trial judge appears to be moving from the issue of whether the operation might succeed to the issue of a detrimental outcome. For one thing, the passage opens with words suggestive of a new subject: “There is  
       also 
        the issue …”. Further, in that passage the trial judge uses the word “risk” which is not an expression she employed in discussing the evidence about the chances of failure and which is, in ordinary usage, more appropriate to describe the chance of a detrimental change in the patient’s condition as distinct from the chance of no improvement. On the other hand, the word “risk” was used by the trial judge in other places to describe the chances of a detrimental outcome: Red 26N-P and 27E. It follows that the adjective “slight” is not being applied at Red 29J-L to the risk of the operation not succeeding, but to the risk of the results being detrimental.  
        
       
     42    It further follows that the two criticisms which the appellant made of the trial judge - that she failed to take into account the risk of failure, or that if she did she called it “slight” - are ill-based. She did take account of it, but not at Red 29J-L, and she did not call it “slight”.  
      
       
     43    As noted above, the appellant criticised the trial judge for relying on Dr Weidman’s warnings because they were given six years before 1995. The criticism was repeated in oral argument. The criticism was, however, misplaced. The trial judge was not saying: “In evaluating the significance of the absence of a warning about a risk of failure, I can ignore it because of a similar warning six years earlier”. Rather she was saying: “Had the appellant been warned of a 90 percent risk of failure, it would have been unlikely to cause him to decline the operation, because a similar warning in 1989 did not cause him to decline the second operation.”  
      
       
        
        
       New Trial? 
       
     44    Even if the trial judge did err in the manner for which the appellant contended, it would not follow that the appeal should succeed. The appellant accepted that he could not ask this Court for a verdict, because the issues turned in large measure on the assessment of primary evidence and in particular on the assessment of the appellant himself. The appellant accepted that the only remedy in relation to established appellable error would be a new trial. Part 51 r 23 of the Supreme Court Rules provides that the Court of Appeal shall not order a new trial on any ground “unless it appears to the Court of Appeal that some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.” If the reasoning of the trial judge does contain any of the errors contended for, those errors did not cause any substantial wrong or miscarriage.  
      
       
     45    The primary error contended for turned on the risk of the operation not succeeding. At the time of the third operation, the appellant knew that two earlier operations, conducted by a trusted surgeon, had not succeeded. Dr Weidman had told him more than once that the second operation had only a 10 percent chance of success. The respondent had not held out strong prospects of success, and had not urged the operation on the appellant. There was evidence that the respondent discussed with the appellant the risks of the procedure not working (CAB 52U-V). There was also evidence that the respondent said to the appellant words to the effect that “one would hope that he would lose his symptoms” (CAB 65V). This evidence suggests the communication of a real risk that the appellant would not lose his symptoms. The appellant’s evidence that he had been given no warning at all, as distinct either from the relatively limited warnings which the respondent said he had given and the more elaborate warning which Dr Nade said should have been given, was not accepted. In contrast, the evidence of both the respondent and Dr Weidman was accepted. The respondent was accepted at Red 24U-W, and Dr Weidman was accepted at Red 24H-L and 29D-F. The trial judge was moderate and courteous in the language she used to express these conclusions, but in more blunt terms they must rest on a disbelief of the appellant at least so far as the conflict between the appellant and the respondent is concerned. The appellant gave no evidence as to what his reaction would have been to a warning of the type which Dr Nade said was appropriate. The appellant gave evidence that if he had been told before the third operation that there was a possibility of a complication but that it was very, very slight - a risk of one in a million procedures - he would not have undergone back surgery (CAB 40K-Q). It is implicit in the trial judge’s findings on causation that she must have rejected that evidence. If she had accepted that evidence she would have found for the appellant. The appellant’s evidence was certainly on the face of it not credible particularly in the light of the trial judge’s findings that the appellant was warned of the risks of the surgery causing paralysis, resulting in him becoming crippled or bound to a wheelchair (Red 23R-S). The appellant never ran a case at trial that a combination of the warnings of Dr Nade and Dr Weidman should have been given. The appellant never gave evidence at trial of what his reaction would have been to the type of warning which Dr Nade recommended. In the circumstances none of the alleged errors can have produced a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
        
       Quantum of Damages 
       
     46    Since the appeal fails in relation to the trial judge’s conclusions as to liability, the question of her reasoning on damages does not arise. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
       
     47    In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

      REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
       
     1   SHELLER JA: I have had the privilege of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by Kirby J. I have no need to repeat the facts or the relevant statutory provisions. His Honour has emphasised the cardinal principle that no one can be tried for a crime unless that person is in mental condition to make a proper defence; R v Pritchard (1836) 7 Car & P 303; 173 ER 135 at 304 and 135. If the Court becomes aware that the accused is unfit to be tried, the trial must be halted. The Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 Part 2 is intended to establish a procedure to deal with the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence when it is raised, as it may be, by any party to the proceedings in respect of the offence or by the Court; s5. That question is to be tried on the balance of probabilities; s6. The question, although preferably to be raised before the person is arraigned, may be raised at any time during the course of the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence and may be raised on more than one occasion in respect of the same proceedings; s7.  
      
       
     2   Subsection (1) of s10 directs the Court, if the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for the offence is raised after arraignment, to conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether the person is unfit to be tried for the offence. Subsection (2) directs the Court not to conduct an inquiry into the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence “unless it appears to the Court that the question has been raised in good faith”.  
      
       
     3   No doubt, subs (2) was designed to prevent allegations of unfitness, known to be false, interrupting trials. In Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1 at 8-9, in a passage which Kirby J has quoted, Gibbs, Mason and Wilson JJ, considered the procedure laid down in s631 of the Western Australian Criminal Code. This procedure applied if it appeared to be uncertain, for any reason, whether the accused was capable of understanding the proceedings at the trial, so as to be able to make a proper defence. Their Honours said:  
      
       
        
         
         “This of course does not mean that it has to be proved that it is uncertain that the accused is incapable before the judge is required to empanel a jury. Once a real question as to incapacity is raised, the Judge must follow the procedure laid down in the section.”  
         
        
       
     4   In my opinion, in this context to qualify a question as “real” means the same as to qualify it as one that “has been raised in good faith”. Other words or phrases such as “genuinely” or “on the basis of a belief honestly held” may help to explain what is intended.  
      
       
     5   It seems to me that the learned trial Judge thought something more was required. I cannot otherwise understand how he came to the conclusion he did on the various occasions Kirby J has referred to. In particular, in his reasons for judgment of 12 August 1999, which Kirby J has quoted, the trial Judge said:  
      
       
        
         
         “I am not prepared to come to a conclusion on the balance of probabilities that the question of his fitness to be tried has been raised in good faith. It may be that Mr Tier is unfit to be tried. I say that would have to be a possibility. It is only a possibility. It is to my mind far from a probability.” 
         
        
       
     6   I do not understand how it could be said that, if there was a possibility that the appellant was unfit to be tried, the question of whether he was indeed unfit to be tried could be said not to have been raised in good faith. With due respect, this conclusion may have resulted from a misunderstanding of the expression “a real and substantial question”; see Eastman v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 915 paras 28, 66, 319 and 400. In Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230 at 245, Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ repeated the phrase in Ngatayi and said:  
      
       
        
         
         “It cannot be doubted that, in the context of s393 [of the  
         Crimes Act 
          (Vic) 1958], ‘[o]nce a real question as to incapacity is raised, the judge must follow the procedure raised in the section’. Sometimes the test has been stated in terms of whether there is a reason to doubt the accused’s fitness to stand trial. However, the judge should leave the issue to be tried by the jury unless no reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find that the accused was fit to be tried.” 
         
        
       
     7   I am satisfied that his Honour, with due respect, applied a wrong test. On the basis of the material before him, his Honour was bound under s10(1) to conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether the appellant was unfit to be tried for the offence. For this reason, I joined in the orders made by the Court on 8 February 2001.

I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Kirby J and I express my agreement with them and also with the additional remarks of Sheller JA.

      REGINA -v- Terrence John TIER 
      
      
       
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
        
       
     9   KIRBY J: Mr Terrence John Tier (the appellant) was charged with having knowingly taken part in the manufacture of not less than a commercial quantity of amphetamines (contrary to s24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, 1985). The offence was said to have taken place between 1 January 1991 and 16 August 1992. Mr Tier pleaded not guilty. In 1994 he was convicted. On appeal, however, the conviction was quashed, and an order made for a new trial. A similar order was made in respect of Mr Karim Elfar. Mr Elfar was said to have been involved with Mr Tier in the same illegal enterprise. 
      
       
     10   The new trial of Mr Tier and Mr Elfar began in the District Court in May 1999. However, after seven weeks, the jury was discharged. A week later, on 29 June 1999, a new jury was empanelled. The trial began once more. Mr Tier was on bail. On Monday 9 August 1999, when the Crown case was almost complete, Mr Tier failed to appear. Enquiries were made by his solicitor, Ms Spooner. She ascertained that he had been admitted to the psychiatric unit of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. 
      
       
     11   The trial Judge was obliged by the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, 1990 (“the Act”), to observe a particular procedure where a question had been raised concerning an accused person’s unfitness to be tried. The appellant contends that his Honour failed to observe the requirements of the Act, which were mandatory. When the matter was argued on 8 February 2001, it was apparent that the appeal had to succeed. At the conclusion of argument, therefore, the appeal was allowed. An order was made quashing the conviction, and ordering a new trial. No judgment was given at that time. I now provide my reasons for joining in that order. 
      
       
        
       The Crown Case 
        
       
     12   Mr Tier has tertiary qualifications in agriculture. It was the Crown case that he was engaged by Mr Elfar as the chemist in the manufacture of amphetamines. In December 1991, Mr Elfar took out a short term lease on factory premises at Moss Vale. He told the owner that he wished to use the premises for the storage of earthmoving equipment used in his plumbing business. The lease was to run for three months. Mr Elfar paid the $12,000 rental in cash in advance. 
      
       
     13   At about the same time, Mr Elfar purchased laboratory equipment, which was then installed in the factory. The locks on the factory were changed. Mr Tier, meanwhile, purchased a number of chemicals, using cash. He did so providing a false name (Tharrin). At the first trial, in a statement to the jury, Mr Tier said that he had used a false name because he had a number of creditors. He did not want his creditors to know about his new business venture. 
      
       
     14   The chemicals purchased were substances used in the manufacture of amphetamines, employing what is called the Leuckardt method. The chemicals themselves were pungent. The person from whom they were purchased noticed that Mr Tier already smelt strongly of one of these chemicals. 
      
       
     15   The police became aware of these purchases soon after they were made. They observed the delivery of the chemicals to a guest house where Mr Tier was staying, and their transfer from the guest house to the factory. The transfer was made by a utility driven by Mr Tier, with Mr Elfar as his passenger. 
      
       
     16   The police inspected the factory when it was unoccupied, accompanied by an analytical chemist. Samples were taken, and a listening device installed. An observation post was then established, and a video made of those entering and leaving the factory. 
      
       
     17   On 28 March 1992, a conversation took place between persons identified as Mr Elfar and Mr Tier. Mr Elfar was recorded as saying: “It’s good, good go. It’s nearly speed already.” “Speed” is, of course, a colloquial term for amphetamines. 
      
       
     18   Search warrants were later executed both on the factory and the guest house. Various items were seized, including some of Mr Tier’s clothing. The clothing smelt strongly of phenylacetic acid, an important ingredient in the manufacture of amphetamines. Samples taken from the laboratory equipment contained the by-products of the manufacture of amphetamines. Of the 14 drums of ethylphenylacetate delivered to the guest house in March 1997, 13 were recovered, and were empty. 
      
       
     19   At the first trial, neither Mr Tier nor Mr Elfar gave evidence. Each made a statement to the jury. At the retrial, the Crown tendered, as part of its case, each of these statements. The accounts of Mr Tier and Mr Elfar were similar. Each said that Mr Tier had been engaged to conduct experiments with a liniment which was unusable because of its smell. Mr Tier believed he may be able to get rid of the smell. At some point the objective changed. Mr Tier was then instructed to create a stimulant, said to be superior to the illegal drug amphetamine, but a substance which was perfectly legal. Mr Tier asserted that at no stage did he intend to manufacture amphetamines. 
      
       
        
       The First Application 
        
       
     20   The circumstances of the first application for a hearing in respect of Mr Tier’s fitness to stand trial have already been described. On Monday 9 August 1999, as the Crown case was nearing its close, Mr Tier failed to appear, he then being on bail. He had been admitted the day before to the psychiatric unit of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. The psychiatric registrar of that unit, Dr Simpson, provided a report. The report included a brief history, which was in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “He was admitted to the Missenden Psychiatric Unit on 8 August 1999, with a provisional diagnosis of major depression, partially treated by his private psychiatrist, over the last two months.” 
         
        
       
     21   Dr Simpson concluded his report with these words: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is difficult to comment on his prognosis at this point, without a further period of observation. It is however, likely that he will remain an in-patient for the remainder of this week for further assessment and as such will be unable to attend court.” 
         
        
       
     22   The jury was told that Mr Tier had been admitted to hospital, and the matter could not proceed that day. They were asked to come back the following day. 
      
       
     23   That afternoon Mr Tier’s counsel, Mr Rasmussen, attended the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He saw Mr Tier. He provided the following description of his client to the trial Judge the following day (Tuesday 10 August 1999), when the matter resumed: (T1454) 
      
       
        
         
         “… it was rather difficult to communicate with him. His ability to communicate with me was I think much affected. He spoke very slowly and very torturedly and if I’m permitted to say so he looked very frail.” 
         
        
       
     24   Arrangements were made for the psychiatrist who had been treating Mr Tier to see him at the hospital, and furnish a report. 
      
       
     25   The Crown in these circumstances suggested, sensibly, that the jury should be sent away until the following Monday. However, there was a complication. Counsel for Mr Tier had foreshadowed the need to call, and possibly interpose, an expert witness. The witness was only available until the end of the week. He would then be overseas until 31 August 1999, a date well beyond the projected conclusion of the evidence. After discussion, the matter was adjourned until the next day, Wednesday 11 August 1999. The possible need for a bench warrant was discussed. 
      
       
     26   On Wednesday 11 August 1999, counsel for Mr Tier tendered a report from the treating psychiatrist, Dr Mary Jurek (dated 10 August 1999). The report provided a detailed history. Mr Tier had been referred to Dr Jurek in May 1999 because his solicitors were concerned about him. He appeared depressed, and unable to provide them with instructions. Dr Jurek first saw Mr Tier on 21 May 1999. She then saw him a month later, on 21 June 1999. 
      
       
     27   Dr Jurek had not seen Mr Tier since 21 June 1999. Her report, however, included a description of the events leading to his admission to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He had been found by a friend, crying and depressed. He had neglected his personal hygiene. He was taken to a doctor at Balmain. That doctor arranged for Mr Tier’s admission to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on Sunday 8 August 1999. Dr Jurek offered the following opinion: (p7) 
      
       
        
         
         “Because of his severely depressed state, Mr Tier requires specialised psychiatric treatment. Treatment with antidepressant medication is usually recommended for about 6 months for the first episode of depression and may need to be given for a year or more for subsequent episodes. 
         
        
        
         
         Currently he is unfit to undergo the rigours of a trial. He will remain unfit whilst depressed due to his low mood, cognitive impairment and suicidal risk. 
         
        
        
         
         The prognosis with appropriate treatment is reasonably good.” 
         
        
       
     28   It was not clear to the trial Judge whether Dr Jurek’s conclusion was based upon her consultation with Mr Tier in June 1999, or more recent discussions with the psychiatric staff of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Counsel sought to clear the matter up by calling his instructing solicitor, Ms Spooner. Ms Spooner, before entering the law, had been a nurse. Her qualifications include psychiatric nursing. She had spoken to Dr Jurek. She was in a position to confirm that Dr Jurek had conferred with Dr Simpson and Associate Professor Buhrich of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Ms Spooner had also made her own observations of Mr Tier. She said that she was simply unable to communicate with him. She formed the view that he was not able to instruct her. She had known him since 1995, and he was not the same person. 
      
       
     29   Counsel for Mr Tier, upon this basis, applied for a discharge of the jury. The application was refused. Counsel then sought an adjournment until the following day, Thursday 12 August 1999. He wished to explore calling the defence’s expert, perhaps in the absence of Mr Tier. He needed to obtain instructions. 
      
       
     30   A discussion then took place as to whether the trial could proceed in Mr Tier’s absence. Ultimately his Honour issued a bench warrant to secure Mr Tier’s presence. His Honour directed, however, that the warrant should lie in the Sheriff’s office until further order, since the solicitor for Mr Tier expressed confidence that she could secure his presence without the need of a warrant. She was concerned that a warrant may exacerbate his depression. 
      
       
     31   The following day, Thursday 12 August 1999, Mr Tier did not appear. His counsel withdrew his application to interpose the defence expert. Instead, an application was made under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, 1990, for a hearing as to whether Mr Tier was unfit to stand trial. 
      
       
     32   After argument, his Honour rejected that application. He did not believe it had been made in good faith (s10(2)). It is convenient to postpone an examination of his Honour’s reasons, and to deal with them in the context of an examination of the Act. 
      
       
     33   Having rejected the application, his Honour then adjourned the hearing until the following day (Friday 13 August 1999). He directed the execution of the bench warrant to secure Mr Tier’s presence. 
      
       
     34   Mr Tier was brought to court on Friday 13 August 1999. An application was made for bail, and was refused. Notwithstanding the trial Judge’s finding of an absence of good faith, he made the following recommendation, directed to the gaol authorities: (T1580a) 
      
       
        
         
         “I strongly recommend that Mr Tier, who was, I presume, brought from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital to the Court today, be held in the hospital complex of the Community Corrections Centre in Sydney. 
         
        
        
         
         I make recommendations that Royal Prince Alfred Hospital make available to appropriate persons acting on behalf of Mr Tier his prescribed medication and copies of any documents appropriate to either accompany him or follow him to his place of custody and in the alternative, that he be given appropriate medication by the authorities of the Community Correction Service.” 
         
        
       
     35   The following Monday, 14 August 1999, arrangements were made for Dr Jurek to see Mr Tier. Counsel foreshadowed a further application for a hearing in respect of Mr Tier’s fitness to stand trial. Mr Tier was available for a psychiatric examination by any expert retained by the Crown, if it wished. The Crown, however, did not take up that offer. 
      
       
     36   The trial then continued, the Crown calling the remainder of its evidence, and closing its case. 
      
       
        
       Second Application 
        
       
     37   In the meantime Dr Jurek furnished a further report (16 August 1999). On the basis of that report, counsel made a second application, as foreshadowed. The transcript contains the following abbreviated account of the nature of the application: (T1833) 
      
       
        
         
         “(Mr Rasmussen advised he had some witnesses outside for his application pursuant to the Mental Health Criminal Procedure Act that his Honour embark upon an inquiry as to Mr Tier’s unfitness to be tried. His Honour enquired as to how the unfitness arises. Mr Rasmussen replied that it arises by reason of the fact he is suffering from a major depressive illness, symptoms of which in a general way affect his cognitive ability and therefore his ability to satisfy the matters alluded to by their Honours in  
         The Queen v Presser 
         . Mr Rasmussen handed up copies of the authority. Mr Rasmussen advised the application this morning is not an application that he be adjudicated unfit to be tried, but simply an application in order to satisfy his Honour that the issue is being raised in good faith as to his unfitness to be tried. Discussion ensued regarding the authority.)” 
         
        
       
     38   Counsel re-tendered the reports submitted on the first application, together with the further report of Dr Jurek of 16 August 1999. A Voir Dire examination was then undertaken in the absence of the jury. A number of witnesses were called. Associate Professor Neil Buhrich gave evidence. He was, at that time, Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He had examined Mr Tier. He described his symptoms, which included psycho motor retardation. Prof Buhrich said this: (T1837) 
      
       
        
         
         “Psycho motor retardation describes lack of movements which you see classically in a serious depression. You also get it in other conditions.” 
         
        
       
     39   Prof Buhrich added: (T1839) 
      
       
        
         
         “… he was slow to answer questions. I felt that he found it quite difficult to come to grips with some of the more complicated questions and that his concentration was poor.” 
         
        
       
     40   Prof Buhrich diagnosed major depression. He added the following: (T1841) 
      
       
        
         
         “He would be able to respond with yes and no but I don’t think he’d concentrate very much on the question and I am imagining that he might give a no answer just to get rid of the question or a yes answer just to get rid of the question…” 
         
        
       
     41   He did not think Mr Tier was well enough to attend court: (T.1846) 
      
       
        
         
         “I agreed with Dr Simpson’s letter in the sense that I thought he was not well enough to attend Court proceedings. I mean he could certainly attend in the sense that he could come here physically and sit down, and he could certainly attend in the sense that intellectually he knew what day, month and year it was, but the reason I felt he could not attend was I didn’t think, because of his poor concentration, that he would be able to participate in the Court proceedings. … “ 
         
        
       
     42   Prof Buhrich considered the possibility that Mr Tier may be feigning his symptoms. In respect of that possibility, he provided the following opinion: (T1854) 
      
       
        
         
         “The other possibility was … there’s nothing wrong with him at all, he wasn’t depressed in any way whatsoever but he is just pretending to be depressed and come into hospital to avoid going to court. … that’s a possibility too but I don’t think so because people like that usually can’t sustain that pretence when they’re observed in the ward for a day or so. There are periods when they’re not thinking they’re observed, they’re with other patients, they talk animatedly, it’s just not - they can’t sustain it for more than a couple of days.” 
         
        
       
     43   Dr Simpson gave evidence along the same lines. He rejected, perhaps more emphatically, the suggestion that Mr Tier may be faking his symptoms. 
      
       
     44   Dr Jurek, Mr Tier’s treating psychiatrist, was then called. She confirmed the diagnosis of major depression. She specifically addressed the issue of fitness to be tried. She said this: (report 16.8.99 p3) 
      
       
        
         
         “I have now examined Mr Tier on 5 different occasions and in each of the consultations I was able to confirm my diagnosis of Major Depression. This diagnosis was also confirmed by Dr Buhrich, Dr Simpson and Dr Wilcox. Although he has been treated for this depression and at times has shown some clinical improvement, the overall situation is that he has now worsened and is suffering from a psychiatric condition which is potentially life threatening. 
         
        
        
         
         When seen today, it was quite evident to me that Mr Tier continues to be seriously depressed. Not only is he depressed in his mood but he is also not functioning well psychologically. Depression is not only a low mood state but also a medical condition characterised by cognitive impairment and vegetative symptoms affecting most systems of the body.” 
         
        
       
     45   Dr Jurek’s conclusion was expressed in these terms: (p6) 
      
       
        
         
         “Although for medical and psychiatric reasons, it is in Mr Tier’s best interests to have his matter resolved and finalised as soon as possible, in my opinion he would be prejudiced in receiving a fair trial were his trial to continue whilst in his current state of mind.” 
         
        
       
     46   Dr Jurek adhered to this view when giving evidence. 
      
       
     47   Having heard argument, his Honour again rejected the application. He did so upon the same basis. It did not appear to him that the issue of unfitness had been raised in good faith. Again, it is convenient to postpone, for the moment, an examination of his Honour’s reasons. 
      
       
        
       Accused’s Proposed Dock Statement 
        
       
     48   The trial therefore continued. It was open to Mr Tier to make a statement (as he had at the first trial), rather than give evidence. Apparently, a draft statement was made available to the Crown, who indicated that it gave rise to difficulties. The Crown said this: (T1991) 
      
       
        
         
         “It includes this statement that I am incapable of giving an account of myself. Now that raises the question of his unfitness again and you have to consider that. …” 
         
        
       
     49   A discussion then took place. It included the following comment by his Honour: (T1993) 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Rasmussen, does your client want to challenge the rulings of the court that perhaps he didn’t find to his liking, is that what he wants to do? I mean he may like or not the rulings that the court’s given but the court’s given to me (sic) he has remedies in relation to that as he either knows or can be told but I’m not sure about him challenging in front of the jury. Is that what he wants to do?” 
         
        
       
     50   The accused, in this context, then chose not to make a statement. Dr Simpson, however, was called to state that, by reason of his depression, Mr Tier would find it difficult to give evidence, or make a statement. 
      
       
     51   I see no reason why Mr Tier should not have made the statement which was proposed. Had he done so, it would have reinforced the evidence of Dr Simpson. His Honour’s rulings did not, to my mind, prevent such a course. 
      
       
     52   No specific complaint is made in the Notice of Appeal concerning this aspect. It was an error capable, in my view, of giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. However, in view of my conclusions on the issues dealt with below, I need not further deal with the matter. 
      
       
     53   The jury ultimately returned verdicts of guilty against Mr Tier, and Mr Elfar. His Honour sentenced Mr Tier to penal servitude for 3 years and 4 months, with a minimum term of 1 year and 10 months. The minimum term was due to expire on 4 September 2001. 
      
       
        
       The Common Law in Respect of Unfitness 
        
       
     54   Before examining the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, 1990, it is instructive to look at the common law, and comparable legislation interstate. Justice requires that any person put on trial should be fit to stand trial. In R v Dashwood (1943) 1 KB 1, Humphries J said this, on behalf of the Court: (at 4) 
      
       
        
         
         “It is a cardinal principle of our law that no man can be tried for a crime unless he is in a mental condition to defend himself.” 
         
        
       
     55   An accused person must be in a position to comprehend the course of proceedings, so as to make a proper defence (per Alderson B in R v Pritchard (1836) 7 Car & P 303; 173 ER 135; R v Presser (1958) VR 45 per Smith J). 
      
       
     56   Three things follow from this fundamental precept. First, the obligation to raise any issue concerning the fitness of the accused rests not simply with the parties, but with the Court. If, through observation or information (such as depositions), the Court becomes aware that the accused is unfit, it must call a halt to the trial and, through inquiry, resolve that issue. It should do so even though neither the prosecution, nor the defence, urges such an inquiry (R v Dashwood (supra) at 2; Eastman v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 915 at 969 (para 294) and 971 (para 300) per Hayne J.) 
      
       
     57   Indeed, the Court should recognise that very often it will be against the interests of an accused person to raise the issue of unfitness. Gleeson CJ, in Eastman, made the following remarks: (at 920, para 24) 
      
       
        
         
         “It is not to be overlooked, as Deane and Dawson JJ pointed out in  
         Kesavarajah v The Queen 
          ((1994) 181 CLR 230 at 249) that the usual consequence of a finding that a person is unfit to plead is indefinite incarceration without trial. It is ordinarily in the interests of an accused person to be brought to trial, rather than to suffer such incarceration.”  
         
        
       
     58   Secondly, the question being fundamental, it falls outside the adversarial system (per Hayne J in Eastman (supra) at 969, para 294). Smith J in R v Presser (supra) said this (following Hood J in R v Davies (1853) 6 Cox 326): (at 49) 
      
       
        
         
         “Considerations of onus, however, in the sense in which onus applies on issues joined, would seem to be foreign to an inquiry of the kind in question.” 
         
        
       
     59   His Honour added: (at 50) 
      
       
        
         
         “Upon the authorities, it seems to me that my proper course is to treat this inquiry as one which does not involve any issue joined between the parties, and one in which, notwithstanding the presumption of sanity, I should not regard the accused as bearing the onus of an issue, or require him to begin.” 
         
        
       
     60   Thirdly, if there is error as to whether the accused is fit to plead or stand trial, it is a fundamental flaw in the trial process (Gaudron J in Eastman (supra) at 924, para 62; Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230 at 247). There is a mistrial. 
      
       
     61   When can it be said that a question as to the accused’s fitness to be tried has been raised? In Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1, a person described as a “full blood tribal aborigine” was indicted for murder. His counsel expressed concern that the accused could not understand the nature of the proceedings. He sought an inquiry into his fitness to be tried. The trial Judge declined to direct such an inquiry. On appeal, the High Court said this: (at 8) 
      
       
        
         
         “Once a real question as to incapacity is raised, the judge must follow the procedure laid down in the section. If counsel raises an issue of incapacity he should indicate the nature of the facts which in his submission will support the view that the accused is incapable of understanding the proceedings so as to be able to make a proper defence. The judge should then leave the issue to the jury unless on the facts as stated no reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find that the accused was not capable of understanding the proceedings so as to be able to make a proper defence.” 
         
        
       
     62   In Kesavarajah v The Queen (supra), the accused was charged with the importation of heroin. The Crown produced two medical reports before the trial began. One diagnosed mental illness, and urged the trial be adjourned. The other thought the accused fit, although the report was qualified in a number of respects. The trial Judge, in these circumstances, determined that there was not a serious issue to be tried. When the matter came before the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Court (Phillips CJ, Crockett and Marks JJ) said this ((1993) 66 A Crim R 376: (at 396) 
      
       
        
         
         “If there is material that invites inquiry as to an accused’s fitness either to plead or (if the trial has commenced) to be tried, the judge is under an obligation to determine if there is ‘a real and substantial question’ as to such fitness.” 
         
        
       
     63   Their Honours added: (at 396/397) 
      
       
        
         
         “It must be borne in mind, as the Full Court pointed out in  
         Khallouf 
          ((1981) VR 360 at 364), that it is important to keep separate the two matters, namely a finding as to whether a real and substantial question as to fitness exists (which is for the judge to make) and a finding as to whether the accused is or is not unfit in the relevant sense (which is for the jury to make).” 
         
        
       
     64   When the same matter came before the High Court, Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said this (referring to the provisions of the Crimes Act, 1958 (Vic)) (supra): (at 295) 
      
       
        
         
         “…it cannot be doubted that, in the context of s393 ‘[o]nce a real question as to incapacity is raised, the judge must follow the procedure laid down in the section’ ( 
         Ngatayi 
          (1980) 147 CLR at 9). Sometimes the test has been stated in terms of whether there is a reason to doubt the accused’s fitness to stand trial ( 
         R v Gibbons 
          [1947] 1 DLR 45 at 49). However, the judge should leave the issue to be tried by the jury unless no reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find that the accused was not fit to be tried.” 
         
        
       
     65   Applying that test, the Court found error. There was, in that case, a real issue. The trial Judge, therefore, was obliged to follow the procedure laid down by the Act, which was to empanel a jury to determine whether the accused was unfit to stand trial. 
      
       
        
       The Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, 1990 
        
       
     66   Part 2 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, 1990, deals with criminal proceedings relating to persons with mental disorders (ss2 to 30). A question concerning a person’s unfitness to be tried may be raised by any party to the proceedings, or by the Court (s5). It may be raised before the person is arraigned, or during the course of the hearing (s7(1)). It may be raised more than once (s7(2)). Once raised, the Court is obliged to conduct an inquiry (s10(1)) subject to two exceptions (which appear in ss10(2) and 10(4) below) (see Zhang [2000] NSWCCA 344, per Dunford J, at para 25). Section 10 is in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “s10(1) If, in respect of an offence: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) … 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for the offence is raised after the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         the Court must (except as provided by this section), as soon as practicable after … the question is raised, … conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether the person is unfit to be tried for the offence. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) The Court must not conduct an inquiry into the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence unless it appears to the Court that the question has been raised in good faith. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) … 
         
        
        
         
         (4) If, in respect of a person charged with an offence, the Court is of the opinion that it is inappropriate, having regard to the trivial nature of the charge or offence, the nature of the person’s disability or any other matter which the Court thinks proper to consider, to inflict any punishment, the Court may determine not to conduct an inquiry and may dismiss the charge and order that the person be released.” 
         
        
       
     67   The inquiry into unfitness is before a jury constituted for that purpose (s11(1)), unless the accused, on advice, consents to the Judge determining the issue without a jury (s11A). The safeguards of the Common Law have been reproduced and strengthened by s12 of the Act. That section is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “s12(1) At an inquiry, the accused person is, unless the Court otherwise allows, to be represented by counsel or a solicitor. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) An inquiry is not to be conducted in an adversary manner. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) The onus of proof of the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence does not rest on any particular party to the proceedings in respect of the offence. …” 
         
        
       
     68   The issue of unfitness is to be determined upon the balance of probabilities (s6). If the accused is unfit, he or she must be referred to the Mental Health Tribunal (s14(a)). 
      
       
        
       The Question of Unfitness 
        
       
     69   This appeal is concerned with the proper construction of s10 of the Act. If there is a real and substantial issue as to the unfitness of the accused to stand trial, then justice requires that it be determined. It is impossible to imagine, in such circumstances, that a Court would then determine (having examined the motivation of the person who raised the question) that it was not raised in good faith, and decline to hold an inquiry (cf s10(2)). 
      
       
     70   Against this background, there are two ways in which the construction of s10 might have been approached. The section repeatedly uses the phrase “raise the question” concerning the unfitness of the accused. One may “raise the question” either by simply identifying the issue, without substantiation, or by the disclosure of some factual basis which, if accepted, gives rise to a real and substantial question concerning the unfitness of the accused to be tried. In Zhang the Court appeared to favour the first of these alternatives. Dunford J (with whom Foster AJA and Greg James J agreed) said this: (paras 28 & 29) 
      
       
        
         
         “28. It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that before s10 came into operation the trial judge had to be satisfied that there was a real and substantial question to be considered in relation to the accused’s fitness to be tried, and reference was made to  
         R v Presser 
          at 46,  
         Kesavarajah v The Queen 
          at 245 and  
         Eastman v The Queen 
          [2000] HCA 29, 74 ALJR 915, at paras [28], [66], [319]. However, those cases related to the procedure under the relevant Victorian and Australian Capital Territory legislation respectively, both of which were in significantly different terms to s10. 
         
        
        
         
         29. Counsel for the Crown expressed concern that there was a need for a further threshold test in addition to the raised in good faith test provided by subs (2), because the question could be raised in good faith but inappropriately, for example by an over anxious party. Not only do I consider such an occurrence most unlikely but, whatever the position may be at common law and in other states, s10 admits of no other threshold test.” 
         
        
       
     71   The exception provided by s10(2) recognises that an inquiry into fitness (involving a separate jury) is disruptive. It will often lead to the discharge of the jury hearing the trial. A mechanism is therefore needed (and is provided, by s10(2)) for the trial Judge to prevent attempts by the accused, or his representatives, to disrupt or abort the trial. No inquiry need be held where it appears to the Court that the question has not been raised in good faith (s10(2)). It will not be raised in good faith where there is no real and substantial question of unfitness, and where the motivation in raising the question (which is either transparent or to be imputed) is to disrupt the trial process (cf Dunford J R v Zhang (supra) para 29). Conversely, where there is a real and substantial question, good faith will be presumed. 
      
       
     72   Section 10, therefore, suggests a sequence of questions. Usually, an accused person will be represented (s12(1)). Where an accused’s representative raises a question concerning the unfitness of the accused, the trial Judge would ordinarily be expected to accept that the issue has been raised in good faith. Legal representatives, whether barrister or solicitor, are subject to professional obligations. Once raised by a practitioner there is, prima facie, an obligation upon the trial Judge to halt the trial, and to conduct an inquiry before a separate jury. If, however, the basis for concern is not obvious, or the validity of that concern is dubious, it is appropriate for the trial Judge to seek an elaboration upon the matters giving rise to the concern (cf Ngatayi v The Queen (supra) at 8). Where that elaboration demonstrates a real and substantial question, good faith will be presumed. The question of unfitness must then be determined by a separate jury. It is only where there is patently no real and substantial question that the Court may impute an absence of good faith, and decline to conduct an inquiry (s10(2)). 
      
       
        
       The Trial Judge’s Reasons 
        
       
     73   When the issue of Mr Tier’s unfitness was first raised (12 August 1999), his Honour identified a threshold issue. He said this: (p18) 
      
       
        
         
         “I have said that the question before the Court today is really a threshold question and the fate of the application stands or falls on that threshold question. It is worth repeating that the Court, in imperative terms, is enjoined that it must not conduct an inquiry into the question of a person’s fitness to be tried for an offence unless it appears to the Court that the question has been raised in good faith.” 
         
        
       
     74   Referring to Lord Denning in Central Estates (Belgravia) Ltd v Woolgar (1971) 3 All E R 647, his Honour took the expression “good faith” in s10(2) of the Act to mean “honestly and with no ulterior motive” (p 19). His Honour also referred to the Second Reading Speech of the Minister, given on 22 November 1983, in respect of s428F(2) of the Crimes Act, 1900, which was the previous section, in similar terms (although using the words “bona fide” rather than “good faith”). The Minister said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “This will prevent any accused from delaying his trial by repeatedly making a false claim that he is not fit to be tried.” 
         
        
       
     75   His Honour then said this: (p19) 
      
       
        
         
         “I am firm in my conclusion that the precondition to the Court exercising its jurisdiction under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 has not been satisfied. I am not prepared to come to a conclusion on the balance of probabilities that the question of his fitness to be tried has been raised in good faith. It may be that Mr Tier is unfit to be tried. I say that would have to be a possibility. It is only a possibility. It is to my mind far from a probability. Other matters to my mind, which I do not see it necessary to record or express, are more probable than that Mr Tier is presently unfit to be tried.  
         
        
        
         
         In those circumstances I refuse the application …” 
         
        
       
     76   The appellant complains that reasons ought to have been provided for the conclusion that the question had not been raised in good faith. The complaint is justified (Jordan CJ in Carlson v The King (1947) 64 WN(NSW) 65 at 66; McHugh JA in Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 279; R v Maxwell (CCA, unreported, 23 December 1998) at 46). The parties were entitled to know the basis upon which his Honour viewed the application as not being made in good faith. 
      
       
     77   The Crown, in its submissions, endeavoured to identify reasons based upon the history of the trial. It is not obvious, however, which aspects of that history his Honour had in mind. 
      
       
     78   It will be remembered that Mr Tier was brought from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital to Court under bench warrant (and thereafter held in custody, bail refused). The issue of his unfitness was reagitated approximately one week later, on 20 August 1999. His Honour again refused to hold a fitness hearing. He did so upon the same basis, namely a failure to satisfy the Court that the issue of unfitness had been raised in good faith (s10(2) of the Act).  
      
       
     79   The issue was approached by his Honour as a contest between two parties, the Crown, and Mr Tier. His Honour’s judgment speaks in terms of “the case” advanced by the accused (p4). His Honour said this: (p7) 
      
       
        
         
         “The test applied when the Court determined the first application on 12 August was on the balance of probabilities. Support for this being the appropriate test comes not only from s6 but also from s142 of the Evidence Act 1995 which provides that, except as otherwise provided, in any proceeding the Court is to find that the facts necessary for deciding … any other question arising under this Act (has) been proved if it is satisfied that (it) has been proved on the balance of probabilities.” 
         
        
       
     80   His Honour ultimately made the following determination: (p8) 
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion the appropriate test is on the balance of probabilities. My conclusion on this application is the same as it was in relation to the first application. As announced, the evidence does not satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that the threshold test has been met.” 
         
        
       
     81   The findings made by his Honour in respect of the second application were in these terms: (p9) 
      
       
        
         
         “In the context of considering what is said in these works as to what the expressions ‘bona fide’ and ‘good faith’ mean, I pose the question thus: does the Court consider that the raising of Mr Tier’s alleged incapacity because he suffers from major depression a matter which has the quality of being raised with sincerity and genuineness? If that is the appropriate way to state the question I say that the answer of the Court is no, it does not.” 
         
        
       
     82   His Honour added: (p10) 
      
       
        
         
         “I ask myself: is the raising of the question of whether Mr Tier is unfit something that the Court is satisfied is not faked, nor feigned, nor pretended, nor simulated, nor specious, nor spurious or disingenuous? To answer such formulations it is necessary to have resort to double negation in order to express the state of my mind which is that I am not prepared to hold that the raising of the question is not faked, feigned, pretended, simulated, specious, spurious or disingenuous.” 
         
        
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     83   I believe that the approach of the trial Judge manifested error. 
      
       
     84   First, it was important that his Honour maintain the distinction between his role, and that of the jury. He appears, with respect, not to have done so. Although his Honour saw himself as addressing the issue of good faith raised by s10(2) of the Act, his investigation and determination went beyond anything required by that subsection. In his first judgment explicitly, and his second judgement implicitly, he addressed the question whether Mr Tier was, as a matter of probability, unfit to be tried. He found that he was not. That, however, was a question for the jury. His Honour recognised the possibility that Mr Tier may be unfit. That should have been enough to persuade him that the question had been raised, that it was a real and substantial question, and that good faith may be presumed. The exception in s10(2) had no application. 
      
       
     85   Secondly, his Honour had before him a substantial body of evidence that Mr Tier was, or may be, unfit to be tried. Three doctors had expressed that view. Dr Simpson, in charge of Mr Tier’s treatment at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Associate Professor Buhrich, the head of the psychiatric unit at that hospital, and Dr Jurek, Mr Tier’s treating psychiatrist, had each diagnosed major depression. Each said that Mr Tier was unfit adequately to defend himself by reason of that condition. Ms Spooner, Mr Tier’s solicitor, provided her perspective, which suggested that Mr Tier was unfit, as did Mr Rasmussen, Mr Tier’s counsel. It is plain, upon the basis of this material, that there was a real and substantial question to be tried. In the circumstances, I do not believe it was open to his Honour to impute an absence of good faith under s10(2). 
      
       
     86   Finally, the issue of unfitness was approached by his Honour as a contest between parties. That, I believe, was inappropriate. In determining the issues under ss10(1) and 10(2), it was inappropriate to regard Mr Tier as making a “case” (cf s12(2)). The issues were not to be determined on the balance of probabilities. That standard would ultimately be applied by the jury when determining the issue of unfitness (s6), once an inquiry was undertaken. Section 142 of the Evidence Act (as the Crown acknowledged), had no application. 
      
       
     87   As mentioned, an error as to the accused’s unfitness is fundamental. There is no question of the application of the proviso (Kesavarajah v The Queen (supra) at 248). 
      
       
     88   It is for these reasons that I joined in the orders of the Court made on 8 February 2001, namely: 
      
       
        
       1. The appeal should be allowed. 
        
        
       2. The conviction of Mr Tier should be quashed. 
        
        
       3. There should be a new trial.

       GREG JAMES, J. 
       
        
      FRIDAY 30 MARCH 2001 
      
      REGINA v. DAVID FREDERICK ANDERSON 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   WOOD, CJ. at CL: I will ask Greg James, J. to deliver the first judgment. 
     2   GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour Judge O'Reilly, QC. in the District Court of New South Wales in consequence of the applicant having been found guilty by the verdict of a jury on a charge of break, enter and steal and his having pleaded guilty to two counts; one of larceny and the other of detain for advantage, an offence under s.90A of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the crime of break, enter and steal is imprisonment for 14 years. The maximum penalty for larceny is five years. The maximum penalty for the crime of detain for advantage in circumstances where the victim was not injured is 14 years. 
     3   In addition, the applicant asked there be taken into account two offences on a Form 1, viz., possession of a prohibited drug and entering enclosed lands without lawful excuse. 
     4   In respect of those crimes, his Honour imposed sentences of three years and six months to commence on 6 April 2000 and to expire on 5 October 2003 by way of a fixed term in respect of the first matter. On the second matter his Honour imposed on the first count a fixed term of two years and six months to commence on the same date as that provided for the sentence on the first matter. On the third count his Honour passed a sentence of seven years imprisonment to commence on the same commencement date, to expire on 5 April 2007. 
     5   In respect of those sentences his Honour imposed a non-parole period of five years and two months to commence on 6 April 2000 and to expire on 5 June 2005. 
     6   It will become of significance later to note that the applicant was arrested on 12 September 1999 in relation to the matter contained on the first indictment. Bail was refused and the applicant remained in custody until 27 October 1999 when, following a grant of bail in this court, he was released. 
     7   Shortly, the crimes the applicant committed were found by his Honour to have been attended with some degree of naivety on his part. Certainly, the explanation that he purported to give for the crimes of larceny and detaining was attended with, at least, naivety. He was one of a gang of three people who laid in wait for a bread vendor outside the bakery at about 4.15 am. The three people utilised the baker's access to the premises to detain him, tying him with electrical cord and frog marched him into the freezer where a pillow slip was put over his head. There was some utilisation of a gun. 
     8   His Honour found that the baker was under a considerable degree of apprehension, having had a loose rather than a written guarantee, as his Honour expressed it, that the assailants were reasonable men. The prisoner and the two others stole a large quantity of cigarettes and escaped. He was charged and committed for trial. 
     9   It was after that committal for trial and after a fresh indictment had been presented against him that he pleaded guilty to the offences with which he was then charged rather than armed robbery, of which he had stood charged previously. 
     10   His Honour had in his recital of the events in his remarks on sentence, after dealing with those matters, returned to events that had taken place at Agnes Banks on 12 September 1999. His Honour referred to circumstances whereby the applicant on that occasion was found to have participated with another man in stealing a cash register from a hairdressing business after throwing a brick through a window. They were apprehended when, having driven off with the cash register on the back of their vehicle, by coincidence, they came across a police investigation of another matter and in attempting to conceal the cash register, placed it under the car. 
     11   His Honour was of the view, not inappropriately it seems to me, that the two matters on the Form 1 were not really significant in the context of all the offences his Honour had to deal with. One of those matters involved the possession of a small amount of cannabis. The other involved entering premises at Agnes Banks after the secreting of the cash register under the vehicle to which I have already referred. These were premises the two men entered in order to hide. His Honour took those two matters into account. 
     12   He noted that the applicant was only 26 years of age, but referred to his appalling prior record of multiple convictions for dishonesty and offences relating to the taking of the property of others in circumstances such as showed the applicant has no regard for the normal considerations of honesty. His Honour remarked, ""I deal with him really on the basis he has an unremitting record for crimes of dishonesty"". 
     13   It was, however, accepted in the applicant's favour that there was little in his record to suggest violence. He appeared to have been basically unemployed, as appeared from the pre-sentence report that his Honour noted. He had a gambling problem and he expressed some remorse for what he had done to the baker, but no remorse in respect of the taking of the cash register. For the offences to which he had pleaded guilty, his Honour took that plea into account. 
     14   There was some discussion as to the seriousness of the offences the applicant had committed in the context of the decision of this court in Regina v. Ponfield & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 435 concerning guidelines for the offence of break, enter and steal. However, his Honour noted, and entirely appropriately, that at the time at which the prisoner committed the Agnes Banks break and enter the prisoner was on bail for the other matters. His Honour could detect nothing by way of genuine regret and remorse or steps towards substantial rehabilitation taken by the prisoner. 
     15   Structuring his sentence in accordance with, as his Honour expressed it, what the High Court said in Pearce v. The Queen (1988) 194 CLR 610, his Honour passed the sentences that I have referred to. 
     16   At the conclusion of his Honour's examination of the relevant matters there was some discussion with counsel appearing for the prisoner as to the appropriate commencement date of the sentences. It appears that notwithstanding the prisoner had been in custody, bail refused, for the period to which I have earlier referred, that matter was not brought to his Honour's attention at that point of time. So his Honour dated the sentence from the time at which the applicant had entered into custody at Penrith, he having pleaded guilty at Campbelltown and did not have, it appears to me, specific regard to that period in custody. 
     17   In my view, it will be necessary, subject to an examination of the other grounds of appeal, for us to have regard to that period in the disposition of this matter. 
     18   The applicant has appeared before us unrepresented. He has provided written submissions. Those submissions essentially suggest that he was unaware that the plea that he made to the offences of larceny and detain for advantage might produce the consequence of a more severe attitude being taken than might have been embraced by a simple plea to larceny. He has submitted that he did not understand that this meant that he was admitting that the victim was detained in a way which might attract a seven years gaol sentence. 
     19   He has specifically drawn attention to comparisons made by his Honour in his remarks on sentence and in argument with cases of abduction involving more severe violence. He wished to make it clear that he limited his appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed for the abduction conviction.  
     20   Notwithstanding that the applicant may not have been himself engaged in any serious violence of a particular kind to the victim, nonetheless, he participated fully in an offence which involved quite serious violence being inflicted upon the victim. The offence under s.90A is punishable by a higher maximum in the event that injury is occasioned to a victim. There is nothing advanced which would challenge the integrity of the plea. 
     21   His Honour does not appear to me to have fallen into any error in the way in which he dealt with the sentence on that matter or the sentences taken together in the context of the facts that his Honour properly found. I do not consider that any error has been shown in his Honour's disposition of the matter, excepting only his Honour's failure to take into account the period that the applicant has been in custody. 
     22   Indeed, on one argument, since the later offences were committed whilst the applicant was on bail for the former offence, extending to the applicant the benefit of the whole of that period is to be, to a degree, generous. 
     23   Nonetheless, I am of the view that sufficient has been shown such that the sentences should be varied for that reason and the non-parole period consequently varied in accordance with s.52 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by directing that all sentences are to commence not on the date stipulated by his Honour but on 21 February 2000 so that the sentences and non-parole period would commence on that date and in each case would expire 45 days earlier than that date his Honour had stipulated. 
     24   I would propose that to that extent the application for leave be granted, the appeal allowed and the sentences so varied. 
     25   WOOD, CJ. at CL: I agree. The orders of the court will be as have been proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
     The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm under s 52A(3)(a) Crimes Act on the basis of intoxication. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence on the grounds that (1) his Honour took into account material which was not in evidence; (2) the sentence was manifestly excessive. Held: (Allowing the appeal):Ground 1: Material not in evidenceThe statement of facts recorded that the applicant was traveling at 70km per hour in a 60km per hour zone. A statement given by a witness indicated that the applicant’s vehicle was traveling at 100km per hour. This statement was not in evidence before the sentencing Judge. The sentencing Judge’s reference to the speed of the vehicle was in error. His Honour should not have taken this statement into account. This aspect of the case was left in an unsatisfactory position.Ground 2: Sentence Excessive The considerations relevant to sentencing the applicant were those outlined in the guideline judgment of Jurisic. It would have been preferable for his Honour to have given more precise attention to the existence or non-existence of factors identified in Jurisic. In the present case special circumstances were shown, such as the high degree of remorse displayed; age and complex personal history of the applicant; the justifiable concern the applicant had in relation to his safety in custody; the interest of encouraging rehabilitation and the applicant’s need for psychological treatment. The sentence was manifestly excessive. Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 applied.ORDERS PROPOSED(1) Appeal allowed. (2) Sentence quashed and new sentence imposed of two and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months.

        REGINA v JONATHON DAVID KILBORN 
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
        
     1   WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Shadbolt in the District Court on 22 May 2000. The sentence was one of three years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of two years, for an offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm under S 52A(3)(a) of the Crimes Act, to which the applicant pleaded guilty on 9 August 1999. 
     2   In sentencing the applicant, his Honour found that he was the driver of a Suzuki Hatchback which, at the time of the accident giving rise to the offence, was travelling west in the kerbside lane of the Broadway, Sydney at about 6.25am. He had begun his journey into the city some time earlier from Kensington, and upon his own admission he was affected by liquor. 
     3   While in the kerbside lane the applicant came upon a taxi parked in lane 2. The victim, Lin Zang Zen, was standing near its front nearside door, remonstrating with a female who had been a passenger in his taxi and who, having abandoned it, had hailed and stopped the second taxi. Her purpose had apparently been to evade the fare due to Mr Lin.  
     4   The applicant's vehicle struck Mr Lin while he was standing in this position talking to her. The impact bent the door of the taxi backwards against the wing of that vehicle. 
     5   The applicant's vehicle was, at this point, out of control and sliding on the wet roadway. He managed, however, to turn left into City Road after travelling a further 50 metres or so along the Broadway. After doing so he struck the rear of a vehicle driven by Amanda McGuire, who had just made a lawful right hand turn into City Road from the Broadway. Thereafter, his vehicle mounted the kerb, drove along it for some eight metres before crashing into, and demolishing a ""no standing"" sign. He then crossed over the three southbound lanes of City Road and mounted the median strip before colliding with a Toyota Camry sedan driven by Mr Yu, who, as a result of that further collision, also suffered some injuries. 
     6   Upon coming to rest, the applicant fled the scene, on his account, because he was fearful and panicked. However, he made contact with his partner within a short time and later turned himself into police. 
     7   The effects of the accident upon Mr Lin were appropriately described by his Honour as having been “catastrophic” in that he suffered traumatic brain damage requiring emergency surgery, as well as a fracture to his shoulder, and soft tissue injuries to a knee. He has been left with permanent cognitive impairment and abnormalities of behavioural control, as well as depression, which have taken him out of the work force. 
     8   The sentence is challenged upon the basis that: 
      
       
      1) His Honour took into account material that was not in evidence, and 
       
        
       
      2) The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
        
       
      I shall deal with each submission in turn. 
       
        
       
      1. Material Not in Evidence 
       
        
     9   The material in question concerns a statement that had been provided by a witness to the accident, Mr Beck, in which he had assessed the speed of the applicant at the time of the accident at about 100 kilometres per hour. This statement was not in evidence, and the statement of facts that was tendered had been edited to remove the relevant passage. 
     10   In those circumstances, it should not have been taken into account by his Honour, particularly as his attention had been drawn to that fact by counsel for the applicant and also by the Crown Prosecutor. The applicant had admitted, in an ERISP, to have been driving at about 70 kilometres per hour at the time of the collision, a speed which he acknowledged was in excess of the 60 kilometres per hour limit in force. It was at that speed that the statement of facts recorded him to have been driving. It was at that speed that he was entitled to be sentenced. 
     11   The competing versions were noted by his Honour in the reasons for sentence, although without any specific finding as to the applicant's speed. That was regrettable, having regard to the earlier observation made by his Honour, during the sentencing proceedings, when this point had been drawn to his attention: 
      
       
        
        ""I don't think it makes much difference any way. I certainly wouldn't accept from him, either on his oath or to the police, that he was going at 70 kilometres an hour."" 
        
       
        
     12   Whether his Honour maintained that view when pronouncing sentence, is not known. It should have been made known. 
     13   If he did in fact sentence the applicant on the basis that he was travelling at 100 kilometres per hour, then he was, in my view, in error, since that was not a finding that could have been made upon the evidence before him.  
     14   It also should not be overlooked that the case was prosecuted upon the basis that the dangerous driving was attributable to the fact that the applicant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor rather than to the fact that he was driving at a speed dangerous to another person or persons.  
     15   Having regard to the distinctly unsatisfactory position in which this aspect of the case was left, I would grant leave to appeal and consider the matter afresh. 
      
       
      2. Sentence Excessive 
       
        
     16   To some degree this ground overlaps the first, since it needs to be considered in the light of all of the considerations which are relevant for sentencing in a case such as the present, being those identified in the guideline judgment of Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. There Spigelman CJ said at 231: 
      
       
        
          
         
        ""The list of mitigating and aggravating factors, conveniently collected by Lord Lane CJ in 
         R v Boswell 
         and quoted above, are reflected in the judgments of this Court to which I have made reference. The presence or absence of these factors - and their degree - will determine the appropriate penalty. A survey of the authorities indicates that the following factors arise: 
         
          
         
        (i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted.  
         
        (ii) Number of people put at risk. 
         
        (iii) Degree of speed. 
         
        (iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse. 
         
        (v) Erratic driving. 
         
        (vi) Competitive driving or showing off. 
         
        (vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk. 
         
        (viii) Ignoring of warnings. 
         
        (ix) Escaping police pursuit. 
         
          
         
        A number of these factors are reflected in the definition of ""circumstances of aggravation"" in s 52A(7), for purposes of the two higher offences. 
         
          
         
        Paragraph (i) and par (ii) focus on the occurrence, whereas pars (iii)-(ix) refer to the conduct of the offender. The presence of these latter factors may indicate that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. When the presence of such a factor can be so described, then it can be said to be present to a material degree for purposes of determining an appropriate sentence. 
         
          
         
        In my opinion this Court should promulgate the following guidelines: 
         
          
         
        1. A non-custodial sentence for an offence against s 52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or mis-judgment. 
        
       
       
        
        2. With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death)  
        and less than two years 
         (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional. 
         
          
         
        I realise that the formulation I propose - does the relevant aggravating factor manifest, in the circumstances of the case, that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct - introduces an element of judgment on which reasonable minds may differ. Nevertheless the formulation of the issue in such a way will serve the objective of consistency of sentencing with respect to conduct that the community has indicated plainly that it wishes to deter and condemn."" 
        
       
       
        
          
        
       
     17   Reference to that decision was made in the reasons for sentence, so far as his Honour noted that this case did not qualify as a ""rare exception"" justifying a non-custodial sentence, and in so far as he stated: 
      
       
        
          
         
        ""This is certainly not a matter of momentary inattention. It is a combination of over-indulgence and speed."" 
        
       
     18   It is that reference to “speed” which gives rise to concern, having regard to the matters previously mentioned. 
     19   His Honour expressly took into account first, the applicant's plea of guilty, although noting that it had to be viewed in the light of ""the circumstances of the collision, his subsequent record of interview, and the very detailed eyewitness accounts on what had happened""; secondly, the fact that he was young, (aged 28 years at the time of the accident); thirdly, that he had been employed for most of his adult life and had work to go to when released; fourthly, that was he was capable of reformation; and fifthly, that his driving record, while not good, had not been so bad over the last ten years ""as to preclude any leniency whatsoever"". 
     20   His Honour also noted that he had a history of having had a troubled childhood and adolescence, having been sexually assaulted by a member of the congregation of which his father had been a minister, and of having suffered anxiety and depression consequent upon that experience. His Honour regarded that experience as of marginal relevance as it had no causal connection with the offence. It would also appear that, while his Honour noted the various difficulties identified in the presentence and psychiatric reports, which dealt with the applicant's upbringing by parents who were profoundly deaf as well as very conservative and very strict; his relationship, which had not been accepted by them; and the fears he held about the risk of exposure to sexual abuse if held in open custody, little if any weight was given to them, save so far as they assisted in the finding of special circumstances. 
     21   Returning to the objective circumstances, I consider that it would have been preferable for his Honour to have given more precise attention to the existence, or non existence, of the factors that were identified in Jurisic as being of relevance for the determination of penalty, than occurred in this case. 
     22   The material available does show that there were a number of the circumstances identified in Jurisic present, in that: 
      
       
      a) The injuries of the victim were extensive and permanent; 
       
      b) A number of people were placed at risk, having regard to the applicant's own assessment that there was traffic around, and the fact that he struck two other motor vehicles, apart from that occupied by the second taxi driver and by Mr Lin's former passenger; 
       
      c) The applicant was driving in excess of the speed limit by about 10 kilometres per hour on a road that was wet, in conditions where he acknowledged that his vision ahead was blurred to a degree by rain, and where he acknowledged that had he been driving slower, he could have maintained greater control of his vehicle. 
       
       
      d) He was, on his own admission, affected by intoxicating liquor, having consumed four schooners of beer and two or three black Sambucas from about 11.45 pm, acknowledging that he had felt that he was drunk, and had known it was ""wrong to hop in the car"". 
       
       e) He had driven a considerable distance, while in this state, and on his own admission had been feeling “tired”. 
       
       f) He had seen the taxi and victim on the roadway at least 35 metres away, but he had carried on before braking hard, at the last moment on a wet road, in circumstances guaranteed to cause a loss of control of the vehicle. 
       
     23   Having regard to these matters and assuming, in the applicant's favour, that he was travelling at 70 kilometres per hour at the time of the accident, the case remains properly one involving more than momentary inattention. It was one, in my view, justifying the description of an “abandonment of responsibility” which, although not of a gross kind, was appreciable. 
     24   I am of the view that the head sentence was excessive and that error occurred in the way in which the matter of speed was taken into account. I am also satisfied that special circumstances were shown. They are attributable to: 
      
      i) the very high degree of remorse displayed;  
       
      (ii) the age and complex personal history of the applicant, including the alienation from his family, and the exposure to sexual abuse which has led him to be particularly susceptible to the form of reactive depression diagnosed by Doctor Roberts, and to have been, for at least a period of his life, at risk of self harm;  
       
      (iii) the justifiable cause for concern which he had in relation to his safety while in custody;  
       
      (iv) the interest of encouraging his rehabilitation and return to the workforce;  
       
      (v) and the need for him to receive treatment for his somewhat fragile psychological state, with which he has been attempting to come to grips.  
       
     25   The existence of these favourable objective circumstances has been confirmed by the additional material placed before us today and which was received on the usual condition that it would be taken into account if the court thought it appropriate otherwise to intervene. 
     26   I observe that, in the explanation given to the applicant as to the effect of the sentence, and in the framing of the sentencing order, his Honour overlooked S 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 which requires, in the case of a sentence not exceeding three years, that an order be made directing the release of the applicant at the end of the non-parole period. It is necessary this error be remedied, however, I am also of the view that independently, when the full circumstances are properly taken into account, the sentence was shown to be manifestly excessive. 
     27   I would accordingly grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal and quash the sentence below. I propose substituting in its place a sentence of imprisonment for two and a half years to commence on 22 May 2000. I would fix a non-parole period of fifteen months, to date from 22 May 2000, and to expire on 21 August 2001. I would direct the release of the applicant at the end of that non-parole period. 
     28   GREG JAMES J: I agree. 
     29   WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the court will be therefore as I have proposed. Do you understand Mr. Kilborn that the Court has allowed your appeal? A non parole period of fifteenth months has been set. You will be released at the end of that period.30   APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.

      Regina v MH 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     The applicant pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 16 in circumstances of aggravation, namely that the victim was under his authority, pursuant to s 66 C (2) Crimes Act 1900. The applicant also pleaded guilty to the commission of an act of indecency with the same victim. Six other offences were included on Form 1. None of these acts were disputed by the applicant when he gave evidence. The applicant was sentenced to an effective head sentence of seven and a half years imprisonmentThe applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the grounds that (1) the applicant was sentenced on a factual basis that was not particularised; (2) the uncharged offences were inappropriately taken into account by the trial judge as circumstances of aggravation; (3) the trial judge failed to give proper weight to the pleas and confession. Held: (Appeal dismissed):Ground 1: applicant was sentenced on a factual basis that was not particularisedThe indictment stated that the offence occurred when the victim was 14 years of age. The trial judge sentenced the applicant with reference to the complainant’s statement that she was 13 years of age. This was not a case where the dates particularised were of the essence, that is essential ingredients of the offence. The indictment was not defective. The offence to which the applicant pleaded did not differ according to whether the victim was 13 or 14 years old at the time of the commission. Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270; Stringer (2000) NSWCCA 293 distinguished. Ground 2: uncharged offences were inappropriately taken into accountThis submission relied on the assumption that the trial judge added an increment to the sentences for the charged offences, by way of punishment for uncharged acts in the victim’s statement. However, nothing in the reasons for sentence provided support for this assumption. It was entirely appropriate for the prosecution to place before the Court the wider sexual history, to explain the relationship, to place the offences into context and to meet any suggestion that the offences were islolated incidents. H (1980) A Crim R 53; RNS (1999) NSWCCA 122; GWE NSWCCA 12 March 1997; H (1994) 74 A Crim R 41; JCW (2000) NSWCCA 209 applied. Ground 3: the trial judge failed to give proper weight to the pleas and confessionThe trial judge did not overlook the significance of the pleas and the fact that the applicant effectively gave himself up to police. Although the extent of the discount extended was not indicated, the sentence was pronounced before the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton in which that course was encouraged. A failure to expressly quantify the discount given does not demonstrate an appellable error. In the end the question depends upon a consideration of what might have been an appropriate sentence, after taking into account all of the objective and subjective circumstances, including the early pleas and the assistance provided through the voluntary disclosure of the offences. Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 applied. ORDERS PROPOSED(1) Leave to appeal granted. Appeal dismissed.(2) Sentence confirmed.

       REGINA v M H 
       
        
       
       JUDGMENT 
      1   WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Job in the District Court at Gosford on 5 May 2000. 
     2   Pleas of guilty were entered by him in relation to three counts of sexual intercourse with a child between the age of 10 and 16 years in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that the victim, who was his step-daughter, was under his authority. These three counts were preferred under s 66 C (2) of the Crimes Act and the maximum penalty available for each offence was imprisonment for 10 years.  
     3   The indictment further charged the commission of an act of indecency with the same victim while under the age of 16 years and under his authority. The maximum penalty for this offence, to which the applicant pleaded guilty, was imprisonment for five years (s 61 0 (1) of the Crimes Act). 
     4   The short facts in relation to these crimes were as follows: 
     5    Count 1: At a time before her fourteenth birthday (a circumstance to which I will return) the applicant instructed the victim to remove her shorts and underpants and to lie on the floor. He placed a condom on his penis and inserted it a small way in her vagina before withdrawing when she complained that it hurt. 
     6   Count 2: After the victim turned 14 the applicant again placed his penis into her vagina on this occasion penetrating her more deeply and occasioning her pain. 
     7   Count 3: One afternoon after school, when the victim was 14 or 15 years of an age the applicant instructed her to remove her top and bra and to suck his penis. 
     8   Count 4:  On 8 January 1999 the prisoner took the victim into the bathroom to shower together. While there he made her masturbate him. 
     9   The total period spanned by these counts as charged was between 15 September 1997 and 8 January 1999. 
     10   Six other offences were included on a Form 1 spanning a period of two years from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1998. They include three offences of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61 M (1) of the Crimes Act, the first of which involved the applicant touching the victim's vagina and having her touch his penis; the second of which involved the applicant having the victim masturbate him; and the third of which involved him shaving her pubic hair.  
     11   The remaining three matters comprised offences of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 years, under the applicant's authority, contrary to s 66 C (2) of the Crimes Act. The first of these additional matters involved the act of the applicant in requiring the victim to suck his penis while they were in the bathroom together. The second and third offences occurred on the same date and involved the act of the applicant in producing two vibrators, one of which he required the victim to insert into her vagina and the other of which he inserted into her anus while masturbating her with a pen and requiring her, all the while, to read to him from the Forum column of a Penthouse magazine. 
     12   The offences included in the indictment and in the Form 1 were shown to be part of a wider history of sexual interference with the victim, who had been born on 15 September 1983. In the two statements which she provided, and which were tendered without objection, she described a number of other acts of the applicant commencing with his regular touching of her breasts and vagina, from the age of about 11 years, taking and placing her hand on his penis and placing his penis between her legs in the shower, requiring her to dance for him in underwear, showing her pornographic images on the Internet of women engaged in sexual activity with animals and showing her photographs of himself having sex with his wife. None of these acts were disputed by the applicant when he gave evidence. 
     13   The applicant was sentenced on counts 1 and 3 in the indictment to a fixed term of two and a half wears to date from 2 May 2000; and in relation to count 4 to a fixed term of 18 months to be served concurrently with the sentences in relation to counts 2 and 3. In relation to the first count, taking into consideration the matters on the Form 1, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for five years to be served cumulatively upon the sentences for counts 2 and 3. The effective head sentence was accordingly one of seven and a half years imprisonment. A non-parole period was set to expire on 1 May 2005. 
     14   Before turning to the grounds upon which the applicant relies it is convenient to note that the offences only came to light because of the prisoner's disclosures to his wife, commencing on 15 February 1999, with expressions of concern that he had been entertaining inappropriate feelings for the victim, although without having touched her; and progressing to disclosure, on the following day, to having had sex with her. During these various disclosures the applicant displayed a good deal of distress, and on the second occasion the police were contacted because of his wife's fears that he might harm himself. When speaking to police over the phone he asked them to come and arrest him. 
     15   When formally interviewed by the police the applicant admitted to having incompletely and briefly penetrated the vagina of the victim on two occasions. He did not disclose any wider sexual impropriety with her.  
     16   The applicant pleaded guilty to the offences from the outset and sought counselling from Doctors Darcy and Spark, neither of whom found in him any sign of mental illness apart from some depression reactive to his stress, guilt, unemployment and isolation, and to the pending court proceedings. The applicant also saw a counsellor, Mr Bust, and a psychiatric nurse and was referred for possible pre-trial diversion via the Cedar House programme. He was however adjudged unsuitable for that programme. He was also referred for a psychiatric assessment for the purpose of determining his suitability for entry into the Sex Offenders Programme. He was assessed as posing a moderate risk of reoffending and to be suitable for the educational programme which is a precursor to the CORE programme, a low intensity programme designed to help sex offenders work on changing their thinking, attitude and feelings. 
     17   The applicant was 41 years of age when he appeared for sentence. He had a prior record of some antiquity and of no relevance to the present offences, as well as a history of employment with Telecom for some 20 years before taking redundancy. His Honour assessed that working record as ""good"" and expressly noted that he would not take the prior convictions into account. 
     18   In 1996 the applicant was involved in a motor vehicle accident in the course of which he suffered a back injury and his wife suffered serious leg injuries which left her in constant pain and which interfered with their sexual life. 
     19   When giving evidence the applicant expressed shame for what he had done and accepted that the effect on the victim was ""insurmountable"" and inexcusable. It was his evidence that, while he knew what he was doing was against the law, he had not thought it to be wrong. He said that he was now searching for reasons, and seeking assistance, as to why he had done what he has done. 
     20   The fact of the disclosures to his wife he attributed to the accumulation of guilt that he needed to get off his chest, to the realisation that the victim was being deprived of the opportunity for forming relationships with persons of her own age, and to the realisation that he did not want the misconduct to continue. 
     21   He asserted that he was not trying to lay blame on the victim, although that was not the impression of the authors of the psychological reports, who came to the view that he was endeavouring to pass some responsibility to her. 
     22   All of these matters were taken into account by his Honour, in a comprehensive judgment on sentence, in the course of which he noted that it was in the applicant's favour that he had contacted the police voluntarily, before any complaint had been made by the victim, and that the pleas of guilty had saved her the ordeal of having to give evidence. Each of those matters his Honour expressly said that he would take into account. Special circumstances were found, having regard to the assessment that the applicant would need some assistance when released upon parole. 
     23   His Honour appropriately noted that the offences were extremely serious, that young children are virtually helpless against sexual attacks by parents, and that deterrence is of prime importance when sentencing in such cases. 
     24   It was submitted that his Honour fell into error in three respects: 
      
       
      The Applicant was Sentenced on Count 1 on a Factual Basis that was not Particularised: 
       
     25   This count charged an offence while the victim was aged 14 years occurring between 15 September 1997 and 15 September 1998, yet his Honour sentenced him by reference to the facts contained in paragraph 13 of the complainant’s first statement, that is, upon the basis that she was aged 13 years. 
     26   It is true that during the period charged she would have been aged 14 years. The sentencing proceedings were, however, conducted upon the basis that it was the facts asserted in paragraph 13 of the statement that gave rise to this count, and that the victim had in fact been aged 13 years. While leave was given to amend count 4 on the indictment, it appears that the need to amend count 1 to accord with the facts particularised, was overlooked. 
     27   This is not a case where the dates particularised were of the essence, that is, essential ingredients of the offence (see Stringer (2000) NSW CCA 293). The indictment was not, as a consequence, defective: s 58(g) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     28   It has been made clear this morning that the applicant does not seek to resile from the plea. Some reliance was, however, placed by the applicant upon the circumstance that, in the ERISP, he had admitted to only two acts of penile/vaginal intercourse, each occurring when the victim was aged fourteen years, and also upon the fact that, in paragraph 15 of the victim's statement, there were two such acts described by her as having occurred after her 14th birthday. 
     29   There are two problems with this submission which, as I have observed, does not raise a matter going to the integrity of the plea, but rather is directed to the proposition that the applicant was sentenced upon a more serious version of events than was in fact the case.  
     30   The first problem lies in the fact that the ERISP involved only a partial admission of the applicant's criminality. By his plea, by his request that the offences included in the Form 1 be taken into account, and by his failure to take issue with any of the matters raised in the victim's statements, the applicant clearly accepted the existence of a considerably wider history of offending than that to which he had admitted in the ERISP. It is disingenuous, in those circumstances, to submit that the applicant's admissions were confined to the two acts of penile/vaginal intercourse disclosed in the ERISP. 
     31   The case is not of the genus of which Kirby J spoke in Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 291. The offence to which the applicant pleaded did not differ according to whether the victim was 13 or 14 years old at the time of its commission. In any event, I am quite unable to see that it was any less serious for the victim to have been aged fourteen years rather than thirteen years, in a case involving such a gross abuse of a breach of trust. This submission is not made good. 
      
       
      Uncharged Offences were Inappropriately taken into Account as Circumstances of Aggravation: 
       
     32   This submission depends on the assumption that his Honour added an increment to the sentences for the charged offences, by way of punishment for various uncharged acts disclosed in the victim's statement. 
     33   Had this been the case then the ground would have been made good for the reasons discussed in De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 and Olbrich (1999) 73 ALJR 1550. There is, however, nothing in the reasons for sentence that provides any support for the assumption upon which the submission rests. 
     34   It was entirely appropriate for the prosecution to place before his Honour the wider sexual history, in order to explain the relationship, to place the offences into context, and to meet any suggestion that the counts in the indictment and the Form 1 were isolated lapses on the applicant's part and not events occurring in the course of a systemic course of abuse extending over a number of years. This is established by a long line of authority: see for example H (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 at 59 per Street CJ, per Moffit P at 62 and per Begg J at 74; R N S (1999) NSW CCA 122; G W E NSW CCA 12 March 1997, H (1994) 74 A Crim R 41 per Gleeson CJ at 43 and J C W (2000) NSW CCA 209. 
     35   The continuing validity of the distinction between not increasing a sentence, and failing to grant leniency, on account of the fact that the events charged were not isolated instances, was examined in some detail in J C W in the light of the different approach that had been taken in Queensland, in the decision of D (1996) 1 QDR 363. 
     36   In J C W, after reviewing the authorities, Spigelman CJ at para 38, came to the conclusion there was no warrant for refusing to follow the consistent line of authority in this State and for adopting the reasoning in D. His Honour also noted that this approach would accord with that adopted in Victoria: S B L (1999) 1 VR 706; and with the observations of the High Court in Siganto (1998) 194 CLR 656, concerning the validity of the distinction between denying the existence of circumstances of mitigation, and asserting the existence of circumstances of aggravation. 
     37   I am not persuaded that his Honour used the wider sexual history other than for the purpose permitted by this line of authority. Moreover, the proof of the wider history was relevant in assessing the several matters arising for consideration from the psychiatric and psychological assessments, concerning in particular the applicant's appreciation of his wrongdoing, his prospects of rehabilitation, and the true extent of his remorse or contrition.  
     38   Moreover, the case was not one where there was any issue as to the occurrence of the uncharged events. The statements, as I have observed, were tendered without objection, and the applicant accepted in cross-examination that the misconduct had begun when the victim was 11 years old and had continued until the time of his arrest. He also agreed that he accepted full responsibility for his actions, and expressly acknowledged to having allowed the victim to see the pornography on the Internet and the photographs of himself and his wife. This submission is not made good. 
     39   In a supplementary submission an additional argument was advanced that his Honour fell into error so far as he had taken into account the fact that the applicant had been assessed as unsuitable for entry into the Cedar House programme. Reliance was placed, in this regard, upon the decisions of this Court in P W H NSW CCA 20 February 1992 and Harding NSW CCA 16 December 1993. 
     40   The point considered in those cases was, however, very different. It related to the relevance and admissibility of the proof of a breach of an agreement entered into by an offender, once admitted to the programme.  
     41   In the present case the attempted entry to Cedar House was a matter operating in favour of the applicant, so far as it demonstrated remorse; while the assessment of his unsuitability was also relevant for an appreciation of his contrition and an understanding of his criminality. There is no suggestion whatsoever that the fact of his lack of success in gaining entry to the programme was taken into account as a circumstance of aggravation. This additional ground is also not made good. 
      
       
      Failure to give Proper Weight to the Pleas and Confession: 
       
     42   It may be accepted that the pleas were early pleas, the applicant having been committed for sentence on 21 October 1999 by way of a hand up brief, and having earlier offered himself for admission to the Cedar House Diversionary Programme, a precondition of which was an acceptance of his guilt. The pleas had a considerable utilitarian value in saving the victim the ordeal of being called to give evidence, and also in saving the time and expense of a trial.  
     43   Moreover, the case is one where the fact of those pleas, and the evidence otherwise tendered, did convey a considerable degree of remorse upon his part. On the other hand, it also disclosed a lack of appreciation of the nature and extent of his criminality, and hence his contrition does need to be regarded as somewhat qualified. 
     44   It may also be accepted that, without the applicant's confessions to his wife and to the police, the offences would not have come to light when they did since, despite the suspicions entertained by the applicant's wife and from other relatives there had been no complaint from the victim. Indeed, on one occasion, when pressed about it, she had denied that the applicant had been touching her.  
     45   This is a circumstance that does operate in mitigation of the sentence for the reasons discussed in Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604. 
     46   However, it also ought not to be overlooked that, at the time of the disclosures, the complainant was still aged only fifteen years. In the light of the nature and extent of the violation of her, and with the benefit of the experience of similar victims coming forward years later, when they realise the enormity of what has occurred to them, it could not possibly be said that these offences would never have come to light but for the applicant's disclosures. 
     47   As I have observed his Honour did not overlook the significance of the pleas, and the fact that the applicant effectively gave himself up to police. Although he did not indicate the extent of the discount extended, it may be observed that the sentence was pronounced before the guideline decision of this Court in Thompson and Houlten (2000) 49 NSWLR 338 in which that course was particularly encouraged.  
     48   It is not the case that a failure to quantify expressly the discount given demonstrates appellable error. In the end the question depends upon a consideration of what might have been an appropriate sentence, after taking into account all of the objective and subjective circumstances, including the early pleas and the assistance provided through the voluntary disclosure of the offences. 
     49   The offences charged, and the number of them, properly placed this case in the upper range of seriousness for offences of their kind; see Ibbs (1987) 163 CLR 447. They involved a very serious breach of trust by a stepfather and the element of general and specific deterrence loomed large, since this kind of violation of children cannot be tolerated by any civilised society. 
     50   When these circumstances are taken into account, and the principle of totality is applied, I am of the view that the sentences were well within a legitimate range of sentencing discretion, and that the effective sentencing order reflected an appropriate reduction for the early pleas, and for the applicant's disclosure of his criminality. The sentencing statistics which were relied upon by the Crown, and by the applicant, for different purposes, provide very little by way of assistance in this regard, having regard to the number of offences here involved, and the wide range of objective and subjective circumstances which are encountered within the individual cases which make up those statistics. They have utility as background information, but they still need to be considered with a great deal of caution, since sentencing can never be reduced to a mathematical exercise dependent on statistics. 
     51   I would grant leave to appeal, but I would dismiss the appeal, and confirm the sentences below. 
     52   GREG JAMES J: I agree. 
     53   WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the Court will be as I have proposed.  
     54   The case will be reported under initials. Otherwise the name of the victim is not to be disclosed.

      REGINA v. JOHN ADRIAN KNIGHT (aka DAVID BLACK) 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   HEYDON, JA: I agree with Greg James, J. 
     2   STUDDERT, J: I agree with Greg James, J.3   GREG JAMES, J: The nature of the proceedings 
     4   This is an application for leave to appeal from convictions on some 20 charges after a trial before his Honour Judge Viney, QC. and a jury in the District Court at Sydney. 
     5   Those charges comprised 13 charges of make false instrument, an offence under s.300(1) of the Crimes Act (NSW) 1900, punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment; five charges of forge document deliverable to a public authority, an offence under s.67(b) of the Crimes Act (Cth) 1914, punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment; one offence of attempt to open bank account in false name contrary to s.24(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act (Cth) 1988, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment; and one offence of operate bank account in false name contrary to s.24(2) of that Act, again an offence punishable by a maximum of two years imprisonment. 
     6   For those offences his Honour imposed on the appellant, in total, a sentence of imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of 18 months. No application for leave to appeal against sentence has been brought. 
      
       
      The ground of appeal 
       
     7   On the application for leave to appeal against conviction, the sole ground argued is:- 
      
       
        
        ""The learned trial judge's discretion under s.138 of the Evidence Act miscarried when he was considering the application to exclude the P59B forms from evidence and he was in error in not excluding them."" 
        
       
     8   That ground asserts that examples of the appellant's handwriting obtained on standard police forms (P59B forms) should not have been allowed as evidence on which expert opinion expressed at the trial could be based. 
      
       
      Summary of submissions 
       
     9   It is contended that his Honour, in applying s.138 of the Evidence Act 1995 and the public policy considerations examined in Bunning v. Cross (1977-78) 141 CLR 54, erred because he had failed to hold that it was necessary the accused be informed of the purpose for which the handwriting was sought to be provided and its possible use so that any co-operation or consent of his to providing it would be with that knowledge. In the absence of the provision of that information, it was submitted, the obtaining of samples of the appellant's handwriting was attended with grave impropriety so as to attract s.138 or on the basis the provision of them amounted to making admissions, s.139, as there had not been a caution. It was submitted that his Honour should have followed the course asserted to have been taken in the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court by Miles, CJ. in Regina v. Browning (1991) 103 FLR 425, where, by a ruling during a criminal trial, his Honour rejected the tender of samples of handwriting of the accused obtained in circumstances at least superficially similar to those under which the handwriting samples were obtained in this case. 
     10   In the case of all those samples obtained before the commencement of the Evidence Act in 1995, the absence of the caution meant, so it was submitted, that they should be rejected as being admissions or analogous to them, on public policy grounds or because it would be unfair having regard to how the samples were obtained, to use them against the appellant at his trial and as to the remaining sample, it too should be rejected by reason of the application of s.138 or because it should be regarded as or analogous to an admission to which either s.139 or its spirit should apply. It was argued that a written requirement to provide identification particulars in handwriting was in the absence of the caution or the information I have referred to seriously deceptive in that it wrongly expressed that the requirement had lawful compulsive force. 
     11   Section 138(1) and (2) provide:- 
      
       
        
        ""(1) Evidence that was obtained:- 
        
       
       
        
         (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australia law; or 
        
       
       
        
         (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australia law; 
        
       
       
        
         is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:- 
        
       
       
        
         (a) did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning; or 
        
       
       
        
         (b) made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission."" 
        
       
     12   Section 138(3) details particular matters the court is to take into account when applying the section. For the purpose of this case, I do not consider it necessary to resolve whether there is any substantial difference between those matters and those necessary to consider at common law on the application of the public policy principles set out in Bunning v. Cross (supra). 
     13   The effect of s.139 is to deem evidence of a statement made or an act done by a person during questions to have been obtained improperly, relevant in the absence of a caution to the person in custody that they need not say or do anything but that if they do it may be used in evidence. 
     14   In reply, the Crown submits that the requirement was lawful; consent and/or co-operation was not necessary; the provision of the handwriting was not an admission nor analogous to that concept and hence s.139 has no application; no caution was necessary; no requirement the appellant be so informed is to be implied into the words of s.353A which provides lawful power to require the giving of the handwriting as particulars of identification. Therefore, it is submitted there is no impropriety or contravention of Australian law, further, that in any event, the trial judge's application of s.138 and the principles in Bunning v. Cross (supra) on the contingency he might have been wrong and there was an impropriety, was entirely correct 
     15   Section 353A relevantly provides:- 
      
       
        
        ""(3) When a person is in lawful custody for any offence punishable on indictment or summary conviction, the officer in charge of police at the station where the person is so in custody may take or cause to be taken all such particulars as may be deemed necessary for the identification of such person, including, where the person is of or above the age of 14 years, the person's photograph and fingerprints and palm-prints."" 
        
       
     16   Subsection (3D) was inserted in the section in 1995. It provides:- 
      
       
        
        ""(3D) The consent of the person in lawful custody is not required for the doing of any thing under this section."" 
        
       
     17   Although no objection to this evidence was made on this basis at trial, in the light of the matters I will now set out, I would consider that the point as it is now taken warrants detailed examination. Since an objection was taken, Rule 4 does not apply. 
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
     18   The following account of the nature of the Crown case, which is taken from the outline of the appellant's submissions, sets the context to the ground of appeal:- 
      
       
        
        ""The Crown cases in respect of 13 counts in the indictment were that the appellant knowingly made false applications to the relevant statutory authority for birth and/or death certificates in false names. These counts are offences under s.300(1) of the Crimes Act. In addition there were five counts of forgery under s.67(b) of the Crimes Act (Cth). The Crown cases in respect of those counts were that the appellant forged Medicare application forms in false names and submitted them to the Health Insurance Commission. The final two counts on the indictment related to the attempted opening, in one case, and actual operation, in the other, of bank accounts in false names, known by the appellant to be false. 
        
       
       
        
        In the 18 make false instrument or forgery counts, evidence was led in every count, that the documents which were presented to the relevant authorities were false and in the appellant's handwriting. There was a great deal of evidence from which a jury could infer that the appellant knew that these documents were false. The appellant's fingerprints were found on a number of the documents. Other circumstantial evidence connected the appellant to some of the applications. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown case relied very heavily on the evidence of a handwriting expert who compared samples of the appellant's handwriting with documents which were the subjects of the various charges. Without that evidence, the Crown cases would have been immeasurably weaker and may not have had a case at all in respect of some of the counts. 
        
       
       
        
        The sample handwriting material of the appellant which was used by the expert (and admitted by the appellant to be his) comprised three P59B forms and a letter written by the appellant to the Supreme Court in relation to his bail. There were issues of prejudice attached to each document but they were adequately covered by the way the material was presented to the jury. A comment made by the Crown during the voir dire on the admissibility of the forms indicated that the expert's opinion was based on an examination of all four sample documents (t.12 22/5). If one or other of the documents was not available to the expert another examination would have to be conducted to conclude an opinion. Accordingly the P59B forms were critical to the Crown cases. The Crown described its case as comprising 'principally' the handwriting specialist (t.12 22/5). 
        
       
       
        
        The P59B forms came into existence after the appellant was arrested at various times, twice in 1993 and once in 1995. The Crown set out in summary form the circumstances relating to the forms (t.4 22/5). One of the forms was completed by the appellant after he was arrested in relation to the matters before his Honour (t.4 22/5). Objection was taken to the admissibility of the forms and his Honour conducted a voir dire commencing at t.17 22/5. The forms were completed by the appellant at the time he was fingerprinted after arrest (t.18 22/5). The forms were routinely completed by suspects in offences where handwriting comparison might be part of the investigation (t.18, t.21 22/5). No other reason was offered for requiring the appellant to complete the forms. No caution was given to the appellant about the use to which might be made of the forms (t.18, t.21 22/5). There was no suggestion or evidence that he was advised of the purpose to which the forms might be put or that completion of the forms in his handwriting was not compulsory."" 
        
       
     19   The other circumstantial evidence referred to included the following. There was evidence from surveillance videos and still photographs of the appellant's presence in the bank premises at the time of opening of the account in the false name to which one of the charges referred and at the time of the deposit of a sum of $10.00 into the account involved in one of the other counts. 
     20   There was evidence from a person whose name had been used in opening one of the accounts that his identity had been usurped and that he was not involved in the opening of the account; that the name in which the first of the accounts to which I have referred above was opened was in fact that of a girl who had died at the age of three. There was photographic evidence and videos showing the appellant posing as one of the persons whose name had been used on birth certificates or Medicare application forms and the apprehension of the appellant in the National Australia Bank attempting to use one of the two accounts to which I have earlier referred. 
     21   At the time of the appellant's arrest, he was carrying a bag which contained a passbook in the name of that witness who had denied involvement, a Medicare card, a birth certificate, bank books, a Medicare card in another person's name, as well as a number of other birth certificates for other individuals. 
     22   The appellant asserted he had been given this material by the witness who had denied knowledge of those matters and asserted that signatures on those documents were not his. Notwithstanding the additional evidence and whether or not on any particular charge there would have been no or no sufficient evidence without it, the handwriting evidence was so important that the convictions on all counts could not stand without it. 
     23   In his remarks on sentence (at 1), the learned trial judge referred to the factual crux of the case as follow:- 
      
       
        
        ""The facts which the jury must have found proved beyond reasonable doubt were that between April and December 1995 the accused wrote out in various ways applications for birth and death certificates of various people. In most instances those certificates were supplied by the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages in Sydney. The people in whose names they were sought were mostly people who had died at a very young age a number of years ago."" 
        
       
     24   His Honour continued (at 3):- 
      
       
        
        ""The case for the Crown in the trial relied extensively on the handwriting evidence of a Mrs. Woodard, a Federal agent with the Australian Federal Police. 
        
       
       
        
        Clearly, the jury accepted her analysis of the documents that they were in the handwriting of the accused. The accused did not give any evidence in the trial and it is understandable that the handwriting evidence was accepted, especially when it was augmented by the circumstantial evidence of the arrest of the accused in possession of these other documents and his relationship to the bank account of Kerakossian. There was also other evidence."" 
        
       
       
      Importance of the comparison documents 
       
     25   The comparison documents comprised three P59B forms were dated 9 June 1993, 24 August 1993, 22 December 1995 and the letter of 7 January 1996. For clarity, I set out hereunder the content of the form of 9 June 1993 as a specimen of the three forms (handwriting is denoted by bold italics):-

     26   The bail letter to which I have referred was a notification to the Supreme Court by way of a prisoner's application or statement on Department of Corrective Services letterhead official stationery of the prisoner's wish not to proceed with a listed bail application since he was arranging for a private solicitor and was awaiting a psychiatric report. That application bore his signature in the name of David Black as did the P59B form of 22 December 1975, the other P59B forms being signed in the name ""J.A. Knight"". 
     27   As the outline of the appellant's submissions I have quoted above notes, the opinion given in respect of the authorship of the contested documents was based on the handwriting used in the comparison documents which were proved to be, indeed admitted to be, in the appellant's handwriting. The crucial opinion of the handwriting examiner as to the disputed documents was based upon a comparison between those documents and the comparison documents. 
     28   In each disputed document, there were writings which were not the subject of comparison because there was no appropriate specimen of writing of the relevant nature, for example, cursive writing, with which to make a comparison. A demonstration chart was admitted into evidence showing the nature of the examination and the comparisons made. One challenge made to the expert's opinion at trial was to the samples constituting a sufficient basis for a reliable opinion. 
     29   As well as mounting the objection to which I have referred, the appellant sought to attack, through cross-examination, the value of the evidence on the basis that the analysis related only to block capitals and printing, which it was contended would have been relatively easy for someone to fake, the suggestion being that someone had faked his writing on the disputed documents, imitating the writing on the samples. 
     30   In his directions to the jury, the trial judge emphasised the necessity in respect of each relevant charge for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant made out or wrote out the false application. 
     31   Having referred to the conclusions of the handwriting witness supporting the Crown case, his Honour encapsulated the issues at trial for the jury when he said the following:- 
      
       
        
        ""I should say something to you about the handwriting evidence. You heard Mrs. Woodard give details of her experience and expertise and it is a matter for you to evaluate her evidence. You do not have any contrary evidence as to her conclusions. 
        
       
       
        
        Nevertheless, you do not have to accept her evidence at face value. You have her comparison chart, but it is only a sample of her conclusions. You should really look at the original documents yourselves to evaluate her evidence. Having said that, I must tell you there is no contrary evidence from any other expert to challenge her conclusions. 
        
       
       
        
        In saying that, I do not mean the accused has any obligation to produce any contrary evidence. As I have said, he has no onus of proof and he has cross-examined Mrs. Woodard about the comparison chart and pointed out a number of matters. 
        
       
       
        
        As I recall her evidence, she said variations in the formation of letters is natural in a person's writing, but even so, when some of these things were pointed out to her by Mr. Knight, she said she was satisfied that the writing of the accused from the specimen documents is the same as the writing on the disputed documents that she examined. 
        
       
       
        
        In the absence of contrary evidence, you would be entitled to accept her conclusions. Whether you do or not is a matter for you. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused has argued that there is the possibility that some dishonest policeman has extracted samples of his handwriting and falsified the documents Mrs. Woodard says are in his handwriting. The accused is in no position to prove and I do not suppose he has to, but if you think that is a reasonable possibility, it is a matter you would have to consider in evaluating the evidence of Mrs. Woodard. 
        
       
       
        
        As against that, you have the evidence of the many police officers as to obtaining possession of the various documents and the chain of possession of them, thereafter. The Crown argues that it is simply fanciful that some policeman has forged all of these applications for birth and death certificates over the months and paid the fees and so on, simply to frame this accused and been able to successfully fabricate the documents in a way that Mrs. Woodard could not detect, with so many documents and so many addresses he would have to cover. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown says that is simply unbelievable. After all, Detective Baker did not come into the investigation until September 1995 when Mr. Austin contacted him. By then, a number of these false documents had been produced. How could Baker have been involved in such a subterfuge, if there was one?"" 
        
       
       
      The objection and the voir dire 
       
     32   I record at this point that the appellant, although appearing for himself at trial, showed some considerable acquaintanceship with the techniques of legal advocacy, in an appreciation of the concept of prejudicial material and in his reference to legal decisions, including a decision of the House of Lords and his references to relevant provisions of the Evidence Act 1995, viz. ss.135 and 137. Before us he is represented by experienced counsel. 
     33   However, in consequence of his being unrepresented at trial, considerable care seems to have been taken by the trial judge and the Crown Prosecutor to ensure his interests were protected as far as possible. In that regard, prior to the formal commencement of the trial, in describing the nature of the proceedings to the trial judge, the Crown Prosecutor advised him of the Crown's intent to lead the handwriting evidence and the nature of the issue to which it went. In particular, his Honour's attention was drawn to the bail letter being prejudicial in content as referring to extraneous illegal activity. The trial judge was also referred to the P59B forms having been obtained at the time of the appellant's arrest for other offences so that they too might have had a prejudicial effect as being, on their face, police records. The P59B in the alias was specifically referred to. The Crown Prosecutor pointed out that it was possible for the trial to proceed on the basis of the comparison made by the handwriting expert without divulging the precise nature of the documents from which the handwriting comparison had been made, so as to avoid prejudice to the appellant, although the Crown would wish to have the documents admitted into evidence as examples of ""specimen handwriting"" even if the documents needed to be, to some extent, edited to avoid the prejudicial effect.  
     34   At that time, the Crown Prosecutor drew the trial judge's attention to the decision of Miles, CJ. in Browning (supra) and informed his Honour that the forms were obtained by way of a requirement of a person, prior to being charged, to fill them out themselves and for the purpose of, perhaps, to collect handwriting specimens. 
     35   The appellant informed the trial judge that he was not contesting ""it"" (ie., the comparison document) was in his writing, but he challenged the admissibility of that material on the basis of the prejudice created by reason of the jury becoming aware of his prior arrests and in particular his having been in gaol under a different name. 
     36   After his Honour had explained the possibility that the handwriting expert's conclusion and comparison could go before the jury without the admitted specimen handwriting documents, the appellant is recorded in the transcript as saying:- 
      
       
        
        ""If that's the case, your Honour, thank you for advising me, then it would probably be best, as far as the jury is concerned if you do contest it's my writing the dispute will remain being put in front of the jury."" 
        
       
     37   So far as I follow what the transcript shows, the appellant was referring to the necessity to show the forms to the jury to illustrate the inadequacy of their utility as handwriting samples to show the authorship of certain of the disputed writings. 
     38   His Honour then indicated he would have to decide whether to keep the material out because of its prejudicial effect. Later, the appellant pointed out that he would not have objected to specimens of his handwriting which did not raise his prior police record going into evidence. It was during this discussion, the Crown Prosecutor informed his Honour that the opinion of the handwriting expert was founded on all four documents so that the opinion could not stand unless all four were to be the basis of that opinion. It seems to have been accepted that unless those documents could be admitted, the evidence of the expert would not be permitted. His Honour thereafter commenced a voir dire to examine whether the documents were to be admitted in evidence. 
     39   On the voir dire, statements were tendered without objection from the police officers who had obtained the P59B forms from the appellant who informed his Honour that he did not contest that the forms were filled in as the witnesses said. 
     40   His Honour drew to the appellant's attention the decision in Browning (supra) and in particular advised him that a discretion might have to be exercised as to the admission into evidence of those documents. At that point the appellant informed his Honour that he did not think anything would be gained by cross-examination, that the relevant question was whether or not his argument that the material was prejudicial should succeed. After discussion with the Crown Prosecutor as to the purposes for which the officers taking the forms may have acted, two of the relevant police officers were called in evidence. Their evidence broadly was that no caution was administered and that at the time of fingerprinting an arrested person, a handwriting sample was obtained by use of the form in the circumstances referred to in the instruction to which I will later refer. 
     41   The appellant in his submission, referred to the passage in Browning (supra) at 433 relating to the use of other non-prejudicial samples. Notwithstanding, the Crown Prosecutor raised the possibility of impropriety through the absence of a caution and the applicability of s.138 of the Evidence Act but submitted that ""the Act"" (ie., s.353A of the Crimes Act 1900) permitted the obtaining of particulars of identification. 
     42   In discussing the decision in Browning (supra), where much turned on the relevant Police Instructions in the Australian Capital Territory, his Honour was informed that the Crown Prosecutor was unable to assist him as to the relevant New South Wales Police instructions which existed at the time of the taking of the particulars set out in the P59B forms. 
      
       
      New South Wales police instructions 
       
     43   On the appeal we were provided with a set of relevant instructions admitted by consent valid as at 1 October 1996. Those instructions read as follows:- 
      
       
        
        "" 
        Fingerprint Information - form P59B (handwriting form) 
        
       
       
        
        It is desirable for all offenders charged with an indictable or a serious summary offence to complete a copy of the fingerprint information form P59B in their own handwriting. An offender who has been previously charged and who has completed a P59B form is required to complete another form. The larger the sampling of a person's handwriting held on file, the better. This demonstrates changing handwriting styles, connected with aging, etc. 
        
       
       
        
        If you are aware that any of the information recorded by the offender is untrue, attach a short report to the form noting the discrepancies. 
        
       
       
        
        These forms are also useful to ascertain the next-of-kin of unknown deceased persons who are fingerprinted and subsequently identified. Other instances have arisen where the P59B forms have been used to counter assertions by offenders that they were incapable of committing the alleged offences, because of their illiteracy. 
        
       
       
        
        To ensure that the person charged completes the form in their normal handwriting seat them in a comfortable position. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender must complete the section under the heading 'The following particulars are to be written by the person charged' 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        After witnessing completion of the form, complete the particulars in the left hand margin and write'P59B form attached' on the reverse side of the fingerprint form in the space above the box, marked 'alias or nickname'. Take an impression of the right index fingerprint on the back of the P59B form. If this finger is missing, take an impression of any other finger and describe on the form which finger was used. 
        
       
       
        
        Pin, do not staple, the P59B form to the fingerprint form and forward it as directed. When an offender states that he/she is unable to write, or refuses to complete a copy of the P59B form, submit a short report of the facts to the Document Examination Unit, Physical Evidence Section."" 
        
       
     44   I have emphasised that passage of the instructions which it is contended would have given rise to the appellant being deceived into believing he was bound to comply with a requirement made in accordance with the instruction if he was informed of the requirement in accordance with its terms. It is contended that passage erroneously stated the effect of s.353A. 
     45   Even though there were no instructions in evidence before the trial judge and he was informed the New South Wales instructions were broadly similar to those referred to in Browning (supra), we were invited by both parties to proceed with the appeal upon the basis that the instructions in force at the relevant times were in general accord with that tendered before us. 
      
       
      The trial judge's decision 
       
     46   Relevant to the ground now asserted, at the conclusion of the voir dire as to the taking of the P59B forms, his Honour found the following:- 
      
       
        
        ""The gravamen of the issue is that on each of three occasions the accused was taken into custody and filled in a form, this P59B in his own handwriting and each such form was witnessed by a police officer, Constables Robinson and Bradley respectively. Constable Robinson, Scott Robinson, gave evidence as did Constable Bradley. The other Constable Robinson is not available because she has a young child and cannot be here at court today, but the Crown said that her evidence, it is anticipated, would not be much different from what the other officer said. Their evidence, if I can summarise it briefly, was that in accordance with the usual procedures and at the direction of either the custody manager or at the request of the arresting police via the custody manager, when the accused's fingerprints were taken in the usual process he was asked to fill in the P59B form which he then did and which the constable then witnessed by signing it in the margin. 
        
       
       
        
        Each of those officers were asked whether, when the form was given to the accused to fill in, he was told that he had the right not to fill it in or whether he was given any caution about it, that it might be used in evidence against him, and the effect of their answers to those questions was that he was not given any such caution. Simply in situations like that the accused person is given the form and asked to fill it in. If they do not fill it in, well, that is the end of it. They just make a note of that. If they fill it in all well and good and it is then sent off to the appropriate authorities. Furthermore that their understanding was that these forms are filled in only in cases where it is likely that handwriting may be an important part of the investigation and the document can be used for comparison purposes."" 
        
       
     47   His Honour held:- 
      
       
        
        ""In the present case the accused did not give evidence on the voir dire and it was not suggested to the police witnesses that there was any lack of co-operation or consent on his part."" 
        
       
     48   His Honour stated the issue he was then examining on the voir dire as follows:- 
      
       
        
        ""The issue that has now been propounded is that the filling in by an accused person of documents in those circumstances is unfair, in that the accused person is not told first of all that they have the option not to fill it in, and secondly not told that if they do fill it in it may be used in evidence against them."" 
        
       
     49   I refer to these two matters of which the accused person was not told compendiously as the caution. 
     50   I note at this point that s.353A(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) had been applied to the Australian Capital Territory and is noted as so applying by Miles, CJ. in Browning (supra). It was concerning that provision that the trial judge made the observation:- 
      
       
        
        ""After all, there is provision for police to take fingerprints of people charged and frequently those fingerprints are used very much in the further investigation of offences. And there is statutory authority for that under the section of course. It may be that if there is this element of unfairness, there should be some amendment to the legislation to permit this to be done."" 
        
       
     51   His Honour, after considering the judgment of Miles, CJ. in Browning (supra) said:- 
      
       
        
        ""I must say with great respect I cannot come to the conclusion that there is any actual unfairness in this process."" 
        
       
     52   His Honour had previously noted that:- 
      
       
        
        ""The reasons for obtaining handwriting samples are clearly in cases such as the present ones followed by the investigators to obtain evidence which would possibly identify the accused as a participant in the alleged offences, or perhaps even exonerate him. The fact that they do not tell the suspected person that that is the purpose they are going to use the material does not strike me as being necessarily unfair."" 
        
       
     53   Neither the trial judge nor Miles, CJ. referred to subsection (3D) when referred to s.353A and its effect. Unfortunately neither did the submission in this court. Miles, CJ., however, as will be seen, was particularly concerned with requirements for, inter alia, co-operation and consent by the prisoner under the Local Police Instructions not having been complied with by the police. 
     54   The trial judge in this case, as it appears to me, dealt with two questions. First, the lawfulness of the requirement to furnish the identification particulars in the prisoner's handwriting, and second, the fairness of doing so, both in the context of the lack of a caution, and in the absence of being provided with the New South Wales Police Instructions. 
     55   Notwithstanding that his Honour concluded that there was no unfairness, he went on to consider how the balancing exercise dictated by s.138 of the Evidence Act 1995 might be carried out in the event that he was wrong. He had regard to the fact that for many years these forms had been used in the manner used in this case for the comparison of handwriting of the suspect. He concluded that the evidence thus obtained was probative; important; that the alleged criminal activity was of a significant degree and that, as far as the gravity of the impropriety or contravention was concerned, the police simply followed the procedures that they said had been followed in many situations. Thus, the impropriety, if there was one, was not grave. Although the conduct was deliberate, it was not the sort of case ""where there is the pejorative nature of such conduct"". His Honour had regard to the appellant's submission that other handwriting evidence could be probably obtained from just about anywhere but concluded that what had followed here was simply the normal process of the obtaining of a sample of handwriting. 
     56   Thus, his Honour was of the view that if the balancing exercise was to be undertaken, the Crown should succeed on that aspect and the otherwise prejudicial effect of the documents, the basis of the original complaint, might have to be dealt with as best one could by giving the jury appropriate directions or editing the documents. 
     57   In that regard, his Honour gave special consideration to Exhibit A3, the third of the P59 documents where the name ""David Black"" was used and to the letter of 7 January in which the appellant sought not to proceed with a Supreme Court bail application (patently raising the appellant then being in custody for another offence), in order to see what could be done to permit the handwriting to be examined without attracting the prejudice arising from the nature of the document. He concluded that there were steps open to be taken at the instigation of the appellant which might minimise or remove such prejudice. 
     58   His Honour concluded, finally, that the documents were admissible, were not caught by s.138 and, insofar as they might have been ""unfairly obtained"", exercised his discretion to admit them. 
      
       
       
      Case law on s.353A 
       
     59   Handwriting has traditionally been a mode of identifying the individual with the crime charged: see eg., Adami v. The Queen (1961-62) 108 CLR 605; Regina v. Hannes [2000] NSWCCA 503. The Evidence Act 1898 made special provision for evidence of handwriting by s.36. The characteristics of an individual's handwriting are as much particulars of identification as the characteristics of appearance, voice or fingerprints. These things have long been proved as a mode of identification. In my view, s.353A is applicable to handwriting having regard to the case law concerning the section. 
     60   In Regina v. McPhail & Tivey (1988) 36 A. Crim. R. 390 at 399, Lee, CJ. at CL., delivering the principal judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, when examining the ambit of s.353A, made reference to extensive records of persons taken into custody in respect of offences in regard to fingerprints, photographs and ""other particulars"". He referred to blood, hair and semen samples becoming a feature of identification of persons charged with offences. 
     61   It had already been held by Lee, J. sitting as a single judge in Fullerton v. Commissioner of Police (1984) 1 NSWLR 159, that the section is not limited to matters of fingerprints, palm prints and photographs, but applies to ""all such particulars as may be deemed necessary for the identification"" of the person in custody. His Honour said (at 163):- 
      
       
        
        ""Given the word 'taking' merely the meaning of 'recording', it could be made to include particulars of identification which were merely a matter of observation, such as colour of hair, colour of eyes, youthful appearance, etc., but I do not think it was intended to have that effect. Such particulars are the property of anyone, police officer or otherwise, who cares to use his eyes, and it is no affront to the dignity of an individual that a police officer may note them. The section, in my view, is directed to those features of identification which are peculiar to the individual and which are not discoverable or obtainable except by force or with his co-operation, so that the taking thereof is an affront to his dignity and akin to an assault upon the integrity of his person. 
        
       
       
        
        The intention of the section is that the citizen, albeit in custody, is not required to put such particulars into the hands of the police except when a responsible officer requires that they be made available, and then only in accordance with the terms of the section."" 
        
       
     62   As to the question of the relevance of consent, his Honour continued:- 
      
       
        
        ""Consistent with this purpose, the section will have application in every case where the police seek to have such particulars and irrespective of whether the person in custody consents or does not consent to giving such particulars. It is not intended to apply only in cases where the person in custody raises objection or protests or offers physical resistance to the giving of the features of identification being sought by the police. Very few people who are taken into custody for the first time have any real appreciation of what may or may not be done lawfully by the police, and if it were given an operation only in favour of those who protested or resisted, it would deprive of protection against the affront and indignity involved in personal identification the very persons most likely to need that protection. 
        
       
       
        
        In short, the section brings about the result that the taking by the police of particulars of identification of a person in custody obtains its lawfulness from the terms of the section, not from the state of mind of the person in custody."" 
        
       
     63   In relation to fingerprints, the High Court agreed with the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Carr [1972] 1 NSWLR 608 (special leave refused) and in Regina v. Carr (1973) 127 CLR 662 held that:- 
      
       
        
        ""There is nothing unlawful in asking a person, even if he be in custody, to provide fingerprints and, with his agreement, taking those fingerprints. That appears to be the position here. 
        
       
       
        
        Furthermore, s.353A of the Crimes Act confers an authority to take the fingerprints, when a person is in lawful custody for an offence punishable on indictment."" 
        
       
     64   Those observations, absent any interference with the person of the prisoner, would seem to apply to the taking of other particulars of identification. Further, where the section applies, s.353A(3D) makes clear that the consent of the prisoner is not required. The reasoning of Lee, J. which I have set out dealing with the section as it stood before the insertion of s.353A(3D) with which I agree, is to the same effect as that of the subsection. 
     65   In McPhail (supra), in the Court of Criminal Appeal, Lee, CJ. at CL. , having considered Duffield v. Police (No. 2) [1971] NZLR 710, held that in the absence of any oppressive conduct in the taking of particulars, in that case, photographs, there was nothing which could be pointed to contrary to s.353A(3). With his Honour's judgment, Hunt and Campbell, JJ. agreed. 
     66   His Honour examined the applicability of what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal and the High Court in Carr (supra) concluding that those decisions were not inconsistent with the view he had taken. In his judgment in McPhail (supra) he followed the approach he had earlier taken in Fullerton (supra). Consistent with those authorities and the effect of the subsection, I see no unlawfulness or misleading effect in the application of the powers conferred by the section here. If any relevant contravention or impropriety might exist, it will have to be found outside the operation of the section as, it seems to me, it was found in Browning (supra). 
     67   In this appeal, no question is agitated concerning the purpose of identifying the person having any problem associated with it such as was referred to in Carr (supra); Sernack v. McTavish (1970) 15 FLR 381; Catell v. Rolfe (1993) Vol. 1, No. 5, NSW Courts Review, June 1994. Nor does any issue arise as arose in Ireland v. The Queen (1970) 126 CLR 321 and as was discussed by Barwick, CJ. at 334 of whether the particulars were obtained for a purpose other than for the purpose of identification. No complaint is made of failure to comply with the statutory prerequisites to exercise of the power provided by the section. Nor is there any suggestion in his Honour's findings of any coercion on the appellant of, for example, the kind referred to by Cross, J. in Hockley v. Power (1982-85) 6 Petty Sessions Review 2823 in which a magistrate intimated that he would direct a charged person to remain in custody until that person had had his fingerprints taken, or would grant bail conditionally upon that person submitting to being fingerprinted. 
      
       
      The decision in Browning 
       
     68   In Browning (supra), Miles, CJ. at 430 concluded, after examination of Sernack (supra); Carr (in the Court of Criminal Appeal and the High Court) and Duffield (supra):- 
      
       
        
        ""In my view, it has been established that in requesting the accused to complete the forms and in directing the constable on each occasion to obtain the particulars, Sergeant Garbutt caused to be taken all such particulars as may be deemed necessary for the identification of the accused, within the purview of s.353A(3)."" 
        
       
     69   It appears that his Honour found against any relevant contravention of the section in the application of the power. 
     70   His Honour then turned to the question of whether there was an impropriety, having regard to the relevant provisions of the Instructions to Police applicable in the ACT, viz, general instructions to members of the Australian Federal Police. The instructions appear at pp.431-432 of the report. His Honour held those instructions were not complied with and particularly the accused's knowing co-operation and consent as generally required were not obtained. 
     71   His Honour applied the principles in Bunning v. Cross (supra) and Ireland (supra) in considering the application of the fairness discretion. In passing, I note that the overlapping of the fairness discretion and the public policy discretions at common law was elucidated by the High Court in Foster v. The Queen (1993) 67 ALJR 550. 
     72   His Honour concluded as a matter of fact that the accused would not have co-operated and would not have assisted the police had she been advised, as that instruction appeared to require, that the specimen was to be used to try to strengthen the case against her. His Honour's conclusion that fairness required the accused to be told that she was under no obligation to complete the forms is one that appears to turn entirely upon the local instructions. The significance of his conclusion that she would not have provided the specimen is to be considered in that light. His Honour was able to conclude that it was unfair to her to admit the handwriting, given that she would have availed herself of the option of refusing to provide it had she been properly instructed as to the nature of the local police instructions. 
      
       
      An absence of evidence of impropriety 
       
     73   No such finding as his Honour had made, as was essential for the application of s.138 or the principles in Bunning v. Cross (supra), was made or on the evidence might have been made in this case. 
     74   There is no evidence nor finding of the trial judge here that the accused gave the handwriting samples other than voluntarily. There is no evidence, one way or the other as to whether he did so knowingly and aware of the use to which they might be put, but there is no evidence to suggest any oppression. 
     75   There is no sufficient basis in this case to hold that the disputed material would not have been provided had the accused been informed of the local instructions. 
     76   Unlike the ACT form, the form of instruction provided to us states ""the offender must complete the section under the heading 'the following particulars are to be written by the person charged'"". There is no requirement expressed in the instruction that there be informed co-operation. Section 353A expressly authorises the requiring of the accused person that particulars of identification as deemed necessary, be provided and s.353A(3D) provides that consent is not required. 
     77   I see no basis upon which the doctrines enunciated in Bunning v. Cross (supra) and Ireland (supra) can play a part. 
      
       
      Self-incrimination 
       
     78   As to the submission that the provision of the handwriting sample was or was analogous to providing an admission, I see no basis on which it could be concluded that the doctrines as to self-incrimination referred to in Sorby v. The Commonwealth (1983) 152 CLR 281; Environment Protection Authority v. Caltex Refining Co. Pty. Limited (1992-93) 178 CLR 477 have here, any applicability, particularly since the section, in my view, authorises the obtaining of the samples and considering how the matter was regarded at common law. In Carr (supra) in the Court of Criminal Appeal at 610, the analogy to self-incrimination is expressly rejected. 
     79   In Sorby (supra) at 292, Gibbs, CJ. referred to the requirement of an accused to provide a fingerprint or show his face or some other part of his body so that he may be identified, or to speak or to write so that the jury or another witness may hear his voice or compare his handwriting, specifically as outside the ambit of the privilege against self-incrimination. Brennan, CJ. cited that passage in Bulejcik v The Queen (1995-96) 185 CLR 375 at 381. 
     80   Under the Evidence Act the provisions as to admissions contained in Part 3.4 and s.139 apply only to matters caught by the statutory definition of that term and its essential element ""representation"" as contained in the dictionary. I would not consider the handwriting to be a representation nor could I see any of the provisions of that part as applicable to lawfully obtained evidence where the particular enabling statute negates any requirement for consent. 
     81   I do not accept either the argument based on the common law or that based on the Evidence Act as support for a conclusion the appellant should have been cautioned or that there was any relevant impropriety. 
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
     82   I find no support for the appellant's submissions in Browning (supra). Having regard to the evidence before the trial judge and his findings, I am unable to regard the decision in Browning (supra) as laying down a principle which would require exclusion of handwriting samples furnished as these have been in accordance with s.353A(3). Nor do I understand Miles, CJ. to be applying a principle of application more general than is supported by the relevant ACT instructions and the attitude of the defendant as he found it to be. I share Miles, CJ.'s view that handwriting samples provide particulars of identification as do fingerprints, photographs and those other matters referred to by Lee, J. in McPhail (supra) and Fullerton (supra) and that within the purview of the section, handwriting samples may be included in the particulars of identification which the relevant officer might cause to be taken as may be deemed necessary for identification of the accused. 
     83   For my part, I am unable to see any basis on which the discretion under s.138 of the Evidence Act 1995 might be said to have been wrongly exercised by the learned trial judge. His findings of fact were open to him. There is no finding of fact which would support the existence of any impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.  
     84   In The Queen v. Kyriakou (1987) 29 A. Crim. R. 50 and Regina v. Merritt & Rosso (1985) 19 A. Crim. R. 360, this court held that appeal does not lie to this court to call in question findings of fact found by and open to trial judges on a voir dire or as founding the exercise of discretion. Although the correctness of the breadth of the expression of the views of Hunt, J. was doubted on an unsuccessful special leave application to the High Court in Kyriakou (supra), nonetheless, his Honour's conclusion in this regard has subsequently been followed in this court. When it is sought to appeal in such a case, there needs to be shown a legal error below such as an absence of necessary evidence for a finding or an error vitiating the exercise of discretion as is described in The Queen v. House (1936) 55 CLR 499. 
     85   In this case, the trial judge proceeded to perform the balancing exercise on the contingent basis there might have been an impropriety. I am of the view that there was no impropriety. Strictly, I need not, therefore, deal with the correctness of his Honour's reasoning in that regard. However, I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in that exercise. I do not see any reason why, on the arguments presented to us, I should regard his Honour's decision as flawed.  
     86   In the upshot, I consider that although the matter was plainly deserving of argument and for that reason at least leave should be granted, nonetheless, the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons I have given. 
     87   I propose the following orders - leave to appeal granted; appeal dismissed.

       R v Angelo KALPAXIS  
       
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
     1    STEIN JA: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a sentence imposed by his Honour, Judge Woods QC in the District Court on 1 December 2000. 
     2    The respondent, Angelo Kalpaxis, pleaded guilty to a supply (or more accurately the offering to supply) of a large commercial quantity of cocaine contrary to s 25 (2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The offence is liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000. 
     3    The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years and the execution of the sentence was suspended for the term of the sentence on condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence. The respondent had spent five months and 10 days in custody prior to sentence and referrable to the offence. His Honour took this into account in sentencing the respondent. 
     4    The facts placed before the Court were agreed and, insofar as material to the appeal, are as follows: In 1995 the respondent met a person called Raymond and in May 1997 Raymond received a call from the respondent who was then in Greece. They had apparently kept contact before the respondent and his family went to Greece where the respondent's father was dying of cancer. In that conversation the respondent said ‘I have some good news for us. Can you handle the marketing of one hundred keys?’ This constitutes the offence of supply the subject of the offence. Raymond understood the respondent to be referring to cocaine and he also understood the term ‘keys’ as commonly used to refer to kilograms of illegal drugs. 
     5    Raymond then contacted the police and was later introduced to National Crime Authority (NCA) investigators and became a registered informant. Raymond maintained contact with the respondent whilst he was overseas and, on the 4 June 1997 in another telephone conversation, the respondent said that there was 150 coming in in October in sealed packages and percentage 98. 
     6    There was another telephone conversation on the 7 July 1997 between the respondent and Raymond about the supply of the cocaine in October. The respondent returned to Australia from Greece and met Raymond at Prospect on the 10 July 1997. During that time another conversation took place wherein the respondent said that he had control of the ‘150’, that a boat would be used to import the drugs to Australia and that: 
      
       
        
        When the stuff's here there's no problems selling it, that's the least of our worries, it is just a matter if you've got someone safe why would you show your face to ten different people? 
        
       
     7    During that conversation the respondent indicated to Raymond that he would need $10,000 to get back to Greece to organise the supply. A little later on the 16 July the respondent and Raymond met again at Prospect and in that conversation Raymond gave to the respondent air tickets to Greece and $7,950. The money and ticket had been provided by the NCA. 
     8    During the conversation the respondent showed Raymond a photograph of the boat named Iliki which he indicated would be purchased in Greece to transport the cocaine to Australia. Three days later Raymond drove the respondent to the airport to catch the plane to Greece and further organise the cocaine. This conversation was recorded and contains other detail.9    Over the following months the two of them maintained contact relative to the supply of cocaine and on 10 September 1997 they met again at Prospect. Again this meeting was recorded and the respondent told Raymond that the boat would be leaving with the drugs in 10 days. This did not occur and during the next few months there were further conversations between the two of them and in the last conversation about the supply the respondent indicated that it had been delayed. This conversation occurred on 17 December 1997. 
     10    The facts then record that there were three further contacts between the respondent and Raymond in March 1998, the last of these occurring on the 25 March 1998 where nothing occurred in relation to the provision of the cocaine. On 27 March 1998 a search warrant was executed at the respondent's home but nothing relevant to this offence was located. 
     11    The other matter recorded in the agreed statement of facts is that the Crown accepts that there was no evidence that the respondent could in fact supply the amount of drugs offered. 
     12    The respondent is aged 52 years and there are two matters on his criminal record, a false pretences offence which occurred some 23 years ago and in respect of which the respondent was required to enter into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for two years. The other was a charge of supplying a prohibited drug, namely amphetamines, which occurred in 1992 and in respect of which he was sentenced in 1993 to 200 hours community service. 
     13    In relation to the air ticket and sum of money that was given to him by Raymond, the respondent made restitution to the NCA in the sum of $10,070. 
     14    In my view the offence needs to be put in its true perspective and context. In this regard, his Honour made the following findings at pp 8 and 9 of his remarks on sentence: 
      
       
        
        1. That the offender did not intend to supply 100, 150 or 200 kilograms of cocaine or indeed any cocaine. 
        
       
        
       
        
        2. That there was no actual supply of cocaine or anything else. 
         
        3. That the proposal by Mr Kalpaxis was never genuine. 
        
       
        
       
        
        4. That not only did the respondent not have the intention to supply cocaine, he did not have the ability to supply cocaine. 
         
        
       
     15    Those findings, it seems to me, were all open to his Honour on the evidence and the agreed facts. 
     16    His Honour described the case as ‘extraordinary’. Indeed it is. From beginning to end the respondent was carrying on a ruse to obtain money from the person Raymond. The purpose was clear on the evidence, that is, so he would be able to spend time with his father and family in Greece whilst his father was dying of cancer. His father succumbed on the 8 January 1998. It needs to be emphasised that the $10,000 that the respondent obtained from Raymond had nothing to do with any drug deal. 
     17    In written submissions the appellant is critical of his Honour for describing the true character of the offence as more akin to obtaining money by a false pretence. It is submitted that his Honour made an erroneous classification of the offence and that this led him to impose a sentence which was far too short and to exercise his discretion to direct that the execution of the sentence be suspended. In my view, what his Honour said was no more than a comment which, with respect, was appropriate. 
     18     Given the wide definition of supply in s 3 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the undisputed facts came within s 25. However, this does not require that a lengthy term of imprisonment be imposed. Indeed, the facts belie this. While Regina v Dendic and Mazzeo (1987) 34 ACrim R 40 is authority for the proposition that the circumstances encompass an offence of offering to supply notwithstanding that there was no intention of actual supply, the facts relating to the two offenders in that case bear no real parallel with the instant case. In particular, the subjective factors are to be distinguished as indeed are the objective circumstances of the offence. 
     19    Some of the subjective circumstances relating to the respondent have already been mentioned but it should be added that there is ample medical evidence that at the time of the offence the respondent was suffering from severe depression. According to Dr Roberts the depression was accompanied by psychosis in which there was a substantial departure from reality (see appeal book 81). 
     20    In my view, his Honour was entitled to describe the present case as exceptional and extraordinary. It is, and given the facts and circumstances, the concern of the Legislature with the actual supply of drugs has little application. 
     21    The offence itself must be seen as falling at the least serious end of the spectrum encompassed by the breadth of the provision and the definition of supply in s 3. It needs to be emphasised again that there was no actual supply nor any intention or ability to supply drugs. 
     22    There is, it seems to me, an argument that offences of this nature, which apparently occur infrequently, ought be dealt with by a separate section of the legislation which can have as its maximum penalty a different penalty than life imprisonment. There is concern, that at least I have, that if it continues in the present situation there may be a skew in the JIRS statistics relating to offences under this provision which may have the capacity to mislead courts in the future. 
     23    Returning to this particular appeal I can discern no error of principle by his Honour. In my view the sentence cannot be said to amount to the kind of inadequacy in sentencing standards as to constitute an error. 
     24     It cannot be said that the sentencing discretion has been improperly exercised and, given the discretionary nature of the exercise, I do not see that the intervention of the Court can be justified. 
     25    In my view the appeal should be dismissed. 
     26    WOOD CJ AT CL: I agree and I similarly share his Honour's concerns as to the appropriateness of charging offences of the present kind under supply provisions. 
     27    STUDDERT J: I also agree. 
     28    STEIN JA: The order of the Court will be the appeal is dismissed.

      Regina v Gheorghe Becheru 
     The appellant pleaded guilty to one count of being in possession of a trafficable quantity of heroin, contrary to s 233 B (1) (c) Customs Act 1901. He was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years. During the course of the proceedings the appellant indicated that there was a possibility that he may no longer wish to adhere to his plea. Counsel obtained written instructions in which the appellant confirmed his understanding of the relevant considerations and his decision to enter a plea of guilty. The appellant appeals against the conviction on the basis that his plea was not a free and voluntary one, having been made in circumstances which did not involve a true admission of guilt, or in circumstances where he was effectively pushed into a plea. HELD: (Appeal dismissed):Ground 1: plea not made in circumstances which involved true admission of guiltThe courts approach attempts on appeal to effectively change a plea of guilty or assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with caution. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and the principle that a plea of guilty of a person in possession of all the relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission of all the essential ingredients of the offence. This was a case where it was inevitable , in light of the evidence, that the appellant would have been convicted if he had gone to trial. The appellant was fully informed and clearly understood what he was doing. There was no support for the proposition that he was wrongly pressured into entering into and adhering to the plea or that he did so as the result of inappropriate or imprudent advice.

       REGINA v GEORGHE BECHERU 
       
        
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
        
     1   MEAGHER JA: The Court is now in a position to give judgment and I ask Justice Wood to give the first judgment. 
     2   WOOD CJ AT CL: On 19 May 2000, the appellant pleaded guilty to one count of being in possession, without reasonable excuse, of a trafficable quantity of heroin reasonably suspected of having been imported, contrary to s 233 B (1) (c) of the Customs Act 1901. 
     3   He was sentenced by Latham DCJ on 26 June 2000 to 8 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 5 years. The sentence imposed reflected the fact that the appellant had previously been convicted, in 1991 of a similar offence although it had involved cocaine rather than heroin. Allowance was made for the plea, for the absence of remissions and for the fact that the appellant had been in gainful employment, save for the period spent in custody serving the sentence for the earlier offence. 
     4   The course which the proceedings took on sentence requires further mention as that is of direct relevance for the ground of appeal now raised.  
     5   A plea of guilty was entered by him on 19 May 2000 in the District Court. Before doing so the appellant endorsed the indictment with instructions that he wished to plead guilty. 
     6   The matter then came before Latham DCJ on 21 June 2000, on which occasion a statement of the facts and the appellant's antecedents were tendered, along with some references provided on his behalf and a presentence report. That report noted a denial of his guilt. That was a matter which attracted some debate, at least so far as it was thought to be relevant for the aspect of contrition. Submissions were addressed that day, on the part of the appellant, in the course of which it was made perfectly clear that a prison sentence could be expected, in the light of the earlier conviction and sentence.  
     7   The proceedings were then stood over until 21 June when some further material was tendered on behalf of the appellant. They were adjourned to 26 June for sentence. 
     8   On that day, a short adjournment was granted to the appellant so that he could discuss with his counsel the possibility of him giving evidence. In the course of that exchange, it became apparent there was a possibility that he may no longer wish to adhere to his plea. The sentencing judge inquired whether that might be the case. Counsel indicated that he proposed to get instructions in writing. The transcript records Her Honour as observing: 
      
       
        
        ""Absolutely I agree they need to be in writing. You need to take all the time that you need in order to be satisfied that those instructions are clear and unequivocal."" 
        
       
       
        
       
     9   When the proceedings resumed, later that morning, counsel confirmed that nothing had changed and that he did not wish to call evidence. Her Honour then proceeded to announce sentence on the basis of the plea of guilty. 
     10   The appellant now appeals against the conviction upon the basis that his plea was not a free and voluntary one having been made in circumstances which it is submitted, did not involve a true admission of guilt, or in circumstances where he was effectively pushed into a plea upon the basis that he had no choice about the matter. 
     11   The principles applicable in such a case are well established and were reviewed most recently by this Court in Toro-Martinez (2000) 114 ACR 533 and in Wilkes (2001) NSWCCA 97. 
     12   They were succinctly defined by Badgery-Parker J in Davies, NSW CCA 16 December 1993, a decision cited with approval in Toro-Martinez and in Wilkes. 
     13   Moreover, as Kirby P of the Court of Appeal recorded in Liberti (1991) 55 ACR 120 at 122: 
      
       
        
        ""For good reasons courts approach attempts at trial on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with caution bordering on circumspection. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence: See O'Neill (1979) 2 NSWLR 582(1979) 1 A Crim R 59; Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 81."" 
        
       
     14   It is these principles that need to be applied to the circumstances of the present appeal. 
     15   The prosecution case here was circumstantial. It depended upon the arrest in Perth of a man Juliana Bardo also known as George Bostan. He was a friend of the appellant who was found to have been in possession of a block of heroin bearing the impression 999, wrapped in brown paper, and sealed with cellotape. He had arrived in Perth on a flight from Sydney, where the appellant resided.  
     16   The appellant's fingerprints were found on the inside of the cellotape which sealed that package. When a search warrant was executed at his home, agents discovered in a shed an exercise book containing 15 plastic sheets each bearing the seal ""100% Double Uoglobe Brand."" This is a brand commonly seen on block heroin, and in combination with the numerals 999, it represented a high degree of purity. A fingerprint of the appellant was found on this exercise book, and his palm print was found on one of the 15 plastic sheets.  
     17   Agents also found 3 heavy metal plates which together formed a block press. The detachable top of this press had a raised impression of the numeral 9. Two bronze 9s were found within the press which could be used to impress the numerals 999 on. The packaged heroin found in Bostan's possession was of a similar size to plates of the the press, and the impression 999, was consistent with the size of the numerals found in the shed.  
     18   Other items recovered from within the shed included a quantity of glucose, the same substance with which the heroin block found in Bostan's possession had been cut. Cellotape, of a similar kind to that found on the package, was located in the kitchen of the appellant's home.  
     19   When interviewed by agents the appellant denied all knowledge of the heroin, the exercise book and the press. The only explanation which he gave for their presence in the shed was that someone else may have put them there. The glucose he suggested may have been there for making cakes. 
     20   The appellant now asserts that before entering his plea he was informed by his solicitor, on 19 May, hat he did not have a choice as he could expect to be convicted by reason of a presence of his prints upon the relevant exhibits. If he pleaded guilty, he was informed that he would get a shorter sentence than if he went to trial and was found guilty. It was following this conversation that he gave the written instructions which were endorsed on the indictment.  
     21   He says that on 26 June he informed his solicitor and counsel that he had no knowledge of the heroin, or of the manner in which his fingerprints came to be on the exhibit. He added that a friend of his, one Buca, who had been staying at his home until a date some 6 months earlier, had been allowed access to the shed where some of the incriminating articles had been found. The somewhat far-fetched suggestion, implicit in this assertion, is that in some fashion, he, the appellant, may have placed his fingerprints and palm print unwittingly on the various articles which may have been brought into the premises by Buca and used, presumably by that man to press and package the heroin block.  
     22   He said that he indicated to his legal advisers that he wished to give evidence along these lines. He was then informed of their opinion that, as he could not explain how his fingerprints came to be on the items, he would not be believed; that the judge would reject his plea and that he would end up being convicted and with a heavier sentence. This was the conversation which took place, as I understand it, in the period during which the proceedings were adjourned that morning. It was following that conversation that he signed a letter of instructions in the following term: 
      
       
        
        ""Friend Buca stayed at home 9 months. 
         
        Buca had access to all the home. Not aware of what he was doing in home. 
         
        Unaware of how fingerprint came to be on fingerprint. Uglobe plastic fingerprint unknown how they got there. 
         
        I've done nothing with this stuff. 
         
        Instructions: 26.6.00 
         
        Having been advised of the following: 
         
        1. To give this evidence would result in the Judge rejecting my plea of guilty and ordering me to stand my trial. 
         
        2. If I enter a plea of not guilty it is likely that Jury will convict me of possession of the heroin on any subsequent trial. 
         
        I ask that I continue with the plea of guilty. I do not wish to give the evidence outlined."" 
        
       
     23   The present is quite a different case from that considered in Wilkes, or McLean (2001) NSW CCA 58, where the advice of those advising a person entering a plea of guilty was, on its face, imprudent or inappropriate.  
     24   Conversely it seems to me that this was a case where it was inevitable, in the light of the fingerprints, and the other articles found in the appellant's home that, had he gone to trial, he would have been convicted, and he would have lost the discount available for the plea which was offered to a count which carried a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life.  
     25   Upon the appellant's own evidence, and by the signing of the written instructions on 26 June, the only inference open is that he was fully informed and clearly understood what he was doing. Apart from the advice given to him by his solicitor and counsel, and the opportunity which he had to reconsider his position, he was not unfamiliar with criminal proceedings by reason of his earlier trial and appeal.  
     26   There is not the slightest support, in my view, for any reasonable suspicion that he was wrongly pressured into entering into and adhering to the plea, or that he did so as a result of inappropriate or imprudent advice. Rather the material before us shows that the plea was a result of a free and informed choice.  
     27   In this respect the present case does bear a similarity to that of Jupp NSW CCA 23 November 1993, where this Court dismissed a similar application upon being satisfied that the appellant's decision to plead guilty was a deliberate one taken by him with a full understanding of what he was doing. It is also a case where the observations of Lee J in Segiv (1986) 22 ACR 73 at 80, made in the context of an application to withdraw a plea, but equally applicable to an appeal, apply. His Honour there said: 
      
       
        
        ""It is clear that, in the case of mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt the Court should readily grant leave. But if the plea has been entered in the full knowledge of all the facts and intentionally as a plea for the charge which is made, the court is plainly entitled to exercise its discretion against a withdrawal of the plea. The law regards a plea of guilty made by a person in possession of all the facts and intending to plead guilty as an admission of all of legal ingredients of the offence (O'Neill (1979), 2 NSWLR 582; 1 A Crim R 59) and as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made, for the court is prepared to act upon it and proceed to conviction or final disposal of the proceedings."" 
        
       
       
        
       
     28   Similarly, Brennan, Toohey and McHugh JJ in Meissner (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 141 said: 
      
       
        
        ""A court will act on a plea of guilty when it is entered in open court by a person who is of full age and apparently of sound mind and understanding provided the plea is entered in exercise of a free choice in the interests of the person entering the plea. There is no miscarriage of justice if the Court does act on such a plea even if the person entering it is not in truth guilty of the offence."" 
        
       
     29   In the circumstances outlined, and by reference to the authorities noted above, I am of the view there is here no real question about the guilt of the appellant, or about the integrity of the plea, which is to be taken, as I have observed, as an admission of all of the necessary ingredients of the offence.  
     30   The circumstances previously identified which the Crown was in a position to prove, constituted a strong case, the strength of which may properly be taken into account, in an appeal such as the present for the reasons identified by Mahoney JA in Ross NSW CCA 20 April 1994. There, his Honour noted the relevance of the courts assessment of the strength of the Crown case and added: 
      
       
        
        “In considering whether there has been a miscarriage of justice, the court looks not only at principle but at reality. It would be conscious of the danger of putting aside principle upon the plea that the accused was plainly guilty: the possibility of abuse from such an approach is plain. But an appeal upon the ground of miscarriage is not a retrial of the offence or, as in this case, a full trial of it. It is therefore necessary to consider what is the relevance of the strength of the case for the Crown and the defence in determining an appeal of this kind. 
        
       
       
        
        It is, in my opinion, sufficient in this regard that the accused had a reasonably arguable case at the trial and that there was a real possibility that he would succeed. If he had this, he need prove no more in this regard. If by being led to plead guilty in an unacceptable way he lost this, that is, in my opinion, sufficient to establish a miscarriage.” 
        
       
     31   In the present case I am of the view that there was no real possibility that the appellant would succeed if he went to trial. Moreover, I am not persuaded that he was led to plead guilty in an unacceptable way. 
     32   For those reasons I am not satisfied that this is a case where a miscarriage of justice has been established and I would dismiss the appeal.33   MEAGHER JA: I agree. 
     34   STUDDERT J: I also agree. 
     35   MEAGHER JA: The order of the Court is the appeal is dismissed.

      R v JOHN VIANA 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1   MEAGHER JA: This is an application for leave to appeal by Mr John Edward Viana against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Viney on 16 March 1999. In effect was comprised a head sentence of fourteen years and a non-parole period of ten years. It is not submitted that the head sentence is too long, but is said that the non-parole period represents too high a proportion of the head sentence. 
     2   Attention is drawn to the fact that the applicant's co-offender, Mr Stead, was given a sentence of ten years with a non-parole period of five years. In the case of the co-offender, Mr Bonett, the sentence was eight years with a non-parole period of three and a half years. The percentages of the non-parole period to the head sentence, therefore, is as follows: Mr Viana, 71.31 percent; Mr Stead, 50 percent; Mr Bonett, 43.75 percent. 
     3   The principles of law applicable in this area have been laid down by this court in Bernier v R (1998) 102 ACrimR 44. There is in fact no statute which requires the non-parole period to bear any particular proportion in relation to the head sentence, nor is there any mandatory precedent in this Court which requires a fixed sentence. The most that can be said is that this Court has usually in cases of this sort, thought the proportion ought to be somewhere between 60 and 66 percent. That is not to say that higher percentages cannot stand. Indeed, if one looks at a survey of similar cases, there are many cases in which this court has approved of high percentages as high as 75 percent at least. 
     4   To compare Mr Viana's position to the position of Mr Stead and Mr Bonett, is also hardly fair. They are very different cases. To compare Mr Viana's position to Mr Bonett, one finds these factors at least: Mr Viana was a much more serious offender in that he initiated a whole series of importations earlier than the one with which he was charged. Mr Bonett was not in that position. Mr Viana did not enter an early plea of guilty whereas Mr Bonett did. He did not give any particular cooperation to the authorities, where Mr Bonett did. What is more significant is that Mr Viana had three other charges against him, apart from the conspiracy to import commercial quantities of cocaine. In addition, he was charged with possession of not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine and with possession of prohibited weapons and possession for supply of not less than the indictable quantity of cannabis. These matters are reflected in the length of the head sentence. 
     5   In the circumstances, I cannot see why the seriousness of the crimes so reflected should not also be reflected in the proportion of the non-parole period to the head sentence. For these reasons I am of the view the application should be dismissed. 
     6   WOOD CJ at CL: I agree. 
     7   STUDDERT J: I also agree. 
     8   MEAGHER JA: The order of the Court, therefore is that the appeal is dismissed.

IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL CCA 60324/00 MEAGHER JA HIDDEN J HOWIE J  Friday, 6 April 2001  
      
      JOHN GIANG DIEU KOOK v REGINA 
      
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1   MEAGHER JA: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed by her Honour Judge Latham on 19 May 2000. The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 years, with a non-parole period of 8 years. The applicant had, on 10 March 2000, pleaded guilty to one count under s 233B (1)(d) of the Customs Act (1901), namely that between 23 March and 13 June 1998 he was knowingly concerned in the importation of a commercial quantity of heroin. In fact the amount involved was nearly 2.5 kilograms. It was concealed inside hollowed out computer instruction books. 
     2   The principals in the importation were two men called Mei and Li. The hollowed books arrived by plane in Sydney on 17 April 1998. A Malaysian citizen called Pang was recruited by one Simon in Malaysia to collect and sign for the books. Thereafter the books were taken to the accused’s premises, the key to which the accused gave to Pang. As her Honour said “in general terms Pang received instructions and expenses from the prisoner throughout this period”. 
     3   It is contended on behalf of the applicant that the sentence was too harsh. This contention was advanced by four submissions. The first is that the sentence was outside the guidelines set by this Court in R v Wong & Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340. In that case the Chief Justice said that for “low range commercial quantities” of heroin (ie amounts between 1.5 kilos and 3.5 kilos), the conviction appropriate for “couriers and persons low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation” should be 8 to 12 years. Hence the applicant was “low in the hierarchy” and the amount involved was 2.5 kilos. Thus the applicant received a sentence towards the top of the range for importing a quantity in the middle of the range. I do not think the art of judging sentencing can be reduced to such jejune mathematics. 
     4   Obviously her Honour, who was aware of R v Wong & Leung, chose a period which was within the range, although towards the top of it. That she did so reflected her Honour’s opinion that although the applicant was “low in the hierarchy”, and “only a foot soldier”, he was heavily involved in the transportation. He was the apparent lessee of the unit at Summer Hill to which the heroin was delivered; he gave the keys of it to Pang; he transmitted the orders of Mei and Li to Pang; he acted as Pang’s chauffeur; and it was his duty to distribute the heroin to its ultimate users. What else he did we will never know, because he never told us. This submission should fail.  
     5   The second submission was that the principle of parity was offended because Mr. Pang’s sentence (before discounting for assistance) was 10 years, with a non-parole period of 7 years. However, there were sufficient indications that the activities of the applicant were more intimately involved with the importation than were those of Mr Pang. This submission should fail. 
     6   The third submission was that her Honour gave insufficient weight to the plea of guilty. I do not think so. It arose at the last moment; it cannot be contorted into an expression of contrition; and the Crown case was extremely strong. This submission should fail. 
     7   Even less powerful is the fourth submission, to the effect that a greater discount should be allowed for assistance given to the police. This turns out to be no more than an interview with a police officer and conveying to him information which he already possessed. 
     8   The application should be dismissed. 
     9   HIDDEN J: I agree that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Howie J. 
     10   HOWIE J: I agree with Meagher JA that the application should be dismissed for substantially the reasons given by him. However, I wish to add a few comments of my own. 
     11   The applicant’s principal contention was that the sentence imposed upon him ought to have been no more than that which the Court of Criminal Appeal thought was appropriate for Pang, absent any discount for assistance. That was a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years. 
     12   There were two arguments advanced to support that contention. The first was that such a sentence was an appropriate one to reflect the role played by the accused as a courier or a person low in the hierarchy in the importation of an amount of heroin coming within the middle of the “Low range commercial quantity” as specified in the judgment of the Chief Justice in R v Wong & Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 at 366. The second argument was that the role played by the applicant in the importation was no greater than that of Pang and, therefore, the principle of parity requires that the applicant receive no greater sentence than that which would have been imposed upon Pang but for the assistance he provided. 
     13   In my view the contention fails on both arguments once proper regard is given to the actual part played by the applicant in the importation. 
     14   The majority of the High Court in R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 279 although recognising the usefulness of the terms “couriers” and “principals” to describe the different kinds of participation in a single enterprise and the differing levels of culpability, warned against too much reliance being placed upon those terms when sentencing a particular offender. Their Honours stated: 
      
       
        
        “Further, it is always necessary, whether one or several offenders are to be dealt with in connection with a single importation of drugs, to bear steadily in mind the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. Characterising the offender as a ‘courier’ or a ‘principal’ must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did”. 
        
       
     15   So too the use of the phrase “couriers and persons low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation” as used in relation to the guideline set out in R v Wong & Leung should not deflect the sentencing judge from focusing upon the acts performed by the offender in connection with the importation in which he or she is concerned when determining the sentence appropriate to reflect the offender’s culpability. 
     16   In the present case, the issue raised before Judge Latham seems to have been whether the level of involvement of Pang and the applicant was the same, or whether one was more involved than the other sufficient to place them in different categories for the purpose of considering the guideline set out in R v Wong & Leung. Before her Honour the Crown submitted that, whereas Pang was a courier, the applicant was a go-between or intermediary in the importation and his role was to take possession of the heroin for dissemination in the community. On the other hand the submission made on behalf of the applicant was that Pang was not a “mere courier” but had a role higher in the organisation than the applicant as evidenced by his frequent and direct contact with the principals. 
     17   It is in the light of this controversy that the remarks of her Honour about the respective roles of the applicant and Pang in the importation have to be read and considered. So it was that Her Honour recognised that the applicant’s role was different to that of Pang but she was not satisfied that his role was more significant “so as to attract an increment to the range of eight to twelve years”. In other words her Honour rejected the Crown’s contention that the guideline in R v Wong & Leung was not relevant because the applicant’s role was as a middleman between the courier and the principals. Consistent with this finding her Honour expressed her agreement with the submission made on behalf of the applicant that he fell to be sentenced as “a person low in the hierarchy but not a courier”. However, her Honour rejected the submission that Pang occupied a more senior position in the hierarchy than the applicant. 
     18   It is clear that her Honour was aware of the following matters when determining the sentence to be imposed upon the applicant: the range of sentence applicable by reason of the amount and nature of drug imported and the applicant’s role in the importation as specified in R v Wong & Leung; the issue of parity between the applicant and Pang based upon their similar position in the hierarchy of the organisation involvement in the importation; and the sentence imposed upon Pang and the basis upon which that sentenced was calculated by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Yet her Honour determined that an appropriate sentence to reflect the prisoner’s culpability and subjective circumstances was greater than that which would have been appropriate in Pang’s case had there been no assistance provided by him. 
     19   In my view the only basis upon which her Honour could reasonably have reached that conclusion was that she considered the applicant’s role in the importation was greater than Pang’s notwithstanding that, generally speaking, they both fell in the lower end of the hierarchy. In my opinion, not only was her Honour entitled to come to that finding of fact, it is the only finding reasonably open on the evidence. 
     20   I acknowledge that at one point during her remarks on sentence, her Honour expressed the view that there was “little which distinguishes the prisoner from Pang in terms of the objective gravity of the offence”. If by that statement her Honour meant to convey any more than that the culpability of the applicant and Pang was similar because they both held a position at the lower end of the hierarchy, then it is inconsistent with the sentence imposed on the applicant, the general tenor of her Honour’s discussion of their differing roles in the importation, and the undisputed facts. 
     21   Pang’s role was to receive the package containing the drug when it was delivered to the unit in which he had been installed and then, some time later under instructions, to convey the package from the unit to the applicant who was waiting nearby in a motor vehicle. Pang had been recruited to carry out the task in Malaysia and was to be paid a sum of money and his expenses for carrying out this task. Clearly those who organised the importation perceived that the receipt of the package posed the most serious risk of detection for any person involved in the venture and recruited a person from outside the organisation to perform that task. 
     22   The applicant, however, was a person within the organisation who was assigned the task of taking care of Pang by, at various times, giving him instructions and directions, amounts of money, a mobile telephone, and the keys to the unit to which the drugs were delivered. But the applicant’s role in the importation was not limited to his dealings with Pang. The applicant was also involved in receiving the drugs from Pang so that the process of their dissemination into the community could commence. The box, in which the books containing the drugs had been delivered to Pang, was found in premises where the applicant lived within a relatively short period of time after the drugs were delivered to Pang. After the applicant’s arrest on 3 June, six of the hollowed-out books which had contained the drugs were found in these premises. 
     23   Although this Court should accept her Honour’s finding that the applicant’s level of involvement in the importation was low in the hierarchy for the purpose of considering the relevance of the guideline in R v Wong & Leung, in my view he came at the very top of that level and he was more significantly involved than Pang. I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive in itself or by reference to the guideline, notwithstanding the amount of drug involved. 
     24   Nor do I believe that her Honour erred by giving insufficient weight to the applicant’s plea. The applicant did not indicate that he was prepared to plead guilty to the charge until 11 days before his trial was to commence. Apart from the plea, her Honour found no other evidence of contrition for the applicant’s involvement in the commission of the offence. Her Honour stated that the plea was in the face of an overwhelming Crown case. Yet her Honour said that she was taking the plea into account. 
     25   Although the guideline in R v Wong & Leung encompasses all relevant matters including a plea; R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 419, it does not follow that her Honour erred in choosing a sentence which is at the top of the range specified in the guideline for the quantity of drug involved. 
     26   It is important to bear in mind that a sentencing guideline is indicative only and it may be departed from in the proper exercise of a sentencing discretion; R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 220; R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 356, 359. It may well be that a sentence which is outside the guideline may attract the close scrutiny of this Court to determine whether the sentence was justified by the particular facts of the matter. But the fact that the sentence imposed by her Honour is at the top of the range of sentences reflected in the guideline, notwithstanding that the applicant pleaded guilty, does not necessarily require a finding that her Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried or that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     27   Finally I am unpersuaded that Judge Latham erred in failing to give any discount to the applicant for, what was said to be, assistance provided by him to the police. On 15 March 2000, that is almost two years after his arrest, the applicant spoke to a police officer for about one and a half hours about his role in the importation and what he knew about it. It should be noted that, before the applicant gave the police his account, Pang had given evidence in the applicant’s committal proceedings. The police officer gave evidence before her Honour that the information was of no assistance because the applicant told the officer nothing that the police did not already know. 
     28   Although there was no evidence of what the applicant had told the police officer, her Honour assumed, not unreasonably, that it would have been consistent with an account given by the applicant to a psychologist on 13 April 2000. The applicant told the psychologist he was not aware that drugs may have been involved until he received the hollowed-out books. He emphasised to her that his role was minor and involved “just that of driving Pang around and keeping the books”. Judge Latham placed no weight on what the applicant told the psychologist about his part in the importation because the account was self-serving, the applicant did not give evidence before her, and it was inconsistent with other evidence which she did accept. 
     29   In my view it was well within her Honour’s discretion to determine that the information provided by the applicant to the police did not warrant a discount of his sentence. Clearly her Honour did not accept that the applicant’s version given to the psychologist was a full and frank account of his involvement in the importation. Her Honour was accordingly unpersuaded that the information provided to the police amounted to full and frank co-operation and, therefore, could significantly assist the authorities: R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 253.

      JUDGMENT 
     1   BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Studdert J. 
      
       
        
       
     2   STUDDERT J: The appellant, TJF, stood trial before his Honour Judge Mitchelmore and jury in the Penrith District Court in July and August 1998 following the presentation of an indictment which charged him with the commission of two sexual offences. The first of these was a charge of aggravated indecent assault and the second charge was one of sexual intercourse without consent knowing that the victim was not consenting and in circumstances of aggravation. The jury disagreed in relation to the first count but the jury found the appellant guilty on the charge of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. 
      
       
        
       
     3   By his notice of appeal the appellant appealed against conviction and he also made an application for leave to appeal against sentence, but the application for leave to appeal against sentence has not been pursued. The appellant was sentenced, following conviction on the second count, to a minimum term of eighteen months penal servitude commencing on 3 August 1998 and expiring on 2 February 2000 and an additional term of eighteen months penal servitude to commence on 3 February 2000 and to expire on 2 August 2001. The significance of this sentence is that the appellant has already served the minimum term and more than two-thirds of the additional term, and this feature alone explains why the application for leave to appeal against sentence has not been pursued. Why the appellant was so slow to pursue this appeal has not been satisfactorily explained. 
      
       
        
       
     4   It was the appeal against conviction only that was argued before this Court. 
      
       
        
       
     5   The alleged victim of the aggravated indecent assault was a sister of the alleged victim of the more serious offence in respect of which the appellant was convicted. I shall refer to the alleged victim of the aggravated indecent assault as SM and the alleged victim of the more serious offence as CM. 
      
       
        
       
     6   SM was born on 19 March 1986, CM was born on 25 November 1981, and the two children were two children of a family of four. They had a sister C and a brother J. All four children lived with their parents in an outer suburb of Sydney. 
      
       
        
       
     7   The appellant was a friend of the family. The complainants’ mother gave evidence at the trial that she had known the appellant for some eighteen years and he frequently visited and stayed overnight at the family home. 
      
       
        
       
     8   SM gave evidence that on an occasion in some past winter school holidays she was awakened in her bed to feel someone’s hand, down her nightie and outside her underpants, touching her vagina. SM observed that this was the appellant. She left her bed and went to sleep on the floor near her chest of drawers. SM could not recall how old she was or what class she was in at school when this happened but her evidence was that it was two years later when she first complained about the incident. 
      
       
        
       
     9   The evidence concerning CM’s case was more specific. On 16 March 1996 the appellant set off with CM’s family to travel in the appellant’s vehicle to Dubbo where J was to play football. The appellant’s vehicle broke down and the appellant returned to Sydney by train, taking the three girls with him whilst J and his mother and father went to Dubbo for the football. 
      
       
        
       
     10   According to CM, the three girls and the appellant spent the night of 16 March at their home and the girls went to bed in their parents’ bedroom. The appellant joined them in the same bed. According to CM, she asked him to sleep in one of the other bedrooms but he declined. The evidence of CM was that when she woke up in the morning the appellant was lying beside her under the blanket and that his finger was inside her vagina. CM said that the appellant kept his finger there for about five minutes. She said that she then made a noise as though she was waking up and the appellant left the bed and the room. Nothing was said between them as to what had occurred, and CM said that when she woke up her sisters were no longer in the bed or the bedroom.  
      
       
        
       
     11   CM’s evidence that the appellant slept in the same bed as the children was supported by her sister C. 
      
       
        
       
     12   It was not until October 1996 that there was any complaint by either complainant. To the detail of the various complaints, I shall refer in the course of considering ground 1. 
      
       
        
       
     13   Evidence was given by the parents of the complainants, their mother, GM, and their father, JM. Their evidence was that they had a number of conversations with the appellant after hearing the complaints made by their children. In the course of one of these conversations, according to JM, the appellant admitted offending against CM. 
      
       
        
       
     14   Evidence was given by JM that the appellant made an offer to pay money and that JM and GM were willing to accept money as “an out of court settlement” concerning what it was claimed by the children had taken place. There was evidence of a number of recorded telephone conversations in which JM, GM and the appellant participated concerning the payment by the appellant of money, and which led to both JM and GM being charged with demanding money with menaces and the failure to report a serious offence. Each parent was convicted in the Local Court and at the time of the appellant’s trial had an appeal pending in the District Court. 
      
       
        
       
     15   The appellant made a statement to the police on 24 October 1996 in which he denied having committed either of the offences charged. He also gave evidence at his trial to the like effect, and denied making the admission attributed to him by JM. The appellant’s evidence was that he was so distressed by the allegations made against him by the children that he decided to commit suicide and that he telephoned JM informing him that he could have half his (the appellant’s) superannuation. It was subsequent to this, on the appellant’s account, that the sum of $40,000 was demanded by GM and later the sum of $60,000 instead was demanded by JM. 
      
       
        
       
     16   Against this brief review of the evidence, I turn to consider the various grounds of appeal. 
      
       
        
         
        THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
         
         
        Ground 1: The trial miscarried by reason of trial counsel’s errors and incompetence 
         
        
       
     17   Four points have been taken concerning the conduct of this trial as supporting this first ground: 
      
       
        
         
        (a) the failure to apply for separate trials 
         
         
        (b) conduct in respect of the complaint evidence 
         
         
        (c) the failure to object to the admission allegedly made to JM 
         
         
        (d) the failure to apply for directions under s 136 of the Evidence Act. 
         
         
        The failure to apply for separate trials 
         
        
       
     18   It was submitted that reasonably prudent counsel would have been expected to apply for separate trials as a means of ensuring that the appellant received a fair trial on each count, because for the charges to be heard together involved the risk that the evidence on the one count might prejudice the jury in relation to the other count. Reference was made to De Jesus v The Queen (1986) 61 ALJR 1 in support of the submission that the two counts should not have been joined in the one indictment. 
      
       
        
       
     19   It is relevant to consider the history of the appellant’s prosecution, which is recorded in a judgment of Judge Coleman QC on 21 April 1998. From that judgment, it appears that the appellant was arraigned in April of the previous year on an indictment that contained two counts, ie one in relation to each of the complainants I have earlier identified. However, the Crown later decided to proceed on separate indictments with back-to-back trials and on 20 April 1998 the appellant was called for trial in relation to an indictment charging an offence against CM only. Because of the nature of the cross examination of CM during that trial, the Crown applied to have the jury discharged and a fresh trial on an indictment in the form in which it was ultimately presented before Judge Mitchelmore. Counsel appearing for the appellant in April 1998 did not oppose a joint trial and had no objection to the Crown’s application. Judge Coleman expressed himself to be satisfied that a joint trial was necessary in the circumstances, having earlier observed: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “In the present situation the defence case requires exploration of the dealings between the parents of the complaints [sic] and the accused and between those parents and the complainants and between the complainants themselves.” 
          
         
        
       
     20   Counsel who appeared for the appellant before Judge Coleman did not represent the appellant at the trial before Judge Mitchelmore and was not counsel against whom the submission of incompetence has been made. 
      
       
        
       
     21   This Court received an affidavit sworn by the appellant in which he complained that counsel to whom ground 1 relates did not discuss with him the disadvantages of having but a single trial. Plainly counsel should have done so, but it does not automatically follow from this that the trial miscarried. 
      
       
        
       
     22   The principles relevant in considering this first ground of appeal as expressed by Gleeson CJ in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685 are these: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “The relevant principles, may be summarised as follows: 
          
         
         
          
          1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates. 
          
         
         
          
          2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 
          
         
         
          
          3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.” 
          
         
        
       
     23   The trial which led to the appellant’s conviction and to this appeal proceeded after yet another jury had been discharged. The reasons for that discharge assume no significance for present purposes but, in the course of his reasons for deciding to discharge that jury, Judge Mitchelmore referred to the ""forensic decision” of counsel for the appellant (at the trial before him) “to run the two complaints of [SM] and [CM] together in one trial.” 
      
       
        
       
     24   Consideration of the transcript of evidence at the trial supports the conclusion that counsel determined that tactically the better course was to have the two charges determined together. The very considerations referred to by Judge Coleman in the passage set out above were relevant considerations for counsel in determining how best to conduct the appellant’s defence. 
      
       
        
       
     25   The appellant’s case at trial was that the complaints by both children were fabrications and that their evidence was false. Consideration of the transcript makes it clear that counsel had determined that the appellant’s prospects of acquittal would be enhanced by allowing into evidence complaints of the two children, albeit belatedly made, in order to take advantage of asserted inconsistencies in the detail of the complaints. Emphasis was given to the different accounts of the complaints given by GM and JM. In addition, the doctor who examined each of the children after the complaints were made was cross examined to elicit the different versions of the complaints as relayed to her by the parents. Further, GM was cross examined as to what she told the police had been said by her daughters by way of complaint. 
      
       
        
       
     26   Coupled with this was the asserted discreditable conduct of the parents in demanding money from the appellant. Such conduct provided an explanation as to why the complaints may have been pursued when otherwise the relationship of the appellant, and the complainants and their parents seemed to be one of longstanding friendship. 
      
       
        
       
     27   Counsel also relied upon assertions by the complainants and their parents to the effect that there was no discussion between SM and CM about what each claimed had happened to her and no family discussion either. The jury was invited to decide that evidence to such effect was not to be believed.  
      
       
        
       
     28   The issues above addressed could effectively be pursued in proceedings where both counts were dealt with at the same trial. 
      
       
        
       
     29   Doubtless, different counsel may well have decided that the appellant’s interests would have been better served by making application for separate trials, but a recognition of this does not compel the conclusion that the appellant’s counsel demonstrated incompetence in the decision he reached, nor does it lead me to the conclusion that the trial miscarried. 
      
       
        
         
        The conduct of counsel in respect of the complaint evidence 
         
         
        The failure of counsel to apply for directions under s 136 of the Evidence Act 
         
        
       
     30   It was submitted before this Court that the decision to allow into evidence the evidence of complaints made by the children was erroneous and demonstrated incompetence. 
      
       
        
       
     31   This trial was conducted after the Evidence Act 1995 took effect. Mr Fliece submitted that even though the trial took place before the decision of the High Court in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606, counsel nevertheless demonstrated incompetence in not objecting to the complaint evidence because, at the time the complaints were expressed in each case, the events complained of were not fresh in the memory of the respective complainants. In the case of the complainant SM, the claimed misconduct had occurred two years prior to the complaint, and, in the case of CM, the claimed misconduct had occurred seven months before she spoke to her mother. 
      
       
        
       
     32   Even if counsel’s decision to allow the evidence of complaint to be introduced did not demonstrate incompetence, at the very least what counsel ought to have done was to ask for a direction pursuant to s 136 of the Evidence Act so as to limit the use that might be made of the complaint evidence to the issue of reliability of the complainants’ testimony. The jury ought not to have been allowed, Mr Fliece submitted, to weigh the complaint evidence as evidence of the substance of the complaints. 
      
       
        
       
     33   Had objection been taken to the complaint evidence, it ought properly to have been excluded. In SM’s case, the complaint was two years old and in CM’s case, the complaint was seven months old. Neither complaint was therefore fresh for the purposes of s 66 of the Evidence Act. Nor is it to be assumed that had objection been taken to the evidence of complaint being introduced, it would have been admitted under s 108(3) of the Evidence Act. However, the conduct of trial counsel was governed by the deliberate tactical decision to draw on the perceived inconsistencies in the complaint evidence in order to discredit the complainants and to undermine the prosecution case, and it is to be considered in this way. 
      
       
        
       
     34   So, too, is the failure of counsel to seek a direction limiting the use to which the jury could put the complaint evidence. Mr Fliece submitted that counsel should have sought a direction that the jury be permitted to have regard to such evidence only in assessing the reliability of the complainants and that the evidence was not to be taken as evidence as to the truth of the substance of the complaint. 
      
       
        
       
     35   However, again, it does not seem to me that the failure of counsel to seek a direction to such effect necessarily bespeaks incompetence. Again, the point has to be considered having regard to the decision which counsel had made as to how this trial was to be conducted and how the evidence of complaint was to be used. Counsel may very well have determined that the appellant’s prospects of acquittal would not have been enhanced in the atmosphere of this trial by having the judge refine in such a manner the use to which the complaint evidence might be put. 
      
       
        
         
        The failure to object to the admission allegedly made to JM 
         
        
       
     36   JM gave evidence that in a telephone conversation the appellant expressed contrition for what he had done and said he was going to put “half his superannuation into a trust fund for [CM]”. In the course of that conversation, according to JM, the appellant said “I can remember doing it to [CM], but I can’t remember doing it to [SM],because I was too far gone.” It was submitted that counsel demonstrated incompetence in allowing this evidence without objection. What JM claimed the appellant said to him was in context evidence that could be regarded as evidence of an admission. However, Mr Fliece has submitted that, if objection had been taken, the evidence would have been excluded. In support of that submission, Mr Fliece relied upon provisions of the Evidence Act. 
      
       
        
       
     37   The first of the provisions to which Mr Fliece referred is s 85. Section 85(1) defines the scope of the application of the section: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          (1) 
           This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only to evidence of an admission made by a defendant:  
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) in the course of official questioning, or  
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (b) as a result of an act of another person who is capable of influencing the decision whether a prosecution of the defendant should be brought or should be continued.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     38   Section 85(1) was not enlivened in the circumstances under consideration. The admission made was not in the course of official questioning, nor was it made in consequence of any act by JM. JM’s evidence was that it was the appellant who made the telephone conversation and that the appellant volunteered the admission. Moreover, whilst the fact that JM was able to give evidence of the alleged admission may have been a factor in determining whether to proceed against the appellant or not, it did not follow from this that JM was a person “capable of influencing the decision whether a prosecution… should be brought” for the purposes of s 85(1)(b): see R v Truong (1996) 86 A Crim R 188. 
      
       
        
       
     39   Alternatively, Mr Fliece relied upon s 90 of the Evidence Act under which the Court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission if “having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.” The circumstances identified by Mr Fliece as calling for the discretionary exclusion of the admission were these: 
      
       
        
         
        (i) that the admission was made after GM had threatened him (according to his account of events to the police in the statement admitted into evidence as Exhibit H); 
         
         
        (ii) the circumstances revealed in the transcripts of the intercepted telephone conversations, in which the parents of the complainants sought to obtain the sums of money referred to earlier by way of out of court settlement; 
         
         
        (iii) the evidence that the complainants’ parents had pleaded guilty to demanding money with menaces; 
         
         
        (iv) the appellant’s evidence at the trial that his mental state at the time of making the admission was such that he was contemplating suicide. 
         
        
       
     40   I am by no means persuaded that any of the above circumstances would have warranted the exclusion of the evidence of admissions under s 90. So far as the appellant’s state of mind was concerned, no medical evidence as to his mental state at the relevant time would appear to have been available and GM’s accusation levelled at the appellant and her assertion as to what was going to happen to the appellant preceded the telephone conversation initiated by the appellant in which the admission was allegedly made. I am not persuaded that trial counsel was in a position to establish that to admit the evidence of admission would have been “unfair” for the purposes of s 90. Still less am I persuaded that a decision not to object to the evidence established incompetence by counsel having regard to the way in which he had decided to conduct this trial. 
      
       
        
       
     41   It has not been shown that trial counsel was equipped to persuade the court that the evidence of admission ought to have been excluded under s 135 upon the basis that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the appellant. Nor has it been established that counsel was in any better position to persuade the court to exclude the evidence under ss 137 or 138. 
      
       
        
       
     42   For the above reasons, I do not consider ground 1 has been established. 
      
       
        
         
        Ground 2: That the directions on the use which could be made of the evidence of complaint were erroneous and inadequate 
         
        
       
     43   For the purpose of considering this ground and ground 3, it is appropriate to record the terms of the directions which the trial judge gave to the jury on the evidence of complaint (SU11-13): 
      
       
        
         
          
          “I now turn to give you some directions about what is called complaint evidence. I direct you, if you find there was a delay in making a complaint, the delay in complaint does not necessarily indicate the allegations that the offence was committed is false. Secondly, there may be good reasons why victims of sexual assault may hesitate in making a complaint. 
          
         
         
          
          [SM] said she was scared. This was the reason that there was a delay of somewhere around two years before she spoke to her sister about what she said had happened to her. 
          
         
         
          
          Evidence of complaint is to be considered both as evidence of the allegation made in the complaint and as evidence of consistency of the conduct of the alleged victims with the allegations made by them. 
          
         
         
          
          There was evidence of complaint by both [SM] and [CM] to their father in mid-October 1996 on his return from Singapore. [C] gave evidence of a conversation in October 1996 when she said [SM] told her [the appellant] put his hands down her pants. [C] said ‘Why didn’t you tell Mum?’ [SM]’s alleged to have said ‘Because I was scared.’ [CM] said then [SM] told [GM] what had happened. 
          
         
         
          
          I also direct that should you find there has been a delay in making a complaint that fact can be taken into account by you in evaluating the evidence of the complainants and whether you believe them or either of them. 
          
         
         
          
          Now because someone said a thing happened does not mean the event happened. The source of complaint is still the complainant. 
          
         
         
          
          You must remember that when assessing the evidence of [C] and the other evidence of complaint which has been given to you during last week in this Court. 
          
         
         
          
          I repeat, complaint still has its genesis in the complainant you must give it close attention and careful scrutiny. 
          
         
         
          
          I remind you that complaint is not evidence independent of the complainant. It is, I repeat, evidence which has its genesis or its origins in the complainant. It is what the complainant said and in this case what the complainants said. 
          
         
         
          
          Complaint is not independent supportive evidence, confirmatory of the accused committing the offence or offences. 
          
         
         
          
          ………….. 
          
         
         
          
          The witness [SM] said that she did not complain until two years after the incident. It seems [CM] did not complain about the alleged instant [sic] which was said to have occurred in March 1996 until October 1996. That is roughly seven months. 
          
         
         
          
          Delay makes difficult for the accused to instruct his lawyers in relation to the charges. Try and remember your way of life two years ago. It is not easy. Likewise it is not easy to remember your way of life seven months ago. 
          
         
         
          
          The accused does not have to prove anything, I told you that. But trying to assemble material relevant to the accused case is made very difficult by the lapse of time between the alleged events and the complaint. 
          
         
         
          
          It makes the testing of the Crown case and the presentation of the accused’s case most difficult. 
          
         
         
          
          You must bear in mind when assessing the evidence that has been put before you. You must scrutinise the Crown case with great care.” 
          
         
        
       
     44   Mr Fliece has submitted that the above directions suffered from these deficiencies: 
      
       
        
         
        (i) that the jury was not alerted to the fact that the complaint of CM was not spontaneous but rather that it was elicited on questioning by her mother; 
         
         
        (ii) that the direction was erroneous to the extent that his Honour told the jury that the complaint evidence was to be considered  
         
         
          
           
            
            “both as evidence of the allegation made in the complaint and as evidence of the consistency of the conduct of the alleged victims with the allegations made by them”; 
            
           
          
         
         
        (iii) that the jury was not directed as to the inconsistencies in the various accounts of the terms of the complaint of CM; 
         
         
        (iv) that the jury was not told that complaint evidence could be used to cast doubt on the reliability of the complainants. 
         
        
       
     45   Ground 3 raises a discrete matter which I shall shortly address, but for the purposes of Ground 2, it is to be observed that counsel at the trial did not seek any further direction as to any of the above matters. Rule 4 thus applies. 
      
       
        
       
     46   It is evident that counsel dealt with the issue of the evidence of complaint in pursuance of a plan. Leave is not ordinarily granted where failure to take a point at trial may be explained as a tactical decision: see R v PAH (unreported, NSWCCA, 18 December 1988), R v Gillard (1999) 105 A Crim R 479 and R v Ali [2000] NSWCCA 177. I would not grant leave to rely upon this ground in the present circumstances. 
      
       
        
         
        Ground 3: Failure to adequately direct the jury that the evidence of complaint may be unreliable and failure to properly identify the matters that may have caused that evidence to be unreliable 
         
        
       
     47   Counsel did ask for a further direction after the summing up which the transcript records was expressed in the following way: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “…with respect to the reference of complaint, your Honour did in fact indicate to the jury reasons why that evidence may not be regarded as independent evidence. Your Honour didn’t mention the word ‘unreliable’ in the context of s 165 of the Evidence Act that there may be good reasons why the evidence is unreliable. I’d ask your Honour to indicate that to the Jury, particularly in relation to [CM] because most of your Honour’s directions on complaint were in respect of [SM]’s delay of two years.” 
          
         
        
       
     48   The transcript records his Honour’s response: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “HIS HONOUR: I don’t propose to give that direction.” 
          
         
        
       
     49   It does not appear that counsel was asked to identify or that he did identify those “good reasons” why the evidence may have been unreliable. 
      
       
        
       
     50   Section 165 of the Evidence Act identifies various categories of evidence “of a kind that may be unreliable”. Those categories include hearsay evidence (s 165(1)(a)) and evidence of complaint falls within that description. 
      
       
        
       
     51   Section 165(2) provides: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          (2) 
           If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:  
          
         
         
          
          (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and  
          
         
         
          
          (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and  
          
         
         
          
          (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.” 
          
         
        
       
     52   Section 165(3) provides: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          (3) 
           The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.”  
          
         
        
       
     53   In my opinion, the request of counsel sufficed to activate sub-s (2) so as to require the judge to give appropriate warning and information, unless there were good reasons for not doing so. 
      
       
        
       
     54   What matters were there that may have caused the evidence of complaint of CM to be unreliable? Mr Fliece suggested a number of matters: 
      
       
        
         
        (i) the lateness of the complaint; 
         
         
        (ii) the fact that it was not made spontaneously but at the prompting of the complainant’s mother. CM’s evidence was: 
         
         
          
           
            
            “Q. Can you tell me how you came to tell someone about it? 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            A. I was in the kitchen with my mum and dad and I was making my brother’s birthday cake and-- 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            Q. So what time of year is this? 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            A. October. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            Q. Do you know what the date was? 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            A. October 18, I told my mum, and then I told mum. Mum asked me ‘[CM], has [the appellant] ever made a pass at you’ and she goes ‘You can tell me the truth’ and then my face went red and I said ‘Yeah’ and she goes ‘Where did he touch you?’ and then I started crying and I couldn’t tell her and she goes ‘Did he touch you on your vagina?’ I said ‘Yes’ and then she started crying and she rang up my nan.” 
            
           
          
         
         
        (iii) there were the different versions of the complaint. CM’s version of what was said to her mother differed from GM’s version, and JM’s version of the complaint was different again. 
         
        
       
     55   By its very nature, evidence of complaint, being hearsay evidence, may be unreliable for a number of reasons expressed in the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission which led to the enactment of the Evidence Act 1995. Those reasons are identified in Uniform Evidence Law by Odgers, 4th ed. at p 413 and may be restated as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “(a) The potential compounding of weakness of perception, memory, narration skills and sincerity when evidence of the fact is given second hand. 
          
         
         
          
          (b) The statement to the witness not be testable by cross-examination. 
          
         
         
          
          (c) The statement made to the witness not being made in a court environment and thus potentially more susceptible to pressures which might result in a false account. 
          
         
         
          
          (d) The statement made to the witness not being made on oath or affirmation in the solemn context of proceedings in court.” 
          
         
        
       
     56   In the present case, consideration (a) applied, in particular but not exclusively, by reason of delay in complaint (as the appellant’s counsel said it did). Consideration (b) did not apply because the complainants were called as witnesses and were accordingly available for cross examination on what they allegedly told others. Consideration (c) applied, in particular but not exclusively, because of the circumstances in which the complaint by CM was made (as counsel for the appellant said it did). Consideration (d) applied to the hearsay evidence of complaint in the circumstances of this case. 
      
       
        
       
     57   Those considerations (a), (c) and (d) should have been the subject of a warning under s 165 unless there were good reasons for a warning not to have been given. I would add that if warning was to be given, I consider it ought to have extended to alerting the jury to the different versions of the complaint. Inconsistencies in a complainant’s evidence as to complaint were considered to require the judge to give a warning under s 165(2) in R v Mayberry [2000] NSWCCA 531: see in particular the judgment of Beazley JA at para 62. 
      
       
        
       
     58   Since the learned judge did not accede to counsel’s submission, the question arises as to whether there were good reasons for his declining to do so. Whilst s 165(3) does not specifically require the judge to whom a request is made to state his reasons for declining it, it is generally desirable that reasons be given: see R v Beattie (1996) 40 NSWLR 155 (in particular at 160), R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 and R v Stanton (unreported, NSWCCA, 24 July 1998). 
      
       
        
       
     59   “Good reasons” may be found elsewhere than in reasons given at the same time as the expression of refusal to warn under s 165(2). Thus in Fernando it was held that it was legitimate to look for what his Honour considered to be good reasons in a judgment delivered elsewhere in the same proceedings: see paras 106-108 of the judgment. 
      
       
        
       
     60   In R v Flood [1999] NSWCCA 198 the trial judge declined to give a warning under s 165, indicating at the time of refusing his intention to direct the jury in his summing up in a particular way. It was held that this was capable of constituting good reasons for not giving a warning in the precise terms of s 165(2). Spigelman CJ, with whose judgment Bell J agreed, said at para 16: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “His Honour does not refer expressly to his power under s165(3) to refrain from giving a warning where ‘there are good reasons for not doing so’. However, his Honour's reference to his intention to direct the jury in his summing-up in a particular way is capable of satisfying this test. In a case such as the present, when the reliability of a single witness is the kernel of the Crown case, the issue of reliability is best handled in the circumstances by detailed directions rather than by the incantation of a statutory formula. This in my opinion is capable of constituting ""good reasons"" for not giving a warning in the precise terms of s165(2).” 
          
         
        
       
     61   Whilst in the present case, the learned trial judge did not state his reasons for refusing to give the warning under s 165, the Crown has submitted that directions were given, the effect of which constituted compliance with the need recognised by s 165(2). 
      
       
        
       
     62   The Crown drew attention to these features of the directions as to complaint set out in para 42 above: 
      
       
        
         
        (i) attention was drawn to the considerable delay in complaint by each complainant; 
         
         
        (ii) the jury was instructed that this could be taken into account in assessing their credibility; 
         
         
        (iii) the jury was instructed that such evidence was  
        “not independent supportive evidence confirmatory of the accused committing the offence or offences”; 
         
         
        (iv) further, the jury was instructed  
        “You must scrutinise the Crown case with great care”. 
         
        
       
     63   To those passages to which the Crown has directly referred may be added another passage in the summing up where the judge emphasised the importance of the complainant’s evidence and the need for careful assessment of it. The jury was given the following direction later in the summing up (SU17): 
      
       
        
         
          
          “You must likewise scrutinise with great care the evidence of [CM]. [CM] is the focal point in the Crown case relating to Charge Two. You must examine with great care and close attention the evidence of [CM]. 
          
         
         
          
          Again if you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt her version of events is truthful and accurate then you acquit the accused. On the other hand if you are satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, of the truth and accuracy of what [CM]’s told you in the witness box it is your obligation to convict the accused, that is to find him guilty.” 
          
         
        
       
     64   Whilst the jury was adequately instructed upon the need for caution in assessing the evidence of the complainant CM and the need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that her version of events was truthful and accurate, the jury was also instructed as to how they could approach the evidence of complaint in their task. The jury was instructed that the complaint evidence could be considered by them “as evidence of the allegation made in the complaint” and also “as evidence of consistency of conduct”. Accordingly, any matter that may have impacted upon the reliability of the complaint evidence assumed significance and it is in this context that the necessity for a warning is to be addressed. 
      
       
        
       
     65   Whilst the jury was told that it was proper to take into account delay in making a complaint in evaluating the evidence of the complainant, the jury was not specifically directed that the complaint evidence may be regarded as unreliable because of those features which I have addressed in paras 54 and 55 above. 
      
       
        
       
     66   I am not satisfied that there were good reasons for the learned judge not to give a warning under s 165(2) which drew attention to the above features in an appropriate way. In a trial of this nature, it may very well be that counsel in address reminded the jury of those features of the evidence, but what counsel may have said in address and what the judge may have said in his summing up by way of reminding the jury of the submissions of counsel, does not substitute for a direction of principle, stated by the judge to be such, in the context of informing the members of the jury of the principles of law which they were required to apply to their deliberations. 
      
       
        
       
     67   I have concluded that this ground of appeal has been established. I do not consider, having regard to the nature of the omission from the summing up, that the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act is applicable. Had relevant instruction been given, the jury may have taken a different view of the complaint evidence, and, in consequence, a different view as to how the complainant’s evidence was to be regarded. It follows that, in my opinion, this conviction cannot stand. 
      
       
        
         
        Ground 4: The verdict of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence 
         
        
       
     68   For the sake of completion, I refer briefly to this ground. 
      
       
        
       
     69   No point was taken that the jury was unreasonable in convicting on the second count when it was unable to agree on the first count. There was an obvious explanation for the absence of agreement on the first count concerning SM. That complainant was unable, with any precision, to say when the offence had been committed, and the jury was reminded in the summing up that the Crown had acknowledged that the appellant had to be acquitted on the first count if the jury was unable to eliminate any real possibility that the offence occurred in 1994. 
      
       
        
       
     70   Mr Fliece did not seek to support ground 4 as a separate ground. It adds nothing to grounds 1-3.  
      
       
        
         
        PROPOSED ORDERS 
         
        
       
     71   I propose the following orders: that the appeal against conviction be allowed and that the conviction and the sentence imposed be quashed. 
      
       
        
       
     72   In view of the fact that the appellant has served the entire minimum term and much of the additional term imposed, an order for a new trial would seem inappropriate and I propose that a judgment and verdict of acquittal be directed to be entered. 
      
       
        
       
     73   SPERLING J: I have read in draft the judgment of Studdert J in this appeal. I agree with the orders proposed by him. With a relatively minor exception, I also agree with his reasons. 
      
       
        
       
     74   The exception is this. His Honour is of the opinion that the warning pursuant to s165 ought to have extended to alerting the jury to the different versions of the complaint (as counsel for the appellant submitted it should have done). 
      
       
        
       
     75   I respectfully disagree. Section 165 applies - as specified in subs (1) - to “evidence of a kind that may be unreliable”. If a party so requests, the judge is to warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable and inform them of the matters that may cause it to be unreliable. 
      
       
        
       
     76   When one looks at the kinds of evidence in subs (1) which are listed as examples of the kinds of evidence to which the section relates, it is apparent that the purpose of the section is to provide the jury with the benefit of the accumulated experience of the judiciary concerning the potential for unreliability associated with some kinds of evidence. 
      
       
        
       
     77   The reasons why one kind of evidence may be unreliable are different from the reasons why another kind of evidence may be unreliable. For example, the reasons why hearsay evidence may be unreliable are different from the reasons why identification evidence may be unreliable, and different again from why evidence from a prison informer may be unreliable. The section is directed to ways in which evidence of various kinds may be unreliable for reasons associated with a particular kind of evidence. 
      
       
        
       
     78   Inconsistency between versions of events is as much a reason why direct evidence of events may be unreliable as it is a reason why hearsay evidence of events may be unreliable. The inconsistency between versions of complaint in the present case was a reason why the evidence of complaint might be unreliable, but it was not a reason associated with the hearsay character of the evidence. 
      
       
        
       
     79   A trial judge should, of course, relate his or her observations to the evidence when giving a warning concerning hearsay evidence pursuant to section 165, specifying how it is that the evidence in question may be unreliable in ways associated with its hearsay character. But the section does not extend to a feature of the evidence which may make the evidence unreliable for other reasons. 
      
       
        
       
     80   In the present case, the trial judge was at liberty to warn the jury that the evidence of complaint might be unreliable in view of the inconsistency between versions, but s165 did not require that to be done. 
      
       
        
       
     81   In Mayberry [2000] NSWCCA 531 Beazley JA (with whom Greg James and Kirby JJ agreed) said at [62]: 
      
       
        
         
          
          Counsel at trial did not seek a direction under s165. However, the inconsistencies in NRD’s evidence, particularly in relation to complaint, were such as required the judge to give a warning which encompassed the type of matters specified in s165(2). In particular, he should have warned the jury the NRD’s evidence may be unreliable, pointed out for them the matters which might cause the evidence to be unreliable and given a warning to the jury of the need for caution in assessing whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
          
         
         
        It was not argued in the present case that such a warning was required otherwise than by operation of s165.  
        Mayberry 
         was not referred to by either side. The present case is, therefore, not a suitable vehicle for reconsideration of what was said in  
        Mayberry 
         concerning the need for a warning where there are inconsistencies in complaint evidence otherwise than by operation of s165.

      Regina v Mark Wayne WARMAN 
     The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of robbery pursuant to s 94 Crimes Act 1900. A further 12 offences were also taken into account on a Form 1. He was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years with a non-parole period of four years. The applicant appeals against the sentence imposed on the grounds that it was manifestly excessive in that (1) the case did not fall into the worst category for the offence; (2) insufficient weight was given to the timely plea of guilty or to the applicant’s remorse and rehabilitation. HELD: (Appeal dismissed):Ground 1: case did not fall into the worst categoryThe present offence was properly categorised as serious in light of the applicant’s prior record and obvious pre-meditation. Robbery is regarded as a serious offence and considerations of deterrence are of special importance. In this case the victim was in a vulnerable position and as such he was entitled to be protected by a consistently firm stand on sentencing. Roberts (1994) 73 A Crim R 306; France NSWCCA 9 July 1992; Thwaites NSWCCA 6 October 1993; Crotty NSWCCA 29 February 1994 applied. Ground 2: Insufficient weight given to applicant’s plea and remorseGiven that the starting point which the sentencing Judge adopted was correct and making full allowance for the early plea, the contrition displayed by the applicant and professed change in attitude, there was no error of law in the sentence imposed. Proposed Orders(1) Leave to appeal granted.(2) Appeal dismissed.

       JUDGMENT 
       
        
     1   WOOD CJ AT CL: On 3 April 2000 the applicant pleaded guilty at Penrith District Court to one court of robbery pursuant to s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900. For that offence, taking into account twelve further offences pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, he was sentenced by Robison DCJ to imprisonment for seven years with a non-parole period of four years. He was now seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
     2   While accepting that the ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence appropriately reflected the special circumstances that were found to exist, it was submitted that the sentence as a whole was manifestly excessive upon the bases that: 
      
      (a) the case did not fall into the worst category attracting a sentence in the upper range, and that 
       
      (b) insufficient weight was given to the timely plea of guilty, or to the applicant's remorse and genuine desire for rehabilitation. 
       
       These grounds need to be considered in the light of the facts of the offence and in light of the subjective circumstances presented to, and found, by his Honour. 
       
      Facts 
       
       At about 7.40pm on 24 September 1999, the victim of the robbery left the service station, of which he was the owner/operator, to drive home. He had with him a brief case containing the days takings as well as a change bag. The total amount which he was carrying was between $2,000 and $3,600. The applicant followed him home from the service station. When he alighted from his vehicle the applicant grabbed him by the shirt and instructed him to ""open up."" The applicant seized the briefcase and ran away with it. He was arrested in the early hours of the following morning at his home, where a considerable quantity of cash was found. These facts give rise to the charged offence of robbery. 
       
       The further offences taken into account included two offences of shop lifting, four offences involving the forgery, uttering or possession of forged prescriptions, one offence of possession of house breaking implements, one offence of goods in possession, one offence of break, enter and steal, one offence of larceny, one offence of driving a motor vehicle whilst under the influence of a cocktail of drugs and one offence of driving a motor vehicle while unlicensed. 
       
      Subjective circumstances 
      . 
       
      The following subjective circumstances were shown to exist. 
       
      (a) when he appeared for sentence the applicant was aged 33 years; 
       
      (b) he had an extensive criminal history both as an adult and a juvenile, including multiple convictions for serious driving offences, goods in custody, break, enter and steal, possession of house breaking implements, false pretences, forgery and uttering, larceny, receiving, assault, escape lawful custody, malicious damage and shoplifting; 
       
      (c) as a result, he had spent in excess of 13 years of his life in custody, some portions of that period of custody relating to offences similar to those included in the Form 1.  
       
      (d) the offences encompassed in the Form 1 and the offence charged occurred, with the exception of one matter that had been outstanding on a warrant, between 14 July 1999 and 24 September 1999, the first within four weeks of his last release from gaol. 
       
      (e) he had a long-standing drug habit. 
       
      (f) he had not previously been motivated to undertake rehabilitation, regarding gaol as an easier option, and having relapsed following his earlier releases from prison, when he had run into his old friends. 
       
      (g) he had very limited education and work experience. 
       
      (h) Mr Warwick John Taylor assessed his potential to reoffend to be quite high and thought him to have a personality disorder with anti social and passive-aggressive characteristics, and also assessed him to have a high predisposition towards substance abuse.  
       
      (i) when giving evidence on sentence he asserted that he was tired of going to gaol, that he felt he had matured, and wanted now to go into rehabilitation; 
       
       
      (j) he had been assessed as suitable for entry into the Bridge rehabilitation programme conducted by the Salvation Army, when he was eventually released to parole; 
       
       
      (k) while in custody he had been making some progress with education classes. 
       
     3   His Honour accepted the applicant's evidence concerning the genuineness of his desire to take a turn for the better and found special circumstances justifying the considerable reduction of the non-parole period, to one representing a ratio of fifty-seven per cent of the head sentence, so as to allow for an extended period of post release supervised rehabilitation. His Honour also expressly took into account the applicant's contrition and the early plea of guilty. 
     4   In submitting that his Honour had set the bar too high for an offence of robbery, counsel placed some reliance upon the Judicial Commission statistics, which would tend to show that, from a sample of 323 offenders, only ten had received sentences in excess of seven years, and only three had received sentences of eight years for the offence of robbery. Additionally, counsel invited a comparison with the guideline range, for the sentencing of those convicted of the more serious offence of armed robbery, that was suggested by the Court in Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. He did, however, accept that several of the applicant's characteristics, notably those concerning his age, his lengthy criminal history and the degree of pre-meditation involved in the robbery, were more serious than the characteristics posited for the guideline.  
     5   The comparison invited with Henry was, in my view, of limited assistance, particularly having regard to the fact that, for the offence under consideration in Henry, the narrow range in the guideline was said to be a starting point and that aggravating or mitigating circumstances would justify a sentence above or below that range.  
     6   Reliance upon the sentencing statistics was also, in my view, of limited value. Those figures have a use as background information. However their over use, particularly without regard to the infinite variations in the objective and the subjective circumstances of the cases upon which they are based, can be dangerous, particularly if the outcome derogates from an otherwise correct exercise of the sentencing discretion: see Yin (Muoi) NSWCCA 30 November 1998 and see also Bayeh (Louis) [1999] NSWCCA 82. 
     7   The present offence was, in my view, properly categorised as serious, in light of the applicant's prior record, which disclosed a long standing attitude of disobedience of the law and in light of the obvious pre-meditation that was present. The Crown case was also a strong one, in view of the identification of the offender, as the applicant, by the victim and by another witness. 
     8   It is the fact that robbery is regarded as a very serious offence: Roberts (1994) 73 A Crim R 306 at 309, and that considerations, of deterrence are of special importance: France NSWCCA 9 July 1992. The present victim was in a vulnerable position having regard to the likelihood that, as the operator of the service station, it could be expected that he would need to carry the day’s takings with him. As such he was entitled to be protected by a consistently firm stand on sentencing: Thwaites NSWCCA 6 October 1993 and Crotty NSWCCA 29 February 1994. 
     9   Had the criminality in the present case been confined to a single offence of robbery, and had the applicant's record not been so extensive, then there would have been good reason for questioning the length of the total term, particularly, since it was a case attracting a discount in the upper range of that considered appropriate for a timely plea in Thomson v. Houlton (2000) NSWCCA 309 at par 160, a decision which was not available to his Honour.  
     10   However, the applicant here was to be sentenced for the total criminality involved in the offence charged and in the Form 1 matters: see Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 372; and also upon the basis that he had demonstrated himself to be a recidivist who had displayed no previous interest whatsoever in rehabilitation. 
     11   So far as totality was concerned, this Court in Dawson (2000) NSWCCA 399 and again in Lemene (2001) NSWCCA 5, made it clear that an additional penalty must be expected when an accused asks that further offences be taken into account on a Form 1, albeit that such additional penalty will be less than would have been imposed had separate charges been prosecuted.  
     12   For these reasons, the submission concerning the starting point which his Honour might be assumed to have adopted before the reduction for the timely plea, and for the contrition and rehabilitation prospects, loses force. As against the maximum available sentence of fourteen years, and making full allowance for the early plea, for the contrition displayed by the applicant, and for his professed change in attitude, I am unable, in the circumstances outlined, to detect any error of law in the total sentence imposed. 
     13   Whether the applicant has truly reached the cross roads has yet to be seen. Hopefully, as his Honour found, that will be the case. However, so far as his Honour gave him the benefit of the doubt in this regard, that seems to me to have been amply demonstrated in the reduced non-parole period.  
     14   I would, accordingly, grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal.15   SULLY J: I agree.16   WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will be as I have proposed.

       REGINA v LEE-ANNE KEHOE 
        
       REGINA v KARL WERNER OTTO 
        
       
      
      
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1    HANDLEY JA: The Court has before it appeals by Karl Werner Otto and Lee-Anne Kehoe from their convictions by the jury following a trial before Viney DCJ in the District Court at Port Macquarie which commenced on 18 August 1999. There is also before the Court another appeal by Karl Werner Otto from his conviction by the jury following his trial before Coolahan DCJ on two of the counts of the second indictment. 
     2     In the first trial the appellants were convicted of charges of a sexual nature. It is not necessary for the purposes of these reasons to go into the detail. Three counts arose from an incident involving both appellants in the back of a Bedford van which the appellant and his de facto wife, Ms Kehoe, are alleged to have driven into the bush. They then got into the back of the van with the girls where the acts of indecency occurred. The events were alleged to have taken place up to six and a half years before the trial before Viney DCJ. Other counts involved acts of sexual intercourse of one kind or another which involved only one of the three girls allegedly involved in the first three counts. 
     3     The principal grounds of appeal in both cases relate to the discovery of fresh evidence following their conviction and sentence. The Crown had led background evidence at the trial before Viney DCJ to establish the nature of the relationship between the girls and both accused and, in particular, the accused Karl Werner Otto. The three girls involved in the first three counts were the twins, KH and MH, and a friend, AP. The person involved in the remaining counts was AP. 
     4    The Crown led background relationship evidence from each of the girls which indicated the nature of their dealings with the two accused over a considerable period of time. This involved visits to their home and contact including play acting, wrestling and massaging. There was also oral evidence from each of the girls that on one occasion the accused had videoed them, in their own words ""chucking a brown eye"", which involved them dropping their clothes, bending over and presenting their buttocks to the camera. KH and AP said they did this at the suggestion of the accused, Karl Werner Otto. The third girl, MH, did not give evidence of any suggestion from him. 
     5     Each of the girls adhered to their evidence in cross-examination and said that this behaviour only occurred once in the house of the accused. KH in particular was quite certain that there was only one such incident. 
     6     During the second trial the sister of Lee-Anne Kehoe discovered a video film at their home which showed that the three girls, with another girl present, had indeed behaved as they said they did in the first trial when the male accused was not in the house. One of the girls operated the video camera and the behaviour had taken place spontaneously as a result of their discussions among themselves. This film entirely supported the evidence which the accused had given at the first trial denying any involvement in the incident. It also showed either that the girls' recollections were seriously astray or that they had deliberately lied when they implicated the male accused in this conduct. 
     7     This evidence was used to powerful effect in the cross-examination of the girls who were called to give evidence about this filming incident which was the subject of the first three counts in the second trial. Two of the girls did not claim that the male accused had incited them to behave in this way and the trial Judge directed verdicts of acquittal on the counts relating to them. 
     8     A third count involving AP, which was supported by her evidence, was left to the jury who acquitted the accused. The video was introduced during the evidence of KH who initially maintained her evidence-in-chief and rejected the suggestion that the girls had behaved in this way without any involvement by the male accused. After she was shown the film she agreed that the film recorded the only incident in which the girls had ""chucked a brown eye"". The other two girls, AP and MH, were recalled, after viewing the video overnight, to give further evidence-in-chief and they then claimed for the first time that there was a second such incident which involved the accused.  
     9     The jury acquitted the accused on the only charge involving this incident left for their determination. 
     10    In my judgment this video was fresh evidence. On the accuseds’ instructions there was no such video and no occasion for them to search for it. The video that was ultimately discovered by accident only involved them because it was recorded on their camera and in their house. 
     11    This evidence is cogent. It was not capable of being directly challenged. It was objective and independent. It totally supported the relevant evidence given by the male accused at the first trial and effectively destroyed the relevant evidence given by the three girls. In every other respect the evidence at the first trial involved the oaths of one or more of the girls against the oaths of one or more of the accused. 
     12    The evidence of the girls in support of the first three counts in the first trial which involved the incidents in the van was inconsistent. In view of the lapse of time before the first complaint, there would necessarily be concern about convictions based upon conflicting prosecution evidence where the accused gave sworn evidence to the contrary and there was no corroboration. 
     13    The importance of the video evidence is that this is one very clear instance where, to put it at its lowest, the evidence and recollection of the male accused was shown to be completely correct and the evidence and recollection of the three girls was shown to be completely wrong in so far as it implicated the male accused. 
     14    In light of this fresh evidence there is no alternative but to order that the appeals on those three counts be allowed and the convictions of the two accused quashed. No jury properly directed could, in my judgment, have failed to have a reasonable doubt as to the charges on the three counts relating to the incidents in the van. 
     15    The other counts concern only AP and her evidence was not corroborated as to any of the essential ingredients of the offences. It is simply a case of her evidence against the evidence of the male accused. 
     16    Having regard to the video evidence no jury properly directed and properly approaching their task could have failed to have a reasonable doubt about the evidence of AP relating to those other offences. 
     17    The appropriate course for this Court is to allow the appeals and enter verdicts of acquittal in favour of both appellants in relation to the convictions at the first trial. 
     18    The only accused at the second trial was Karl Werner Otto. He was acquitted either by direction or by the jury in relation to the counts based on the video incident. He was convicted by the jury on count six which involved digital penetration of the girl, KH, at a time when, according to her evidence, she and two other girls were lying under some bed clothes with the accused each of them lying on their left hand side. In that situation, KH said she had been interfered with digitally by the accused. 
     19    Count ten involved another girl, RB, who had not been the subject of any of the counts at the first trial or any of the other counts in the second trial. I will deal with this count separately in a moment. 
     20    So far as count six involving KH is concerned, her evidence was not corroborated by the other two girls who she said were with her and the accused on the occasion in question. They do not even give evidence that the four of them were lying under the bed clothes together at or about the time specified in this charge. 
     21    The accused denied being in that situation, that is, being on the bed in daylight hours with three girls under the bed clothes and, as I said, the other two girls do not corroborate KH's evidence that the four of them were together in that situation.  
     22    The conviction, therefore, depends upon the uncorroborated evidence of KH against the evidence of the accused. There was no evidence of a recent complaint and it was simply a case of oath against oath. The jury would have to consider the evidence of the complainant very carefully before they could convict. 
     23    The jury which convicted on count six had before it the evidence of KH in chief and in cross-examination in which she initially had said, with apparent certainty, that there was only one such incident and that she had acted as she did with the encouragement of the accused. This evidence was shown to be false and whether this was faulty recollection, some form of confusion, or deliberate lying and embellishment of an incident which did not involve the accused at all, does not matter. 
     24    I fail to see how any jury, approaching the task in the manner as directed by Coolahan DCJ, could have failed to have a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused on count six. 
     25    I would, therefore, allow the appeal in relation to that count and enter a verdict of acquittal. 
     26    The remaining count involved another girl, RB, who, as I said, had not given evidence or been involved in any of the other incidents the subject of the first and second trials. She herself did not give evidence of immediate complaint but both the accused and Lee-Anne Kehoe gave evidence of an immediate complaint by RB of inappropriate sexual handling by the male accused. The incident is alleged to have occurred during some friendly wrestling activity. So far as the core elements of the offence are concerned, it is indeed another case of oath against oath. However on this occasion there is evidence of immediate complaint. There is also evidence of an immediate physical reaction which was observed by Naomi Griffiths who saw RB punch the accused on the arm as she entered the room having heard the noise of a scuffle. 
     27    The accused said he had applied a fireman's grip to RB and lifted her up on to his shoulder. So much is common ground. However, RB said, in the course of doing this, his hand touched her vaginal area through her clothes. The accused said that if any such contact did take place his arm only was involved.  
     28    This was very much a jury question. Important aspects of the evidence of the complainant were corroborated and the jury had, uniquely in these two trials, evidence of immediate prompt and public complaint. RB was not implicated in any false or inaccurate evidence about the video incident. 
     29    I have not been persuaded that the verdict on count ten was in any way unsafe or unsatisfactory. 
     30    Miss Mundey suggested that the accused suffered a serious disadvantage in the trial before Coolahan DCJ when his convictions at the trial before Viney DCJ still stood which prevented him from calling what she described as character evidence which may have been relevant on count ten and may have enabled him to secure an acquittal on that count. The Court has not been provided with any affidavits setting out the evidence that might have been called. Moreover Naomi Griffiths, one of the Crown witnesses, was cross-examined by Miss Mundey to establish that she had not observed any inappropriate conduct or language between the male accused and either herself or any of the other young girls who were present from time to time in the home. No application was made to the Judge in the absence of the jury for a ruling which would have allowed the defence to call this evidence without the accused being subject to cross-examination on his prior convictions from the first trial. 
     31    I have not been persuaded that there is any substance in this ground which should cause this Court to order a new trial on count ten. In my judgment, therefore, the appeal against the conviction on this count fails and should be dismissed. 
     32    It will be necessary for the Court to re-sentence the appellant, Karl Werner Otto, but this can be done after the other judgments have been delivered.33    IPP AJA: I agree.34    GREG JAMES J: I also agree.35    HANDLEY JA: The orders of the Court are as I have indicated. 
     36    Karl Werner Otto is sentenced to a fixed term of one month on count ten to commence on 24 August 1999. As a result of his acquittals on the other counts, the Court orders his immediate release.******

      Regina v Shane Christopher HAWKER 
     The applicant pleaded guilty to nine offences of obtaining money by deception under s 178BA Crimes Act 1900 and asked that a further thirty-five matters be taken into account. He was sentenced to a total of six years of imprisonment with a non-parole period of three and a half years. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences on the grounds that the total sentencing order fell outside the proper range for the offences involved. HELD: (Appeal dismissed):Ground 1: sentence fell outside the proper rangeThere is a danger is endeavouring to extract a “range” from a limited group of decisions on appeal, or from bare sentencing statistics. Greater assistance is to be derived by general sentencing policy, which has seen something of a hardening of attitude towards white collar crime. It is now generally accepted that, absent very special circumstances, criminality of this character, particularly that which demonstrates blatantly dishonest conduct, with no regard to the propriety of the transaction or their consequences, will normally require a significant element of general deterrence. In the instant case there were aggravating circumstances due to the amount of money involved in the offence, and the criminality involved was “considerable”. Corner (John Stewart) NSWCCA 19 December 1997; Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328; Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 applied. Proposed Orders(1) Leave to appeal granted.

      REGINA V SHANE HAWKER 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
     1   WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant, together with his co-accused, Craig Sundstrom, appeared in the District Court for sentence on 14 August 2000, in relation to a series of offences under S178 BA of the Crimes Act 1900. The applicant added to his plea of guilty nine such offences, and asked that a further thirty-five matters be taken into account. The co-accused pleaded guilty to ten such offences and asked that a further eighty-three matters be taken into account. 
     2   As a consequence each was sentenced, effectively to a total term of imprisonment of six years, with an effective non-parole period of three-and- a half years. In the case of the applicant this was made up by concurrent sentences for fixed terms each of two years, in relation to the first four counts in the indictment, and by sentences each of four years for the remaining five counts to be served cumulatively upon the fixed terms, but concurrently with one another. A non parole period of one and a half years was fixed to commence at the expiry of the fixed terms.  
     3   His Honour came to this sentencing order by reason that the objective criminality of the co-accused was greater than that of the applicant, and that in his case a starting point of ten years was appropriate for his total criminality, which he reduced by twenty-five per cent for his plea of guilty, to one of seven and a half years. He further reduced that term by one and a half years for the assistance he had given, to produce a total sentence of six years. 
     4   In relation to the applicant the starting point was one of eight years, to reflect his lesser criminality. This was similarly reduced by twenty-five per cent for the plea of guilty to a total sentence of six years. He was not entitled to any further discount for assistance. 
     5   In assessing parity his Honour reached the conclusion that there was nothing to distinguish between the two offenders in terms of their ages, backgrounds, education, employment and motivation attributable to an addiction to gambling. Special circumstances were found in relation to each offender, referable to their age, the fact that this was a first occasion of imprisonment for them, their favourable prospects of rehabilitation, and the need for guidance and supervision to foster their assimilation back into the community. As a consequence, the non parole period was reduced to equate to fifty-eight per cent of the total sentence. 
     6   The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences upon the basis that the total sentencing order fell outside the range for offences of dishonesty of the kind here involved.  
     7   It was submitted this morning that the proper range in the case of the applicant was one attracting a head sentence of four to five years with a non-parole period of two to two and a half years. 
      
       
      Facts 
       
     8   The applicant lent himself to a simple but cunning system of dishonesty to which he was introduced by his co-accused, and which was practised by them over the period between December 1995 and February 1999. At the time of inception of the scheme, each was an employee of the Commonwealth Bank. The applicant had a staff housing loan account with the bank, into which he made repayments on his loan. The account was so structured as to allow payments over and above the normal mortgage instalments to be credited to it. They were then available for withdrawal, upon application to the Staff Housing Loan section of the bank, where the co-accused worked.  
     9   A flaw, however, existed in the system which the co-accused discovered and which he and the applicant then utilised to draw down sums in the order of $1.2m, over the period in question. This involved the co-accused entering false information onto the bank’s records to the effect that a special repayment had been made against the applicant’s housing loan, when in fact, no such payment had been made. 
     10   This placed the housing loan account in funds, and it was a simple matter thereafter for the credited moneys to then be drawn from that account, and credited to the applicant’s personal account. The moneys fraudulently acquired in this way, and received by the applicant over the period in question, amounted to about $560,000, while those received by the co-accused amounted to about $730,000. In the case of each offender, the funds so acquired were dissipated through gambling. 
     11   Their activities came to light during an internal investigation which led to the co-accused being suspended or dismissed. He immediately confessed his guilt and produced a witness statement in which he undertook to give evidence against the applicant. At the outset, the applicant declined to be interviewed, as he was entitled to do. Subsequently, after discussions between his legal advisers and the Director of Public Prosecutions, he elected to plead guilty to the various offences, each of which involved that of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception. By the time when all of the offences came to light the applicant had left the bank. This occurred in March 1997, by which time the flaw had been dishonestly utilised, it would appear, on about seven occasions. Notwithstanding his resignation, the scheme did not come to an end at that point. The applicant knowingly allowed it to continue for a lengthy period hereafter and he benefited from it in so far as he obtained funds to which he was not entitled, and with which he could continue his gambling activities. 
     12   The applicant has made reparations in the sum of $12,500. The co-accused has repaid some $186,000. 
     13   In support of the submission that the sentencing order was out of the range, reference was made to a number of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, and they are identified in the schedule to this judgment. They were said to support a submission, firstly, that a sentence involving a non-prole period in the order of three and a half years or more for offences of the kind before the Court was outside the range and, secondly, that his Honour had erred in selecting a starting point for the co-accused which was too high, and which he had then carried forward when sentencing the applicant. 
     14   It was also submitted by counsel that this was not a case involving the abuse by the appellant of his position as an employee of the bank. Rather it was submitted that the offences involved his participation in a scheme of deception that was practised by his co-accused, who throughout was an employee of the bank, and in a position where he was able to and did manipulate its affairs. So, it was submitted, the present case did not involve, on the applicant’s part, a breach of trust or a breach of duty of employment of the kind that categorised the various cases that were cited in the schedule. 
     15   This, in my view, is to split hairs. The occasion for the offences initially arose by reason of the applicant’s employment with the bank and it involved the use of the accounts which he held with it. The applicant knew of, connived in, encouraged and profited from the egregious reaches of duty and trust owed by the co-accused for their mutual benefit. His participation in allowing his loan account and personal account to be used was as important for the deception as was the activity of the co-accused in manipulating the records of the bank. 
     16   The applicant was in a position throughout to understand the ramifications of what was occurring. In those circumstances I can see no reason, either in principle or in common sense, to differentiate between them, or to require a different approach from that considered in the cases cited in the schedule. 
     17   There is a danger in endeavouring to extract a “range” from a limited group of decisions on appeal, or from sentencing statistics. Some of the cases here selected by the applicant were Crown appeals in which the principle of double jeopardy or that relating to special discretion attaching to Crown appeals, were applicable. Others were cases involving quite different objective and subjective considerations, a well as differing sums of money. Some involved offenders such as solicitors or others holding fiduciary office or positions of trust, and others of which involved employees of no great seniority. In some instances, the offences were relatively simple and of short duration, and in other cases they were complex and prolonged. 
     18   The need for care in attempting any such comparison as that suggested here was recently underlined by Spigelman CJ in Slater [2001] NSWCCA 65 at paras 50-52. Moreover, while reference to cases of similar character can be helpful as a guide, those selected are by no means a comprehensive survey of sentences imposed, either upon appeal or at first instance, for serious instances s 178BA offences. Nor is it clear upon which basis they were selected. 
     19   Indeed, not all of the cases cited support the applicant’s proposition as to the appropriate range, since those of O’Neill, Smith, Pantano, Corbett and Sellen, produced either comparable or longer sentences than that imposed upon the appellant. 
     20   So far as reference to comparable cases involving employees may, however, be of assistance to the resolution of the present appeal, subject to the qualifications previously noted, that of O’Neill justifies mention. There, a payroll supervisor of a large company, admittedly with a prior income of dishonesty, received a head sentence of ten years with a minimum term of six years for a series of offences committed over three years and involving a sum of $1,063,000. 
     21   Additionally, the recent case of Tripodina (2001) NSWCCA 136, is in point. There an employee with favourable subjective circumstances, who defrauded his employer of some $96,000, by directing cheques ostensibly payable to creditors to his own use, over a four year period, to support a gambling habit, had an appeal against a head sentence of six and a half years, with a non parole period of four and a half years, dismissed. The Court there also confirmed that an accumulation of sentences was appropriate, since the imposition of concurrent sentences, in a case involving continuing criminality of the kind seen there, and in the present case, would not adequately reflect the criminality involved. 
     22   The circumstance that a number of offences were here taken into account on a Form 1, also meant that there had to be some increase in the sentence, although not as great as might have been the case had those offences been the subject of separate charge: Dawson (2000) NSWCCA 399 AND Lemene (2001) NSWCCA 5. 
     23   In my view, greater assistance is to be derived by reference to general sentencing policy which has seen something of a hardening attitude to white collar crime in view of its difficulty of detection, and in view of the fact that its impact may fall upon a wider group of investors or creditors: Pont [2000] NSWCCA 419. Particularly has this been recognised in cases involving fraud on the revenue, or on Commonwealth agencies such as those involved in the administration of the Social Security System or the Medicare system: see e.g. Farrell NSW CCA 22 November 1996, Whitney NSWCCA 6 June 1997, Stitt NSW CCA 8 September 1998, and White NSW CCA 20 August 1998. 
     24   It is now generally accepted that absent very special circumstances, crime of this character, particularly that which demonstrates blatantly dishonest conduct, with no regard to the propriety of the transactions or their consequences, will normally require a significant element of general deterrence: Corner (John Stewart) NSW CCA 19 December 1997, and Pantano (19909) 49 A Crim R 328, where I observed: 
      
       
        
        “As was observed in  
        McKechnie ( 
        CCA 1 October 1987, unreported) those involved in serious white collar crime must expect condign sentences. The commercial world expects executives and employees in positions of trust, no matter how young they may be, to conform to exacting standards of honesty. It is impossible to be unmindful of the difficulty of detecting sophisticated crime of the kind here involved or of the possibility for substantial financial loss by the public. Executives and trusted employees who give way to temptation cannot pass the blame to lax security on the part of management. The element of general deterrence is an important element of sentencing for such offences:  
        Glennister 
         (1980) 2 NSWLR 597 9AT 330.” 
        
       
       
     25   In the instant case there were aggravating circumstances in that large amounts of money were involved: see Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 and Jalaty CCA NSW 2 April 1997; and in that the offences occupied a period and involved a deliberate and systematic deception of the bank in excess of three years : Tyneth NSWCCA NSW 25 November 1994. 
     26   The criminality of the applicant was appropriately described by the sentencing judge as ‘considerable’ and deserving of ‘appropriately salutary punishment.” I wholeheartedly agree with those comments, and I am unable to see any error in the most comprehensive and careful reasons on sentence which were delivered by his Honour..  
     27   In my view, the sentences imposed were entirely within the permissible range. I would grant leave to appeal, but would dismiss the appeal. 
     28   SULLY J: I agree. 
     29   WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will, therefore, be as I have proposed.

      Regina v Khaled KHALED 
     The applicant pleaded guilty to having supplied a quantity heroin on three separate occasions within a thirty day period, contrary to s 25A Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. The analysts’ certificate showed that the quantities of heroin involved in the sale were less than that assessed by the sentencing Judge.The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence on the grounds that (1) the sentencing Judge erred in relation to the assessment of the quantity of drugs involved; (2) the sentence was manifestly excessive. HELD: (Appeal dismissed):Ground 1: his Honour erred in relation to assessment of quantity of drugs It may be accepted that the quantity of the drug is a relevant consideration in sentencing, however, this is not the only consideration. In determining an appropriate penalty for offences under s 25A Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act it is relevant to consider the magnitude of the operation or dealing. It is important to give full effect to the legislative policy of the section so as to provide a strong deterrent for those who may otherwise become involved in such activity. Sirocic [2000] NSWCCA 447; Smiroldo [2000] NSWCCA 120 applied. Ground 2: the sentence was manifestly excessiveThe sentencing Judge’s conclusion that the applicant had reached a stage of his life where he may be able to overcome his drug additcion, was not supported by the evidence. The applicant had convictions for a series of drug and drug related offences, which showed a continuing disregard for the law. The applicant had also committed the current offence while on parole, a fact seemingly overlooked by the sentencing Judge, which was a circumstance of considerable aggravation and should have been taken into account. While the sentencing proceedings were marred by a factual error concerning the quantity of drugs involved, there was a significant counter-balance of error, such that no amendment of the sentence was warranted. Proposed Orders(1) Leave to appeal granted.(2) Appeal dismissed.

       REGINA v KHALED KHALED  
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
     1   WOOD CJ at CL: On 24 March 2000, the applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Moore to four years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of two years for an offence of having supplied heroin on three separate occasions within a thirty-day period, contrary to s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. This is an offence for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for twenty years. To that offence he had pleaded guilty when arraigned.  
     2   He now seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence upon two grounds:  
      
      (a) that his Honour erred in relation to the assessment of the quantity of drugs involved; and 
       
      (b) the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      Facts 
       
     3   The facts, as recorded by his Honour in his reasons for sentence somewhat briefly, disclosed a sale by the applicant to an undercover operative on 11 August 1999 of a quantity of heroin, which he found to have been .2 of a gram, in exchange for $100; a similar sale on 19 August 1999; and a third sale on the same date, this time of two packets of heroin, the quantity of which his Honour did not mention, but which was also handed over in exchange for $100.  
     4   His Honour either overlooked, or did not pay sufficient attention to the material tendered on sentence, so far as he erroneously found that the first two deals each involved .2 of a gram of heroin. The analyst's certificate, which was in evidence before him, showed that the quantities respectively involved in the three sales were 0.10gm, 0.05gm and 0.04gm, totalling 0.19gm. That factual error, which is relied upon by the applicant as one of his grounds of appeal, has been conceded by the Crown. It is, accordingly, appropriate that leave to appeal be granted and that this Court then reconsider the matter in order to determine in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, whether some sentence other than that imposed was warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     5   The very brief findings made by his Honour, in relation to the circumstances in which the offences occurred, did not address the further facts that: 
      
      (a) the first sale was made by the applicant in the gaming room of an hotel in Crown Street, Wollongong and involved the supply of two packets of heroin;  
       
      (b) the second sale was, at least, initiated outside the methadone clinic in Wollongong and was effected after the applicant asked the undercover operative to place $100 in an envelope which he was carrying. The applicant then took the operative to the side of some nearby premises, where he cut two small pieces of heroin from a larger rock which he had concealed in his pants, and placed them onto a piece of foil held by the operative;  
       
      (c) the third sale was, at least, similarly initiated outside the methadone clinic. The undercover operative was taken on this occasion by the applicant to the railway station toilets. There he cut from a larger rock two deals, which he again placed into the foil held by the operative. After doing this, he handed a quantity of cash to an associate, ""Speedy"", who had come into the toilet area.  
       
     6   When interviewed by the police, the applicant, as he was entitled to do, made no admissions. Again as he was entitled to do, he did not give any evidence when he appeared for sentence. 
     7   In sentencing the applicant, his Honour observed at one point, that the applicant was dealing for the purpose of feeding an addiction. Somewhat contradictorily, his Honour later observed that ""immediately prior to the commission of this offence, he was performing extremely well by not abusing drugs ..."" These two passages cannot stand together and, in any event, I can find no evidentiary support for the second observation either in the pre-sentence report or in the report from Anna Robilliard, or elsewhere. 
     8   His Honour also came to a conclusion, for which I can see no proper support in the evidence, that the applicant had ""reached a stage in his life where there are real indications that with substantial support he may wean himself from his addiction"". 
     9   The evidence, in my view, pointed in the opposite direction. The applicant had an extensive criminal history, which commenced in 1983 in the Children's Court, and contained multiple convictions for drug offences, including convictions for supply offences in November 1983, January 1986, August 1986 and May 1998, quite apart from numerous convictions for use and possession.  
     10   In relation to two of those supply convictions, it is appropriate to note that, on 13 August 1986, he was sentenced to a term of four years and six months penal servitude with a non-parole period of two years and two months. It is also appropriate to note that following appeal in relation to the other of these two matters, he was sentenced in the Wollongong District Court, on 23 June 1998, to a minimum term of nine months and to an additional term of one year and three months for six counts of supply prohibited drug. Accordingly, he could not have been ignorant of the seriousness with which courts regard drug supply offences. 
     11   The applicant also had convictions for offences of break, enter and steal, receiving, robbery in company and goods in custody. His record was in these circumstances anything but a good record, in that it showed a continuing disregard for the law particularly that relating to the use of and the dealing in narcotics.  
     12   At the time of the offence before the Court, the applicant was in fact on parole for a drug supply offence, a matter that was seemingly overlooked by his Honour since he made no mention of it, even though it was a circumstance of significant aggravation which should have been taken into account: Vranic NSWCCA 7 May 1991, and Moffit (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 per Badgery-Parker J at 128. 
     13   Moreover, in July 1999 the applicant broke off contact with the Probation & Parole Service, apparently out of pique when the Parole Board refused his request to be allowed to travel to Lebanon. The report of that Service noted that while he had continued his attendance at the methadone clinic, which had helped him to stabilise his position and to, at least, reduce his use of heroin, he had ""maintained regular association with former or current drug users and seems unable or unwilling to break away"".  
     14   The report of Ms Robilliard did not paint a particularly favourable picture, either so far as it noted that he had a long history of drug dependence and a parallel history of related criminal offences. She observed additionally that he displayed a ""markedly anti-social"" personality. The most favourable aspects of this report related to the fact that he was on methadone maintenance and was participating in counselling while in custody, that he had a ""valued relationship"" with Tabatha Sharp, who his Honour sentenced at the same time for related drug offences, and that his criminal antecedents did not include violent behaviour. 
     15   The cautious opinion Ms Robilliard offered was that, ""Given his current relationship commitment and his willingness to undertake counselling, he may be able to cope this time."" That was, however, as far as it went and neither this report nor the pre-sentence report support the unduly optimistic findings of his Honour, concerning the subjective circumstances of the applicant. 
     16   Returning to the objective criminality of the applicant and to the objective findings of his Honour, it may be accepted that quantity is a relevant consideration: Sirocic [2000] NSW CCA 447 per Sheller JA at para 15. However, it is not the only consideration, for the various reasons identified by Hulme J in Smiroldo [2000] NSW CCA 120 where his Honour said: 
      
       
        
        ""[15] On the other hand, it would be wrong to look merely at the quantity supplied on the occasions which led to a conviction and attempt to judge an offender's conduct by the quantity and those provisions of the Act which imposed penalties for supply and grade those penalties by reference to quantity. The persons at whom section 25A is directed are those who appear to be indulging in a practice or business of supplying prohibited drugs. It must, it seems to me, be relevant to consider the magnitude of such an operation. As great a quantity of a prohibited drug may be supplied by a series of small transactions as by a few large ones, and one may anticipate that most offenders charged under s 25A will have been involved in the supply of far more than the particular quantities the subject of the occasions which have inspired the charge.  
         
         
        [16] But there are likely to be constraints on how far it is permissible to go in any assessment of any overall quantity supplied in an offender's operation. Any conclusion that he or she had supplied a specific quantity or at least that quantity on occasions other than those relied on in the particular charge would run against the principle for which  
        Regina v DeSimone 
         (1980-1981) 147 CKR 383 is commonly cited that, in sentencing, it is not appropriate to take into account as factors of aggravation, circumstances which would themselves constitute another offence which has not been charged. 
         
         
        [17] However, subject to that qualification, the sentencing judge was entitled to take other matters into account if they bore on the applicant's criminality and which were proved in accordance with the standards referred to in  
        Regina v Olbrick 
         (1999) 73 ALJR 1550."" 
        
       
     17   It is evident in the present case that the applicant was a street dealer, and not a person any higher up in the distribution circles operating within the Wollongong district. Nor was he a person shown to have had access to any great quantity of heroin. It is, however, also clear, even though there was no actual evidence of other sales by him during the relevant thirty-day period, that the sales he made to the undercover operative were not isolated lapses on his part. So much is clear from the fact that he was present in those areas of Wollongong to which drug users are likely to be drawn, from the terms of the product of a listening device that was used in the operation, from the fact that he cut the deals from a larger rock of heroin in his possession, from his delivery of money to ""Speedy,"" and from his earlier record. 
     18   It is precisely to the dealers who engage in this kind of conduct, that s 25A is directed, since it is those persons who keep the pernicious trade in heroin rolling. It may well be that an important part of the policy behind this legislation was to impose significant penalties which exist for those offenders who see it as profitable or prudent to immunise themselves from the significant penalties which exist for dealing in single large quantities, and in particular, by selling small enough deals from a stock warehoused elsewhere. I am unable, however, to accept that the section is to be confined to them. It applies equally to dealers such as the present applicant, who engage in an ongoing trade within the meaning of the section.  
     19   An appropriate differentiation can be drawn between the various classes of offenders to whom the section applies, by reflecting that in sentences towards the upper end of range within the available maximum of twenty years, for the bigger and more organised dealers, and by imposing lesser sentences for those who are at the bottom of the distribution chain. What is important is to give full effect to the legislative policy that this section operate so as to provide strong deterrent to those who may be tempted to engage in an ongoing trade in heroin and, in particular, to deter those who are minded to stand in their shoes once they are apprehended and sentenced to imprisonment. This is necessary to combat the unfortunate reality that there seems to have been an almost endless supply of street sellers willing to move in once others of their ilk are taken off the streets.  
     20   While the sentencing proceedings in this case were marred by factual error, there is significant counter-balancing error. I am not persuaded, after reviewing the subjective and objective circumstances, that any sentence other than that imposed is warranted.  
     21   I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal.22   SULLY J: I agree.23   WOOD CJ at CL: The orders of the Court are as I have passed.

       IPP, AJA. 
       
       GREG JAMES, J. 
      FRIDAY 20 APRIL 2001 
      
      REGINA v. HAN-MING DENG 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   HANDLEY, JA: The court is in a position to give judgment in this matter and I will ask Justice Greg James to give the first judgment. 
     2   GREG JAMES, J: The appellant was convicted after trial in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney of two counts of supplying prohibited drugs, namely, heroin, in an amount in each case not less than the commercial quantity. These are offences under s.25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, each punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years of imprisonment. The first charge was one of actual supply; the second of deemed supply by reason of possession of the quantity of heroin in a car. 
     3   The grounds of appeal argued before us include that the trial judge erred in allowing the evidence of certain conversations between the appellant and police officers at the scene of his arrest and search of a motor-vehicle in which heroin was found. The ground contends that police failed to caution the appellant in a language in which he was reasonably fluent, also that the conversation was prejudicial so that it should have been excluded. 
     4   At the trial there was a voir dire. On the voir dire the conversation was put in evidence, not only through the evidence of police officers but also by the tender of a video of the conversation which became Exhibit E on that voir dire. 
     5   We have seen the video today and have had access to the evidence of the police officers concerned in the conversation. 
     6   On the voir dire the appellant did not give evidence, although he did at the trial. Evidence was, however, given by a former police officer who had known the appellant for some six months in 1996 and who was able to give some evidence concerning the appellant's command of English. There was also evidence from the arresting police officer as to the appellant's command of English at the time of the conversation with him. 
     7   The trial judge published extensive reasons on the voir dire in which she rejected the contentions made here. Both contentions were essentially based, as counsel for the appellant has conceded before us, on the applicability to what had occurred of s.139 of the Evidence Act 1995. That section provides that, for the purposes of s.138(1)(a):- 
      
       
        
        ""… evidence of a statement made or act done by a person during questioning is taken to have been obtained improperly if:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the person was under arrest for the offence at the time; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the question was conducted by an investigating official who was at the time empowered, because of the office that he or she held, to arrest the person; and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) before starting the questioning the investigating official did not caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence."" 
        
       
     8   Section 139(3) reads as follows:- 
      
       
        
        ""The caution must be given in, or translated into, a language in which the person is able to communicate with reasonable fluency, but need not be given in writing unless the person cannot hear adequately"". 
        
       
     9   The submission was made that her Honour fell into error in holding that there had been compliance or sufficient compliance with s.139(3), that in those circumstances s.138 applied, thus the evidence should have been excluded unless the court's discretion to admit it, notwithstanding that it was obtained improperly or in contravention of an Australian law was exercised. It is said the evidence should have been rejected either by that application of s.138 or by reason of the various other provisions of the Evidence Act 1995, the application of which is similarly conceded to turn on the caution point. 
     10   On the voir dire her Honour made the following findings:- 
      
       
        
        ""Taking into account the evidence of Detective O'Connor, but more importantly, taking into account the reasonably extensive conversation in English which I have set out above before any caution was ever administered, I have come to the view that the caution was indeed given in a language in which the accused was able to communicate with reasonable fluency. The caution was not administered in unduly technical terms.... 
        
       
        
       
        
        There is nothing in the terms or the nature of the conversation between the accused and the police prior to the caution, and indeed there is nothing in the conversation between the accused and those police officers who speak to him in the basement of the block of flats which gives rise to any doubt on my part that the accused is incapable of speaking readily in the English language, albeit in fairly basic terms."" 
        
       
     11   She held that the accused's ability to speak and understand the English language by reason of all the conversation which occurred in the course of the accused's arrest both in relation to the actual supply and deemed supply were relevant. It seemed to her to offend common sense to compartmentalise the conversations and access therefore to the entire exchange. From that she concluded that and held that s.139(3) was satisfied. 
     12   In addition, she was of the view that applying the relevant criteria as to the admission and exclusion of that evidence, in the event that her earlier conclusion had been wrong she still would have admitted the evidence. 
     13   Further, she had concluded that there was nothing about what the accused said to the police officers which cast doubt upon the reliability of what he said and that his responses appeared responsive and rational. Nor was there any challenge to the accuracy of the conversation recorded. 
     14   Later in her judgment she said:- 
      
       
        
        ""Nonetheless, it seems to me that the police officers were - and in my view, correctly - operating under the understanding that the accused had comprehended the caution when it was given in relation to the alleged offence of the finding of the heroin in the Nissan vehicle, and that there was no further caution necessary in relation to the finding of the heroin in the Toyota vehicle."" 
        
       
     15   It is contended that in so concluding, her Honour fell into error and did so because she applied a wrong test as to the meaning of the words ""with reasonable fluency"" in the section. She had, for that purpose, examined the Macquarie Dictionary and concluded that, for the purposes of her decision the Macquarie Dictionary definition of ""fluency"" as ""the ability to speak readily"" should be applicable to her construction of the phrase ""with reasonable fluency"". It is contended that that test was in error. 
     16   Whatever may be the appropriate test necessary for precise definition of the terms in the section, her Honour's findings of fact appear to go to the extent of holding that the accused was able to understand in English the caution the police officers gave him. 
     17   In my view the section is purposive. It does not operate on an accused's general language ability. It operates on the ability to understand the concept underlying the caution and the function of a caution. The caution is meant to convey to an arrested person that he/she has the right to choose to speak or to remain silent. It is meant to ensure that the person is aware that if he/she speaks, what he/she says may be given in evidence. 
     18   For my own part, I would conclude that there was an overwhelming case made that this offender did have the relevant understanding communicated to him, particularly when I have regard to what he said and how he acted in the video which has been before us. 
     19   I see no basis upon which I could conclude that there was such an absence of evidence as would show that even any test of greater stringency would require that her Honour, on her findings of fact with which I do not disagree, should have rejected the contention that the caution was adequately administered. 
     20   For my part, I would in those circumstances reject that ground of appeal. 
     21   The further ground that the conversation was prejudicial and equivocal does not seem to have been pressed strongly before us although it is argued in the written submissions. Having regard to the accused's case at the trial, a case which was put by her Honour in the summing-up that the bag containing the heroin was admitted to the police officers by him to be his but which he contended contained rubbish, it would seem to me that her Honour's conclusion in the latter part of her judgment on the voir dire that the admissions should not be excluded on any ground of prejudice was inevitable. 
     22   Another ground was also asserted and that is that her Honour had erred in excluding additional evidence relevant to be tendered on behalf of the accused. 
     23   In the transcript appears a truncated reference to what occurred when the matter was raised. The suggestion was put that a witness would be able to give evidence of a similar drug transaction involving the same vehicle and a similar quantity of heroin in similar packaging at a date which was apparently some five weeks later than the date upon which the heroin was found in the vehicle which event supported the second count of which the appellant was convicted. 
     24   Her Honour applied the test expressed in s.55 of the Evidence Act 1995. She concluded on the information she had that the evidence was inadmissible as lacking any necessary nexus with the facts referable to the offences before the court. 
     25   Before us counsel was unable to supplement the paucity of the material contained in the transcript or derived from her Honour's judgement as to the matter to which the evidence might go. Nothing was provided to us which might make the material any more specific. The argument that was put was that if one might have had access to the vehicle five weeks later and put heroin of that kind in the vehicle that is a matter which would cast light upon who might have had access to the vehicle other than the accused at the time at which the heroin, the subject of the charge, came into the vehicle. But that was not the accused's defence at trial. His defence was not that someone else put the bag in the vehicle, ie, that it was not his bag. Indeed, in his evidence at the trial in chief when he was asked what the police had said and what he said he referred to the police asking him what the substance in the bag was and he said ""rubbish"". 
      
       
        
        ""Q. Could you have used the words just junk""? A. Yes I can."" 
        
       
     26   He was further asked by the police ""Is it yours?"" and said ""yes"" but asserted that he was not talking about drugs at that time but the rubbish he said was in the bag. There was, however, albeit contested, evidence that the term ""junk"" is used to refer to heroin. There was no suggestion of any inappropriateness when her Honour put in the summing-up, the accused's case that he accepted ownership and possession of the bag but not the heroin in it as not a fair and accurate expression of the issues as they were raised at the trial. There was clearly enough at the trial to require examination of the hypothesis that some other person might have somehow caused the heroin to be introduced into the bag but as far as any relevant access to the car was concerned, that was merely a secondary matter and anything concerning access by any of the persons whose identity was suggested as possibly having access to the car on the day of the offence was only relevant to having access to the bag. There was nothing specific to the bag or as to when its contents might have been altered. On such matters, the later incident sought to be given in evidence sheds no light whatsoever. 
     27   In my view, the evidence does not raise a rational connection or have the capability that it might rationally affect directly or indirectly the assessment of the probability of whether the accused had possession of the heroin. 
     28   I see no logical connection which would shed light on that issue or advance the proof of that question so as to make the evidence relevant. 
     29   At most, it might afford something upon which some speculation unrelated to the issues as they were prosecuted at the trial might be raised. 
     30   In those circumstances, I see no basis on which Her Honour fell into error and I would reject the ground of appeal. 
     31   I would conclude then that the appeal should be dismissed. 
     32   HANDLEY, JA: I agree. There are also other grounds which would have supported the ruling of the trial judge that the evidence of an allegedly similar transaction some weeks later was not relevant to the guilt of the accused and was therefore not admissible. 
     33   I agree that the appeal fails and should be dismissed. 
     34   IPP, AJA: I agree. I would simply add two brief comments. One as regards the first ground. In my opinion the phrase ""reasonable fluency"" in s.139(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 means fluency sufficient to enable the person concerned to understand the caution. 
     35   With regard to the second ground, I consider that the later evidence that was not admitted throws no light on how the heroin in the bag which the appellant admittedly had in his possession and which he admitted was his came to be in the bag. 
     36   HANDLEY, JA: The order of the court is that the appeal is dismissed.

     1    HANDLEY JA: I will pass to Mr Justice Ipp to give the first judgment. 
      
       
     2    IPP AJA: The appellant was charged with having, on 19 June 1996 at Cootamundra, threatened unlawful violence to the complainants, Rebecca Hoffman, Gregory Kendrick, Jason Elliot and Jemina Buggy by conduct that would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for their personal safety. He was also charged with having at the same date and place maliciously damaged a motor vehicle the property of Jemina Buggy. He pleaded not guilty to both charges. He was found guilty by a jury of the first charge and acquitted of the second charge and now appeals against the conviction. 
      
       
     3    The appellant, in effect, relies on two grounds of appeal. The first is that the trial judge, Shillington DCJ, failed appropriately to direct the jury about his failure to give evidence. The second complains that his Honour erred in giving directions to the jury that the evidence of a witness, one Peter Young, might be unreliable because he was an accomplice; the appellant contends that his Honour should have discharged the jury in consequence of the directions that he gave. 
      
       
     4    With regard to the first ground, the direction complained of is the following: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Well now, members of the jury, I must also tell you that the accused in this trial has himself failed to give evidence. He was entitled to give evidence and to give his version of the facts. On the other hand, I remind you that the onus lies on the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is perfectly entitled to say to a jury, through his counsel as occurred here, you would not be satisfied for this or for that reason of the guilt of the accused, you would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt."" 
         
        
        
       
     5    The appellant submits that these directions were defective as they should have included, firstly, a direction that the silence of the appellant should not be treated as evidence of guilt (See R v OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744 at 755) and, secondly, a direction that there may be many reasons unknown to the jury why an accused might decide not to give evidence. 
      
       
     6    In R v OGD Gleeson CJ at 750 observed that jurors generally are aware of the right of an accused person to give evidence and, left to their own devices without any assistance from the trial judge, might well draw inferences more adverse than those legitimately available. The learned Chief Justice accepted that s 20 (2) of the Evidence Act 1995 did not generally prohibit comment on a failure of an accused person to give evidence and proceeded to set out general principles that provide guidance in regard to the kind of comment that would be appropriate, that is, subject to the qualification expressed in the second sentence of s 20(2). 
      
       
     7    For the purposes of this appeal, comments made by Gleeson CJ in two particular respects are relevant. 
      
       
     8    Firstly, his Honour observed that if anything at all is said about a failure to give evidence, the jury should at least be directed that such a failure can not be treated as an admission, by conduct, of guilt. His Honour pointed out at 751 that: 
      
       
        
         
         As a matter of ordinary experience, many lay people would readily treat an accused's silence as an admission of guilt unless warned against doing so."" 
         
        
        
       
     9    Accordingly, the jury should be told that they cannot infer guilt simply from the accused's failure to testify. 
      
       
     10    Secondly, his Honour went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         ""It is ordinarily necessary to warn a jury that there may be reasons unknown to them, why an accused person, even if otherwise in a position to contradict or explain evidence remains silent"". 
         
        
       
     11    Judge Shillington gave his imprimatur to the appellant's behaviour in not testifying. This is apparent from his Honour's use of the phrase: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The accused is perfectly entitled to say to a jury, through his counsel, you would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt..."" 
         
        
        
       
     12    Nevertheless, the fact remains that his Honour did not instruct the jury substantially in the terms indicated by Gleeson CJ. This omission was particularly significant in regard to the failure to tell the jury that there may be reasons unknown to them why an accused person remains silent. In this case the appellant may well have decided that it was unnecessary for him to testify by reason of the evidence given by the witness Young, to which I will shortly refer. In my view, his Honour’s omission constituted a misdirection. 
      
       
     13    I turn now to the second ground of appeal. This ground of appeal can only be fully appreciated against the factual background of the relevant circumstances of the case. 
      
       
     14    On 19 June 1996 a group of persons which included Glen Kendrick, his girlfriend Rebecca Hoffman, Kendrick's half-brother Jason Elliott and his girlfriend Jemina Buggy were at the Cootamundra Hotel. The appellant and Young were also at the hotel at the time. An argument occurred between Hoffman and the appellant. Kendrick and Elliott and their two girlfriends left the hotel and went to Hoffman's house in Lawrence Street, Cootamundra 
      
       
     15    At the house they ordered a pizza. While they were in the kitchen, Fiona O'Keefe, the appellant's girlfriend, came to the house. A fight broke out between O'Keefe and Hoffman and they punched each other. O'Keefe then left the house. 
      
       
     16    Shortly thereafter the appellant arrived at Hoffman's house with two men, one Dean Schultz and Young. 
      
       
     17    According to Buggy and Hoffman, the appellant pulled out a tomahawk and threatened to kill Elliott. Hoffman said that the appellant threatened to kill all of them. According to Kendrick the appellant was very angry. 
      
       
     18    Kendrick, Hoffman, Buggy and Elliott all stated that the appellant struck the front screen door of Hoffman's house with his tomahawk a number of times. Whilst doing this, according to them, he said, ""I am going to kill you"" or ""I am going to kill Jason Elliott."" 
      
       
     19    The evidence of the complainants was consistent with that of Sergeant Bell, who was attached to the Police Crime Scene Unit, and who testified that there were gouges in the aluminium screen door that would have had to have been made ""with some sort of force"". He said the marks indicated that a metal instrument with a sharp edge had been used to make the gouges. 
      
       
     20    Each member of the group was frightened by the incident. Kendrick thought he was going to die. Buggy was frightened for her life. Elliott stated that he ""felt pretty bothered about it, you know, like what you would do if someone was banging on your door, wanting to kill you with a tomahawk in his hand"" (although, later, he stated that he was not bothered by the tomahawk). Hoffman said she was very scared. 
      
       
     21    The incident was brought to a halt when a woman arrived to deliver the pizza that had been ordered. She saw someone standing in the doorway of the house and someone walking up and down the footpath. She heard swearing and raised voices from inside the house and from the man on the footpath. She was concerned about getting out of the car because of the anger in the voices and the agitation of the man on the footpath. When she was noticed, the man at the front door said, ""Come on we're going"" and the men left. 
      
       
     22    Young was called by the Crown. He said he was good friends with the appellant and Schultz. He said that the appellant did not have a tomahawk with him. He saw the appellant get ""a bit cranky"" with Kendrick and saw him hit his fist on the door once. Generally, he tended to down play the incident. Substantially Young's evidence refuted the Crown's case. It exculpated the appellant. This was particularly so in regard to the critical issue of whether the appellant had a tomahawk in his hand. 
      
       
     23    The Crown did not seek to question Young on the basis he was a hostile witness. 
      
       
     24    In dealing with Young, Shillington DCJ explained that the Crown had an obligation of fairness to present all the relevant evidence and observed, 
      
       
        
         
         ""If the Crown has a suspicion only that the evidence of a witness is not reliable that would be not enough to relieve the Crown of its obligation to call all relevant witnesses including that particular witness."" 
         
        
       
     25    This observation, itself on its own tended to cast doubt on the veracity or reliability of Young. 
      
       
     26    Shillington DCJ then went on to give what can only be described as an accomplice direction. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Now on one view of the matter, members of the jury, it could be open to say, well Young was an accomplice, in other words he went up there with the other two. He got into the car, they went up there together, he was in the background. The law recognises in that situation that the evidence of an accomplice - and by an accomplice is meant someone who was himself involved in the offence itself - the law recognises that the evidence of an accomplice may be unreliable. An accomplice could well tend to minimise his own personal involvement in the matter or he could even tend to minimise the events which occurred altogether, suggesting that no crime occurred at all, or something far less serious occurred than in fact on the Crown's case did occur. So the law recognises that an accomplice may be unreliable. 
         
        
        
         
         Now whether you would regard Young as an accomplice is a matter for you as judges of the facts. As I have said on one view of the matter you could regard him as an accomplice because he went up there to the premises at Lawrence Street with the other two and he remained there while whatever did happen happened, he did not immediately leave or make any protest, he was there. On the other hand of course, as a matter of fairness, you would realise that there is certainly no evidence whatsoever that he himself did anything. He was not up at the door, on the evidence of the witnesses in the Crown case he was either off the verandah or just around the corner, he was not up near the door. So you would have to take that into account when you consider the question of whether in fact he was an accomplice or not"". 
         
        
        
       
     27    In Jamieson, Elliott and Blessington (1992) 60 A Crim R 68 Gleeson CJ observed that where an accomplice gives evidence partly supportive of the case of an accused person it is technically correct that any accomplice warning that is given should be confined to the care to be taken in relation to those parts of the accomplice’s evidence that support the Crown case. 
      
       
     28    This stricture was not observed by Shillington DCJ. Those parts of Young's testimony which supported the Crown case against the appellant were, in my opinion, of minimal significance. The warning, however, was given in general terms. In my opinion it was entirely inappropriate. Certainly it was capable of reflecting adversely on Young. 
      
       
     29    It is also not without significance that, immediately following the accomplice warning, Shillington DCJ proceeded to deal with the appellant's failure to give evidence and then omitted the full direction as required by OGD.  Thus, after setting out the Crown case in detail, His Honour, when dealing with the defence case, watered down the force of Young's testimony by giving the accomplice warning, and then pointing out that the appellant had failed to testify. This exacerbated the impact that these matters would have on the jury. 
      
       
     30    After Shillington DCJ had completed his charge to the jury, counsel for the appellant requested him to withdraw the directions he had made in regard to Young. His Honour agreed to do this, recalled the jury, and told them: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Members of the jury, when I was dealing with the question of Mr Young's evidence I gave you a direction of law as regard to the evidence of an accomplice, and I told you that the law is that the evidence of an accomplice may be unreliable. I have come to the view, members of the jury, that I should withdraw that direction from you and I therefore ask you to disregard what I said in that regard, and I now ask you to retire to consider your verdicts"". 
         
        
        
       Thereafter, counsel for the appellant told his Honour that he had reflected on the accomplice direction and accepted that his Honour had withdrawn the direction as he had requested, but proceeded to submit that the misdirection could not be cured. He pointed out that Shillington DCJ had: 
        
        
         
         ""spent five or six minutes telling the jury that they could regard him as effectively being unreliable for all sorts of reasons"". 
         
        
        
       He submitted that the mere statement by Shillington DCJ to the jury that he withdrew what he said did not cure the prejudice that had ensued. Shillington DCJ, nevertheless, refused to discharge the jury. 
        
       
     31    In my view, it would not have been appropriate to discharge the jury. However, I do accept that the mere statement to the jury that the accomplice direction was withdrawn was insufficient to cure the harm that had been done to the appellant's case by the direction itself 
      
       
     32    The trial judge told the jury that on one view of the matter they could regard Young as an accomplice ""because he went up there to the premises at Lawrence Street with the other two and he remained there while whatever did happen happened, he did not immediately leave or make any protest, he was there"". That was not an appropriate basis for determining that Young was an accomplice as, on the basis postulated, Young did not participate in the offence of which the appellant was charged.  
      
       
     33    Moreover, his Honour told the jury that ""the law recognises that the evidence of an accomplice may be unreliable"". His Honour went on at some length to explain why an accomplice might be regarded as unreliable. 
      
       
     34    In my view, these directions would have left a lasting impression on the mind of the jury that would not have been eradicated by the mere statement that the directions were to be regarded as withdrawn. In my view, His Honour should have explained that, to the extent that Young's evidence tended to support the evidence of the appellant, he should be regarded as an ordinary witness and his evidence should be treated on its merits without there being a need for a special warning. 
      
       
     35    Accordingly, I have come to the conclusion that the directions given in regard to Young were inappropriate and given in error. 
      
       
     36    I would uphold the appeal, set aside the verdict and order a new trial. 
      
       
     37    HANDLEY JA: I agree. 
      
       
     38    GREG JAMES J: I agree. 
      
       
     39    HANDLEY JA: The orders of the Court will be as expounded by Ipp AJA.

      FRIDAY 20 APRIL 2001 
      
      REGINA v. ADAM BENJAMIN SMITH 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   HANDLEY, JA: The court will give its judgment in the matter of Smith and I will ask Justice Greg James to give the first judgment. 
     2   GREG JAMES, J: This is an appeal by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions against the sentence pronounced by his Honour Judge Moore, a judge of the District Court, on the respondent on a charge of armed robbery with wounding. The ground of appeal assigned to the notice of appeal was that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 
     3   The respondent was convicted on his own plea of an offence under s.98 of the Crimes Act 1900, that is robbery with wounding, which offence is punishable by a maximum penalty of 25 years. He was sentenced by the trial judge to imprisonment for three years to commence on 13 October 2000 and a non-parole period of 18 months to expire on 12 April 2002. 
     4   By reason of the sentence being a sentence of three years or less, the trial judge was constrained by s.50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to make an order directing the release of the offender on parole at the end of the non-parole period. His Honour did so. 
     5   The facts found by his Honour as to the commission of the crime were substantially based on a document provided to him for sentence headed, ""Full Facts"". Those facts disclosed to his Honour a crime of considerable gravity. The offender had in company with another person, while armed with a knife robbed a prostitute, taking from her the monies provided to her for her services and in the process of that robbery she had come to be severely wounded in circumstances to which I will refer in a moment. 
     6   His Honour acknowledged the maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment provided by the legislature for the crime, that it was a grave crime and that the effect on the victim was a grave one. 
     7   The crime had come to be committed when the offender and the other man, whilst drunk, had picked up the prostitute in the other man's car. They had smoked cannabis together with the prostitute and then journeyed to a remote area in the vicinity of Wollongong. The co-offender had sex with her first. He expressed dissatisfaction with the services provided and apparently, by way of reprisal for the asserted inadequacy of the services, sought that the offender, using a knife secreted alongside the seat of the car, should seek to retrieve the money. The offender used the knife for that purpose. He stated it was his intention to scare the victim into giving the money back. 
     8   The trial judge found that the victim on seeing the knife panicked, kicked at the offender, screamed and struggled with him, and received numerous lacerations from the knife to her hands and arms. She kicked one of the windows out in the struggle. Eventually the offender pulled her from the car and put her on the ground. She was left in that remote location, bleeding profusely. The co-offender disguised the number plate of the car. They left and the co-offender took with him her handbag and its contents. 
     9   There was evidence before his Honour from the victim of her belief that her life was in danger, that she had been threatened by the knife, even to the point where she thought the offender was trying to slash her with the knife and that she became slashed by the knife. The statement that she provided which was tendered before his Honour included a statement that she became extremely frightened and thought she was going to die. 
     10   The evidence provided of the extent of her injuries showed that she had suffered superficial cuts on the left foot and left forearm and a serious injury to the right hand, which was so deep as to expose the bone and required repair to cut tendons. 
     11   Following these events, the identity of the offender could not be established, but in consequence of widespread publicity, an anonymous tip was received. Police discovered the motor vehicle and went to the offender's home. The offender was spoken to at his place of employment and then at that place of employment invited to accompany the police to the police station for interview. 
     12   Initially, he said, according to the statement provided by Detective Northfield, part of the material provided to his Honour, that he was willing to see the police in the afternoon, but when later that day they approached him, he said that he had been expecting this to happen one day, ""It has made me sick every day just thinking about it"". He was then arrested. 
     13   At his interview he recounted the circumstances to which his Honour had referred. He gave an account of what had occurred in terms of his having presented the knife to the victim and then ""she would have been pretty scared, she was going, like, pretty berserk as you could imagine"". He denied sticking her with the knife in her lower back, but did describe the events in terms which plainly recognised his having put the victim in fear of serious injury, if not her life. 
     14   His Honour noted that as the tip-off was an anonymous one, there was no evidence against the offender at the time the police first went to speak to him and that as soon as the police arrived he immediately volunteered his guilt and informed the police that he was deeply guilty and remorseful for his actions. 
     15   His Honour described the record of interview, to which I have referred, as completely inculpating by an absolutely full and frank disclosure of activities which were unlikely otherwise to have been discovered. In this regard, it is noted that the co-offender had been charged and has pleaded not guilty and that the woman was apparently unable to identify the offenders, although she had given descriptions. 
     16   His Honour found in consequence that the plea of guilty was one for which a substantial discount should be given and that the admissions were of such value that he was required to give attention not only to s.22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, but to the reduction provided for in s.23, and referred to the decision in Regina v. Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 with reference to the necessity to extend a substantial degree of leniency. 
     17   He found the offender to be a young man of excellent character notwithstanding some imperfections certainly of substantial value to the offender when it came to sentence. He had employment and had enjoyed employment prospects on eventual release. He had a young wife and daughter, and they had, after some rejection of him, become supportive. He had on the night in question apparently been, as a consequence of some domestic argument, got himself extremely drunk and vulnerable, so it was said by his Honour, to suggestions by the co-accused. 
     18   His Honour felt that the use of the knife was itself absolutely impulsive, with no forethought whatsoever. The account given by the offender suggests that what his Honour there was referring to is any forethought independent of the invitation being extended to him by the co-accused to obtain the use of the knife. 
     19   His Honour referred to the lack of prior planning. I take that to mean the lack of prior planning in contrast with that degree of planning necessary for the performance of the sort of armed robbery that is described in Regina v. Henry & Anor (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 is used to describe. 
     20   His Honour, when considering the question of general deterrence, was of the view that it was an impulsive crime and it might well be treated as requiring less by way of general deterrence than might otherwise be the case. 
     21   His Honour was greatly impressed by the subjective case made on behalf of the offender, and by the gallery of supporters. He held:- 
      
       
        
        ""He is clearly a young man who would never have contemplated a crime of this nature and although he accepts full responsibility for it, it is something which evolved on impulse after impulse"". 
        
       
     22   His Honour accepted that the offender accepted full responsibility and was very genuinely and deeply remorseful. 
     23   His Honour noted the youth of the offender and the unlikelihood of the offender re-offending, but nonetheless had regard to the necessity that the strong subjective case not cause sight to be lost of the gravity of the crime. He referred to the breach of trust and the vulnerability involved in the victim putting herself in their hands as she had. He referred to the gravely aggravating feature of the use of the knife, and noted the absence of an intent to wound, but qualified that since the offence does not have any element of intentional infliction of wounds. However, rightly in my view, he observed that the use of the knife renders the case more grave because of the risk of injury, the very risk which was accomplished in this case when the victim resisted, and the wounds were inflicted. 
     24   His Honour referred to the plea of guilty and in that context, apparently by reason of the combination of the matters referred to in s.22 and s.23 decided on a reduction of something like 40%. Although his Honour expressed it as additional to the element I have just mentioned, his Honour appears to be referring to the utilitarian element of the plea as a matter that should be expressed in terms of its significance in that discount, and also referred to the remorse and the saving of the victim from having to give evidence. 
     25   He noted that the respondent might be at risk within the prison system in consequence of his youth, that he was going to gaol for the first occasion, and the prospect that if it were thought he had provided material against the co-offender, he might well be treated adversely by other prisoners. 
     26   His Honour accompanied the sentence by recommendations that the offender be classified urgently and that he be classified to minimum security. 
     27   It is apparent that the sentences passed by his Honour involve a variation of the statutory proportions referred to in s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That subsection provides:- 
      
       
        
        ""The non-parole period must not be less than three quarters of the term of the sentence unless the court decides there are special circumstances ... in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision."" 
        
       
     28   At the close of his Honour's remarks counsel for the respondent drew to his Honour's attention the necessity to refer to special circumstances, and his Honour said:- 
      
       
        
        ""The special circumstances have been expressed at length in my reasons."" 
        
       
     29   Putting aside what other matters have been argued on this appeal, in my view his Honour there fell into error. His Honour did not identify the particular special circumstances. He did not identify the circumstances which might have the necessary character and which might attract thereby such significance as to warrant the variation of the statutory proportions, and failed in that regard to give adequate reasons for variation of the proportions. 
     30   The Crown has argued on the appeal that his Honour's sentence was manifestly inadequate, and that his Honour fell into error in some three ways. I put aside for the moment the submission that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. His Honour was said to have fallen into error having regard to the guidelines expressed in the judgment in this court in Henry (supra) concerning the appropriateness of sentence for armed robbery. There was debate before his Honour concerning those guidelines and their applicability. 
     31   The guidelines provide for a category of case of armed robbery, which is sufficiently common as to include such characteristics as: a young offender with no previous criminal history; a weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; a limited degree of planning and limited, if any, actual violence and the victim in a vulnerable position; a small amount of money being taken; and a plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. 
     32   This offence was, however, a different offence. It involved actual violence and injury. It could not be said to have involved limited actual violence, albeit that that violence has to be considered in the context that the injuries were not intentionally deliberately inflicted. On the other hand, it could not be said that the significance of the plea was limited by a strong Crown case. Indeed, in my view, it could not be said that the significance of the plea was such as to show that his Honour fell into appellable error, as his Honour weighed it, having regard to the range of decisions open to a trial judge in the discounting of the sentence in accordance with the guidelines set out by this court in the decision of Regina v. Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 and having regard to the additional matters to which s.23 applies. 
     33   The appropriate range for the offences to which it refers is identified in Henry (supra), so that sentences for an offence of this character should generally fall between four and five years for a full term, although aggravating and mitigating factors could justify a sentence in a lower part of the range. Further, of course, if there is a finding of special circumstances, the non-parole period may fall further below that which otherwise would have been appropriate as referred to in Henry (supra). 
     34   However, this is a crime that is very different to those referred to in Henry (supra).  
     35   Consequently, when the Crown contends that his Honour fell into error in (1) failing properly to apply the guidelines in Henry (supra), having regard to the fact that the maximum penalty for this offence was 25 years, rather than 20 years, and (2) failing to have adequate regard to the fact that actual violence was used, so that the appropriate sentence starting point, having regard to the range in Henry (supra), was too low. I do not accept that submission. 
     36   The Crown also submits that the plea discount was too much. Having regard to the matters to which I have already referred, to s.22 and s.23 and to the principles in Thomson (supra), I am not persuaded that it was inappropriate for his Honour to have given a substantial discount and to have regard to the principles in Ellis (supra) notwithstanding that the co-operation and assistance furnished by the accused, since it did not include evidence against the co-offender, was not of the greatest utility as is envisaged in that decision. 
     37   Moving then to the Crown's submissions that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. The reduction of the non-parole period means that the sentence when considered as a whole is a sentence which would require the defendant to spend 18 months in prison, to be liable to be returned to prison or for supervision during the balance of the term. It is undoubtedly an entirely lenient sentence for a crime of this gravity. It was a crime of a vicious and despicable nature. 
     38   However, even though his Honour did not detail them, in my view there were in evidence before his Honour, and on his Honour's findings, clearly special circumstances, such as to warrant a variation of the statutory proportions. In particular they were that this was the offender's first time in custody, that he had a young family, that he had entirely excellent rehabilitation prospects, and indeed his Honour's findings were sufficient to conclude that this event was an aberrant occasion in an otherwise reasonably well conducted life, putting aside the smoking of marijuana. 
     39   It was contended on the offender's behalf that the sentence was to be regarded as entirely appropriate, notwithstanding his Honour had reduced the custodial proportion of it so drastically, and notwithstanding that his Honour had failed, as I have already said, adequately to give reasons as to why and on what basis he had so decided. 
     40   Our function on an appeal of this kind, I have already referred to in some detail in the decision of this court in Regina v. Pont [2000] NSWCCA 493. It is not necessary for me to set out again here the well-known principles that are there summarised. 
     41   I have concluded that the sentence as it stands should not be interfered with, and that, not because his Honour did not fall into error in his decision concerning the special circumstances, because I am plainly of the view that he did, and he failed to give adequate reasons for his findings, but because, for this court to vary the non-parole period pursuant to s.52 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 or to re-sentence to the extent necessary to correct that error, would be to increase the sentence and its practical effect in a way that would amount to tinkering. I find no other basis which would warrant interference. 
     42   I therefore am of the view that the appropriate course to take, notwithstanding the error that I have referred to, is for this court to dismiss the appeal. 
     43   HANDLEY, JA: I agree with Justice Greg James that the learned sentencing judge fell into error in the way that he has identified. I would add for myself that his Honour's remark, ""there was absolutely no planning"" is not, with respect, accurate. There was planning, albeit at a late stage on the occasion in question. 
     44   I am also of the view that the plea of guilty should not have been given enhanced value, because the offender had been discovered, and the police were able to interview him. 
     45   His prompt confession put an end to the police investigations, so there was no occasion for the police to investigate the availability of DNA evidence, the presence of bloodstains or damaged clothing in the prisoner's home, and the possibility that he could have been identified through DNA testing of the vehicle and the victim. 
     46   His Honour also plainly disregarded the statutory injunction to give reasons for his decision that there were special circumstances for making the non-parole period less than three-quarters of the total sentence. 
     47   The crime, with its ugly and dangerous incidents, was one which evolved, and the prisoner did not have complete control over the events. I have nevertheless been troubled by the lightness of the total sentence and the fact that only 18 months of that sentence is to be spent in custody. 
     48   My mind has fluctuated during the course of the argument. It is not clear to me that s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is directed at mitigating the full time custodial portion of the sentence independently of the need of the offender for additional time under supervision following his release, but this is not a suitable case, nor has the argument been such as to make it appropriate to decide those questions. 
     49   The section departs from the previous legislation in significant ways and we have not been referred to any material in the second reading speech of the Minister or any explanatory memorandum which might throw light on the meaning of s.44(2) in the sense that I have referred to. 
     50   Nevertheless, the other members of the court are of the view that the sentence should not be disturbed and not without some doubt, I am prepared to acquiesce in that result. I therefore agree with the order proposed by Justice Greg James. 
     51   IPP AJ: I agree with Justice Greg James. 
     52   HANDLEY, JA: The order of the court will be that the appeal is dismissed.

      REGINA v KELLIE ANNE WALFORD 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1   MEAGHER JA: This matter, which seems to me an extremely sad matter, is an application by Miss Kellie Anne Walford for a reduction in sentence given by Judge O’Reilly at Penrith on 1 December 2000. She was indicted on one count of escape from lawful custody under s 310D of the Crimes Act 1900. His Honour sentenced her to a fixed term of four months to date from 20 March 2001, the date upon which her then existing minimum term will expire. She had previously been sentenced in the Dubbo District Court on 31 January 2000 to a minimum term of 22 months with an additional term of 18 months for robbery in company. 
     2   Her background is hardly inspiring. She was born on 9 June 1979 of Aboriginal descent. She lived her early life with her father in Queensland and apparently, for no reason I can understand, at the age of 15 she came down to Walgett, New South Wales, in order to live with her mother. She did live with her mother, but that was hardly a factor which would lead to any stability in her life because her mother was an alcoholic. The evidence is that after she moved to Walgett, her life spun out of control. She was raped once. She drifted into drug abuse and she also drifted into a life of crime, most of her entries in her previous record being drug related. In Dubbo District Court on 31 January 2000, she was given a minimum term of 22 months which was backdated to 20 May 1999 with an additional term of 18 months. At the time of this escape she was looking forward to release on parole on 19 March 2001. 
     3   On 4 July 2000 there were some renovations proceeding at the Emu Plains Correctional Centre where she was serving her sentence and someone, by mistake, had left a gate open, apparently for use of a tractor. There was no question of any prior deliberation about escaping, however, when she saw the open gate, she understood that as an invitation, which she took, and she walked towards the railway station, presumably with the intention of catching the train back to Queensland. She was noticed by a member of the public and retaken into custody. She went quietly back into prison and she pleaded guilty when she tried to escape. When asked why it was she left the prison, she said it was because of her asthma and significant ongoing stress from other inmates. The way to cure that problem is not to escape gaol. 
     4   Counsel for Miss Walford has stressed the short amount of time involved. She was only out on leave for something like seven minutes and she came back readily. Indeed, in his written submissions, counsel for Miss Walford has said that the escape was a mere technicality. It is, unfortunately, a little bit worse than a mere technicality. Parliament has said again and again that escape from lawful custody is a most serious matter and should be treated by the courts accordingly. If one were to scrutinise the reasons of Judge O’Reilly for imposing the four months sentence, which he did, it is difficult to the point of impossibility to see where his Honour made any error of either fact or law, nor do I think her sentence of such comparative leniency (four months) cannot be said that the result is so totally offensive to one’s expectations that some error, although not easy to point to, must have existed. 
     5   For those reasons I am of the view that the application to appeal should be refused. 
     6   SULLY J: I agree. 
     7   HOWIE J: I also agree. 
     8   MEAGHER JA: The order of the Court therefore is that the application is dismissed.

     JUDGMENT  
    1    HIS HONOUR: Application was made by the Crown for two witnesses, Mr and Mrs L, to give evidence from a remote location by video-link in circumstances where their facial features could not be observed by the accused. 
    2    Evidence was taken on the voir dire and submissions made on 19 and 20 April. On 23 April I granted the application and indicated that I would give my reasons later. The evidence was duly given by video-link on 24 April and I now publish my reasons for granting the Crown's application. 
    3    It was anticipated (as in fact turned out to be the case) that the witnesses would say that two nights before the death of the deceased they were travelling in their motor vehicle in Judith Avenue, a street behind Woods Avenue where the deceased was shot outside his home. They drove from Bowden Street, turned right into Judith Avenue and saw a white four door sedan parked on the left hand side of that street about two metres from the corner, which would be very close to the back of the deceased's home in Woods Avenue; and outside the vehicle they saw a person they recognised as the accused Phuong Ngo whom they knew because of his position as a councillor in the area, where he had received publicity in the local newspapers and on television. Their description of the car as a white four door sedan is consistent with the white Camry owned by the Mekong Club and generally driven by the accused Phuong Ngo. 
    4    They each swore an affidavit on which they were cross-examined as to their reasons for wanting to give evidence by video-link from a remote location, and in effect they said that they were scared, not only for themselves but also for their family. They each gave evidence at the Coronial Inquest into the death of John Newman and it appears that Mr L became visibly upset when cross-examined by counsel for the accused Phuong Ngo, notwithstanding that the accused was not present at the time; and his evidence in this regard was confirmed by the evidence of Superintendent Kaldas, the officer in charge of the case, who was present at the inquest and said that after Mr L ascertained that the person asking him questions was appearing for Phuong Ngo he appeared visibly shaken and he could see that he was quite upset. Mrs L also said that she was frightened. 
    5    Some days after the inquest Mrs L observed a vehicle parked outside their house late at night whilst her husband was at work. She described the persons in the vehicle as Asians. They apparently did not get out of the car, she could see no reason for them to be there and it seems that the vehicle was parked there for approximately 3 hours. She also said that there had recently been telephone calls inquiring whether their house was up for sale and asking whether their surname was as it is. As the house has not been on the market this has caused them additional concern.  
    6    As Mrs L put it, ""I'm in fear just in case these people get acquitted and get released and then I would be really fearful for my own safety"", and she was also concerned for the safety of her family. She said that if directed by the judge to give evidence, she would be very reluctant to give evidence. Her husband said that ""If he (Phuong Ngo) was there, I would not be game enough to give evidence"". They do not know of either of the other accused, but Mr L said he would be reluctant to give evidence in front of any of the accused. 
    7    Mrs L herself appeared very concerned and apprehensive when brought into the courtroom to give evidence on the voir dire, and it was only when she was assured that the accused were not present, and she was able to look at the dock and see for herself that they were not there, that she came forward to the witness box. 
    8    Pursuant to a ruling by Wood CJ at CL on 16 July 1999, both the witnesses were permitted to give evidence in the previous trial by video-link in circumstances where the only video screen in the court was located behind the accused and was visible to the jury, but not to the accused who were directed not to turn around and look at it. A video monitor was placed in front of the accused without any picture so that the jury would be under the impression that they had their own monitor to watch. To facilitate this operation the court transferred to another courtroom where this configuration was possible and the jury was told this was for technical reasons or something of that nature. 
    9    Although that ruling was given on virtually the same evidence as is presently before me, it is necessary for me to consider the evidence afresh for two reasons. Firstly, because as the decision involves elements of discretion it is incumbent on me to exercise my discretion afresh and not merely to follow the Chief Judge's exercise of discretion on an earlier occasion; and secondly, because there has been some legislative changes since the earlier decision. 
    10    The law as it stood in July 1999 was, in my respectful opinion, correctly summarised by Wood CJ at CL by his judgment at pp 2 to 3 as follows: 
     
      
       
       ""The Supreme Court Rules Part 36 r2A(1) permit directions for evidence to be given by any audio-visual method. This rule applies, by reason of Supreme Court Rule Part 75 r22(7) and the Third Schedule, to proceedings in the Court for the prosecution of indictable offences. The grant of leave for the giving of evidence by this means is discretionary. It depends upon an assessment whether the making of a direction for the use of a video-link would advance the course of justice:  
       Park v Citibank Savings Ltd 
        (1993) 31 NSWLR 219 at 225. It is not to be overlooked, in this respect, that the interests of justice favour the reception of all available and relevant evidence in a criminal trial, and that a fair trial is one that is fair both to the State as well as the accused:  
       McKinney 
        (1991) 171 CLR 468 at 488, and  
       Lowe 
        (1997) 98 A Crim R 300 at 318-319. There is precedent for the use of video-link in criminal trials in other jurisdictions:  
       Hyuk Kye Kim 
        (Supreme Court VIC 17 October 1998, Caldrey J,) as well as in New South Wales  
       Bryant 
        (Supreme Court New South Wales, Hidden J, May 1999). 
       
      
      
       
       In weighing this option, it needs to be borne in mind that the practice of requiring witnesses to give evidence orally, and to be confronted in the presence of the jury, ought not to be waived lightly. Considerations such as the quality of the image, the size of the screen and the like need to be given proper weight."" 
       
      
      
    11    At that time the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 did not apply in the circumstances of this case as both the witnesses were present in New South Wales. This limitation has now been lifted by the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Amendment Act 2000, no. 16, Sch 1[5] and the relevant parts of the Act apply to any proceedings (including criminal proceedings) in or before a New South Wales Court: s 5A(1).  
    12    Section 5B provides that the court may direct that a person give evidence etc by audio visual link from any place ""within or outside New South Wales"", other than the courtroom at which the court is sitting, but the court must not make such a direction if: 
     
      
       
       (a) the necessary facilities are unavailable or cannot reasonably be made available, or 
        
       (b) the court is satisfied that the evidence or submission can more conveniently be given or made in the courtroom or other place at which the court is sitting, or 
        
       (c) the court is satisfied by a party opposing the making of the direction that the direction would be unfair to the party, or 
        
       (d) the court is satisfied that the person in respect of whom the direction is sought will not give evidence or make the submission; 
       
      
      
     and the court must not make such a direction unless the party making the application satisfies the court that it is in the interests of the administration of justice for the court to do so: s 5B(3), while s 5(1A) provides that the Act is not intended to exclude or limit the operation of any other law of this State that makes provision for the taking of evidence or making of submissions in this State for the purposes of a proceeding in the State.  
      
    13    Section 20A (the former s 8) provides that evidence can only be given by audio visual link if the courtroom and the place where the evidence would be given are equipped with audio visual link facilities that enable: 
     
      
       
       (a) persons who are at the courtroom or other place to see and hear the person giving the evidence or making the submission, and 
        
       (b) persons who are at the place where the evidence is given or the submission is made to see and hear persons at the courtroom or other place. 
       
      
      
    14    It was conceded that the quality of the video image and of the audio link is first-class, that the demeanour of the witnesses would be clearly visible to the jury and that their words and those of any interpreter used by them would be clear, or at least as clear as they would be if the evidence were given in the courtroom.  
    15    There may be some justification for the fears expressed by the witnesses, although there is no evidence that any of the occurrences giving rise to their fears are in any way referable to any of the accused. But irrespective of whether there is any cause or justification for their fears, I am satisfied that their fears are genuinely held and that they probably would not give the evidence if they were required to do so face to face in the courtroom in the presence of the accused. I am also satisfied that even if they did give the evidence, because of their fears, rightly or wrongly but genuinely held, they would not justice do to themselves as witnesses and it is therefore in the interest of the administration of justice to make the order.  
    16    The evidence, if accepted by the jury could be a significant part of the circumstantial case against the accused Phuong Ngo.  
    17    Section 5B(2)(c) requires that I must be satisfied that the giving of the evidence in this matter would not be unfair to any of the accused. Mr Nicholson SC on behalf of the accused Phuong Ngo, whose submissions were supported by counsel for the other accused, submitted that giving evidence in this way would be unfair to the accused because the images on the screen would be larger than life, giving emphasis to their evidence as compared with that of other witnesses. I do not consider this to give rise to any unfairness because, although the images may be larger than life, the evidence will lack the immediacy that would be present if the witnesses were present in the courtroom.  
    18    His other and more substantial objection on this issue was that as Mr L said he had met Phuong Ngo, and both said they were familiar with him because of the appearance of his image in newspapers and on television, there were issues of identity involved, and that therefore Phuong Ngo should be entitled to see the person giving evidence against him in this regard, because to do otherwise would deny him the opportunity to properly contest that evidence. I gave this submission serious consideration, but ultimately rejected it because the issue is not whether Phuong Ngo could identify the witnesses, but whether the witnesses could identify Phuong Ngo. As a councillor and prominent local identity it is apparent that Phuong Ngo would have met many of the local citizens, and it would not be expected that he would remember them all, and I have no doubt that Mr L would come into this category. 
    19    Mr Hoenig on behalf of the accused Dinh submitted that there should be nothing different about the conduct of this trial from the usual run of other trials because otherwise an inference may be drawn by the jury that the witnesses have some fear of the accused and therefore some reason to fear them. Not only was such a suggestion sheer speculation, but I was satisfied that the possibility could be avoided by an appropriate explanation along the lines of ""technical reasons"" or similar. 
    20    The general rule is that a normal criminal jury trial provides for the presentation of the Crown case in the presence and hearing of the accused and this procedure is correctly described as a ""right"": R v McHardie and Danielson [1983] 2 NSWLR 733 at 739. The accused should normally be able to confront his or their accusers and this cannot occur if the witnesses or their image cannot be seen by the accused. But exceptions have been made in a number of cases to prevent the accused seeing the witnesses or vice versa, apart from cases in which special statutory provisions such as the Evidence (Children) Act 1997 applied. 
    21    For example, in R v Smellie (1919) 14 Cr App R 128, the accused was ordered to sit on the stairs going out of the dock, out of sight of the complainant while she gave her evidence and Lord Coleridge J giving the judgement of the court said, ""If the judge considers that the presence of the prisoner will intimidate a witness there is nothing to prevent him from securing the ends of justice by removing the former from the presence of the latter"".  
    22    In R v DJX and ors (1990) 91 Cr App R 36 and in R v Sparkes (Supreme Court of Tasmania - unreported - 1 October 1996) a screen was erected between the witness and the accused so that the accused could not see the witness and vice versa although the accused could hear everything that was said. In the former case the Lord Chief Justice said at 41: -  
     
      
       
       ""We take the view that we do not need authority to confirm us in the view that what the learned Judge here did in his discretion was a perfectly proper, and indeed a laudable attempt to see that this was a fair trial: fair to all, the defendants, the Crown and indeed the witnesses.""  
       
      
      
    23    A screen was also used in R v West (1990) 51 A Crim R 317 but that was pursuant to express statutory authority. In my opinion this was a similarly exceptional case for the accused to be able to hear but not see the witnesses and the arrangements proposed for the giving of the evidence by audio visual link and the placement of the audio visual screen out of sight of the accused constituted a much less obvious, and therefore less prejudicial, procedure than the placing of screens within the courtroom.  
    24    Section 20A(a) requires that persons in the courtroom must be able to see and hear the person giving the evidence and vice versa. I am satisfied that the facilities in the present case will be such so that everyone in the courtroom, except the accused, will be able to see and hear the witnesses, and the accused will be able to hear them though not see them. Section 20A is a general provision and it refers to persons in the courtroom in general, without specifying any particular persons in the courtroom, and it does not in terms require that each party must be able to see the witness.  
    25    Moreover, the Act is not to exclude or limit any other law for the provision for the taking of evidence in this State, and so is not to be interpreted as limiting the operation of Part 36 r 2A of the Supreme Court Rules. Those Rules still apply and they do not require that every person including every accused be able to see, as well as hear, the witnesses. Part 75 r 8 prevents an order being made under Pt 36 r 2A preventing an accused from ""attending"" any part of the proceedings, except with his or her consent, but there is no requirement in the rule that the accused must be able to ""see"" each of the witnesses.  
    26    Mr Cusack QC made a further submission to the effect that to allow this evidence to be given by video-link would ""open the floodgates"" so as to permit any witness who was reluctant to confront an accused in person in the courtroom to seek to have a similar order made. I do not regard the provisions as being open to such a broad interpretation and the exercise of the power to order prosecution evidence in criminal trials to be given in this way must be carefully circumscribed. On the other hand, this trial has been described as ""high profile"". A politician was shot dead outside his home and the Crown allegation is that it was organised by the accused Phuong Ngo for his own political advancement. It is therefore most desirable that in a case such as this all available evidence is placed before the jury so that, so far as possible, the facts may be properly and correctly ascertained. I am satisfied that this was an appropriate case to make an order similar to that made by Wood CJ at CL on the earlier occasion.  
    27    It is for these reasons that I gave the direction for the evidence of both witnesses to be given from a remote location by video-link and directed that the hearing be transferred to courtroom no. 7 so that the screen was directly above the accused where it could be seen by the jury, but not by the accused. I also directed the accused not to turn around to look at the screen and that a ""dummy"" screen be placed in front of the dock so that it would appear the accused were watching the witnesses on such screen. The evidence was given in accordance with these directions.

        REGINA v SDM 
        
       
      
      
        
      Judgment 
      
      
       
        
       
     1    GILES JA: I have had the benefit of reading the judgments of Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J in draft.  
      
       
     2    I agree with the observations of Wood CJ at CL in relation to R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. In agreement with both their Honours, having regard to the guidelines in R v Henry and the principles particularly applicable in the sentencing of young offenders including those who are in law children, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed on the appellant was excessive. 
      
       
     3    I agree that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
      
      
      ___________ 
      
      
       
        
       
     4    WOOD CJ at CL: In my view the sentence imposed in this case was within a proper range of sentencing discretion, taking into account the objective seriousness of the offence, the subjective circumstances of the applicant, and the special sentencing considerations applicable to young offenders. In this regard I agree with the reasons of Simpson J, and with the orders which she has proposed. 
      
       
     5    It is appropriate to say something more in relation to the applicant’s submission that the guideline judgment in Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 applies only to adult offenders. Support for that proposition was said to lie in the judgment of Hidden J, with whom Carruthers AJ agreed in Jack Sua [2000] NSWCCA 94, where his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Passing reference was made to the guideline judgment in  
         R v Henry & Ors 
          but it does not appear that much assistance is available from that case. I take the guidelines to be applicable to adult offenders and not to embrace the special facts governing the sentencing of children. The principles governing the sentencing of children are well known. I am well aware that the special consideration which might be afforded to persons under the age of eighteen for the purpose of sentence might be qualified where the offence involved is a particularly serious one: that is, a crime which might appropriately be characterised as grave adult behaviour. “ 
         
        
        
       A similar assumption appears to have been made by Hulme J, with whom Carruthers AJ again agreed, in  
       RLS 
        [2000] NSWCCA 175. 
        
       
     6    Each of these decisions was made by a bench comprising two judges of this Court, but in neither case does it appear to me that the point was intended to be dealt with in a considered way so as to constitute a post script to Henry, or as a qualification of the guidelines there pronounced. 
      
       
     7    If the effect of these decisions was to construe Henry in a way that would entirely exclude its application to juvenile offenders, ie those who qualify as a “child” within the meaning of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, S 3(1), then that approach would, in my view, have been inappropriate, having regard to the nature and purpose of a guideline judgment. Such judgments are not to be regarded as equivalent to statutory instruments, which invite interpretation or which bind Judges strictly within their terms, and from which there can be no departure. As this Court has made crystal clear (e.g. Douglas NSW CCA 11 December 1998, Henry per Spigelman CJ at para 29; and Jurisic per Spigelman CJ at para 15), guideline judgments do not have the force of statute law, and they are not to be treated, for example, as the equivalent of mandatory sentencing legislation. 
      
       
     8    One of their advantages is to avoid the vice attached to such form of legislation which can, in individual cases, lead to great injustice, and which conflicts with the well recognised principle that “if justice is not individual, it is nothing” per Mahony JA in Lattouf NSWCCA 12 December 1996 and in Kable (1995) 26 NSWLR 374 at 394. 
      
       
     9    Recently, in Karacic 2001 NSWCCA 12, Spigelman CJ, when confirming the indicative nature of such judgments, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Nevertheless they are appropriate indicators, or to use the words of Winneke P [in  
         R v Ngui and Tiong (2000) 
          111 A Crim R 593 at 13] a “sounding board” or a “check” so that in circumstances such as the present, the court does not fail to consider the level of sentences that have been found to be appropriate in the general run of similar cases, whilst taking into account the differences between the circumstances of the individual case and those of previous cases.” 
         
        
        
       
     10    What such judgments are intended to provide are benchmarks for particular kinds of offence, by way of guidance, while preserving the application of proper sentencing principle which is of general application, including that referrable to children, or to those suffering from some form of mental incapacity, that might reduce the need for the sentence to reflect factors of deterrence, while requiring greater attention to be given to the interest of rehabilitation.  
      
       
     11    Similarly, the principles relevant to matters such as parity, assistance, mercy in the case of offenders at the crossroads, the burdensome effect of a sentence that has to be served upon strict protection or by a person suffering from significant ill heath or physical disability, delay, entrapment and duress, the offer of a plea in the absence of a strong Crown case, the commission of an offence while on conditional liberty, and so on remain applicable, and are properly to be taken into account when reference is made to a guideline judgment. 
      
       
     12    The fact of their application, and the way in which they are taken into account in the sentencing order that is pronounced, do need to be spelled out, otherwise a risk arises of attracting an appeal. Nevertheless, they remain as applicable to cases falling within the ambit of a guideline judgment, as they do to offences which are not the subject of a guideline. 
      
       
     13    To engraft onto a guideline judgment exceptions for particular categories of offender, or for cases where particular aspects of sentencing principle attract special consideration, is to misapply them and to elevate them to statutory instruments. 
      
       
     14    If that was the intended effect of Sua and RLS in relation to Henry, then I would express my disagreement with those decisions. There is nothing in Henry which would provide any direct, ie express support for the view that it was not intended to apply to children, ie subject to the qualification which I have mentioned. Indeed, at para 162, Spigelman CJ included the expression “young offenders” among the characteristics of the category of cases which was “sufficiently common for purposes of determining a guideline”; and at para 170, his Honour expressly noted that, among the factors which might mitigate a sentence below the indicative range was that of “youth”. Although of limited assistance, it may be noted that of the cases cited in Henry, only one (Nguyen NSW CCA 14 April 1994) involved an offender under eighteen years. So far as the researches of Counsel show, the issue which now arises has not emerged for consideration in this Court save in relation to the appeals of Walters and Blackman (2001) NSWCCA 121. 
      
       
     15    It is by no means clear that an exception to Henry was intended in Sua and RLS, as distinct from an acknowledgment of the existence of the guideline, and the making of an allowance for the special circumstances applicable to those who are children at law, i.e. those who are aged under eighteen years.  
      
       
     16    There will always be cases where little allowance needs to be made for this fact, e.g. when the offence is one where the offender conducted himself or herself like an adult: Tran (1999) NSW CCA 109 and Townsend & Cooper NSW CCA 14 February 1995; or where there is a pattern of serious repetitive offending: Biggs NSW CCA 5 March 1997; or where the offender is close to legal adulthood and properly to be regarded as mature: Nguyen. 
      
       
     17    Equally, there are cases where the converse is true and where special allowance will need to be made for the offender’s emotional immaturity: Kama 2000 NSWCCA 23, or for his or her deprived background, and so on. 
      
       
     18    Furthermore, in cases dealt with according to law, it still remains necessary for the Court to have regard to the principles set out in s6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, which were considered in GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112: See also Sharbon NSWCCA 5 December 1991, and Nguyen at p6, per Blanch J. 
      
       
     19    Accordingly, so far as it was submitted in this appeal, that the existence of this provision meant that Henry could not apply otherwise than to adult offenders, even where the case was one that, by force of the Act, was required to be dealt with at law, I am unable to accept that proposition. To a considerable degree s6 reflects general sentencing principle applicable to young offenders, e.g. in relation to the subordination, in general, of punishment and general deterrence to the need to foster rehabilitation: Wilkie NSW CCA 2 July 1992, and GDP.  
      
       
     20    That consideration, and the other matters identified in this provision, can equally well be allowed for, along with all the other aspects of sentencing policy and principle relevant to young offenders, particularly those who were children at the time of offending, within the ambit of a guideline judgment. 
      
       
     21    I would similarly grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
        
        ********** 
        
       
      
      
       
       SIMPSON J :  
        
       
     22    On 7 March 2000, in the District Court at Wagga Wagga, the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of armed robbery in relation to an offence committed on 28 March 1999. Because of the applicant’s age at the time of the offence (thirteen days short of seventeen years) the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (“the Act”) were, for sentencing purposes, applicable.  
      
       
     23    On 9 March 2000 Judge Shillington sentenced the applicant to a total term of imprisonment of four and a half years which he divided into equal minimum and additional terms. Pursuant to s 19 of the Act he directed that the whole of the sentence was to be served in a detention centre.  
      
       
     24    The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence. The ground advanced in support of the application was that the sentence was, in the circumstances, manifestly excessive. Heavy reliance was placed upon the applicant’s age and his personal circumstances.  
      
       
        
       The offence 
        
       
     25    During the evening of 28 March 1999, the applicant, in company with four others, drove to a general store of which a middle aged couple, John and Clara Jones, were the proprietors. While two of the men remained in the car, the applicant and two others entered the store. One of them was armed with a single barrelled shotgun, and another with a golf club. All wore balaclavas. 
      
       
     26    Both the gun and the golf club were used to threaten Mr and Mrs Jones. They were ordered to open the cash register, and the men escaped with about $270 in cash, three gold rings valued at $210, and cigarettes of a total value of $544. Both Mr and Mrs Jones were understandably very frightened by the experience.  
      
       
     27    Although it was the Crown’s contention that the applicant was the offender in possession of the gun, Judge Shillington was unable to make a finding of fact to the requisite standard to that effect. He, however (correctly in my view), regarded that as of little significance in the sentencing exercise. He was satisfied that the applicant knew that a robbery was to take place and that a weapon would be used. 
      
       
     28    The applicant gave evidence which his Honour apparently generally accepted as truthful. He said that shortly before the robbery he had drunk six to eight beers and had, for the first time in his life, used heroin. Both the alcohol and the heroin had been given to him by one of the co-offenders, Kevin Carrick, who was then thirty-five years of age. The applicant said that there had been some discussion among the co-offenders about the commission of the robbery, but that he had been asleep and that after he had woken up he had been physically ill. He knew that the gun had been stolen from a neighbour’s home but said that, to his knowledge, it was unloaded. The balaclavas had been supplied by Carrick. He said that he had very little recollection of the events. He expressed regret and shame for his participation and an intention to rehabilitate himself and never use heroin again. 
      
       
        
        • • • 
        
       
     29    There was some support for the applicant’s claimed contrition. From the date he was charged (1 April 1999) until 10 January 2000, he maintained an intention to plead not guilty. He was released on bail on 13 April 1999. On 10 January 2000 he decided to change his plea to one of guilty and also to ask that his bail be revoked, and he accordingly surrendered himself on that day. The only source of this information was a Background Report prepared for the court by the Department of Juvenile Justice, which was accepted by the Crown as accurate. The Department of Juvenile Justice report also contained the information that, in about January 2000, the applicant committed an offence of break enter and steal. 
      
       
     30    There was other subjective material, again drawn largely from the Background Report. The applicant was born on 9 April 1982, and was almost seventeen years of age at the date of the offence, seventeen years and eleven months at sentencing. He had an insignificant criminal history, extending only to a charge of receiving stolen property and one of common assault, which were dealt with together in the Children’s Court in 1998. He was placed on probation for eighteen months. 
      
       
     31    The applicant has had a disturbed family life, his parents having separated when he was about five years of age. He has little contact with his father, to whom he harbours some resentment. Since the separation his mother has entered into at least two successive relationships. One of her partners became something of a father figure to the applicant, but his mother’s relationship with that man has since terminated. He bears some animosity to his mother’s current partner.  
      
       
     32    The applicant has an older sister, to whom he is close, and two younger brothers. His mother’s care for the family has been unstable, and, from an early age, the applicant and one of his brothers have been left to find their own accommodation. He left school shortly after turning fifteen and has had some casual employment, but the temporary nature of his domestic arrangements has made continuous employment difficult. He was described by the Juvenile Justice officer as “anxious and depressed”. 
      
       
     33    In R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 this court promulgated a guideline sentencing regime in relation to armed robbery. The sentence there proposed was expressed to apply in cases that fell into a broad category of cases with identifiable common features. Those features were stated as: 
      
       
        
         
         “(i) Young offender, with no or little criminal history; 
          
         (ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
          
         (iii) Limited degree of planning; 
          
         (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence, but a real threat thereof; 
          
         (v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; 
          
         (vi) Small amount taken; 
          
         (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.” (para 162, p 380) 
         
        
        
       The guideline sentence promulgated in respect of offences falling generally into the category described was a fulltime term of four to five years. 
        
       
     34    All four co-offenders pleaded guilty to the same charge as the applicant and were sentenced by Judge Bellear on 27 August 1999. Judge Bellear adopted the Henry sentence as the starting point in his sentencing exercise. As will appear, that is a matter of some significance in this application. The sentences Judge Bellear ultimately imposed on the co-offenders, were, however, adjusted according to the circumstances of each individual case and each individual offender, and, in some cases, departed quite widely from the four to five year Henry term. It is convenient here to note the sentences Judge Bellear imposed: 
      
       
        
       CSO 
        was aged seventeen at the time of the offence. He was sentenced to a term of two years, made up of a minimum term of nine months and an additional term of fifteen months. Although it does not appear from the remarks on sentence, the transcript reveals that he had undertaken to give evidence against the co-offenders.  
        
        
       John Colin Osborne 
        was aged twenty-three at the time of the offence. He was sentenced to a term of two and a half years, made up of a minimum term of eighteen months and an additional term of twelve months. He also provided assistance to the authorities and the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed was reduced by approximately 40 percent. 
        
        
       Kevin Carrick 
        was aged thirty-five. He was sentenced to a term of five years and nine months, made up of a minimum term of three years six months and an additional term of two years three months. 
        
        
       BQ 
        was aged sixteen and four months. He was sentenced, as was the applicant, to a term of four and a half years divided into equal minimum and additional terms. 
        
       
     35    In sentencing the applicant Judge Shillington did not refer directly to Henry. He did, however, expressly conclude that he should impose upon the applicant a sentence of the same effect as that imposed by Judge Bellear on BQ (although he also observed that, as the applicant was a juvenile, ordinary questions of parity were of no real relevance) and this is the sentence he did impose. It is evident, therefore, that, although unexpressed, the Henry guideline explains the sentence his Honour selected. It was derived from Judge Bellear’s sentence which was in turn expressly derived from Henry. It is, moreover, in total, the midpoint on the range specified in the guideline. 
      
       
     36    The offence the applicant committed was, by application of the definition in s 3(1) of the Act, a “serious children’s indictable offence”. That is so because it is punishable, pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act  1900, by penal servitude for twenty-five years. Pursuant to s 17 of the Act it was necessary for the applicant to be dealt with “according to law”. This meant that the broad sentencing options relevant to the sentencing of children for which provision is made in Part 3 of the Act were unavailable. It did not, however, exclude the application of the principles stated in s 6 of the Act (see below), although those principles are to be applied in the light of all relevant circumstances, including, of course, the seriousness of the crime for which the offender is being sentenced. The principles stated are not such as to dictate a particular result in any given case. In particular, principles (c) and (d) could not, in this case, operate to avoid the imposition of a full time custodial sentence.  
      
       
        
       The application 
        
       
     37    The principal argument advanced on the application was that, having regard to the applicant’s age, the Henry guideline was inapplicable. Counsel for the applicant placed particular reliance upon two previous judgments of this court. In R v Jack Sua [2000] NSWCCA 94; unreported, 23 February 2000, the applicant had been found guilty by a jury of an offence of armed robbery committed when he was just short of seventeen years of age. Hidden J, with whom Carruthers AJ agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Passing reference was made to the guideline judgment in  
         R v Henry and Ors 
          (46 NSWLR 346), but it does not appear that much assistance is available from that case. I take the guidelines to be applicable to adult offenders and not to embrace the special facts governing the sentencing of children. The principles governing the sentencing of children are well known.” 
         
        
       
     38    In R v RLS [2000] NSWCCA 175; unreported, 1 May 2000, the applicant had pleaded guilty to a number of armed robbery offences, all committed when he was sixteen years of age. Referring to Henry, Hulme J, with whom Carruthers AJ also agreed, referred to Henry and then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I acknowledge that the applicant is of a younger age than contemplated in the guidelines.” 
         
        
       
     39    Counsel for the applicant also drew attention to particular provisions of the Act. These included s 6, which bears the heading “Principles Relating to the Exercise of Criminal Jurisdiction”(in relation to children). A child is defined in s 3 as a person under the age of eighteen years. The principles are stated in s 6 as: 
      
       
        
         
         6. Principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction  
          
          
         A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles:  
          
         (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them,  
          
         (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance,  
          
         (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption,  
          
         (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home,  
          
         (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.  
         
        
       
     40    One matter on which the parties joined issue may now be disposed of. That concerned whether the Henry guideline was intended to apply to offenders who, by reason of their age, are “children” within the meaning of the Act. Counsel for the applicant argued that the Henry guideline was not intended to, and does not, apply to juvenile offenders. Senior counsel for the Crown argued that, because the guideline specifically incorporated youthfulness as one of the features in the category to which it is expressed to apply, it should be taken to have been intended to encompass “children” as defined in the Act. In my opinion the Crown argument elevates the use of the phrase “young offender” beyond what was intended. As I interpret the judgment, the phrase “young offender” was not intended to include “children” so defined. Support for that view is to be derived from the fact that of the seven offenders whose cases were considered in conjunction with the guideline, only one was a “child” within that definition. All others were young adults. It was offenders in this latter category to whom the consideration of the court was principally directed. The reference to “young offender” has nothing to do with “children” as it appears in the Act. That does not mean that the guideline is of no relevance to offenders under the age of eighteen years. Like all guideline judgments, Henry is to be applied flexibly. There will be cases in which greater weight is to be given to particular facts. For example, a plea of guilty where the Crown case is not strong will attract a greater discount than may otherwise be the norm.  
      
       
     41    The youth of an offender may also, in particular circumstances, attract a measure of leniency not extended to older offenders. In this regard it is necessary to bear in mind the well established principle that offenders who engage in very serious crimes, or crimes more commonly associated with older individuals, may forfeit all or some of their claims to leniency: R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128. 
      
       
     42    When it is remembered that the guideline sentence promulgated in Henry is non prescriptive and has inbuilt a high degree of elasticity, the applicant’s argument, it seems to me, evaporates. The youth of an offender is a relevant factor in the sentencing consideration, to be given the appropriate weight, together with all other relevant factors. 
      
       
     43    To the extent that it may be thought that the court either in Sua or RLS intended to exclude the application of guideline sentences (whether in relation to offences of armed robbery, or any of the other offences which have been the subject of guideline judgments) to children, I respectfully consider them to have overstated the position. It is, in any event, to be borne in mind that each was a judgment of a bench of this court constituted by two judges in accordance with s 6AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, sub s 2 of which envisages that disputed issues of general principle will not be decided by the court so constituted. In my opinion neither of the benches in question intended to state any general principle as to the applicability or non-applicability of guideline judgments to juvenile offenders and should not be read as having done so. 
      
       
     44    I am, accordingly, satisfied that no error in principle has been demonstrated by reason alone of the fact that, in an indirect way, the sentence imposed on the applicant derived from the Henry guideline. 
      
       
     45    That does not finally dispose of the application. On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that, even taking Henry as a starting point, the weight given to certain mitigating factors was inadequate. These factors were identified as the applicant’s youth, his level of involvement in the planning of and preparation for the offence, his guilty plea and the circumstances in which it came to be entered, and the remorse that was evident from those circumstances. The fact that the guideline extends the sentencing of children does not mean that it would not be proper in appropriate cases to impose a sentence below the range stated. 
      
       
     46    The pre-Henry authorities that are directed to sentencing of young offenders are readily adaptable to the application of guideline judgments. The principles have been so frequently stated that little is to be gained from further exposition: youth is a factor that may operate to reduce the emphasis to be placed on considerations of general deterrence and retribution; but that principle itself is counterbalanced where the offence is one more commonly expected of an adult offender: Pham and Ly; R v Hearne [1999] NSWCCA 605 at para 76, and the cases there cited; R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37, and the cases there cited. 
      
       
     47    Armed robbery is classically an offence of the kind in which the leniency otherwise attracted by youth may be diminished. The applicant could therefore gain little comfort from his youth in this sentencing process. 
      
       
     48    I have mentioned above the circumstances of the applicant’s involvement, his prior almost clear record, and the circumstances in which he entered his plea of guilty. These are matters that were expressly taken into account by the sentencing judge; there is nothing in the remarks on sentence to suggest that they were given inadequate weight. The thrust of the submission made on behalf of the applicant was that, from the ultimate sentence itself, it should be inferred that insufficient attention was given to one or more of these factors. 
      
       
     49    Having considered all of these matters, I am unpersuaded that such error has been demonstrated. In my opinion the sentence was, in all the circumstances, fairly heavy, but not outside the range of the sentencing discretion legitimately available. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

        JUDGMENT 
        
        
        
        
       
     1    CARRUTHERS AJ: I will ask Badgery-Parker AJ to give the first judgment. 
      
       
     2    BADGERY-PARKER AJ: In the District Court at Parramatta on 3 November 1999 the applicant, Shaun Vincent Patrick Donnelly, was indicted on a charge that on 24 March 1999 at Guildford he supplied the prohibited drug Methylamphetamine in an amount of 10.9 grams, which exceeds the trafficable quantity. He pleaded not guilty. On the following day the jury returned a guilty verdict and on 10 December 1999 his Honour Judge Nield imposed a total sentence of thirty-five months imprisonment, commencing 4 November 1999 and to expire on 3 October 2002, in respect of which his Honour fixed a minimum term of twenty-six months, which, having commenced on 4 November 1999, would expire on 3 January 2002, and an additional term thereafter of nine months. 
      
       
     3    The full term of thirty-five months took into account that the applicant had served approximately one month in custody in respect of the offence, having been arrested on 24 March 1999 and not released on bail until 22 April of that year. 
      
       
     4    On 31 March 2000 the applicant was an inmate of the Industrial Training Centre in the Long Bay Training complex serving the sentence imposed upon him at Parramatta. On that day he escaped. He was arrested later the same day and returned to custody. 
      
       
     5    At the Downing Centre District Court on 17 August 2000, before his Honour Judge Howie, he pleaded guilty to a charge of escape from lawful custody, contrary to s 30 of the Correctional Centres Act. In addition, he asked the sentencing judge to take into account three matters on a Form 1 under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act; namely, one offence of stealing a motor vehicle and two offences of larceny, all committed in the course of the escape. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of twenty-one months, to commence at the expiration of the minimum term of the previous sentence; that is, on 4 January 2002, and to expire on 3 October 2003. In respect of that sentence his Honour fixed a non-parole period of ten months which, having commenced on 4 January 2002, would expire on 3 November 2002. 
      
       
     6    Before this Court now are two applications for leave to appeal, one in respect of the sentence imposed by Judge Nield and one in respect of the sentence imposed by Judge Howie. However, in relation to the second matter, the applicant does not assert any error on the part of the sentencing judge. The application has been lodged only because, in the event that the appeal against the sentence imposed by Judge Nield should succeed, it would be necessary to adjust the commencement date of Judge Howie's sentence, and to make consequential adjustments to the other relevant dates. 
      
       
     7    At the trial there was no issue about the applicant's possession of a trafficable quantity of Methylamphetamine. His possession of such an amount of that prohibited drug attracted the provisions of s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act of 1985. The offence of supply is created by s 25 of that Act which provides that a person who supplies a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence. By s 3 the concept of ""supply"" is defined as including, inter alia, ""having in possession for supply"". S 29 provides as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          ""A person who has in his or her possession an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the trafficable quantity of the prohibited drug shall, for the purposes of this division, be deemed to have the prohibited drug in his or her possession for supply, unless - 
          
          
          (a) the person proves that he or she had the prohibited drug in his or her possession otherwise than for supply ... "" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     8    A practice has grown up of referring to a charge of supply in which the Crown relies upon s 29 as authority for deemed supply as though the offence were in some way different from the offence of supply created by s 25. It is s 25 that creates the defence. S 29 is an evidentiary provision only, which will ease the Crown of the obligation of proving the intention of supply once possession of the relevant amount is established and places on the accused person the onus of proving, if he or she elects to admit to do so, that the possession of the drug was otherwise than for supply. 
      
       
        
       The following account of the facts is taken directly from Judge Nield's judgment. 
        
         
          ""At about 4.30 pm on 24 March 1999 the prisoner ... was stopped by police for driving his motor vehicle at an excessive speed and in an erratic manner along Woodville Road between Yennora and Guildford. After being stopped by police the prisoner and his vehicle were searched. A plastic bag containing amphetamines ... and a set of electronic scales ... were found in a brief case ... which was on the vehicle's floor behind the driver's seat. Another plastic bag containing amphetamines ... and $1,930 in notes were found in the prisoner's wallet which he had on him. A pipe smoker's tool ... containing a spoon was found in the shorts which the prisoner was wearing. 
          
          
         The prisoner was arrested and taken to Merrylands Police Station. At the police station the prisoner was interviewed. The interview was recorded by video and audiotape ... during the interview the prisoner admitted his possession of the amphetamine, spoon, scales and money and, as to the amphetamine, said that he had obtained it for his personal use some months earlier ... the amphetamine was weighed and found to weigh 10.9 grams and analysed and found to be 34.5 per cent pure."" 
          
         
        
       
     9    At the trial the applicant did not contest possession of the trafficable amount of the drug. Consequently the only issue was whether his possession of the drugs was otherwise than for supply; that is, for his personal use and consequently the trial was relatively short. The evidence and counsel's addresses occupied the whole of 3 November and the judge's summing up was delivered on the following day. The jury returned its verdict on that second day. The sentencing proceedings commenced the same day, and were subsequently adjourned to 10 December. Judge Nield refused bail and so the applicant has been in custody since 4 November 1999, for which reason the judge appropriately directed that the sentence which he imposed should commence on that date. 
      
       
     10    The sentencing judgment delivered by Judge Nield on 10 December appropriately and carefully reviews the salient features of the case. These included the prisoner's criminal record, which contained a number of offences relating to the possession or the supply of the prohibited drug. Most relevant among these was a sentence of imprisonment for three years, with a minimum and additional term each of eighteen months, imposed in the District Court at Campbelltown on 23 November 1993. The judge appropriately commented that the offence was a serious one, and that people who supply prohibited drugs must be dealt with in an appropriately salutary way. He noted as an aggravating feature that at the date of the offence the prisoner was on bail, pending the hearing of an appeal following conviction for offences committed on 30 July 1998 and 23 December 1998, and on bail pending a hearing in relation to another offence allegedly committed on 23 December 1998. 
      
       
       The written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant raised only one matter. The ground of appeal is expressed in the following terms: 
        
        
         
         ""The sentence imposed on the applicant expressly disallowed credit on sentence because he had not pleaded guilty to the offence but, in the particular circumstances of the applicant's case, some discount should have been allowed."" 
          
          
         
        
       What Judge Nield said in relation to the prisoner's plea was this: 
        
        
         
         ""The prisoner does not get any discount which would have followed a guilty plea. An offender cannot be forced to plead guilty, no matter how strong the strength of the Crown case. And a prisoner cannot be punished more severely for having pleaded not guilty in the face of a strong Crown case. However, as I have said already, the prisoner does not obtain any discount in sentence which would have followed a guilty plea."" 
          
         
        
       
     11    The submission on behalf of the applicant comes down to this: the indictable offence of supplying a prohibited drug has the following elements: (1) possession of the requisite quantity of the drug; (2) possession of that quantity of the drug for the purpose of supply. In respect of the second element, the Legislature deems it to be established by the mere fact of possession of such quantity of the drug, unless the accused establishes on the balance of probabilities that his possession of the drug was not for the purpose of supply. 
      
       
     12    The applicant admitted to police, and at the trial did not contest, the first element of the offence. He disputed the second element and so undertook the task of persuading the jury on the balance of probabilities that the drug was in his possession for his own use. Because he did not contest the first element, but only the second, he should receive a discount on his sentence, upon a principle analogous to that established by statute and common law in respect of a plea of guilty. 
      
       
     13    Inasmuch as a plea of guilty attracts a discount, not merely because it is an indication of contrition, but upon purely utilitarian grounds (R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) NSWLR 383) so on purely utilitarian grounds the judge ought to have allowed a discount in this case. 
      
       
     14    The oral submissions put today went a little further, and suggested that the willingness of the applicant to admit possession of the drug, as he did in the course of the recorded interview, and not to contest that issue at the trial might also be seen as some evidence of contrition attracting a discount, not in the manner of a plea of guilty but in the manner in which ordinarily any genuine expression of contrition is viewed. 
      
       
     15    Counsel's written submissions sought to justify a claim for discount by comparing the relevant statute law of this State with the law in other jurisdictions; for example, in England, where the Crown is required to prove the intent to supply without the benefit of a deeming provision, and under the Commonwealth Customs Act where, in respect of a prosecution for possession of a trafficable quantity, the question of an absence of intention to supply arises only in the sentencing stage of the proceedings. 
      
       
     16    With respect, those considerations are simply irrelevant to the present case. What this Court has to apply is the law of New South Wales, the substance of which is as set out above. 
      
       
     17    The argument put orally today that the admission of possession of the drug should have been viewed by the sentencing judge as a display of contrition seems to me to be entirely without merit. The fact of the matter is that the applicant was found by the police to be in possession of those drugs. They were shown to him in the course of the electronically recorded interview and his admission of his possession of them is recorded both visually and audibly. 
      
       
        
       
     18    The argument that a discount should have been allowed on a utilitarian basis analogous to that applicable in respect of a plea of guilty is not supported by any authority. In Thomson v Houlton supra there is nothing in the judgment to suggest that a discount of sentence should be allowed on utilitarian grounds in respect of conduct of the applicant, short of a plea of guilty. 
      
       
        
       
     19    It is, of course, well established that the applicant may receive credit in the sentencing stage because, for example, of voluntary surrender to the police and assistance given to the police in the investigation of the crime, or in relation to unrelated matters, but it was not and could not have been suggested that this applicant was entitled to any discount in those respects. 
      
       
        
       
     20    It is not necessary in this appeal to attempt to determine whether as a matter of principle there is a right in every case to a sentencing discount by reason of the making of sensible admissions which shorten the trial because, as it seems to me, even if the sort of principles which the applicant contends were clearly established, the facts of this case would not attract its application in any way beneficial to him. 
      
       
        
       
     21    The fact is that even if the Crown case had been contested in every respect, the trial would still have been very brief. The Crown case that the applicant was in possession of the relevant amount of the drug was not only not contested but was, realistically, impossible to contest. The duration of the trial was not significantly reduced by reason of the stance adopted by the applicant. 
      
       
     22    In the absence of a plea of guilty, a judge and jury were required, as were a Crown Prosecutor and instructing officer. Court staff were still required. Witnesses were still required. In short, any utilitarian value which could be attributed to the accuser’s willingness to admit those elements of the offence in respect of which the Crown bore the onus was minuscule. 
      
       
     23    For those reasons, I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

       BADGERY-PARKER AJ 
       : I turn then to the second matter, the appeal against the sentence imposed by Judge Howie. Since the Court has not interfered with the sentence imposed by Judge Nield, there is no need for this Court to make any adjustment in relation to the sentence imposed by Judge Howie. 
        
        
       In respect of that matter I propose simply that the appeal be struck out.

        JUDGMENT 
         
        
       
     1    POWELL JA: On 26 June 2000, the Appellants, John Bernard Donnelly (""Donnelly"") and John Charles Troth (""Troth""), were jointly indicted before Shillington DCJ at the Sydney District Court on the following charge: 
      
       
        
         
         ""That they between 1 July 1993 and 1 July 1995 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did conspire to cheat and defraud Cementaid (NSW) Pty. Limited."" 
         
        
       
     2    To that charge the Appellants pleaded not guilty and they were tried before his Honour and a jury of twelve.  
      
       
     3    On 10 July 2000, following a trial which occupied a little over eleven days, the jury returned verdicts of guilty against each of the Appellants. 
      
       
     4    On 6 October 2000, Shillington DCJ sentenced each of the Appellants to imprisonment for a period of 3 years comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months to commence on 6 October 2000 and to expire on 5 January 2003, with a parole period of 9 months to commence on 6 January 2003 and to expire on 5 October 2003. 
      
       
     5    Cementaid (NSW) Pty. Limited (""Cementaid"") - which was a subsidiary of a company known as Aldred & Co. Pty. Limited (""Aldred"") - and which occupied factory premises at Lilyfield was, at all material times, a manufacturer of chemicals for use as ad-mixtures and additives for cement and concrete and as surface treatments for coating concrete and other building materials. The function of the chemicals manufactured by Cementaid was to alter the properties of cement and concrete so as to make the cement and concrete water-proof, or corrosion proof, or dust proof, or to stop oil or grease being absorbed into concrete, or to stop mould growing on brick work. All told, Cementaid made some thirty-three different products, most of which were made in the factory at Lilyfield. 
      
       
     6    The raw materials required by Cementaid took varying forms, some being in powder form and others being in a liquid form, some of the chemicals produced by Cementaid being water based and others using petroleum solvents such as xylene. Those raw materials were supplied by a variety of suppliers such as Orica Australia Pty. Limited (formerly called ICI Operations Pty. Limited) and Shell Chemicals (Australasia) Trading Pty. Limited. When delivered, the raw materials came in a variety of forms, some in bags, some in 20 litre pails, some in 200 litre drums and others, such as xylene, which came in bulk, in tankers which were then pumped out into underground tanks at the factory premises. 
      
       
     7    When required for manufacturing products, the raw materials were taken out of storage and placed into large vats, up to 9000 litres in capacity, where they were mixed. Once mixing was completed, the products were ""drummed off"" or decanted into various sized containers, such as 5 litres pails, 20 litre drums and 200 litre drums, the latter being the size of drum most commonly used. Because the 200 litre drum was the size of the drum most commonly used, and because of the nature of some of the chemicals supplied in such drums, some of the drums when returned to the factory could not be reused, or could not be reused without being refurbished, so that Cementaid was obliged to obtain regular supplies of refurbished 200 litre drums. Although Cementaid was capable of manufacturing thirty-three chemicals, two such chemicals, Caltide and 3CC which is similar to Caltide but incorporates one less component, represented 70% of Cementaid's business. It was usual to produce two batches of those products per week, each batch producing forty-four 200 litre drums of product.  
      
       
     8    The Appellant Troth was employed by Cementaid between 1988 and August 1995 as the senior factory operator. In that capacity he had two sets of duties, the first, as a factory operator, to run the factory, and the second, as the senior factory operator, to advise and assist other factory operators in other Cementaid factories around the country.  
      
       
     9    In his capacity as a factory operator, Troth was required to liaise with those members of Cementaid's staff who were selling product so as to ensure that, at all times, there was product available to fulfil orders; he was to purchase whatever raw materials and reconditioned drums might be needed from time to time in order that product might be manufactured to fulfil such orders as might from time to time be obtained; he was required to keep records of raw materials and refurbished drums supplied to the factory, of product manufactured, and of product delivered to interstate branches of Cementaid and, as well, was required, on a monthly basis, to conduct a physical stock-take of raw materials, refurbished drums and product in the factory premises, the results of which stock-take, together with the other records, were to be provided to Cementaid's accountancy staff in order that the information might be entered into the company's computer so that a monthly report might be produced - it would appear the computer had been so programmed as to produce a theoretical stock-sheet relating to raw materials, packages, drums and finished product held at the factory to enable there to be a reconciliation with the results of the monthly physical stock-take. 
      
       
     10    As the person responsible for ordering raw materials and refurbished drums, Troth had control of Cementaid's purchase order books. As supplies were required he would telephone suppliers, obtain a quote for delivery of the supplies in question, write out a purchase order and send it to the supplier or hand it to the supplier when the order was delivered. When supplies arrived at the factory premises, Troth was required to check the supplies which had been delivered against the order and against the supplier's delivery docket to ensure that what had been ordered had in fact been supplied and that the quantities recorded on the supplier's delivery docket had in fact been supplied and then, if the check were satisfactory, to stamp the supplier's delivery docket and sign it. The receipt of those materials was then to be entered by Troth in a Material Inwards Report. Either at the time of delivery or later the supplier would forward an invoice for the goods the subject of the delivery docket which invoice appears then to have been approved for payment by Troth. 
      
       
     11    When he produced product, Troth was required to prepare a production report listing the product he had produced on a day to day basis and showing the size of the container in which the product which had been produced had been stored. When product was transferred interstate, Troth was required to prepare a ""Stock Transfers"" record.  
      
       
     12    Although the materials which are before the Court are not entirely clear, it would appear that, prior to October 1993, the relevance of which date will shortly appear, Cementaid had but one supplier of refurbished 200 litre drums, that supplier being a company known as A1 Drums Pty. Limited (""A1 Drums""), which company, in addition to supplying refurbished drums to Cementaid seems also to have been used by Cementaid to remove from its premises for disposal or destruction, drums which were no longer able to be reused by Cementaid in its operations. A1 Drums, however, did not purchase from Cementaid for refurbishment drums which had previously been used by Cementaid because of its operations. 
      
       
     13    As from October, or, perhaps it was November, 1993 a company known as Drum Distributors NSW Pty. Limited (""Drum Distributors"") commenced to supply Cementaid with refurbished drums and from time to time to remove from Cementaid's factory for disposal or destruction, drums which had previously been used but which were no longer capable of being used by Cementaid in the course of its operations. Despite this, A1 Drums continued its relationship with Cementaid as before, a situation which appears to have continued until about the end of June 1995. In addition, so the Appellants claimed, during that period of one year and eight months, Drum Distributors acquired from Mr. Troth for refurbishing drums which had been used by Cementaid in the course of its operations but which needed to be refurbished before they could be reused, those drums being paid for by cheques drawn to cash on Drum Distributors' bank account and deposited to the credit of Troth's personal bank account.  
      
       
     14    It was the dealings between Drum Distributors and Cementaid and the payments made by Drum Distributors to Troth in the period from late October, or early November, 1993 to the end of June 1995 which formed the basis for the charge upon which the Appellants were indicted and later convicted. Reduced to its most simple form, the Crown's case was that, as the result of an agreement between Troth and Donnelly, on some thirty occasions during that period: 
      
       
        
       (a) Troth wrote out ""orders"" for the supply by Drum Distributors to Cementaid of 200 litre drums; 
        
        
       (b) in respect of each of those ""orders"" Donnelly prepared, or had prepared, for signature by Troth, a ""delivery docket""; 
        
        
       (c) each such ""delivery docket"" was stamped and signed by Troth; 
        
        
       (d) no drums were delivered to Cementaid's premises in respect of any such ""order"" or ""delivery docket""; 
        
        
       (e) Donnelly prepared, or had prepared, an ""invoice"" in respect of each such ""order"" and ""delivery docket""; 
        
        
       (f) each such ""invoice"" when received was passed by Troth for payment;  
        
        
       (g) the amounts which were paid by Cementaid to Drum Distributors in respect of such ""invoices"" totalled some $116,990.00; 
        
        
       (h) neither on his own behalf nor on behalf of Cementaid did Troth make any record of the drums which he claimed to have sold to Drum Distributors for refurbishment; 
        
        
       (i) no conventional accounting record was kept by Donnelly or by Drum Distributors of the drums which it was claimed had been bought for refurbishment by Drum Distributors from Troth or Cementaid; the only form of ""record"" which Donnelly claimed to have being the butts of the cash cheques which had been credited to Troth's bank account, which butts were marked in some form of private code to indicate that the proceeds of the cheque were intended to pay for drums which had been purchased for refurbishment; 
        
        
       (j) the total amount of the cheques so drawn and paid to the credit of Troth's bank account was $49,433.00. 
        
       
     15    I record below the evidence which was tendered on behalf of the Crown for the purpose of establishing that case.  
      
       
     16    The first witness who was called was Mr. Bargwanna, an accountant who, in 1995, was employed by Aldred & Co which, as I have earlier recorded, was Cementaid's holding company, as an assistant accountant. In that capacity, so it would seem, he was also involved with the accounting and other records kept by Cementaid.  
      
       
     17    Mr. Bargwanna first summarised what were Mr. Troth's duties, in particular those relating to the keeping of records, and indicated that through the course of each month the information which was produced would be entered into Cementaid's computer which was so programmed as to produce an interim stock report which recorded what, on the basis of such information, the stock should be, which stock figure could be compared with the result of the physical stock check taken at the end of each month. 
      
       
     18    Mr. Bargwanna said that, in July 1995, he did a reconciliation of the computer produced stock figure with the result of the physical stock count and noted that there was a variance or a discrepancy in relation to the empty 200 litre drum stock. Having done so, and with a view to ascertaining the possible cause of that variance or discrepancy, Mr. Bargwanna went back to Cementaid's records to obtain Drum Distributors' invoices for the month of June 1995. He located Drum Distributors' delivery docket No. 3958 dated 3 June 1995 with an invoice from Drum Distributors bearing the same date and same number, the delivery docket having been stamped and signed by Mr. Troth. Despite that fact the Material Inwards Report for the week ending 9 June 1995 contained no record of the receipt of the drums the subject of that delivery docket and that invoice. Mr. Bargwanna found two further Drum Distributors' delivery dockets for the month of June 1995, No. 3831 dated 10 June 1995 and No. 3974 dated 17 June 1995 with corresponding invoices, the receipt of the drums the subject of each of those delivery docket not being recorded in the relevant Material Inwards Reports.  
      
       
     19    In the light of the discrepancies which he had thus far discovered, Mr. Bargwanna continued to check further into Cementaid's records. As the result of his doing so, he discovered that, in the period from the beginning of November 1993 up to and including the end of May 1995, there were a further twenty-seven Drum Distributors' delivery dockets and associated invoices, the drums the subject of which delivery dockets were not recorded in the relevant Material Inwards Reports as having been received at the factory at Lilyfield. 
      
       
     20    Mr. Bargwanna produced a schedule of the thirty orders from Cementaid and the related Drum Distributors' delivery dockets and invoices, the drums the subject of which had not been recorded in related material inwards reports, the total amount of the invoices being $116,990.00. 
      
       
     21    In the course of Mr. Bargwanna's cross-examination by counsel for Troth, it was suggested to him that one of the terms of Troth's employment was that, if he (Troth) were able to find someone willing to purchase 200 litre drums which could not be reused without first being refurbished, he was entitled to sell them and to keep the proceeds of sale for himself, a suggestion with which Mr. Bargwanna was unable to agree. 
      
       
     22    The next witness who was called in the Crown case was Mr. Pearce who, in 1995 and 1996, was the accountant for Aldred & Co. and Cementaid and, as such, was responsible for the financial administration of Cementaid. 
      
       
     23    In the course of recording the system for the ordering, receipts and payment for raw materials and stock, Mr. Pearce said of the Material Inwards Report: 
      
       
        
         
         ""It's a very important document from an accounting point of view. It's used to highlight the stock coming into the warehouse if it's going into stock and that's the way the information is recorded. As stocks coming in and going out and it's needed for matching the issuing invoices that we received from suppliers if we ever needed to go back and refer back to the particular date from the delivery point of view."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     24    Mr. Pearce said that, on 11 July 1995, Mr. Bargwanna spoke to him and advised him of the stock discrepancies concerning 200 litre drums for the month of June which he had discovered and that, as the result of that conversation, he spoke to Troth and asked him to recheck his figures and to see if there were some reasonable explanation for the discrepancy which Mr. Bargwanna had discovered. 
      
       
     25    On 13 July 1995, there was a meeting between Mr. Pearce, Mr. Bargwanna and a Mr. Bruce, another accountant, who, at that time, had been retained by Aldred & Co. as a consultant for the purpose of preparing the year-end accounts, reconciliation accounts and the year end financial reports for Aldred & Co. and its various subsidiary companies. As the result of that meeting, it was decided that Mr. Pearce and Mr. Bruce should conduct a full audit in respect of the 200 litre drums purchased by Cementaid for the year 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1995. For that purpose, Mr. Pearce and Mr. Bruce obtained the orders delivered to both A1 Drums and Drum Distributors during that period, the delivery dockets and invoices delivered to Cementaid by each of those two companies, the Material Inwards Reports prepared by Troth for that period and the record of material produced by Troth. 
      
       
     26    On 14 July 1995, Troth spoke to Mr. Pearce and told him that he had discovered the reason why there was an imbalance in the numbers of 200 litre drums, the reason being that he had signed for a delivery of drums that the company had not received. On the following Monday, 17 July 1995, Troth saw Mr. Pearce again and showed him a delivery docket and invoice, both numbered No. 3974 and dated 17 June 1995 which delivery docket and invoice he said related to the drums in question. When asked why he had signed for drums which had not been delivered Troth replied to the effect that the drums were going to be delivered later that day and that ""the paperwork had in fact turned up earlier than the drums."" 
      
       
     27    In the course of his evidence at the trial, Mr. Pearce read from a written statement which he had made in August 1995: 
      
       
        
         
         ""… On Monday 17 July 1995 John came into my office. He was holding a number of invoices. John said, 'We didn't get the drums at all. Out of all of the invoices that we are charged for by Drum Distributors we did get (sic) one delivery which was invoice No. 3974.' John then showed me the invoice No. 3974. I said, 'Why did you sign a delivery docket that you didn't receive?' He said 'The girl from Drum Distributors had come in with the paper work prior to the drum being delivered. I stamped them and signed the delivery docket and invoice because both paper work (sic) arrived at the same time. I spoke to the company and they told me that didn't have drums to supply which is why I didn't get the drums which were on the invoice.' John then told me that he shouldn't have put the paper work for the non-deliveries through to be approved by his manager for payment as it was an accident that had got through to the accounts department for processing."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     28    Although, at the meeting which was held on 13 July 1995, it was agreed that Mr. Pearce and Mr. Bruce would carry out a full audit for the financial year 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1995, Mr. Bruce was later to extend his investigations to cover the period from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1994. Various documents which were examined by Mr. Bruce in the course of his inquiries were described by him in his evidence at trial as including: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Invoice, original invoice, the original material inward reports, records, sales reports, sales information would have come from an inventory profit report, I believe it was, as with some sampling, back to original documents to make sure giving a good indication, the stock records came in a summarised form from the inventory status report with again, a sampling and verification back to the originals of that. It was easier to get out of the status report than the original stock-take sheets."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       and as including stock transfer sheets, production schedules, and stock-take records. 
        
       
     29    As a result of his inquiries, Mr. Bruce confirmed that the drums the subject of the thirty delivery dockets and invoices which had earlier been identified by Mr. Bargwanna were not recorded in the relevant Material Inwards Reports. Further, as the result of his inquiries, Mr. Bruce was later able to prepare a number of spread sheets, to some of which I will later refer, which were tendered at trial. 
      
       
     30    The order forms relating to those thirty delivery dockets and invoices were then assembled and discussed by Mr. Pearce with Mr. Aldred, the two of whom interviewed Troth in the afternoon of 2 August 1995. The nature of the conversation is sufficiently indicated by the following passages in Mr. Aldred's evidence in chief at trial: 
      
       
        
         
         ""I asked John to come into my office. I said to him, 'I have a problem here and if I have a big problem here that means you've got a very big problem'. I then said to him, 'I have been looking at the accounts and I have had the accounts checked for drum purchases' and I said, 'It appears that we have purchased some 7000 drums that were never ever delivered here'. And John said, 'Well, I don't know what you mean'. So then I showed John these documents in front of me. 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         I had heaps of them. I started with the first one which was the one that we first found out there was trouble … 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         He did say, he said to me 'I don't know what you're talking about, I can't explain it'. So I said, 'Here' and I explained. I said, 'Here is the purchase order you have signed. Here's the delivery docket you have signed as telling me the drums came in. Here is an invoice you have signed saying yes, we received the goods, we should pay and you signed'. And I said, 'Here's a material inwards thing and it says, it doesn't say I got the drums John and I've already paid money. Where are the drums'? He said, 'I don't know, I can't explain'. Just about every question I asked for three hours …  
         
        
        
         
         I asked again, I said, 'I want to know what's happened to these drums'. He said, 'I don't know, I can't explain'. 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         I asked him, I asked him about the June orders where there was supposedly 400 drums delivered. I said, 'Where are the 400 drums'? I was told by Mr. Pearce that - 'You told him that the drums were coming, one truck broke down so it turned around and went back for something and you then asked to sign the driver's receipt which you signed. Why did you do that'? And he said, 'Well, because they were going to give us a credit note'. I said, 'Where is the credit note'? He said, 'I don't know, I can't explain; I don't know, I can't explain'. 
         
        
        
         
         That went on till 3.30, 'I don't know, I can't explain'. At the end of this period I said to John, 'I will get to the bottom of this. We will stay here, we will do this till we find out'. He said, 'I've got to go home now'. And I said, 'It doesn't matter if you go home. Tomorrow morning when you come to work we'll start with the same question, what happened'? 'I don't know, I can't explain, I've got to go home now'. I allowed him to leave, it was nearly 3.30 which is roughly the time he goes home anyway and he left the premises."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     31    On the following day Troth saw Mr. Pearce and handed him the keys to the factory saying ""I'm leaving the company"" and then left the premises. 
      
       
     32    On the following day, Mr. Aldred received in the mail a handwritten note by Troth resigning his employment.  
      
       
     33    Later that day Mr. Aldred, accompanied by his father, who was the governing director of Aldred & Co., went to the premises of Drum Distributors at Bankstown where he spoke to Donnelly. The general nature of his conversation then, and of a later telephone conversation, sufficiently appears from the following passage in Mr. Aldred's evidence in chief at trial: 
      
       
        
         
         ""I introduced myself, I said, 'I am the Michael Aldred'. I said 'I am the managing director of Cementaid New South Wales'. I introduced my father Peter Aldred as the governing director. I said I was at his offices to discuss the matter of thousands of missing drums. He said, 'Come in', took us into the office. I said to him, 'I have a problem with John Troth in that he has ordered drums, signed for drums that were supposed to be delivered, okayed invoices for drums that were supposedly delivered, but these drums never came to our premises'. And I said, 'I am missing about 7000 drums'. John Troth (sic) said, 'No, I don't know anything about that'. He said that everything, he said 'I have books and receipts and invoices showing everything that has been ordered I delivered and it's all been signed for by members of your company'. And I said, 'That may be but it doesn't gel with my books. I am missing 7000 drums'. 
         
        
        
         
         I said, 'I want to particularly ask you about deliveries in June where John Troth told me you were to deliver 400 drums and that a truck broke down and you only delivered 200 and they never turned up'. And he told me, 'John Troth', he said 'is a liar'. He said, 'I have always delivered what was ordered' and I said, 'Well, it tells me you didn't deliver this'. He said, 'John Troth is a liar'. I said, 'Well, well, I need to get to the bottom of this'. I said, 'There's a lot of money at stake'. Then Donnelly offered to show me his books and he did produce an account book, he showed it to me at the premises at the time, the deliveries, and he had dockets signed by John Troth. I said, 'I can't reconcile your account books right here and now. I don't have the documents. I don't know, I don't have the papers but I assure you I'm going to get to the bottom of this matter'. He said, 'I didn't pinch anything, it's nothing to do with me, you talk to John Troth', and was the last I saw of John Donnelly until this matter. 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         I never saw him but Donnelly did ring up and ask me for payment of money that he said that we owed him. I said, 'Well, it's in the hands of the police', and I said, 'I'm not going to pay you anything until the police tell me. I can't pay you anything until its clear and until I know you haven't been stealing'. He said, 'Well, when will that be'? And I said, 'When the police are ready they will tell me'. He said, 'Well, you know, what I did was okay. What I did was right'.  
         
        
        
         
         I said, 'I'm missing 7000 drums. I'm not going to pay you anything until I get it'. And he said, 'Well, the only thing I did was pay for used drums'. I said, 'I had no idea'. He said, 'We paid him cash, $8.00 a drum'. I said, 'Why are you paying him money'? He had said, 'Because the trade does that'. I said, 'Why don't you give it to the company'? He said, 'The traders did'. I said, 'I'm certainly not going to pay anybody any money who buys off my workers'. So then he said, 'I've done nothing wrong'. And I said, 'Well, until I get clearance from the police I won't pay you'. And he said, 'I will give you a statutory declaration that I haven't done anything'. I said, 'Good, send me one'. He actually sent a stat dec which didn't really say he hadn't done anything wrong."" 
          
         
        
       
     34    As I have previously recorded, Mr. Bruce produced a number of spread sheets to illustrate what was shown by a detailed analysis of the information contained in the documents which he examined during the course of his inquiries. A reference to three of those spread sheets will sufficiently indicate what they disclosed. 
      
       
     35    The first of those spread sheets (Exhibit ""AU"") recorded and compared 200 litre drums invoiced and 200 litre drums recorded on Materials Inward Sheets for the period of 30 months commencing 1 July 1993 and ending 31 December 1995, the ratios between the two figures being compared on a six monthly basis. For the first four months from 1 July 1993 to 31 October 1993, there was a very close correlation between the number of drums invoiced and the number of drums recorded on the Materials Inward Sheets. However, in November 1993, drums invoiced totalled 540 while drums recorded on the relevant Materials Inward Sheets totalled only 260. The ratio of between drums invoiced and drums recorded on the Materials Inward Sheets for the six months ended 31 December 1993 was 1.159. In the six months to 30 June 1994 there were only two months in which there was a close correlation between drums invoiced and drums recorded on Materials Inwards Sheets, they being March and June 1994. The ratio between drums invoiced and drums recorded on Materials Inward Sheets for that period of six months was 1.321. In not one of the six months to 31 December 1994 was there a significant correlation between drums invoiced and drums recorded on Materials Inwards Sheets. Thus, in July 1994, drums invoiced totalled 904 whereas drums recorded totalled only 370; in August 1994, drums invoiced totalled 720 while drums recorded totalled only 200; in September 1994, drums invoiced totalled 1140 while drums recorded totalled only 360; in October 1994, drums invoiced totalled 930 while drums recorded totalled only 510; in November 1994 drums invoiced totalled 490 while drums recorded totalled only 130; in December 1994, drums invoiced totalled 580 while drums recorded totalled only 160; the ratio between drums invoiced and drums recorded during that period of six months being 2.754. The following six months to 30 June 1995 revealed an even greater disparity of which March 1995, in which drums invoiced totalled 1140 while drums recorded totalled only 60 provides a sufficient example; the ratio of drums invoiced to drums recorded in that period of six months was 5.076. By contrast, in the following six months to December 1995, the figures for drums invoiced and drums recorded were identical in five of the months in question, the ratio between drums invoiced and drums recorded being 0.928. The total of drums invoiced over that period thirty months was 14513 while the total of drums recorded on Materials Inwards Sheets for the same period was only 7325. 
      
       
     36    The second of the three spread sheets (Exhibit ""AV"") recorded drums invoiced and drums used in production for the same period of thirty months. In a fashion similar to that recorded in Exhibit ""AU"" there were recorded on a six or seven monthly basis the ratios between drums invoiced and drums used in production over that period. Thus, in the six months to 31 December 1993, there were some 2400 drums invoiced and 1229 drums used in production, the ratio between the two being 1.953. In the period of seven months to 31 July 1994, the ratio of drums invoiced to drums used in production was 2.13; in the six months to 31 January 1995, the ratio of drums invoiced to drums used in production was 3.179; in the five months to 30 June 1995, the ratio of drums invoiced to drums used in production was 2.527. There was a dramatic change in the ratio for the six months to 31 December 1995, the ratio of drums invoiced to drums used in production being 0.48. Over the whole period of thirty months, the total of drums invoiced was 14513 while the total of drums used in production was 8892. 
      
       
     37    The third of those spread sheets (Exhibit ""AY"") depicted, in graph form at two monthly intervals, for the period 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1996 drums purchased, drums signed in, drums used in production and sales and transfers. The pattern which is revealed by the figures prior to November 1993 - on only one occasion did drums purchased exceed 400 - and after June 1995 when drums purchased on no occasion exceeded 200 - is to be contrasted with the period during which Drum Distributors supplied Cementaid with drums - when on only two occasions did drums purchased fall below 400 while on eight occasions drums purchased exceeded 600, six of those occasions being 800 or more, up to 1140 on two of those occasions. 
      
       
     38    The last witness called in the Crown case was Det. Sgt. Power, who, in 1996, had been a plain clothes Senior Constable attached to Balmain Police Station and who, in January 1996, took over the investigations from Det. Prescott, who had commenced the investigations at an earlier time but who was being transferred.  
      
       
     39    Det. Sgt. Power said that, on 18 February 1996, he and Det. Rhodes, who was also stationed at Balmain Police Station, went to Troth's home at East Ryde and there spoke to Troth and asked him to accompany them to Balmain Police Station for the purposes of an interview, in which request Troth acquiesced. 
      
       
     40    In the interview room at the Balmain Police Station Det. Sgt. Power told Troth: 
      
       
        
         
         ""We are making inquiries in relation to a number of inconsistencies in delivery of products whilst you were employed by Cementaid."" 
         
        
        
       and then gave him the conventional caution. He then explained to Troth the procedure to be following in the course of conducting an electronically recorded interview (ERISP) and asked him (Troth) whether he wished to contact a solicitor, to which the latter replied: 
        
        
         
         ""No, I've got nothing to hide."" 
         
        
        
       
     41    In the course of that ERISP: 
      
       
        
       (a) Troth said he received payment by cheque from Drum Distributors from its account at the Engadine branch of Westpac Bank;  
        
        
       (b) the transcript of record of the ERISP contains the following: 
        
        
         
          
           
           ""Q. Would you care to explain to me why Drum Distributors would be writing cheques to you?  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. That's owing to me. The old drums, you either throw them away or if they're good drums - it's all part of a sort of slush fund which I - I didn't share it all of course but everybody got plenty of goodies at the end of the year as far as whisky and beer etc. etc."" 
           
          
         
        
        
       (c) Troth said that the cheques which he received from Drum Distributors were deposited into his personal account at the North Ryde branch of the Commonwealth Bank. 
        
       
     42    In the course of his evidence at trial, Det. Sgt. Power said that, on 27 February 1996, he executed a search warrant on Westpac Banking Corporation and took possession of a number of documents - which I assume to have been the cash cheques which had been paid by Troth to the credit of his bank account at the Commonwealth Bank - relating to Drum Distributors. 
      
       
     43    On 5 March 1996, again accompanied by Det. Rhodes, Det. Sgt. Power went to the premises of Drum Distributors at Bankstown for the purpose of executing another search warrant. At the time he spoke to Donnelly and told him that, at the completion of the search, he intended to take him (Donnelly) to Bankstown Police Station for the purpose of conducting an interview and then gave the conventional caution, to which Donnelly replied: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Yeah, I've got no worries, I'm prepared to show you anything that's here and tell you anything, I've got nothing to hide."" 
         
        
        
       
     44    At the Bankstown Police Station and before conducting the interview, Det. Sgt. Power said to Donnelly: 
      
       
        
         
         ""We are conducting an investigation into certain deliveries of drums from your company to Cementaid at Lilyfield. My investigations cause me to believe that you received payment for the delivery of drums that were not actually received by Cementaid. Further, that as a result you made certain payments to John Troth, an employee of that company. I intend to ask you certain questions about this matter but I want you to understand that you are not obliged to say anything unless you wish as anything you do say may later be used in evidence. Do you understand that?"" 
         
        
        
       to which Donnelly replied: 
        
        
         
         ""Yeah, no problems."" 
         
        
       
     45    As it was during the course of Det. Sgt. Power's oral evidence that the video tapes of the electronically recorded interviews of Donnelly and Troth and the transcripts of those interviews were tendered, as also were a number of documents - such as the cheques and cheque butts which had been obtained by Det. Sgt. Power pursuant to the search warrants which he had executed - the cross-examination of Det. Sgt. Power was not extensive. However, as, on the hearing of the appeal, counsel for Donnelly sought to make a point of it, it is as well that I record here the relevant part of Counsel's written submission on the matter and the evidence to which that submission related.  
      
       
     46    The relevant part of counsel's written submission was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The Crown further relied on a recorded interview (ERISP) between the police and the appellant wherein the appellant allegedly lied to the police (the Crown says the appellant was being truthful), but in any event wherein the appellant said he did not remove orange (Cementaid's colour) drums from Cementaid to be reconditioned or refurbished but rather only raw material drums that were used by suppliers of Cementaid to deliver solvents. These too could be reconditioned by Drum Distributors. The Crown says that the number of such raw material drums that Cementaid could possibly sell to Drum Distributors would not satisfy the total amount paid by it to Troth.  
         
        
        
         
         In evidence it became known that the appellant contacted the police a few days after his interview and advised them that he had listened to the audio tape of the ERISP and wished to correct what he had said and that in fact he had purchased the used orange drums to be reconditioned."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     47    The relevant passage in the cross-examination of Det. Sgt.

Power, so far as is relevant was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. Did he also say to you with respect to the interview that was recorded that we saw that he made a serious mistake in it? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Just to refresh your memory if I might, did he say to you that he misunderstood a question that he had thought when you were questioning him there was something implicit in that he bought reconditioned drums along, put them down on the ground, picked them up and carted them off thus charging for them and being paid to carry them away, something along that line? A. He did make an off the cuff remark in relation to some confusion he felt … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It wasn't off the cuff, it was made face to face with you, he came and you (sic) brought your documents and said look, I may a serious mistake? A. That's correct but the … 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. But what? A. I was going to say sir that the conversation I had with him could be classified as off the record. It was unofficial. 
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: Q. I am not suggesting it was recorded, you didn't take notes of it? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You just recalled it? A. That's correct.

         Q. With respect to the area that we are talking about, it may assist you if you have a copy of Exhibit BB the recorded interview with Mr. Donnelly, I am not suggesting this is implicit but if you go to the bottom of page 49 (shown) - are you able to hear me through this cold can you hear me? A. Reasonably well, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I am sorry, I got (sic) this cold. At the bottom of page 49 above question 280, I just read this out loud, the question is:

           Q. As it had been? A. That's just what I explained to you then.' 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         He went on to say that he didn't buy orange drums from Cementaid, do you recall that area? A. Yes, that's correct.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. That was the area that he wanted to correct with you wasn't it? A. I can't remember the detail of the exact conversation but that was the general nature. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The gist of it was, look, I did buy orange drums and I was confused and I misunderstood you? A. I can't remember the exact nature of the conversation but it was in that area yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That was all that he brought up with you I suggest apart from chit chat and bringing the documents on the Saturday after the Tuesday interview, there was no great moment was there? A. Not that I am aware of, no.""

     49    Troth's evidence in chief was short. Insofar as he dealt with the absence of any record in the Material Inwards Reports of the receipt of the drums the subject of the thirty invoices, his evidence was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q.

He didn't like anybody.' and more or less said; 'I'll fix this guy by - we'll see how clever he is by not indicating everything that comes in and see if he can pick it up or not.' Can you indicate what you meant by that answer to the question? A. To me he was like a smart alec if that makes sense. And he didn't treat me fairly. He didn't treat me correctly and I was - and I did try to get back at him by doing things to the goods inward report.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. What was it that you did in that goods inwards or material inwards report by way of retaliation to him? A. I didn't fill in the most obvious product that was coming in every week.

You're aware that the allegation in this trial is that you had an agreement with Mr. Donnelly to arrange for the invoicing for drums, in the receipt of drums that were not in fact delivered to the company and the payment for him of drums that were not in fact delivered, do you understand that's the allegation? A. I understand that's the allegation.

         ""Q. With respect to the cheques as I understand your evidence, all payments for used drums by Drum Distributors that you received were cheques? A. All cheques. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Never any cash? A. Never any cash.

         Q. And may we take it you never told Mr. Donnelly one way or the other what you were going to do with those cheques? A. That is correct.

         Q. Was that one of the people who sometimes delivered drums either with him or without him, put it that way? A. She came with him and delivered on her own. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So she would either - the drums mostly came on Saturday didn't they? A. That's correct.

         Q. As I understand what you just said Donnelly would come along or the daughter would come along, and could she really deal with these the way you said? A. Better than anybody here. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So she was quite competent to load and unload? A. Very much so. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And sometimes if the load was so big it needed more than one truck to bring them in? A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The pair would come? A. That's correct.

         Q. Did you come to know the name of the young lady who was either bringing drums with her father, or on her own? A. I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What is her name? A. Melissa. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Perhaps I better step back a bit. Did you meet, at least by telephone another Donnelly young lady? A. By? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Telephone? A. I spoke to her on the phone. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was her name Brook? A. Her name was Brook. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And she appeared, at least from your observations to be the young  
          
         lady that took orders when you needed things? A. She was the one that took the orders. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you would place an oral order and confirm it by a written, there would be a confirmation order from Cementaid? A. Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And as I understand what went on, the delivery would be shortly after you placed the order, within days? A. Within two, three days correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And whoever delivered the drums would hand you documents for your signature. One of which was the delivery docket? A. Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And at that time, may we take it, you would hand over your purchase order? A. Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And sometimes, I would suggest, as the time went on more so, you would receive the cash cheques for the drums that had been picked up to go back to Drum Distributors the week before? A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. As I understand it, I'm only giving you my client's instructions, you can agree or disagree as you see fit. As I understand it the situation at first when he, Donnelly, first delivered, he would size up the drums on the spot, pay you on the spot and off he would go? A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And then later on, for whatever reason, he would simply pick them up and get out of there more quickly and you would have to wait to the following week for the cheque? A. After he would inspect them at his yard, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well apparently? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I know your learned counsel asked you whether you in any way shape or form during the years 93, 94 or 95 entered into any agreement with Mr. Donnelly to cheat and defraud Cementaid. I believe you said, no most emphatically. Was there any suggestion by Mr. Donnelly of any such trickery? A. Never. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was there any suggestion by you to Mr. Donnelly of any such trickery? A. No, absolutely not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So I take it your evidence would be, very clearly, there was not even some sort of implicit unspoken arrangement? A. Never.""

         Q. Firstly over that period of time would you agree with me that's a lot of money? A. It's a lot of money all right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It had added considerably to the money in your pocket over the period of time? A. Quite obviously. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did it occur to you that the money ought properly have been given to Cementaid? A. Could you repeat? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did it occur that money ought more properly to be given to Cementaid? A. I thought it was mine, but you know, it's a problem, it could have been theirs. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say it was mine, what possible basis could you have thought …? A. Because I was… 
         
        
        
         
         Q. …I'm sorry let me finish that, that sort of money could possibly be yours as distinct from the company that owned the goods? A. Well it never all happened at once. It was like on a weekly basis that I was getting rid of the drums and I was getting paid for the second-hand drums.

         Q. Yes? A. Other drum companies would take them away they said they're not good. They wouldn't give me money. I asked a manufacture (sic) and I wasn't aware at the time.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. When Drum Distributors came on the scene it was a financial windfall for you wasn't it? A. No, I phoned him up. I looked in the Yellow Pages for another drum supplier. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The $49,000 that you got from Drum Suppliers - Distributors …? A. Distributors.

         Q. Could you think of any other way of putting it? A. Probably not, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Indeed, this was an arrangement that you kept very much to yourself, wasn't it, this arrangement that you had received money for Cementaid's property from Drum Distributors, that was something you kept very much to yourself? A. For the sale of second-hand drums? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. A. Yes, that's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. This business of making reference if you took anyone out ever to drinks or lunch or dinner when it came from the drum man, you weren't referring to the $49,000 were you? A. Of course. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But never the amount? A. No, never the amount. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It would have been an embarrassing thing for you to disclosure (sic) wouldn't it? A. Probably at that stage I didn't know it was 49. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Pardon? A. I wouldn't, I wouldn't know it was $49,000. It probably wasn't that much. The only time I suppose they knew was at lunches and Christmas when I said: 'What would you like for Christmas?' And if asked here it was coming from, 'It was from the drum man'."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     55    At an early stage of his evidence in chief Donnelly, referring to his attendance at Balmain Police Station on 9 March 1996 and his conversation with Det. Sgt. Power gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. When you went, was there some sort of problem with the interview after you listened to the tape? A. Yes, I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you recall the conversation that you had? A. Yes, I do. 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
       I said: 'During the interview I was not completely truthful with you'. He said: 'What do you mean?' I said: 'When you were asking me about empty orange drums I wasn't completely truthful'. And he said: 'In what respect?' And I said: 'That I got confused. I believed that you were intimating that I had dropped a lot of drums there, unused, put them back on the truck and drove away.' And he said: 'Yes?' And I said: 'Well, I did buy drums, orange drums. A lot of orange drums but not that type of drum. So I stayed right away from orange drums from the interview because of the confusion that was, looked like being created over orange drums'. And he said: 'Well, it was a taped interview and I can't do anything about it now.'"" 
        
        
         
        
       
     56    Donnelly then gave evidence as to the operations of Drum Distributors. So far as is relevant it was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. What did you - do - by the by, how many days a week did you work back then? A. Six to seven days a week. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you have a daughter Brooke working there? A. I certainly did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How many days a week did she work? A. Six days a week. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you have a daughter Melissa working for the company? A. Yes, certainly did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How many days a week did she work? A. Six days a week. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Briefly, what was your task within the company, what did you do? A. My task was to be out on the road, buy drums, bring them back into the factory, have them unloaded, delivery of reconditioned drums from out the other end of the factory, around buying drums again. Doing the same thing. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What was Melissa's job? A. Her job was virtually the same as mine.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you ever work together with her? A. Occasionally we worked together. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Let's deal with Brooke, she is your second daughter? A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What was her function within the company? A. To run the office, do the paperwork. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did she ever help out with the loading, unloading, buying, selling any of that? A. No. 
          
         
        
       
     57    When, in the course of his oral evidence in chief, Donnelly came to deal with the question of the delivery of drums to Cementaid he gave the following (inter alia) evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. Now I want to deal with the actual deliveries. And this is only with respect to Cementaid. Was there any particular day or time that you would usually make deliveries to Cementaid? A. Saturday morning, early. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why was that? A. Request of Mr. Troth because it was more convenient. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were you happy to do that? A. Yes, I had no problems to be there at 7 o'clock in the morning. 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         Q. Now lets (sic) us take the Saturday, you come to work, the sun then comes up, I presume. Q. Yes, that's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who would be there? A. There would be my foreman and probably one other to help load the truck. I would, if there was (sic) two trucks Melissa would be there as well. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What about Brooke, would she be there? A. She would be there."" 
          
         
        
       
     58    When he came to deal with the drums the subject of Invoice No. 3974 dated 17 June 1995 Donnelly said that, on that day, the number of the drums involved was such that two trucks were required to deliver them, one truck, which was capable of carrying 180 drums, being driven by himself and the other, capable of carrying 135, drums being driven by his daughter Melissa. Although, so he said, they set off driving in tandem, before they reached Cementaid's premises the truck which he was driving broke down. Accordingly, he stayed with that truck for the time being while Melissa drove on to Cementaid's premises for the purpose of delivering her load and, when she returned, she drove him to a place where he could obtain a replacement spare part when he then installed, following which he, in his turn, drove to Cementaid's premises and delivered the load which the truck he was driving was carrying.  
      
       
     59    When he came to deal with the drums which were removed for disposal or which, so he said, he purchased for the purpose of being refurbished Donnelly gave the following (inter alia) evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. Now with respect to purchasing of drums I think you said you had cash cheques, is that correct? A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And when would those be given over to Mr. Troth? A. At the beginning on the day that I picked the drums up because I would sort them and grade them there and then on the spot. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. This is in 1993, is it? A. That's correct, when we first started. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you eyeball the drums, assess them and pay? A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did that change? A. It did change. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why? A. Because it was just too time consuming for the amount of drums on a Saturday to do that sort of thing; we just had too many other things on.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you have anyone else at your factory who was capable of doing this assessing or appraising of drums? A. Yes, my foreman. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So what was the system after you ceased to inspect them yourself, grade them and pay for them? A. We would take the trucks back or I would take the truck back, depending - park it … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. With something on it? A. Yes, loaded. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. A. Park the truck in the yard, leave it there, hop in another truck and go do whatever else I had to do. On the Monday the foreman would, with a couple of his yardmen, unload the truck, grade his drums into different sections of how many here and how many there, put them in different sections. We would then go to the office and say to Brooke: 'I have so many first grade, so many second grade, so many third grade.' If there was rubbish for removal there was so many removed. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Let's talk about the rubbish for removal. What would happen after that number of known? Would Brooke do …? A. She would then charge for the removal of (sic). 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Would she do that each time? A. How do you mean? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The garbage - I'm not going to say garage (sic) - garbage drums came in. Would she send an invoice out right away or was that something else? A. No, that went on with the same invoices that we created on the delivery docket. She would add that to that. Like there would be - Mr. Troth would say there would be so many - there will be drums for removal, Brooke would then - that would be on the docket. 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         Q. … Now once the others - I think you've categorised them as grade one. grade two, grade three - these are ones you can refurbish? A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And were there different values put on those? A. Certainly was. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What were the values? Were they fluctuating or were they constant? A. They fluctuated to a certain extent on supply and demand. 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         Q. With respect to your payment of these cash cheques after these drums were graded I think you are suggesting on a Monday or something like that, is that correct? A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What would happen? So many of that I take it? A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What would then happen with those facts and figures? A. Those figures were given by my foreman to Brooke.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what was her job description? What would she do with those? A. She would work out the total amount of money and the price for the - at the - on the day for each different section of numbers of the grades.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. A. And make out a cash cheque. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what would happen to the cash cheque? A. It would be taken on the following Saturday and handed to Mr. Troth. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And was there any other paperwork apart from whatever Brooke and the foreman did and the cheque? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. No other paperwork? A. No."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     60    At the outset of his cross-examination of Donnelly the Crown Prosecutor turned to the question of the drums said to have been removed from Cementaid's premises each Saturday. 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. The empty drums, that's the Cementaid's orange drums that you collected, on each occasion that you made the deliveries to Cementaid are you able to say whether they were empty drums or drums that contained sludge and slurry or rubbish? A. The ones I purchased were empty. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And may we take it that the ones that contained sludge, slurry or rubbish were the ones that you invoiced the company to take away? A. With heavy sludge and slurry, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Have you any indication or can you give us any indication as to the percentage of empty drums as against sludge and slurry and rubbish drums that you took away? A. There was a lot more empty ones than sludge and slurry ones. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now there are just a couple of areas I wanted to ask you some questions about, Mr. Donnelly, and they are these. You know we have in Court the comparison of cheque butts and cheques that you wrote or that your daughter wrote, may I take it at your behest or your direction, would that be right? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Would you agree that there's not one cheque butt that written out correctly in what my be called in the normal course of business practice? A. I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. There's not one butt which records either 'Cementaid' or 'John Troth' as being the supplier of drums? A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now you agreed I think that so far as you were concerned I think the drums were owned by Cementaid, I think you said as much in the interview with the police? A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And as far as you were concerned you were making a genuine honest bona fide purchase? Why didn't you include either Cementaid or John Troth as … ? A. Sorry? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. … on the cheque butts? A. Because I was informed it was for Cementaid's social club and requested to have a cash cheque.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. The cash cheque is fine. What I'm talking about is the particulars on the butt. A. That's correct, sorry. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. If the transaction was a genuine one and that you agreed that the drums were, in fact, owned by Cementaid, why is there no mention at all on the cheque butts as to the payee? A. Because under our system or in our industry you give a cash cheque to a social club or to somebody - something like that you just put a bodgy name in it because of taxation purposes for the other - for the receipt - for the person receiving it more than anything else. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you said 'put a bodgy name' in there it's a deliberate untruth in the document, isn't it? A. No, it is not a deliberate untruth. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why is it not? A. It is a bodgy cover, taxation to cover the person receiving the cheque. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, as its a bodgy cover for taxation or its a bodgy cover for anything it's still not true, is it? A. I suppose so. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, is it 'suppose so' or you know so? A. Well, I never looked at it. I've never looked at it in the way you are putting it to me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see, the cheque butts didn't tell the truth about the payee, the correct payee of the cheque, did they? A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. To that extent the cheque butts were false documents, weren't they; they did not reflect the truth of the situation? A. No.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why was the truth not good enough in relation to the compilation of your company documents? A. I'm sorry? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why was the truth not good enough in relation to the compilation of your company documents? A. What document are you referring to. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I'm referring to the cheque butts? A. Because that is the system that our industry runs. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You can speak for yourself but when you say 'our industry' you have an intimate working knowledge of the financial practices of all drum reconditioners in Sydney? A. Well, I've been in the industry for thirty-two years, it is very competitive and that is the way the industry operates.  
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. Does that apply to all the drums that you buy for recondition (sic)? A. 90 percent (sic) of them, your Honour, unless they are a company account and we don't run very many company accounts.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. So 90 percent (sic) you pay by cash cheque? A. Cash cheque, sir. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you have no record as to who you bought it from? A. No, sir. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What you paid for it per drum? A. No, sir. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Or how many drums? A. No, sir."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     61    At the conclusion of his cross-examination of Donnelly, the Crown Prosecutor came to the meeting between the Messrs. Aldred and Donnelly: 
      
       
        
         
         ""When Mr. Aldred and senior (sic) came or when you spoke to Aldred subsequently, did you ever mention to Mr. Aldred that you paid Mr. Troth $49,433.00? A. No, I just said I bought the drums and gave the cheques to Troth to pass on. As far as I was concerned they were being passed on. It - I didn't even know the amount of money.  
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. Pass onto who? A. To the Cementaid's social club. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who mentioned the social club as being the recipient of these monies (sic)? A. That was the - what I assumed from what Mr. Troth had told me. The money was going to the boys, which is the boys' social club. That's what they called it. The boys or social club. It's all the same. Within the Cementaid end … 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. What did Troth say was going to be done about the money? A. All he said is the money was going to the boys. You know, their social club or drinks and do whatever they do. I don't know, their social club. 'To the boys', he said. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When did you realise that you paid out $49,000.00 to Mr. Troth? A. When did I realise. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes? A. When all these cheques were all added up. I had not sat down and worked out how much money I'd paid Mr. Troth. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Indeed you couldn't, could you, because you didn't have a record of a purchase anywhere and nothing written on any of the cheque butts? A. That's correct."" 
         
        
        
       
     62    Melissa Donnelly gave evidence that, over the period from November 1993 to June 1995, she, at times in company with Donnelly, and at times alone, delivered drums to and picked up drums from Cementaid. Although she was unable to say that it was she who delivered the drums the subject of the thirty impugned invoices, she nonetheless asserted that the drums were in fact delivered. 
      
       
     63    Melissa Donnelly gave no evidence to corroborate the evidence given by Donnelly himself as to what was alleged to have occurred on 17 June 1995 (see para. 58 (above)), the day when, so he said, the truck which he had been driving to Cementaid broke down. 
      
       
     64    In the course of her evidence in chief at trial, Brooke Donnelly gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. With respect to Cementaid, are you able to recall who the driver or drivers were over the 20 odd months that you dealt with them? A. Either Melissa my sister or my father. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Would they travel together? A. Occasionally, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. With respect to the two of them, when you handed whoever it was driving the docket? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you ever give them … ? A. I give (sic) them an envelope contains (sic) cheques. The cheques were for the drums that were purchased from Cementaid the previous week.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Let's just deal with that for a moment if we might: did you create the cheques? A. Yes I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. We've seen a battery of cheques here, perhaps we could just look at a few of them, BC, just have a look and see if you can identify those documents (shown)? A. Yep. They (sic) my cheques. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say mine? A. They're the cheques that I wrote. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you see any other signatures than your own on those just take your time and go through? A. Yes, my father's. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is your father's signature on the earlier cheques, would you check that for us? A. Yes, they are. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did that sort of get taken over by your signing of the cheques? A. I did. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. Did you draw those at someone's direction or what happened? A. No. The actual - I was in charge of pricing the drums. We have a foreman. When the drums came back he would tell me what grade drums they were and I determine the price and draw up the cheques accordingly. 
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: Q. I was going to ask you about that procedure and I will do so now. In order to create these cheques, did you fill in the amount yourself? A. Yes, I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did you decide what amounts to put in? A. We have a foreman and when the trucks would return from Cementaid with the drums on them he would unload the drums, grade the drums and come to me and say, we have X amount of drums and they come out of this grade drum. I would then value that put a price on that particular grade and have a total amount. 
          
          
         Q. Now if you could just slow down a little bit. You say trucks would come back in with drums? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what sort of drums would you actually see coming back in on the trucks? A. The bulk of the drums were the orange drums and there were some other various coloured drums as well.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now, typically was there any day out of the seven the trucks would go out with the orange drums, do you recall? A. What date? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What days, not the date? A. What day did they leave.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes? A. Typically a Saturday.  
         
        
        
         
         And typically when you saw drums returned, was there any particular day? A. The same day, the Saturday. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. We have this right, the truck would go out with nice shiny drums and come back with a different load of drums? A. That's right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now I'm not going to ask you to answer this unless you can, but are you able, the operative word is able, are you able to compare in any averaging or typical way the number of drums that would go out, compared with the number of drums that would come back? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And can you put that into percentages? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Could you give us the percent of drums coming back compared with the drums going out? A. I would say it would be about seventy percent (sic).. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And was that typical, over the entire period? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And are you able to say whether over the time the truck went out and the new refurbished drums they would come back with some apparently used drums? A. Yes, they always came back with used drums. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You mentioned that the used drums would be graded? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. Is it you are saying that of the drums that went out to Cementaid, were sold to Cementaid, you say about 70 percent would come back? A. The truck that returned from Cementaid would hold about 70 percent of the quantity of drums that left. 
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: Q. Are you able, this is the critical question, are you able now recalling back, to say whether or not the drums that came back were drums that had already been reconditioned but never used? A. No, they were used drums. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How do you know they were used drums? A. You can tell because a second hand drum is, well obviously it's marked up. It has product residue in it, all of those kinds of things. A reconditioned drum looks like a brand new shiny drum. It is very obvious the difference.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now, when they got back as I understand it, the foreman or whoever would grade the drums? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What were the grades? A. You have a first grade drum, a second grade drum, a third grade drum and a scrap drum.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Let's deal firstly with scrap drums, what would you do, accounting wise or whatever, with those drums that were scrap grade? A. On the invoices they are charged as disposal drums because we charge a fee to remove a scrap drum because we have to pay to dispose of it. We can't use it to recondition it.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. What would you do with account or docket with respect to those? A. I would charge the customer. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How much? A. I believe it was five dollars a drum. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now with respected (sic) to grades 1, 2 and 3? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Would the price that you were prepared to pay as a purchaser, would that vary on the grades? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And can you please indicate whether or not, just a grade 1 for example, would the price on that that you were prepared to pay remain constant or would it fluctuate? A. It fluctuates. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why did it fluctuate? A. It is very much a supply and demand system where we may require a thousand first grade drums this week, next week we are own(sic) require fifty, so obviously you don't pay the same price when you don't require that. Supply and demand theory really. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Would the same answer to the same question applying with respect to a grade 2 and grade 3? A. Exactly. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I'm just trying to, and I appreciate it was seven or so years ago, to test your memory in this sense, are you able to say what the average prices were? And I appreciate they fluctuate for a grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3 drums? Let's just look at 1994 in the middle of it all? A. Across the board an average price probably averaged out between six7 and eight dollars.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that is adding grade one … ? A. All three together. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. So you said between six and eight, you mean seven averaging it out? A. Yeah, seven I suppose, yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: Q. Now, once you had the number and grade of the drums that had been used and that you were going to strike a cheque for, would you do some calculations? A. Yeah, I just totalled the amount of drums against the price for that particular grade and add them all together. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you then make out a cheque? A. Yes, I would either make out a cheque then and there or quite often I would wait until the next load was going out. I just scribbled these things on a notepad I have.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. And I take it you I (sic) kept that pad for some time? A. Yeah, yeah it was a big notepad. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And after a while did those notepad entries get entered into a formal documentation? A. No, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it the case that your cheque stub was all you had for a record? A. That is it, yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And the cheque would then go out, I think you said with the driver who got the docket book and cheque just before leaving? A. Go altogether."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     65    Although the submissions of counsel to the jury appear not to have been recorded, it would seem that, despite the suggestion which had been put to Mr. Bargwanna in the course of his cross-examination by counsel for Troth to the effect that one of the terms of Troth's employment was that, if he were able to find someone willing to purchase the 200 litres drums which could not be reused without first being refurbished, he was entitled to sell them and to keep the proceeds of sale to himself (see para. 21 (above)) and despite the evidence given in chief by Troth to a similar effect (see para. 50 (above)), during the course of her submissions to the jury, counsel for Troth did not press the jury to accept that suggestion but, rather, conceded that Troth had been guilty of a failure to account to Cementaid in respect of any money which had been paid by Donnelly for drums which had been sold to Drum Distributors for the purpose of being refurbished. That this was so is made clear by the following passages in the summing-up by Shillington DCJ: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Ms. McSpedden on behalf of her client emphasised the onus of proof. She frankly concedes that there was a failure to account on behalf of her client for the $49,000.00, but emphasises that is not the charge which is before you and that that does not establish that there was any conspiracy.  
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         She says well you would also accept the evidence of Brooke and Melissa Donnelly in support of the evidence of Mr. Donnelly himself as to the supply of the items, and the taking away of the items from the premises of Cementaid, that although her client was guilty of criminal activity by failing to account for the $49,000.00, she says well that is not the subject of the charge, the subject of the charge is one of conspiracy, and she submits to you you would not be satisfied that there was first of all any failure to deliver the goods the subject of the 30 invoices and for that reason her clients should be also found not guilty."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     66    Since none of the grounds of appeal taken on behalf of either Donnelly or Troth is directed towards the summing-up, it is unnecessary to record in any detail any of the directions given by Shillington DCJ. However, in the light of one aspect of the matter which occurred after the jury had retired, it is as well that I set out part of his Honour's charge to the jury. It was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Members of the jury, the case presented by the Crown is a circumstantial one. I will come back to the reasons why that is the situation later in my summing-up. But I must tell you members of the jury that in the case of a circumstantial case, that is a case in which the Crown submits that the various circumstances are such that they would lead you to a verdict of guilty, before you can convict an accused on such a case you must be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the facts as found by you are inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is guilty. As I say, I will come back to the way in which the Crown puts it case in a circumstantial way in this particular trial.  
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         What is essentially put here is that Cementaid was induced to pay for thirty invoice supplied items by Drum Distributors for goods never supplied. It is essential members of the jury that you would be satisfied before you would go any step further, that in fact those goods were not supplied.  
         
        
        
         
         The allegation here is that you conclude that there was such agreement between Troth and Donnelly, that Troth used his knowledge of the sole use of the materials inwards report as being the only information which went into the computer assessed stocktakes for the month, and he, knowing that that was the only item used, concealed the failure of deliveries by not putting that information onto the stock material inwards reports, and that he agreed with Donnelly to take advantage of this situation and to allow Donnelly to obtain payments for drums which were never delivered, that is in the sum of $116,990.00. It is the Crown's case that for his contribution towards that situation that Troth did receive $49,433.00.  
         
        
        
         
         For that to be the situation of course, you would have to reject the evidence of both the accused, that in fact there were genuine sales by Donnelly, illegal of course, but nevertheless sales by Troth to Donnelly of the 205 litre drums which it is said went out and went back to Drum Distributors."" 
         
        
        
       Having then identified the various overt acts relied upon by the Crown to establish the conspiracy charged, continued: 
        
        
         
         ""Members of the jury, those are the alleged acts of the two accused, which you are entitled to look at and if you are satisfied first of all that there were no delivery by Drum Distributors of the various drums the subject of those thirty invoices to Cementaid, and if those events occurred that there was no transfer of drums, although illegal, by Troth back to Donnelly's company. If those were the actual conclusions that you would arrive at then it would be open to you to look at those various circumstances and conclude beyond reasonable doubt that there was an agreement between those two persons, the two accused, to obtain money fraudulently from Cementaid by Donnelly's company and subsequent repayment by him to Troth as his share in the illegal activities."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     67    Some hours after they had retired, the jury sent a note to Shillington DCJ. The transcript records the following: 
      
       
        
         
         ""HIS HONOUR: A note from the jury, I will just read it out - 'In finding a conspiracy how closely should it match the details put by the Crown. What should we find if for example we thought the drums could have been physically delivered but returned without being genuinely used or by some other means not available to Cementaid?' 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown's case is that they were not delivered Mr. Crown, I think shortly that is it? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, that's right. 
         
        
        
         
         McSPEDDEN: And if they find they could have physically delivered (sic) they must acquit your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: That's right. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Unless taken away by Mr. - 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I think that follows doesn't it Mr. Crown - its depends what they mean by physically delivered. If they came out and were never taken there for example but simply left at the premises and didn't ever get there. They don't really have to go into that, they just simply have to find they didn't arrive for the use of Cementaid. 
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: Yes that's right, it is the ultimate end use. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Your case is that they were delivered and went into the stock of Cementaid Mr. Crown? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: My case is that weren't … (sic)  
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: They did not. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: They did not. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Did not, exactly. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I'm sorry I think I said they did, but did not arrive and go into the stock of Cementaid in the ordinary way. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: That's right, in the ordinary way, yes of course. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: If they weren't able to find they would have to return verdicts of not guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     68    The transcript then records that, after the jury had returned and Shillington DCJ had read out their note, the following then occurred: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Well as I made clear in the summing-up members of the jury, it is essential that the Crown must prove that the drums were not delivered. Now by delivered really means were the drums delivered and did they go into the stock of Cementaid in the ordinary way.  
         
        
        
         
         That is what the Crown's case is in effect. Now you do not have to make any positive finding or any finding really as to what may have happened to them, if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they had not gone into the stock of Cementaid in the ordinary way.  
         
        
        
         
         That is the essential thing. Did they arrive, did they come into the stock and were they dealt with in the ordinary way and confirmed as having gone through that process by Mr. Troth. 
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: Your Honour, if I might, I did put it as part of my case that once Mr. Donnelly or Melissa or both of them dropped off the drums, if they went after that, if my client left the yard and went somewhere else then that is not evidence against him in the sense … 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: If they've come into the yard …  
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: Once he's dropped them off, got the delivery chit signed, he's out.  
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Signed by Mr. … 
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: By Mr. Troth. If they went from there somewhere else of course that is not against my client. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: No, well that's why I made it plain that they have to go into the stock. 
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: No that isn't so, if they went somewhere else from there that's none of my client's business. It is none of my client's business and it wouldn't be a conspiracy. For example if they got dropped of (sic) and somebody else who shouldn't have put them away, it doesn't matter that they never went into stock. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: When I say the stock, I mean into the premises. 
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: As long as what your Honour is saying is they got to the premises, my client leaves … 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: That's what I mean by interstock (sic). They've got to come into the premises and be at the premises (sic) by your client. 
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: Yes, and my client leaves with his empty drums, then there's nothing against … 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: The empty drums are something - on your case - quite different. 
         
        
        
         
         WETMORE: Of course. But as long as he leaves thinking I've delivered, that's the end of the matter. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: That interchange is certainly not - it probably amplifies and illuminates what I have been trying to say to the jury. The essential thing is that they arrive at the Cementaid premises, they're put down there and what might happen after that is another matter.  
         
        
        
         
         FOREPERSON: If for example there were a conspiracy and they were in agreement to defraud but if it were carried out by means of, just example, drums being delivered, left the premises (sic), picked up the next week and used, so there was still a conspiracy but not being executed in precisely the way the Crown has described it. Should we find that we see beyond reasonable doubt a conspiracy has been proved or do we have to find in relation to the specific way in which the Crown has said … (not transcribable) … that there were in fact no drums. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes, well you would have to find that the specific way in which it has been presented to you, in other words that they never really got there, it never got to the premises for the use of Cementaid to the knowledge of both of the accused.  
         
        
        
         
         Does that cover the situation. 
         
        
        
         
         FOREPERSON: Yes I think so, thank you."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       Neither counsel sought a further direction from Shillington DCJ in respect of that matter. 
        
       
     69    Ultimately - but not until the late morning of the following hearing day - the jury, as I have earlier recorded, found each of Donnelly and Troth guilty as charged.  
      
       
     70    The grounds of appeal which were filed on behalf of Donnelly were as follows: 
      
       
        
       1. The verdict was unreasonable. 
        
        
       2. The verdict cannot be supported. 
        
        
       3. The verdict was a compromise. 
        
        
       4. There is a significant possible that an innocent man was convicted. 
        
        
       5. There is a substantial possible that the jury may have been mistaken. The penalty was too severe. 
        
        
       6. The sentencing judge failed to adhere to correct sentencing principles. 
        
        
       It should however be noted that, in the Written Submissions filed on behalf of Donnelly, it was indicated that the second ground of appeal - that is that the verdict could not be supported - was not pressed. 
        
       
     71    The grounds of appeal taken by Troth in the Notice of Appeal filed o his behalf were as follows: 
      
       
        
       A. The verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
        
        
       B. The verdict is a compromise. 
        
        
       C. The sentence is monafectly (sic) excessive. 
        
        
       However, in the Written Submissions filed on behalf of Troth, the following grounds of appeal were advanced: 
        
        
       1. The verdict was unreasonable. 
        
        
       2. The verdict could not be supported by the evidence. 
        
        
       3. The verdict was a compromise. 
        
        
       4. There is a significant possibility that an innocent man was convicted. 
        
        
       5. There is a substantial possibility that the jury may have been mistaken. 
        
        
       6. The penalty was too severe. 
        
       
     72    On the hearing of the appeal Mr. D.A. Wetmore appeared for Donnelly, Ms. L.M. McSpedden appeared for Troth and M.C. Grogan appeared for the Crown. 
      
       
     73    Since, on the hearing of the appeal, Mr. Wetmore did not seek to elaborate upon his Written Submissions but sought only to deal with matters arising out of the submissions which had been filed on behalf of the Crown, it is sufficient to record the Written Submissions which were filed on behalf of Donnelly. 
      
       
     74    Insofar as they sought to deal with Grounds 1, 4 and 5 in the Notice of Appeal, those submissions were devoted to an attempt to demonstrate - by a contorted process of mathematics - that Cementaid's production was such as to require the supply of drums in the quantity revealed by Drum Distributors invoices and was sufficient to provide for refurbishment drums in the quantity suggested by the amounts paid by Drum Distributors to Troth. Thus, in the course of those Written Submissions, when dealing with the evidence of Mr. Aldred, the following appears: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The production could well have been one wherein the number of reconditioned drums invoiced were in fact received and used. He says that three, 9,000 litre batches of Calcite per week plus one to two 4,500 batches of Roctite per week would be produced. P174L43-P176L3. This means that there would be a need for drums to contain 3 x 9000 + 1, 5 x 4,500 (averaging) = 33,750 litres. 33,750/200 = 170 drums or if 2 x 4,500 is used, 180 drums per week. Over 18 months this amounts to in excess of 14,000 drums required i.e. 180 x 18 x 13/3. What was sold was needed. What was left by way of used drums was well (sic) adequate to support purchases from Cementaid amounting to some $49,000.00. At $7.00 average per used drum this is about 7,000 drums purchased. Later, percentage figures will support this position further."" 
         
        
        
       To the same effect was the following submission directed to the evidence of Donnelly. 
        
        
         
         ""The number of drums taken away to be reconditioned would as a percent of those reconditioned being delivered be 70 to 75%. Of these some 75 to 80% would be orange. P391LL22-36. This aligns with the evidence of Melissa Donnelly (below) and with the mathematics of the requirements, the returns and the figure of $49,000.00."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     75    Insofar as they were directed towards Ground 3 in the Notice of Appeal, those submissions were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Troth essentially said that he may well have committed a different offence than that charged by keeping the moneys rather than handing the same onto Cementaid. His learned counsel essentially told the jury that he was not guilty as charged but likewise might be dealt with later for the misappropriation of the moneys.  
         
        
        
         
         It is totally open to think that the jury declined to accept the invitation to so acquit Troth on this basis and decided not to let me off possibly to face different charges. Feeling that the Appellant might be guilty somehow, convicted both. It is noted that the jury was instructed that they were to convict or acquit both. The aforesaid jury note should be taken into consideration here too. There was a real possibility of this having occurred, it is respectfully submitted that there may have been a miscarriage of justice."" 
         
        
        
       and, later: 
        
        
         
         ""It may well be that the jury made inferences when they ought not to have. It was equally open on the evidence for the jury to infer that Troth got the drums and did not leave them at the factory of Cementaid as to think that they were put down and picked up and removed by the Appellant and his daughter. The jury note seems to imply it was thought that this was a possibility but further the words 'or by some other means not made available to Cementaid' seem to indicate they had the other possibility in their minds. If this were so, the Appellant would not be guilty.  
         
        
        
         
         Referring to the transcript at the time the aforesaid jury question was dealt with … there is to be seen a state of confusion and a possible, innocent, inference that might well have been made by the jury. That is that the drums were delivered but did not remain on the premises of Cementaid.  
         
        
        
         
         There is distinct possibility that the jury confused the evidence of overt acts of Troth against the Appellant."" 
         
        
        
       
     76    Insofar as concerned Ground 6, those submissions were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The Appellant seeks leave on the basis that the learned Judge failed to apply the provisions of s. 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in that there existed special circumstances being the health of the Appellant, that of his wife, the needs of his employees and his previous excellent character, the lasting effect of war related trauma, the time spent between being charged and the trial and the options contained in the Pre-Sentence Report (p2) and respectfully submits that the sentence was excessive in these circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     77    Except to the extent noted below, the Written Submission filed on behalf of Troth adopted the submissions which had been filed on behalf of Donnelly. 
      
       
     78    Insofar as concerned Ground 2 taken in the Written Submissions filed on behalf of Troth - which ground, as I have earlier noted, was not, on the hearing of the appeal advanced on behalf of Donnelly - those submissions were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused by reason of the fact that the evidence relied upon by the Crown to prove a conspiracy was entirely circumstantial and raised an equally competing inference inconsistent with a conspiracy as evidenced by the jury's question to his Honour in terms:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'In finding a conspiracy, how closely should it match the details put by the Crown. What should we find if, for example, we thought the drums could have been physically delivered but returned without being genuinely used or by some other means not being made available to Cementaid.'"" 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
     79    Insofar as concerns Ground 3 taken in those submissions, the submissions were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""There is a real risk that the jury, came to the view that the drums could have been physically delivered but returned without being genuinely used or by some other means not being made available to Cementaid, presumably at the instigation of the Appellant Troth alone. In that circumstance there was no alternate count on the indictment against the Appellant Troth alone, in spite of his frank admission that he had retained moneys due to his employer from the sale of used drums. There is a real risk that the guilty verdicts returned in respect of a conspiracy was (sic) by way of a compromise to ensure that the Appellant Troth was convicted at least because of his admitted dishonesty, in the circumstances where the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the existence of a conspiracy."" 
         
        
        
       and, later: 
        
        
         
         ""The Appellant further submits that as in  
         R v RGG 
          [1999] NSWCCA 81 (28 April 1999), the weakness in the Crown case cannot be satisfactory explained by the manner in which the evidence was given or the advantage that the jury had in seeing or hearing the witnesses. It is submitted that, on the evidence, doubt arises of a positive kind such as to require the conviction and sentence to be set aside and a verdict of acquittal substituted."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     80    Insofar as concerned Ground 6, those submissions were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Leave to appeal against the severity of sentence is sought on the basis that his Honour the trial Judge failed to give sufficient weight to the previous good character of the accused."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     81    I am quite unable to accept the Appellant's submissions insofar as they relate to Grounds 1, 2 - in the case of Troth - 4 and 5. 
      
       
     82    As is apparent from what I have earlier recorded: 
      
       
        
       1. prior to November 1993 A1 Drums was the sole supplier to Cementaid in New South Wales of refurbished drums; 
        
        
       2. despite what, at one stage, was suggested on behalf of Troth to have been a condition of his employment, at no stage prior to November 1993 - by which time Troth had been in Cementaid's employ as the senior factory operator for a period of five years or thereabouts - were any used drums sold by Troth to A1 Drums or anyone else; 
        
        
       3. it was Troth who sought out Drum Distributors as a potential supplier to Cementaid of refurbished drums; 
        
        
       4. although, as the first of the spreadsheets (Exhibit ""AU"") prepared by Mr. Bruce demonstrated, prior to the commencement of November 1993, there was a very close correlation between the number of drums invoiced and the number of drums recorded on the Material Inwards Sheets, as from the commencement of November 1993 and until the end of June 1995 there was a growing disparity between the number of drums invoiced and the number of drums recorded on the Materials Inwards Sheets. Further, as that spreadsheet records, in the six months from the end of June 1995 to the end of December 1995 the figures for drums invoiced and drums recorded were identical in five of those months, the ratio between drums invoiced and drums recorded over the period of six months being 0.928 (see para. 35 (above)); 
        
        
       5. Further, as I have earlier recorded, the second of those spreadsheets (Exhibit ""AV"") recorded that, while, in the period of six months to 31 December 1993, the ratio of drums invoiced to drums used in production was 1.953, thereafter, in the period to 30 June 1995 the ratio of drums invoiced to drums used in production increased significantly. Further still, in the period of six months to 31 December 1995 the ratio of drums invoiced to drums used in production was dramatically reduced (see para. 36 (above)); 
        
        
       6. Further still, as I have earlier recorded, the third of those spreadsheets (Exhibit ""AY"") revealed that, during the period in which Drum Distributors was said to have supplied Cementaid with refurbished drums, there was a dramatic and continuing increase of the number of drums invoiced compared with what had been the position prior to November 1993, and a dramatic reduction in the number of refurbished drums purchased after June 1995 when Drum Distributors no longer supplied Cementaid with drums (see para. 37 (above)); 
        
        
       7. although Donnelly claimed to have kept detailed records of the refurbished drums supplied by him to Cementaid, there was no - let alone any detailed - record kept by Drum Distributors of the number of drums which Donnelly claimed to have purchased from Cementaid for refurbishment; 
        
        
       8. although, as was accepted by the Crown, neither Donnelly nor Troth bore the onus of establishing anything, the varying explanations which they proffered as to the matters to which I have earlier referred and as to their conduct in the circumstances, to say the least, cast a shadow of doubt over their evidence and over the propriety of their actions; 
        
        
       9. save for such assistance as might be found in the evidence of Melissa Donnelly and Brooke Donnelly and such comfort as might have been derived from the evidence of Troth, there was no evidence tendered on behalf of Donnelly to corroborate the evidence which he gave. It is not without point that the foreman at Drum Distributors yard who was said to have carried out the task of sorting and assessing the drums returned from Cementaid to Drum Distributors yard was not called to give evidence and no explanation for his not having been called was given; 
        
        
       10. Melissa Donnelly's evidence was, if I may say so, of a very general nature - as I have earlier noted she could not recall on how many occasions she delivered or picked up drums and although saying that ""sometimes"" she went to Cementaid in Donnelly's company she was unable to say how often. More importantly, as I have earlier noted, Melissa Donnelly gave no evidence to corroborate the evidence given by Donnelly himself as to what was alleged to have occurred on 17 June 1995 (see para. 58), the day when, so he said, the truck which he had been driving to Cementaid broke down; 
        
        
       11. nor was Brooke Donnelly's evidence, insofar as it dealt with the drums said to have been purchased from Cementaid for the purpose of being refurbished, of any great weight, insofar as it was put forward to corroborate Donnelly's evidence; as I have earlier recorded it was said that it was the foreman's job to sort and grade the drums, no permanent record of what it was that on any particular occasion the foreman told Brooke Donnelly was kept, and, save for what was said to be the private code endorsed on the cheque butts there was no record of the purpose for which the cash cheques which were ultimately given to Troth were used for; 
        
        
       12. except for such comfort as could be drawn from the evidence given by Donnelly, Melissa Donnelly and Brooke Donnelly, there was no evidence which was tendered which would corroborate Troth's evidence.  
        
       
     83    The test to be applied by a court when asked to set aside the verdict of a jury on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, is to be found in the joint Judgment of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, 493-494) where their Honours say: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary the court must pay full regard to those considerations.  
         
        
        
         
         It was with those considerations in mind that some members of this Court have thought it necessary to qualify the statement by Barwick CJ in  
         Ratten v. The Queen 
          that: 'It is the reasonable doubt in the mind of the court which is the operative factor.' Barwick CJ went on to say: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'It is of no practical consequence whether this is expressed as a doubt entertained by the court itself or as a doubt which the court decides that any reasonable jury ought to entertain. If the court has a doubt, a reasonable jury should be of a like mind. But I see no need for any circumlocution; as I have said it is the doubt in the court's mind upon its review and assessment of the evidence which is the operative consideration.' 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         The qualification was that no circumlocution was involved in speaking of a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have entertained because account must be taken of the advantage which a jury has in seeing and hearing the witnesses. To ask only whether the court has a doubt may place insufficient emphasis upon the fact that the jury, having seen and heard the evidence given, was in a position to evaluate that evidence in a manner in which a court of appeal cannot. 
         
        
        
         
         But it is, we think, possible to make too much both of the view expressed by Barwick CJ and of the qualification suggested. In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     84    I am far from being persuaded that there is a significant possibility that, in this case, innocent men have been convicted. On the contrary, it seems to me that, in this case, the case which was advanced by the Crown was compelling. That being so I would dismiss Grounds 1, 2, 4. 
      
       
     85    Nor am I persuaded that the jury's verdict represented a compromise to ensure that Troth was convicted because of his admitted dishonesty in circumstances where the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the existence of the conspiracy charged. As will be clear from that part of Shillington DCJ's summing-up where his Honour set out what was the essential Crown case (see para. 66 (above)), his Honour made it abundantly clear that, in order to convict, the jury must be satisfied that the drums the subject of the thirty invoices were never supplied to Cementaid, a point which his Honour reinforced when he came to deal with the note which had been forwarded to him by the jury. I would reject Ground 3. 
      
       
     86    I turn then to Ground 5, which ground, being based upon the note sent by the jury to Shillington DCJ, was, in the Written Submissions, put as showing a ""substantial possibility that the jury may have been mistaken"". Although put in that way in the Written Submissions, on the hearing of the appeal it appeared to be put that the direction given by Shillington DCJ was such as to confuse the jury as to what facts would need to be found if they were properly to find that there had been a conspiracy of the type charged. Put in the latter way, the submission requires the leave of the Court since no objection was taken at trial. Quite apart from the fact that the passage from the transcript which I have earlier set out (see para. 68 (above)), in my view, makes it clear that, in order that they might find there had been a conspiracy as charged, the jury had to find that the subject drums never reached the premises of Cementaid, I would not be disposed to grant the leave required to enable the submission to be put. I would dismiss Ground 5. 
      
       
     87    I turn finally to the question of penalty. 
      
       
     88    Although Donnelly and Troth were charged with, and convicted of, a common law misdemeanour, for which the available sentence is at large, in assessing the appropriate maximum penalty consideration is generally given to the sentence applicable to any relevant substantive offence or offences. In the present case each of Donnelly and Troth could have been charged with multiple counts under ss. 178BA or 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900, the former of which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         ""178BA(1) Whosoever by any deception dishonestly obtains for himself or herself or another person any money or valuation thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years"" 
         
        
        
       and the latter of which provides: 
        
        
         
         ""178BB(1) Whosoever, with intent to obtain for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever, makes or publishes, or concurs in making or publishing, any statement (whether or not in writing) which he or she knows to be false or misleading in a material particular or which is false or misleading in a material particular and is made with reckless disregard as to whether it is true or is false or misleading in a material particular shall be liable for imprisonment for 5 years."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       Given the verdict of the jury, the case is one which involved a person in a responsible position committing a breach of trust in carrying into effect, over an extended period and on a significant number of occasions, a plan, an essential ingredient of which was that Troth should use his position and his knowledge of Cementaid's procedures to deceive his employer. In such a case general deterrence is a significant consideration when imposing sentence. As Donnelly was privy to, and obtained a significant financial advantage, from Troth's actions, there seems to be little reason to distinguish between them. 
        
       
     89    In my view, the case was one in which a custodial sentence was clearly called for, a fact which each of counsel for Donnelly (T. 7) and counsel for Troth (T. 10) appeared to concede on the hearing of the appeal, the only real issue seeming to be the duration of that sentence. However, acceding to such submissions as were advanced as to the appropriate duration of that sentence would have involved the Court in doing little more than ""tinkering"".  
      
       
     90    I am not persuaded that his Honour failed to take into account all relevant considerations, including all relevant subjective considerations, or that he otherwise failed to apply correct sentencing principles. That being so, I would refuse leave to appeal on sentence. 
      
       
     91    The formal orders which I propose are, in each case: 
      
       
        
       1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
        
        
       2. Leave to appeal against sentence refused.

      REGINA v. LC 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Shillington sitting in the District Court at Sydney. 
     2   The applicant had been charged with two counts of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, they being offences under s.97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. 
     3   In addition the applicant sought that his Honour take into consideration on a Form 1 two further counts of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon and one count of stealing. 
     4   His Honour referred in his remarks on sentence shortly to the circumstances of those offences. As to the two charges to which the applicant had pleaded guilty, his Honour noted that on the first charge the applicant at Eastwood on 12 November 1999 while armed with an imitation self-loading pistol robbed Ms. Peggy Lo of a quantity of Vodafone starter kits, six mobile phones, a black sports bag, a ladies handbag and the sum of $500. 
     5   As to the second count his Honour noted that on 30 November 1999 at Marrickville the applicant being then armed with a dangerous weapon, an imitation self-loading pistol, robbed Thi Thu Nguyen of a 1998 Honda motor vehicle, two ANZ Visa cards, two Commonwealth Bank Mastercards, an Ericsson mobile phone, a small ladies purse and the sum of $1,200 in cash. 
     6   The three matters on the Form 1, two of which were committed on 18 November of the same year, involved again armed robbery with a dangerous weapon and the stealing of money, the property of Video Ezy Australia. 
     7   The applicant had committed these offences and had come forward for sentence together with a co-accused, JN. Both the applicant and JN were juveniles at the time of the commission of the offences and at the time of sentence. They are to be treated as children under the relevant legislation. Nonetheless the applicants were dealt with according to law in the District Court having regard to the seriousness of the charges. 
     8   The learned trial judge noted expressly that seriousness and noted that the offenders had threatened the people in the store when robbing the Vodafone Store and had threatened that the staff would be killed if the police were informed. 
     9   The robbery of Mrs. Nguyen, which was the subject of the second charge in the indictment, his Honour noted involved her abduction in her own car, into which she was forced and the taking of her to various ATM outlets where attempts were made to use her credit cards. She was in due course driven from where she was initially confronted, in the car park at the Marrickville RSL, to Chinatown where she managed to escape. She called out to a security guard ""this man wants to kill me"". The two offenders then absconded with her vehicle. The property taken included her credit cards and cash. The proceeds were shared between the offenders. 
     10   His Honour referred to that simple recital as being sufficient to indicate the seriousness of the charged offences and to the tragedy that persons so young should have committed such offences. 
     11   In the material before his Honour concerning the offences there was admitted by consent a statement of facts. That fact sheet shows that in perpetration of these robberies the applicant was the person who, during the attack on Mrs. Nguyen, produced the handgun and ordered her back into the vehicle. It was he who restrained her in the rear of the vehicle by putting his legs over her. Threats were made that she would be killed if she did not give them money although it was the accomplice who threatened that if she called the police she would be killed. 
     12   The vehicle was located, after having been observed, on 1 December whilst being used for joy-riding purposes. When the applicant's home was searched credit cards belonging to the victim and her husband were seized.  
     13   The applicant contacted the police and expressed his own intention to give himself up. He was interviewed. Chillingly when he made the full admissions he did about the matter he stated that he needed to get some money to pay some debts and robbing someone was the easiest way to get cash. 
     14   In relation to the robbery on 12 November of the communications store, he similarly made full admissions to the police concerning the commission and planning of that offence. As to the Video Ezy store robbery, being one of the matters referred to on the Form 1, he had produced the small handgun and it was he who had directed the staff as to how other members of the staff were to be restrained with duct tape, which he had supplied. The co-offender was apparently, during that offence, aloof from the scene keeping a look out. 
     15   The robbery on 18 November 1999 again involved the apparent use of a firearm, although the weapon was not itself observed. Nonetheless, the young person told the staff that they were required to lie down or he would kill them. He had his right arm in a black carry bag at the time. There were co-offenders who decamped with him. 
     16   In respect of those matters also there were full admissions. 
     17   The trial judge's recital of the circumstances of these offences can only be said to be a short summary. Overall, it seems to have been favourable, compared with the extensive evidence also provided to his Honour, to the offender in respect of the degree of violence attended upon the commission of the crimes charged. 
     18   When turning to the offenders' background, his Honour noted that the co-accused had prior offences of violence involving common assault in 1997 for which he had received a recognisance; a matter of break and enter, apparently accompanied by stealing in the same year, which also attracted a recognisance; and an offence in 1999 for which he was in due course placed on probation. We are now told that he was on bail for that last matter at the time of the commission of certain of these offences. 
     19   The present applicant his Honour noted had only one prior entry but it was an extremely serious one for robbery. It is noted that he had appeared before the Cobham Childrens' Court and after a lengthy adjournment during which it was considered that youth conferencing might be appropriate, he was directed to perform a very small amount of community service work but failed to comply with that direction. In consequence he was placed on a bond in November of the year in which he came forward for sentencing. It may be, in view of that history of the sentencing options, that the facts of the offence might not have been as serious as might otherwise have been expected. 
     20   This history shows, however, that this applicant had been before the courts at the time at which the first of the offences occurred and was the subject of a recognisance, into which he entered only a few days prior to the commission of the second offence. 
     21   In the case of both co-accused, his Honour was of the view that each had shown a complete disregard for the law and each, having been the subject of leniency on a number of occasions, had treated the law with contempt. 
     22   His Honour adverted to the substantial material before him in each case as to the personal background of each of the offenders. 
     23   The co-offender was a person of considerable intelligence and manipulative ability. He had come from a refugee family and his parents it would seem gave him little by way of control. He had a gambling addiction of quite enormous proportions which motivated him to the commission of the crimes and he had participated in various gang activities. 
     24   His Honour's findings concerning him and the report material supports the submission made that he is a person of considerable capability to manipulate and lead others notwithstanding that he might be slightly younger than the present applicant. 
     25   Both he and the present applicant claimed that he was the instigator and the principal planner of these offences. His Honour was of the view that that seemed to be consistent not only with the assessment made of the co-accused but also those made, particularly as to his state of intelligence, of the present applicant. 
     26   His Honour did not accept the assertion that the co-accused would now lead a crime free life. His Honour was of the view that it appeared the co-accused had little appreciation of the significance of the violent offences upon the victims. 
     27   There was some family discord in the background of the co-accused to which was related the lack of family control but it was the gambling that motivated him and that gambling it was clear was the overwhelmingly important aspect of his subjective circumstances. 
     28   The present applicant was the subject of a number of reports. In particular those reports adverted to his family's migrant background and the dislocation of relationships between his mother and her partners. His Honour noted sceptically her asserted unawareness of any prior criminal or indeed inappropriate behaviour by the applicant. He particularly noted the circumstances of vicious cruelty to the applicant that appeared to underlie the relationships between the applicant and his mother's male partners. 
     29   The applicant was described in a background report as friendly, polite and co-operative. He was also described as a person who was in the lower level of intelligence. When one has regard, particularly to the report to which his Honour referred before him on that issue, it can be seen that the applicant's verbal reasoning abilities are within the low average range out-performing 10% of his age group, but his non-verbal reasoning abilities are within the low average range and above 25% of his peers. 
     30   The report further continues:- 
      
       
        
        ""Overall Lawrence's reasoning abilities exceed seven percent of his age peers and are within the borderline range of intellectual functioning."" 
        
       
     31   That matter is noted by the report as underlying a ""depressive symptomatology which is likely to be related to his peer interactions"". 
     32   The psychologist adverted to the relationships the applicant might well have with his peers. 
      
       
        
        ""It is possible that Lawrence may be subservient in his conduct with peers, however he has engaged in serious criminal conduct with careful planning and intent. He minimises his conduct problems attributing the blame to others. Lawrence appears to react aggressively to problematical interactions with others, and uses power as a means to assert himself with peers or other persons in the community. His behaviour is impulsive and exacerbated by inappropriate peer associations, which leave him at risk of further offending."" 
        
       
     33   The psychologist had noted that he may feel dejected and misunderstood in the custody in which he then was detained, bail refused, in a Juvenile Detention Centre. It was recommended that therapeutic intervention in respect of the depressive affect by counselling be supplied in any custodial situation. 
     34   His Honour noted all of those matters. 
     35   He said that it may well be that the present applicant was involved in these offences at the instigation of the co-offenders but that he was satisfied the applicant had a motive to do what he did and that he certainly took his share of the proceeds. 
     36   His Honour referred to the necessity to consider the assessment of the applicant's intelligence but not in isolation. He said:- 
      
       
        
        ""Although you no doubt are in the lower level of intelligence there has been no suggestion you have not been able to function in the community in a quite normal way."" 
        
       
     37   His Honour noted the conclusion of the psychological report to which I have referred, that the applicant's adjustment had been affected by physical abuse by his step-father and the relocation of his father to another State. 
     38   His Honour made specific reference to that portion of the report that I have quoted and said that it was the background against which he approached the difficult problem of sentence. 
     39   His Honour adverted to the well recognised principle that in the case of young people the question of deterrence is not to be placed foremost in the mind of the sentencing judge but that general deterrence was still a matter of significance in cases where there are considerable acts of violence in the community. In his Honour's reasons that passage is expressed as referring to considerable acts of violence against young people in our community. I apprehend that his Honour was referring there to the victims of the offences. 
     40   His Honour was of the view that the only responsible course was to impose a substantial sentences of imprisonment on both offenders, having regard to the extreme seriousness of the offence, the backgrounds to which his Honour had referred, which in the case of this applicant included specific reference to the applicant's low intelligence, and the prospects of each of the young persons for the future. 
     41   In each case his Honour found special circumstances and varied the statutory proportion. In each case the sentence was dated back to the time at which the offenders had gone into custody. The sentence thus provided for a period each applicant would have to serve in custody of two years to expire on 2 December 2001 and a period during which each applicant would be under supervision after release on parole for two years thereafter. His Honour directed that the sentences be served in a Juvenile Justice Centre. 
     42   Before us it has been argued that his Honour fell into error in a number of respects and that the sentences are manifestly excessive. In particular it has been argued that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the principle that persons of limited intelligence should have considerations of general deterrence treated as of less significance and the sentence thereby mitigated since they do not constitute, so it is said, a good vehicle for example for others. 
     43   It is also put that the trial judge failed specifically to relate the applicant's low intelligence to the question of general deterrence and the possible moderation of the operation of that consideration in the sentence. Further, it is put that his Honour failed specifically to relate the applicant's low intelligence to the prospect that the sentence he passed upon the applicant would have a greater impact upon him, so that it would be more onerous than it would be upon his co-accused or upon others who might be subject to a similar sentence. 
     44   More importantly it is put that because of the differences between the applicant's circumstances, in particular his low intelligence and the high intelligence and manipulative nature of his co-accused, the applicant would have a justifiable sense of grievance should he be compelled to serve the same sentence as the person who, so it was said, involved him in these offences which, it is put, he might well have not committed without that influence. 
     45   For my part I am not persuaded that his Honour failed to relate the applicant's low intelligence to the question of general deterrence. Indeed it was after noting the matters of the applicant's low intelligence, and immediately after noting those matters, that his Honour turned to the question of general deterrence and considered that in the context of looking at the extreme seriousness of the offences, the background and the prospects of each of the offenders. His Honour particularly referred to the low intelligence of the applicant not being such as to disable him from functioning in the community in quite a normal way. 
     46   That low intelligence did not produce any such consequence as to show that the applicant was incapable of independent and violent action while committing the robberies.  
     47   I am also not of the view that the trial judge erred in failing to have regard to the impact of the sentence upon the applicant, having regard to the recommendations made in the psychologist's report and having regard to his Honour having determined that the sentences should be served in a Juvenile Detention Centre. 
     48   The principles to be applied in the sentencing of children and young offenders customarily require the considerations of punishment and general deterrence be given less weight in favour of individual treatment aimed at rehabilitation of the offender. However, those principles are themselves moderated where the offenders commit violent adult crimes in such a way as to show that for their welfare and the welfare of the community a substantial period in custody is required. This was in my view such a case. 
     49   Indeed, having regard to the guidelines laid down by this court for cases of adult offenders by Regina v. Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, it can be seen that the sentence passed by his Honour in this regard in the context of that number of offences, even having regard to the applicant's youth, his early surrender and plea, were in my view lenient. 
     50   The submissions the Crown has made were, that there were no errors of a specific kind in the sentence nor, says the Crown, should the applicant be regarded as having a justifiable sense of grievance because, although the applicant might have been manipulated into the commission of the offences by a person more intelligent, he was a willing and vigorous participant in the planning and in the carrying out of the offences and adopted a role of considerable personal violence which indicated independent thought and independent action. 
     51   It was submitted that his low intelligence was not sufficient to require any different sentence, that any substantial reduction in the sentence would render the sentences entirely inappropriate to the culpability of the crimes and that is particularly so in the context of the commission of certain of the offences while on the recognisance and the lack of appropriate response to other, more lenient, sentencing options. 
     52   It was submitted that there was no justifiable sense of grievance and in any event that these differences had adequately been taken into account by his Honour and expressed in his judgment. 
     53   For my own part, having regard to the principle that in this court we sit on appeal from a discretionary decision and in doing so we have regard to the range of sentences that might well have been imposed below, I am of the view that there is no such error as would warrant interference either with the head sentence or the non-parole period. It is only if we conclude that there is error below that under s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 we should interfere with the sentence and then only when any reduction would result in a sentence which is warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     54   In my view the sentence passed by the learned trial judge was such that any further reduction to it would be to reduce the sentence to such a level as would not be warranted in law. I see no particular error nor do I see any error in the up-shot. 
     55   Since the matter has been fully argued, I would grant leave to appeal but propose that the appeal should be dismissed. 
     56   HODGSON, JA: I agree with Greg James, J. 
     57   Despite the youth of the applicant, in my opinion, having regard to the serious nature of the offences, the sentence passed was not manifestly excessive. 
     58   In my opinion also, while the circumstance that the other offender instigated the offences and the applicant has a low level of intelligence, those matters were taken into account by the trial judge; and it has not been shown to be an error for him not to have, in reliance on those circumstances, imposed a different sentence on the applicant from that imposed on the co-offender. 
     59   There were other matters that the trial judge had regard to pointing in the other direction. The applicant's role in the offences themselves was a more violent role than that of the co-offender. Of course, the co-offender as instigator of the offences, bears responsibility for that violence, but the actual perpetration of the violence was a factor in my opinion that weighed against the appellant. 
     60   I agree with the orders proposed by Greg James, J. 
     61   ADAMS, J: I have the misfortune to be unable to agree with the orders proposed by Greg James, J. and agreed by the learned presiding judge. I consider that there were two significant errors of law in his Honour's judgment. 
     62   The first is, that I consider that his Honour did not place in the scales, in determining whether the principles of general deterrence were appropriate to be applied against this applicant, the fact of his borderline range of intellectual functioning. 
     63   In this respect we are not dealing with someone who is simply mildly less competent than his peers. His verbal reasoning abilities are within the low average range, out-performing 10% of his age group and his non-verbal reasoning abilities are within the low average range but above 25% of his peers. However, of most concern is that this applicant's reasoning abilities exceed seven percent only of his age peers and, as the psychological report which was tendered before his Honour said, ""he is in the borderline range of intellectual functioning"". 
     64   An individual who has such limited verbal reasoning will, as commonsense and experience suggests, find it far more difficult to negotiate social differences than those whose verbal skills are normal. A great deal of social communication, whether adversarial or co-operative, is negotiated by language and the manipulation of subtle but significant modes of communication attached to the words, although not limited to the vocabulary itself. We all learn this process. For someone whose skills in this area are less than 90% of his peers, frustration in communication will be his or her usual experience. 
     65   Having regard to the intellectual functioning as a whole demonstrated in the tests conducted by the psychologist, it is not surprising to find when one adds his difficult domestic and family background, a youth who resorts to violence in adversarial or confrontational situations, and who finds it difficult to respond to any communications not obviously friendly with the sophisticated understanding of subtleties of communication which typify persons of normal intelligence. 
     66   This consideration is, to my mind, very important in understanding the relationship between this offender and his co-offender and the circumstances of the crimes which he has committed, regrettably marked by violence. The learned sentencing judge's general observations lead me, respectfully, to the conclusion that the importance of this aspect was not appreciated.  
     67   It will be a rare case, when one is dealing with a child, considering the public interest in rehabilitation, that general deterrence will be a substantial factor in the sentencing process. 
     68   Having regard to the background of this young man characterised by physical abuse, of which only a part was referred to in the psychological report, together with the intellectual problems to which I have referred. I consider that there was no role for the principles of general deterrence to apply to sentencing this young man. He was not an appropriate instrument of which to make an example to others. 
     69   I regret, therefore, that I have concluded, with unfeigned respect for the very experienced sentencing judge, that his Honour erred in considering that general deterrence was a significant matter in the sentencing of this applicant. It is obvious, from what has been already said, that there was a marked difference between this offender and his co-offender; far from the acts of violence committed by the applicant equalising their culpability, they demonstrated the difference to which I have endeavoured to draw attention. 
     70   Considered by itself, if he were not sentenced with his co-offender, the applicant's sentence could not be seen to be manifestly excessive and I agree that it was significantly lenient. However, he was not sentenced alone, he was sentenced with a person of far greater intelligence than he, who was the instigator of the offence and who was prepared to use what he must have known was the violent propensities of this offender to perpetrate crimes. I do not see that the fact that this offender was more directly violent than the instigator as, in some way, placing him on an equal level so far as culpability is concerned. Indeed if I were to draw that distinction I would draw it to the opposite effect. 
     71   When one considers whether this offender might be left with a justifiable sense of grievance, it is important to appreciate that the term is not truly a description of any particular state of mind, having regard especially to this offender's level of intellectual functioning. The reference to any justifiable sense of grievance is somewhat artificial, but the test is correctly understood an objective one. 
     72   Having regard to the distinctions between the offenders in responsibility and in intellectual capacity, I consider that they should not have received the same sentence and there should be, in light of the errors of law which I have identified, a re-consideration by this court of an appropriate sentence. 
     73   For myself, I think that a lengthy term of supervision is an important factor in attempting the rehabilitation of this young man and for that reason I would not vary the head sentence but I would have reduced the non-parole period to 18 months. 
     74   HODGSON, JA: The order of the court is, leave to appeal is allowed and the appeal is dismissed.

      WEDNESDAY 9 MAY 2001 
      
      REGINA v. WILLIAM MACADAM-KELLIE 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   WOOD, CJ. at CL: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Greg James, J. I agree with his reasons and the orders he proposes. 
     2   GREG JAMES, J: The applicant, William Macadam-Kellie, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Coolahan in the District Court of New South Wales at Newcastle following his plea of guilty to one count of wounding with intent to murder. 
     3   That offence is punishable by imprisonment for 25 years pursuant to s.25 of the Crimes Act 1900. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 16 years to commence on the day of his arrest, the day of the offence, 24 February 1999. A non-parole period of 12 years was imposed. 
     4   The victim of that offence was the applicant's estranged wife. 
     5   In his remarks, the learned trial judge set out the context of the offence. The marriage of some 21 years had declined and Mrs. Macadam-Kellie had left the home to reside with the two younger children. 
     6   Family Law proceedings had commenced and there were proceedings in that court in respect of custody and access. The two older children were living with the applicant. 
     7   Shortly following her leaving home, Mrs. Macadm-Kellie obtained an apprehended violence order from the Newcastle Local Court against the applicant. He consented to that order without admission. That order was obtained on 5 January 1999 and was current on the day of the offence. 
     8   On that day, the applicant and his wife were due to appear at the Family Court in Bolton Street, Newcastle. Mrs. Macadam-Kellie arrived at about 8.45 am, accompanied by their four year old son. 
     9   The applicant was apparently waiting nearby, equipped with the bread knife from the family home. As the victim approached the area where the applicant was waiting in the vicinity of the entrance to the Family Law Court, he approached her and produced the knife which was approximately 30 centimetres in length, with a tapering serrated edge blade. The victim dropped what she was carrying and ran screaming into the centre of the road. The applicant ran after her, caught her in the centre of the road and stabbed her in the right arm and in her back. When she fell to the ground she was stabbed a further three times in the stomach. The offender then dropped the knife and fled. 
     10   These events occurred in the presence of witnesses in and about the area of the Family Court entrance. One of those witnesses described the applicant as having ""reamed the knife around violently, before pulling it from her stomach"". The witness approached the applicant who was raising the knife above his head but then dropped the knife and grabbed the child when the witness told the applicant to get away. 
     11   Following the attack, the applicant approached a prison officer in the Newcastle Court complex area and informed him that he had stabbed his wife and thought that he had killed her. 
     12   He was interviewed at the local police station where, on a number of occasions, he said that he thought he had killed his wife. He also made statements to the effect of asking that the children be looked after and sent to a good home. 
     13   He gave an account to police that he had been waiting outside the court when his wife came up with the child. On his account he produced the knife, she said, ""no Billy"" and commenced to run; he chased her to the middle of the road where he stabbed her and then went to the police station. 
     14   The injuries to the victim verged on fatal. On admission to the John Hunter Hospital, she was haemodynamically unstable, presumably from blood loss. There was a two centimetre transverse laceration, four centimetres lateral to the umbilicus, a two centimetre vertical laceration in the left upper quadrant, a one centimetre laceration over the right costal margin at the front, a four centimetre laceration over the left iliac crest in the flank region, a one centimetre laceration to the right side of the posterior chest wall, a four centimetre laceration on the ulna side of the left forearm and a one centimetre laceration to the tip of the left fifth finger. 
     15   A laparotomy was performed on her, during the course of which it was noted that the flank wound seemed to involve the knife passing through the left flank, into the peritoneal cavity and thence into once side of the sigmoid colon and out the other. In that passage, the tip of the knife had skimmed across the top of the aorta and made several lacerations in the small bowel mesentery. Two holes were found in the stomach and the stab wound in the right of the abdomen, just lateral to the umbilicus, was found to enter the peritoneal cavity laterally. 
     16   Despite these serious wounds, the victim has apparently made some substantial recovery. There was no material before the trial judge to establish the victim's present condition. 
     17   The trial judge concluded that these serious wounds were done in a frenzy and that it was fortuitous the victim survived. He concluded:- 
      
       
        
        ""This was a serious attempt at murdering her."" 
        
       
     18   The trial judge concluded that the applicant in the electronically recorded interview with police was laconic, tearful and in distress, but he got the overall impression that the applicant was more distressed at his own predicament than at what might have happened to his wife. 
     19   His Honour specifically referred to particular answers of the applicant in response to questions as to why he had stabbed his wife. Those answers disclosed that he had done that because she was running away from him and he could not see her again. His Honour noted that the applicant had later said that he did not know what he intended to happen when he stabbed her, and he did not know why he did it. However, there had been some earlier acts of violence between the two. 
     20   His Honour noted that there was evidence of a plan formulated apparently by the applicant to abduct his wife, using the knife to persuade her to come with him so that he could reason with her and that in relation to his immediate motivation for the commission of the offence, the applicant had said that he had just snapped:- 
      
       
        
        ""I don't know, I just felt funny, that's all."" 
        
       
     21   He had admitted that he had the knife with him secreted in his belt but said that he had taken it to make his wife come with him. It had been his intention to threaten her with the knife to achieve that purpose. He asserted that he, at least initially, did not intend to use the knife to stab her, only wishing to get her into the van, but that he had stabbed her because she was running away. He asserted that he had sought to do these things because he loved his wife. 
     22   The trial judge concluded:- 
      
       
        
        ""This offence is an extremely serious one of its own accord but the facts in this matter make the offence towards, in my view, the higher end of the scale. This attack was a frenzied attack in which at least four wounds were made to potentially vital areas and, as I said, in my view, having read all the material, including in particular the medical report from Dr. Gani, it was more luck than good management that Mrs. Macadam-Kellie was not killed. There is evidence of some prior planning, at least of a significantly serious crime in the form of kidnapping. The knife used was an extremely large knife and its potential for harm was great and finally, of course, this offence was committed in the face of an apprehended domestic violence order by which he was bound, and in the face of Family Court proceedings in which he was involved."" 
        
       
     23   His Honour concluded that the offence called for a lengthy sentence by way of full time custody and that it appeared to be at the higher end of the scale provided for offences of this kind. 
     24   In turning to the applicant's subjective circumstances, his Honour noted that the applicant was 47 years of age, with no prior convictions and with a not unsatisfactory work history. 
     25   His Honour referred to a psychiatric report from Dr. Olaf Nielssen dated 24 September 1999 tendered in the Crown case. In that report, the applicant told the psychiatrist that he could remember the picking up of the knife, though not his exact mind or his intention at that time, but that he only ever intended to use the knife to persuade his wife to come with him so they could talk about their circumstances. He said that he wanted to take her out into the desert or some place where she could not run away so she would have to listen. He claimed not to recall the exact events preceding the assault. 
     26   He told Dr. Nielssen his intention was always to persuade his wife to come back to him and he denied ever planning to kill her. 
     27   Dr. Nielssen was of the view that the applicant's attention and concentration were affected by what appeared to be severe depression and emotional distress at the time of the interview, but that the responses were rather self-pitying and tended to minimise the applicant's own responsibility for his actions and the history of domestic violence. 
     28   Dr. Nielssen diagnosed a major depressive illness and a personality disorder, although the applicant appeared to have little awareness of the presence of that severe depressive illness. In summary, he said the applicant's behaviour appeared to have arisen from a combination of an immature personality with narcissistic traits, the adverse life events of losing his livelihood and separation from his wife and the development of the severe depressive illness. The doctor concluded that the applicant's behaviour was better understood as arising from the anger commonly observed in people going through a process of grief, particularly grief associated with rejection or abandonment. 
     29   The trial judge regarded Dr. Nielssen's observations of the applicant as self-pitying and tending to minimise his own responsibility as confirmed by the impression the trial judge had gained from viewing the record of interview. 
     30   On behalf of the applicant, there were tendered various reports, including from Dr. R. Foy, a registrar in psychiatry dated 27 April 1999. The applicant had told Dr. Foy that he had not slept the night before the attack, thinking about how he could get his wife to permit him to talk to her to have her come back and his plan to get her into the van to talk. 
     31   Dr. Foy referred to the applicant as suffering from major depression which affected his insight and judgment and Dr. Foy expressed the view that the attack was an impulsive and irrational act. 
     32   The trial judge had doubts as to whether that opinion should be accepted arising from the undoubted facts that the applicant had obtained the knife, had produced it and the attack had followed. 
     33   A further report was tendered from Dr. Bruce Westmore dated 8 November 1999. Dr. Westmore had been told that the applicant wished to take his wife away in the van into the bush or into the desert, to blow the van up and walk back with his wife, even if it takes weeks, so she would learn to love him again. Dr. Westmore also agreed with the diagnosis of depression but said there were no psychotic features. He referred to the applicant as suffering from a moderately depressed mood involving a mix of a strong reactive component and a vulnerable personality. He too concluded the applicant was suffering from a major depressive illness. 
     34   The trial judge observed:- 
      
       
        
        ""Dr. Westmore did not really attempt to provide any link between, or significant link between, the major depression which it appears from all the evidence the offender was suffering at the time and the actual commission of this offence."" 
        
       
     35   I will return to this matter later. 
     36   There were also tendered three reports from a psychologist, Vincent Cook, at the Cessnock Correctional Centre. These reports dealt with the applicant's suicidal tendencies following his incarceration in the Acute Crisis Management Unit, and in particular that the applicant had attempted suicide on two occasions so that for some substantial time, the applicant would have to serve any sentence in that Unit notwithstanding that this was a significantly harsher way to serve a sentence in that there were no real facilities in the cells, for obvious reasons. Mr. Cook did note that the applicant was improving. 
     37   Before the trial judge, it was submitted, notwithstanding that the applicant did not give evidence himself, that questions of general and specific deterrence should play a limited role in the process because of the applicant's suffering from the major depression to which I have referred. His Honour rejected that submission. He accepted the submission of the Crown Prosecutor that the attack was very severe and showed a degree of viciousness; that it was made in the face of the apprehended domestic violence order and was, in his view, a case in which deterrence, particularly general deterrence, must feature highly in the sentencing process. His Honour pointed out that the courts have stressed time and time again that apprehended domestic violence orders must be observed and that it is harder to imagine a more serious breach of that order than what occurred in this case. 
     38   His Honour, correctly in my view, noted that this was, of course, an aggravating factor also relevant to general deterrence. 
     39   His Honour's findings are to be understood in the context of the applicant having admittedly prepared himself with the knife to ambush and abduct his wife from outside, what should have been, a place of refuge. He attacked her in the presence of their four year old child and in a way which plainly showed he was seeking to kill her at that time rather than abduct her. His assertions as to why he stabbed her, as far as he claimed to remember, appear to be that in running away from his attempt to coerce her with a knife, she showed she was not willing to submit herself to his wishes. 
     40   In my view, his Honour's conclusions as so far expressed were entirely open to him and I agree with him, as I also agree with his Honour's conclusion that although it is not suggested that it was likely that some such event as this might occur again, one could not find, notwithstanding the submissions by the applicant's counsel that there were special and unique factors, that such an offence was unlikely to happen again. 
     41   In The Queen v. Elphick [2000] NSWSC 977, I referred to the circumstances in which that offender killed his partner arising from his frustration and anger at his inability to have her conform to the course he wished her to take with her life and because she did not accord with what he wanted her to be like. I cited the remarks of Allen, J. in The Queen v. Cheung (CCA, unreported 11 December 1995):- 
      
       
        
        ""There are those within the community whose approach to the relationship between a man and a woman is that if the man has what might be called a grand passion for the woman, which completely overwhelms him, there is somehow a degree of respectability in him giving vent to that grand passion by seeking to control the life of the woman against her will - indeed, even in an extreme case, taking her life if he believes that is what ought to be done. 
        
       
       
        
        There is no respectability in that at all. It is arrogance. I do accept that having such a grand passion, if it can be so called, can diminish, for sentencing, the importance of the element of personal deterrence. But it certainly does not diminish the importance of the element of general deterrence. Indeed, the very misconception that such a grand passion affords a degree of respectability to what otherwise is abhorrent makes it all the more important that, for the purpose of general deterrence, it be made perfectly clear that such an approach will not be tolerated in this civilised society."" 
        
       
     42   In the applicant's depression, he determined to abduct or kill his wife. He fortuitously did not commit the crime of murder but he has injured his wife most severely at a time when he intended to commit that crime. His crime falls little short in culpability of the completed crime. 
     43   However, his Honour also concluded that he did not accept that the applicant's adverse life events or his major depressive illness could be used in any way as mitigating factors in the commission of such an outrageous crime. 
     44   His Honour noted that there was no evidence in his view which he found acceptable that would link, in any way or any significant way, the major depression suffered by the applicant at the time with the commission of the crime. His Honour accepted that the applicant was entitled to the benefit of a plea of guilty, albeit that it was entered late, but that was in the context of a difficulty obtaining instructions by the legal practitioners. His Honour noted that there was an extraordinarily strong Crown case.  
     45   On the issue of special circumstances, his Honour noted the applicant's asserted general prior good character, the fact of the confession, some contrition, albeit arising to an extent out of a feeling of self-pity, that it was the applicant's first time in custody and of the confinement in the special unit which would be more onerous and that it was the case that for rehabilitation he would be subject to an extended period of parole. 
     46   His Honour had regard to the matters raised by the applicant's counsel in the light of the concession made by the Crown that those matters could give rise to a finding of special circumstances, but accepted the Crown submission that the need for the finding of special circumstances only arises where it is contemplated that it might be necessary for an offender to need a longer than normal period of supervision upon his release. His Honour concluded that the sentence which he felt appropriate as structured would allow an adequate period of time for supervised rehabilitation and assimilation into the community to occur. 
     47   His Honour did not think that there were special circumstances requiring an extended period of supervision and the non-parole period should therefore be in the statutory proportion. His Honour concluded that the offence:- 
      
       
        
        ""Is an extremely serious offence and falls certainly, in my view, well above the middle range for this type of offence."" 
        
       
     48   On appeal, it was submitted that his Honour should have allowed the full discount for a plea of guilty based on utilitarian considerations: Regina v. Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 418; see s.22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It was contended that that would have entitled the applicant to a discount of about 25%. 
     49   It was contended that there should have been a further discount for contrition, his Honour having acknowledged that contrition, even if it were alloyed to a certain extent by the applicant's concern for himself. It was contended that even though there was a strong Crown case, in the light of what had been said in Thomson (supra), the value of the plea had been underestimated by his Honour and so had contrition, particularly having in regard to the early confession: The Queen v. Bond (1990) 48 A. Crim. R. 1 at 6-7. 
     50   It was contended that his Honour had fallen into error in confining his enquiry in relation to special circumstances as he had, since it has now been held in The Queen v. Carrion [2000] NSWCCA 191 that the utility of special circumstances and the purpose for seeking to ascertain whether there are such circumstances, is different from that which prevailed under the Sentencing Act 1989. 
     51   Most importantly, and I refer again to the finding of his Honour concerning the applicant's suffering from depression, to which I have referred above, it was contended that his Honour erred in failing to accept the findings of Dr. Nielssen and in concluding that there was no evidence which established a link between the major depressive illness the applicant was suffering and the commission of the offence. In that regard, it was submitted that the offence was substantially mitigated in having been committed whilst the applicant was so suffering. 
     52   As I have noted, there was some considerable psychiatric evidence but, the proceedings before the trial judge went ahead on the basis of the tender of written reports without the psychiatrists being called to give evidence. 
     53   I have referred to his Honour's observation that Dr. Westmore did not make any significant link between the mental condition and the offence. 
     54   It is the case that the report of Dr. Westmore of 8 November 1999 did not explicitly associate the major depressive illness and the incident, although the coincidence of the condition with the event was noted. It would appear that his Honour has evaluated the other medical opinion on the basis that Dr. Westmore did not consider there was such a link. 
     55   On appeal, it was submitted the court should have regard to a report from Dr. Westmore dated 26 February 2001 which is annexed to the affidavit of Ross Hill, solicitor, sworn 27 March 2001 and which is read on the appeal. In summary, that report supports entirely the opinion expressed by Dr. Nielssen and also the view of Dr. Foy that the major depression was affecting the applicant's insight and judgment. Dr. Westmore accepted that he had not in his previous report made an explicit link between the commission of the offence and the major depressive condition and pointed out that no doubt such evidence would have been obtained from him had he given oral evidence in court. He expressed the view that it was not possible to separate the significance of the man's depression from his aggressive act and that the depression was so severe that, had the victim died, the applicant might well have been eligible for a defence of substantial impairment or diminished responsibility. 
     56   Whilst his Honour does not appear to have expressly stated, that he rejected the link between the illness and the act as opined by Dr. Nielssen and by Dr. Foy, after observing that Dr. Westmore did not really attempt to provide any link or significant link of that kind, he expressed the view that the major depression could not be used as a mitigating feature in the context of observing that there was no evidence which, in his view, he found acceptable that would link, in any way or any significant way, the depression to the commission of the crime. 
     57   It would appear that his Honour reached that view in the context of the reports being tendered without oral evidence or cross-examination and on the basis that Dr. Westmore had not made his view of the link explicit. Such a statement, it seems clear, would and could have been made if the matter had proceeded on a basis that the parties or the doctor considered such a link was open to doubt. 
     58   In my view, the fresh evidence should be admitted notwithstanding that on behalf of the Crown, it was submitted that the report was admissible on re-sentencing but that the trial judge had not been led into error by its absence. The report is plainly material on a re-sentencing exercise, however, I have concluded that its absence at trial led the trial judge into error in his assessment of the link between the major depressive illness and the crime and thus led him to misinterpret the conclusions of the other psychiatrists. I would conclude that this report is admissible to show error rather than only in the event of error having been shown. 
     59   It was also contended that his Honour's sentence was manifestly excessive, having regard to the maximum for the offence and by comparison with other sentences for this offence, schedules of which were provided to us even making appropriate provision for this offence as falling, as his Honour found ""well above the middle range for this type of offence"". 
     60   It was submitted that making allowances for the matters of the plea and contrition, his Honour must have treated the offence as falling within or close to the worst class of case so that the sentence, after the relevant discounts, would result in the sentence which was imposed and that a comparison with the various cases provided showed that such a starting point was in error. 
     61   Particularly it is submitted, that the asserted error in relation to the finding of special circumstances resulted in a non-parole period which exceeded that which was requisite in the context of the psychiatrists' opinions. 
     62   I consider it is not necessary that these matters be resolved whether his Honour erred in this respect since I am of the view that error has been shown arising from his Honour's failure to accept what must be treated in the light of Dr. Westmore's further report that the undoubted link between the major depressive illness and the crime and in such a case it is well accepted that less weight might be given to the factor of general deterrence: The Queen v. Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A. Crim. R. 81. For myself, however, I am of the view that putting aside the matter of the mental condition, this case does fall within or up towards the worst class of case. I do not consider the comparisons with other sentences as submitted to assist the applicant. 
     63   Further, I am of the view that, in the light of the plea of guilty, the early confession and contrition, but qualified as his Honour noted an appropriate discount on sentence would be of the order of 15%.  
     64   But, having regard to those matters and to the impact of those matters on a sentence which otherwise would be required to emphasise general deterrence, I conclude that, in particular, in the light of the further evidence concerning the link between the offence and the mental illness, that an appropriate sentence would be that of 15 years imprisonment to commence on 24 February 1999 and to expire on 23 February 2014. In respect of that sentence, having regard to the principles in Carrion (supra), I would be minded to impose a non-parole period of 11 years to commence 24 February 1999 and expire on 23 February 2010. In particular, I would be minded to pass a sentence as severe as this notwithstanding the major depression and its link with the commission of the offence in that the objective criminality calling for a substantial element of general deterrence otherwise than as is affected by the mental condition of the applicant is so high. 
     65   I would therefore propose that the sentence imposed by his Honour be quashed and in lieu the applicant to sentenced to imprisonment for 15 years to commence 24 February 1999 and to expire on 23 February 2014 and that a non-parole period be imposed of 11 years to commence on 24 February 1999 and to expire on 23 February 2010.

      MELVA ELIZABETH STANLEY v. DENISE LESLEY FARLOW 
       
      
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: These two matters were ordered to be heard together by Newman, J. on 24 July 2000 because the matters involve similar factual backgrounds and the same question of law. 
    2   Each matter is an application to the Supreme Court by summons under Part 5 of the Justices Act 1902 seeking to review a decision in each case of a magistrate: in the one case, Duncan v. Crews & Anor, staying a summary prosecution; and in the other, Stanley v. Farlow, declining to stay a summary prosecution. 
     
      
     The alleged offences 
      
    3   In each case, there had been, in the Local Court, a summary prosecution on numerous counts for offences by way of contravention of s.1347 of the Social Security Act 1991 which provides:- 
     
      
       
       ""A person must not knowingly obtain:- 
       
      
      
       
       (a) payment of a social security payment under this Act or of fares allowance; or 
       
      
      
       
       (b) payment of an instalment of a social security payment under this Act; 
       
      
      
       
       for which the person is not eligible, or which is:- 
       
      
      
       
       (c) not payable at all; or 
       
      
      
       
       (d) only payable in part."" 
       
      
    4   Such contraventions, if proved, amount to offences under s.1350 of that Act which may be prosecuted summarily and carry a maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $6,600 (pursuant to s.4B(2) of the Crimes Act (Cth)1914). 
     
      
     Background 
      
    5   In both matters, it is alleged that the defendants before the magistrate either did not declare income or understated income. All the prosecutions relate to the requirements for receipt of Job Search/Newstart Allowances. Persons seeking such allowances are required to complete each fortnight a Fortnightly Continuation Form. That form is required to have entered on it by the applicant details of any income received during that period. The allowance, if any, otherwise payable is reduced, having regard to the amount earned during that period. 
     
      
     The proceedings before the magistrates 
      
    6   In both cases, it is accepted that various Fortnightly Continuation Forms containing information as to income during a relevant period, were either lost or destroyed by Centrelink, the lodging authority. 
    7   In both cases, the prosecution is attempting to rely on a computer generated record ""Earnings from Employment"" which purports to be a computer generated record of the amounts of income notified to Centrelink by lodgment of the Fortnightly Continuation Form and transferred to that record from that form. 
    8   Both applications for a permanent stay of the proceedings were based on the fact that Centrelink could not produce the relevant Fortnightly Continuation Form completed by the applicant to substantiate the figures shown in the computer generated document, those forms having been destroyed. It was common ground that there was an entitlement under the Archives Act 1983 for Centrelink to destroy the forms. 
    9   In Duncan v. Crews & Anor, Centrelink was not able to produce in relation to the eight counts, four forms going to four of the charges. 
    10   In Stanley v. Farlow, Centrelink was unable to produce in relation to the five counts before the magistrate any Fortnightly Continuation Forms in relation to counts one, two and four and only parts of those forms as might relate to counts three and five. 
    11   In each case, it was sought to tender the evidence of the earnings from the employment computer generated document as a business record of the prosecution rather than as simply secondary evidence of the forms that had been lodged by the defendant, although the content of the forms was said to be able to be inferred from that of other forms. 
    12   No tendency evidence notices were given as required by the Evidence Act 1995, if the evidence was to be used for that purpose, and the matters were dealt with as the transcript in each matters shows on the basis of submissions put from the bar table. 
    13   Objection was taken to the tender of the computer forms in the matter of Duncan v. Crews & Anor but not in the matter of Stanley v. Farlow. 
    14   In Duncan v. Crews & Anor, the defence asserted was an honest and reasonable mistake of fact, alternatively that the answer to one question on the forms turned on an interpretation of that question in the defendant's favour. The defence successfully moved for the stay prior to the commencement of the prosecution case. In that matter, the prosecutor agreed:- 
     
      
       
       ""A great majority of the forms have been destroyed and are unavailable. It is not disputed again that a check was made between the forms that are available with the computer data information to verify how correct that computer data was and on two occasions the computer data was incorrect."" 
       
      
    15   There was available systems evidence to show that the information submitted by the defendant was intended to be accurately transformed onto the computer forms but there was an admission that human error was possible. 
    16   The court was informed from the bar table that the plaintiff could not recall what she had written on the forms three years earlier and the absence of the original forms meant that there would be no evidence of what she did in fact write on the forms. It was contended that the unavailability of the forms in those circumstances in each case deprived the defendant in each case of the opportunity of a fair trial. 
    17   The magistrate having stayed the proceedings, the Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth seeks that that order be quashed. In Stanley v. Farlow, the stay is sought that the magistrate declined to order. 
    18   In both matters, reliance was placed by the defendants before the magistrate on the decision of Wicks, J. of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Commonwealth Service Delivery Agency v. Bourke (unreported 16 April 1999). Before me the defendants submit that decision should be followed. The Director of Public Prosecutions submits that decision is wrong and should not be followed. 
     
      
     The decisions of the magistrates 
      
    19   In the matter of Stanley v. Farlow, the magistrate delivered an extensive judgment. Relevantly, he concluded that the matters to which the defendant had pointed as the matters going to whether she could have a fair trial are the very matters which would effect the fulfilment by the prosecutor of the necessary burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt. He concluded that if the defendant gave evidence to the effect that she had no intention of obtaining something she wasn't meant to, even if she couldn't remember what it was she had said in the forms, then the tribunal of fact when fairly conducting the trial would have to take into account when assessing her defence that she had no means of showing what she had actually put on her form. He said:- 
     
      
       
       ""But she might well have filled in the forms in such a way as to show that, even if they weren't filled in as they should have been, that they were certainly not filled in so as to trick her way into something she wasn't entitled to"".  
       
      
    20   The magistrate proceeded, so it was submitted by the defendant before me, to hear the application on the basis that the plaintiff's contention was that she did not put false information to Centrelink. 
    21   On that basis, the magistrate ultimately determined that he could adequately direct himself as to the absence of forms and refused the application to stay the proceedings. 
    22   It was submitted that the magistrate concluded he must proceed on the basis that the plaintiff was not acting so as to obtain something she was not entitled to and thus he could never be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. In those circumstances, it was contended the magistrate should have stayed the proceedings because the matter was doomed to failure. 
    23   Such a submission is over-simplistic. The offence is an offence of knowingly obtaining payment of an allowance at an amount not payable. The magistrate's remarks do not require him at the point in the hearing the matter had reached to have concluded that he must acquit the defendant without hearing further even though it might have been open to him to take that course. 
    24   The proceedings were adjourned to enable the testing of the magistrate's decision on the stay application at the close of the prosecution case. 
    25   In the matter of Duncan v. Crews & Anor, the application to stay the proceedings was made during the prosecution case and subsequently renewed at the close of evidence in the prosecution case. 
    26   An application by the prosecution to amend in consequence of the fact that the periods which had been covered by two of the charges included periods to which two of the missing forms related, was declined on the basis that it was too late in the proceedings and that the prosecution had had sufficient notice by reason of the cross-examination. 
    27   The learned magistrate held that it was necessary for her to consider each of the counts separately, although the proceedings were being heard together and that the loss of forms relevant to particular counts created such prejudice as to be unable to say whether the relevant information was entered in the computer correctly. She referred to a prosecution submission that all the other forms were correct and that therefore these had to be correct and rather than consider that in the light of principles relating to the admissibility of tendency or similar fact evidence, referred to Bourke's case as persuasive on the issue that she should stay the proceedings. 
    28   Just as the magistrate in Stanley v. Farlow had noted the possibility of an acquittal on the basis that the prosecution had failed to prove the matters to which the missing forms related beyond reasonable doubt, the magistrate in Duncan v. Crews & Anor referred to her having anticipated that there might be some application that she should acquit on the basis that the evidence, although sufficient to make out the offence, was not such as to satisfy her. She then delivered a short judgment in respect of the four counts in the information on which the forms had been misplaced or destroyed, holding that the unfairness generated to the defendant by the loss of the forms was sufficient for her to conclude that a stay should be granted. 
     
      
     Materials provided on appeal 
      
    29   In each case, on the matter coming forward for hearing before me, I was provided with a chronology, statement of grounds, and affidavits in support setting out what had occurred before each learned magistrate together with extensive written submissions. All of these were received without objection and to all of that material I have had regard. 
    30   In each case, the learned magistrate filed a submitting appearance. 
    31   In each case, I have been provided with the evidence including the evidence by way of recorded interview taken by officers of the Department with the defendants and my attention drawn to the accepted conduct of the matter below which, in each case, although charging individual offences, relied upon a course of conduct on the part of the defendant so as to show the deliberate omission or understatement of income as applicable to individual counts. 
     
      
     The questions 
      
    32   Before me, the parties contented themselves with seeking a determination of the legal question involved in each case in the light of the decision in Bourke (supra) and, having considered their position, were of the view that depending upon the result it might be necessary for them to make further submissions should the matters be returned to the magistrates in the further conduct of the matters in the Local Court, particularly concerning what evidence might be admissible on each count. 
    33   During the argument, I drew to the parties' attention that the proceedings had been instituted under s.105 of the Justices Act 1902 which had been repealed and that s.104 of that Act now provide for the relevant appeal in each case. That section reads as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""(1) A person against whom any conviction or order was made, or sentence was imposed, by a magistrate in summary proceedings may appeal under this Division to the Supreme Court on any of the following grounds:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) a ground that involves a question of law alone, 
       
      
      
       
        (b) a ground that involves a question of mixed law and fact, but only with the leave of the Supreme Court, 
       
      
      
       
        (c) the ground that the conviction, order or sentence cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         This subsection does not apply in respect of an order that is made in relation to committal proceedings or an interlocutory order. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (2) An informant may appeal under this Division to the Supreme Court against the following, on a ground that involves a question of law alone:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) an order made by a magistrate that stays summary proceedings for the prosecution of an offence, 
       
      
      
       
        (b) an order made by a magistrate in summary proceedings dismissing an information or complaint, 
       
      
      
       
        (c) an order for costs made by a magistrate in summary proceedings, 
       
      
      
       
        (d) a sentence imposed by a magistrate in summary proceedings. 
       
      
      
       
       (3) A defendant or an informant may appeal under this Division to the Supreme Court against any order that is made in relation to committal proceedings, on a ground that involves a question of law alone, but only with the leave of the Supreme Court. 
       
      
      
       
       (4) A defendant or an informant may appeal under this Division to the Supreme Court against any interlocutory order that is made by a magistrate in summary proceedings, on a ground that involves a question of law alone, but only with the leave of the Supreme Court. 
       
      
      
       
       (5) A party to any proceedings under the Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act 1970 may appeal under this Division to the Supreme Court as provided for by s.69 of that Act."" 
       
      
    34   It is plain that for the matters to proceed to an effective determination of the essential common question, it was necessary to state the question of law applicable. 
    35   It became apparent during the argument of the matter before me, that although the parties had sought that the matter proceed on the basis of a common question of law, applying Bourke (supra), the form of the question had not been precisely articulated. Whatever be the form of the question, it is clear that it involves a common question of law turning on the correctness of the applicability of the decision in Bourke (supra). A question of leave however arose. 
    36   It was submitted that the order refusing the stay was an interlocutory order which required leave under s.104(4) of the Justices Act 1902. 
    37   In Stanley v. Farlow, no such submission has been made as was made in respect of the order of the magistrate in Duncan v. Crews & Anor staying the proceedings. Nonetheless, the proceedings have before me continued on the basis that leave, so far as is necessary to argue the common question of law, is conceded by the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
    38   Since the matter to be determined is a question of general importance, so far as is necessary, I grant leave. 
    39   The matter was stood over to enable the parties to articulate such a question as might be applicable to the two proceedings. In due course I was advised that the parties had agreed on questions. I set out those questions and the accompanying qualifications:- 
     
      
       
       Duncan v. Crews & Anor 
       
      
      
       
       ""Question 1 Is the decision of Wicks, J. in  
       Commonwealth Service Delivery Agency v. Bourke 
        (South Australian Supreme Court, unreported 16 April 1999), in relation to the granting of a stay, on the facts and circumstances of that case, good law in New South Wales? 
       
      
      
       
       Question 2 If the answer to question one was 'yes', was the decision of the learned magistrate to permanently stay proceedings in respect of counts one, five, seven and eight of the information in these proceedings correct? 
       
      
      
       
       Question 3 If the answer to question one was 'no', was the decision of the learned magistrate to permanently stay proceedings in respect of counts 1, five, seven and eight of the information in these proceedings correct? 
       
      
      
       
       Question 4 Did the learned magistrate err in law in holding, on the evidence available to her, that the destruction of the four forms caused a prejudice to the second respondent which was incapable of remedy in the proceedings before her? 
       
      
      
       
       Question 5 If there was prejudice caused to the second respondent, was that prejudice capable of remedy, and if so, what was the appropriate remedy?"" 
       
      
      
      
       
       Stanley v. Farlow 
       
      
      
       
       ""In this matter, a divergence of views concerning the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court prevents any agreement by the parties on the questions to be asked. 
       
      
      
       
       The plaintiff contends that there is no barrier in the way of jurisdiction or proper function and no proper reason to decline to answer the following questions, which are similar to the agreed questions as posed in Duncan v. Crews. 
       
      
      
       
       Question 1 Is the decision of Wicks, J. in  
       Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency v. Bourke  
       (South Australian Supreme Court, unreported 16 April 1999), in relation to the granting of a stay, on the facts and circumstances of that case, good law in New South Wales? 
       
      
      
       
       Question 2 If the answer to question one was 'yes', was the decision of the learned magistrate to refuse to permanently stay proceedings in respect of counts one to five of the information in these proceedings correct? 
       
      
      
       
       Question 3 If the answer to question one was 'no', was the decision of the learned magistrate to refuse to permanently stay proceedings in respect of counts one to five of the information in these proceedings correct? 
       
      
      
       
       Question 4 Did the learned magistrate err in law in holding on the evidence available to him that the destruction of the forms and the errors in the date entry were capable of remedy by appropriate directions of law? 
       
      
      
       
       Question 5 If there was prejudice caused to the plaintiff, was that prejudice capable of remedy, and if so, what was the appropriate remedy? 
       
      
      
       
       The defendant is of the view that given the nature of the appeal in this matter, questions of the kind posed in the Duncan v. Crews matter cannot be applied to the Stanley v. Farlow matter and answered by the court. 
       
      
      
       
       This is because the jurisdiction and/or proper function of this honourable court on a review brought under Part 5 of the Justices Act 1902, is confined to the question of whether or not, as a matter of law, the learned magistrate was entitled to decline to exercise his discretion to grant a permanent stay of proceedings on the material that was before him taking into account the principles applicable to answering questions one to five in the Pile matter. Alternatively 
       , the defendant contends that, as a matter of discretion, this honourable court ought to decline to intervene at this stage in the Local Court proceedings, leaving the matter for the usual avenues of appeal in the event of a conviction or such other proper grounds of review as may emerge as the Local Court hearing progresses."" (emphasis added) 
       
      
    40   As is apparent, agreement did not extend to the consequences of questions one to five being answered in certain circumstances in the matter of Stanley v. Farlow. For the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the ultimate submission in that matter turned upon a submission that it is discretionary in a court to stay proceedings permanently in the event of a fair trial being unable to be had. 
    41   Subsequent to the originally submitted questions being received, it was agreed that the contentions originally advanced might be amended so that the first sentence in the second paragraph of the qualification to the questions would now be amended to include the words emphasised above:- 
    42   In my view, the questions as posed inappositely state the common question of law to the two proceedings the parties seek that I decide. A number of months now have been devoted to the parties attempting to agree upon the formulation. I do not see it necessary to delay longer. In each case, question two of the questions raised sufficiently the correctness of the decision of the learned magistrate in one case to stay proceedings and in the other to refuse to stay proceedings. 
    43   The question as to the correctness in each case of the magistrate's decision may be adequately stated by reference to the decision in Bourke (supra) in each case by adding to the question as expressed as question two, was the decision of the learned magistrate to refuse or to grant a permanent stay of the proceedings in reliance on the decision in Bourke (supra), correct? 
    44   As to question one, it will sufficiently appear from these reasons of the view I take of the applicability of the decision in Bourke (supra) in New South Wales. 
    45   In each case, question three, four and five are matters preliminary to the determination of the correctness of a magistrate's decision. The contention that as a matter of discretion, notwithstanding the way in which the matter was conducted before me as though the question was appropriate for leave and the issue was fairly joined between the parties, I should decline to intervene at this stage, is one that I reject, having regard to the way in which the parties conducted the proceedings. 
    46   Before turning to an examination of the parties' submissions and the case law, I note that it was common ground between all parties that no orders for costs were sought in either proceedings in any event. 
     
      
     The legal test 
      
    47   The resolution of the question involved in these proceedings does not require examination of whether the proceedings are being brought for an improper purpose or ulterior to the purpose for which they were intended (see Williams v. Spautz (1992) 174 CLR 509; Walton v. Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378) (which latter case also deals with the continuation of proceedings doomed to failure). 
    48   In Jago v. District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 34, it was said that the power to stay only arises in the event of a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial ""of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences"". 
    49   Although there have been prosecutions stayed by reason of abuse of process for unfairness where the evidence has been destroyed including Holmden v. Bitar (1987) 47 SASR 509; Crawford v. Bickar (1987) 75 ALR 522; and Heinze v. Burnley (1992) 57 SASR 452, the mere absence of evidence that has become unavailable otherwise than by the fault of the defendant is not itself generally sufficient to justify a stay of proceedings: Regina v. Adler (CCA, unreported 11 June 1992); Regina v. Goldburg (CCA, unreported 23 February 1993); Regina v. Tolmie (CCA, unreported 7 December 1994). It is of fundamental importance to the processes of justice that courts should exercise their jurisdiction:  Spautz (supra) at 519; Jago (supra) at 47. The absence of important evidence which might have assisted the Crown will usually leave a defect in the Crown case which, if not repairable, may result in a reasonable doubt and acquittal. The absence of evidence which might have assisted the defence requires evaluation of the importance of that evidence to enabling the defence to have a fair trial. 
    50   On the authorities, before a stay will be granted it is necessary that the proceedings be seen as having to miscarry, notwithstanding the extensive powers available to a trial judge or a magistrate in New South Wales and in Commonwealth matters to ensure the proceedings are fair, eg., under the Evidence Act 1995 to reject evidence, and to give appropriate directions as to how evidence should be treated; to draw inferences and to consider the importance of the facts in issue and the absent evidence in the light of the burden of proof and the importance, in that context, of the absent evidence. 
    51   The ultimate issue is whether the proceedings can no longer serve the purpose for which the statute, in this case the Justices Act 1902, was provided, that is, whether the magistrate will be able to hear and determine the proceedings by a fair trial. If not, it will be one of those exceptional cases in which a stay should be granted. Otherwise, the trial should proceed unless doomed to failure: Walton v. Gardiner (supra). 
    52   Although both parties cited extensive authority referring to such decisions as Regina v. Davis (1995) 81 A. Crim. R. 156 and Regina v. Reeves (1994) 122 ACTR 1 as to the effect on proceedings of unavailable documentation, it is plain that in each case the nature of the proceedings and the nature of the documentation will require that each case be determined on its own merits by the weighing process I have referred to and the balancing process referred to in Jago (supra). 
    53   The absence of the documentation needs to be considered in the context of the available powers under the Evidence Act 1995 in particular to reject evidence tendered for the purpose of attempting to establish the matter to which that documentation might go or to reject the tender of secondary or tendency evidence and in the context that a prosecuting party in the absence of the evidence may not be able to rebut a reasonable doubt on matters genuinely in issue. 
     
      
     Review of the magistrate's decision 
      
    54   Both parties accepted I had power to stay the proceedings a magistrate has wrongly refused to stay or to order a magistrate to continue proceedings wrongly stayed and I should examine all powers a magistrate might exercise to see the basis for the decision below and to decide on its correctness. 
    55   Such a decision by me would be, however, not in the exercise of a discretion but one compelled by a conclusion of error below, eg., incorrect findings, just as the magistrate's initial decision should be one to which the magistrate is compelled by findings that the statutory duty cannot, in the particular circumstances, be performed rather than being based on some notion of a discretion not to hear a case based on less than satisfactory evidence. 
    56   One of the powers the magistrate has, as a tribunal of fact, is to acquit and to do so in an appropriate case at the close of the Crown case. Such a course may be taken as a consequence of rejecting evidence including on discretionary grounds. 
    57   It will be apparent from this discussion the degree of importance I place upon it being open to the magistrate to be able to acquit in accordance with the second branch of the rule in May v. O'Sullivan (1955) 92 CLR 654 even though there might be a sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction. In this case it is apparent both magistrates turned their mind to that matter, in each case envisaging that that might well be the course each might, in due course, take. Entering an acquittal would be the more appropriate course than ordering a stay if the magistrate is left with reasonable doubt as to an essential matter, eg., what were the relevant contents of the forms. The evidence of the defendant at the trial may or may not be able to resolve the issue but if it cannot resolve the doubt in favour of the prosecution there should be an acquittal rather than a stay. Indeed, if it is appropriate to acquit, to order a stay would be a fundamental error. The magistrate in Stanley v. Farlow appears to have so reasoned but the magistrate in Stanley v. Crews does not appear to have considered this matter this way relaying on Bourke (supra). 
     
      
     The decision in Bourke 
      
    58   I turn to the decision in Bourke (supra). In that matter, Wicks, J. drew attention to the offences having been detected by means of a date comparison with that provided to the Australian Taxation Office from that provided in the Department of Social Security (Centrelink) records. In that matter, as in these, the original forms had been destroyed in accordance with the Archives Act 1983. The application was made prior to evidence being called for the prosecution and upheld by the magistrate. The proceedings before his Honour were an appeal by the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency against the order the magistrate made permanently staying the proceedings on the ground that they constituted and abuse of process. 
    59   His Honour referred to the mass of authority now in this field of jurisprudence concerning the grant of stays and to the magistrate having undertaken the balancing process of weighing the two competing public interests, that is, the right of the accused to a fair trial, and the need to punish people who break the law, in accordance with that as described in Walton v. Gardiner (supra). 
    60   His Honour stated the question before him thus:- 
     
      
       
       ""The question, therefore, is whether this was one of those rare and exceptional cases where a stay should be ordered."" 
       
      
    61   His Honour had stated that question in the context of his citation of the passage from Barton v. The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75 cited in Jago (supra) referring to the necessity before the power arises for there to be a fundamental defect going to the root of the trial as I have earlier described. 
    62   His Honour concluded that the only evidence which was capable of corroborating the story of the respondent had been destroyed and that the result of that is that to continue with the proceedings would result in an unfair trial. He did so on the basis of an examination of a number of South Australian cases and on the basis that it was essential to a fair trial that the appellant be allowed to support his version of the events. His Honour noted that the issue in the case before him was not so much the strength of the prosecution case without the Fortnightly Continuation Forms, but rather, ""whether denying the defendant the opportunity to corroborate his version of events without the fortnightly forms would constitute an abuse of the court's processes"". 
    63   His Honour concluded that where the facts as put on that basis were adequately before the court on an application preliminary to the calling of evidence, there was no error in the learned magistrate in not considering the strength of the prosecution case. 
     
      
      
     The applicability of Bourke 
      
    64   I regret that I am unable, in the light of the authorities to which I have referred and the principles I have earlier enunciated, to extend to these cases his Honour's view that ""the issue in this case was not the strength of the prosecution case without the fortnightly forms"". I say this with the greatest deference to the care and skill with which his Honour has framed his judgment. I am of the view that to approach the matter in this way fails to appreciate adequately that the onus in cases of this kind remains on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt from first to last and that the absence of essential documentation may appropriately be considered as leading to an acquittal where the tribunal of fact is not persuaded of guilt no matter what might have been the contents of the forms. 
    65   In the event that a defendant is deprived of corroboration of their account in these circumstances, one cannot conclude that their account might be diminished in weight by what might have appeared in the lost documentation. Nor can one consider that the prosecution case has eliminated the possibility of such error as might diminish the weight of the prosecution case. In those circumstances, it may well be that the appropriate course might be to acquit. Such a course, however, could not be taken without hearing what the defence is and whether or not the lost documentation might relate to the matters genuinely in issue between the parties such as to effect the strength of the prosecution case and such as to permit the drawing of an inference adverse to it. An application for an acquittal at the close of the Crown case might, of course, be upheld where that case is then seen as insufficient or where the magistrate has a reasonable doubt on the prosecution evidence. 
    66   A mere absence of documentation, the want of which might be supplied by secondary evidence, albeit it might carry with it some doubt as to the weight to be accorded to that evidence, is not sufficient so that a magistrate would not remain charged with the task of hearing and determining the substance of the complaint. These are not such cases as was Holmden (supra) where the averments had the effect of placing the onus on the accused and the destruction of the documents meant that the accused could not make an effective answer since she could not, by her own testimony, prove that the contents were not as averred. 
    67   In Bourke (supra), it is notable the prosecution relied upon an asserted inconsistency between versions given by the respondent in his record of interview with the Department. That interview, his Honour noted, was conducted in circumstances where the respondent did not have the forms before him and where, as his Honour noted, in the absence of the fortnightly forms, it would be unfair to rely upon the record of that interview as to the substance of what the respondent said as to his assertions that what he did was in accordance with his statutory obligation and as to his general credibility. His Honour concluded that it would be unfair to rely upon the record of that interview at least for the purpose of testing the credibility of the respondent. But I must remark that, insofar as the defence was that the respondent in that case did not knowingly obtain an improper payment in that the information he provided was accurate, so far as there was a test to his credibility based upon the answers in the record of interview which referred to ""an honest mistake"" and being ""reckless"", where those answers were given in the absence of the forms, one would have to be forgiven for concluding that his defence could not, on that basis, be rejected. If it is unfair to rely upon the record of interview, it should be rejected. 
    68   It is to be noted that, although there was in Bourke (supra) a case made on the basis that the prosecution would prove a systematic dishonest approach to providing income details and thus rely upon similar facts, and that the Department did not make errors when processing the information (in effect, again, evidence of system) there was no examination of those matters in the context of a possible rejection of that evidence nor consideration of the weight to be afforded it as I have already held are appropriate in these circumstances. 
     
      
     Conclusion 
      
    69   It is for those reasons that I conclude, in the matter of Stanley v. Farlow, that the decision of the learned magistrate refusing permanently to stay proceedings in respect of counts one to five in the information, was correct, having regard to the views I have expressed of the decision in Bourke (supra) and as to the applicable law in New South Wales. 
    70   I also conclude for those reasons that the learned magistrate in Duncan v. Crews & Anor erred in law in permanently staying proceedings in respect of counts one, five, seven and eight, having regard to those same matters, in that she failed to take into account, or, at least, express as having taken into account, the matters to which I have referred and since, on the face of the magistrate's decision, it did not appear that, having regard to her powers to reject evidence, to evaluate it, to draw or to refuse to draw inferences and to direct herself appropriately, she gave sufficient consideration to the exceptional nature of the remedy. 
    71   In the circumstances and having regard to the dispute between the parties as to the relevant question, but particularly having regard to both magistrates having referred to the possibility of acquittal in the circumstances, I shall re-list the matter for the parties to inform me what further questions remain outstanding, alternatively to bring in short minutes as to the appropriate form of orders.

      FRIDAY 11 MAY 2001 
      
      REGINA v. CANE PEJOVSKI 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   GREG JAMES, J: The applicant for leave to appeal against sentence was convicted, following his trial in the District Court of New South Wales, on one count of attempting to obtain possession of prohibited imports, an offence under the Customs Act 1901, s.233B(1)(c). He was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years, the sentence and non-parole period to date from 14 July 2000. 
     2   The short circumstances of the offence were recited by the learned sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence. The applicant had attempted to obtain possession of a prohibited drug, namely methylene dioxymethamphetamine, commonly known as ecstasy, in an amount not less than the trafficable quantity. This drug had been imported into Australia in contravention of the Customs Act 1901. The maximum penalty for the offence is 25 years imprisonment. 
     3   On 7 December 1997 customs officers detected the drugs, which had a relevant pure weight of 214.4 grams, in a package addressed to Beck Architectural Company, 73 Vaumans Road, Peakhurst. The package had been sent by a person named Vlado in Belgium. 
     4   There was no such road in Peakhurst. A person phoned Australia Post from Belgium, asking about the package, and was told that it had been incorrectly addressed. 
     5   Later, a phone call was made to Australia Post, saying that the correct address was 73 Baumans Road, Peakhurst. That was the prisoner's address. He was, at the time, engaged in the process of doing extensive renovations to his home. 
     6   A controlled delivery was attempted by Australian Federal Police. The prisoner was not in attendance at the time, so a calling card was left. The prisoner later rang and made arrangements for the delivery of the package and, on the occasion of that delivery, the prisoner identified himself as being the person who could receive the material on behalf of Beck Architectural. 
     7   He signed for the package. He took it, wrapped it in a t-shirt, placed it in a plastic shopping bag, and put it in a filing cabinet in his shed, which he then locked and, in due course, provided the key to his co-accused, Messieurs Bunevski and Rahme, who went to the prisoner's shed and collected the package. He had provided the key after arranging a meeting with Bunevski. 
     8   Prior to that meeting, he had rung the person Vlado who had been responsible for the importation of the package into Australia from Belgium, no doubt to inform him that the package, notwithstanding its incorrect address, had been delivered. 
     9   It was his defence at trial that he was an innocent dupe. At trial, the trial judge noted, the accused had asserted that he had been rung by Vlado to pick up a parcel on his behalf, which he should not open. He was told by Vlado, having rung after receipt of the parcel, to contact Bunevski and pass the parcel to him. That innocent explanation was not accepted. It is not surprising. 
     10   The learned trial judge held, on the basis of those facts, that the prisoner played an important role in the attempted importation, in that his role was central to the receipt of the drugs and the intended distribution of the drugs. He said:- 
      
       
        
        ""However, I am unable to say that his role was greater or lesser than the others."" 
        
       
     11   The learned trial Judge noted that the offence was a serious one, that the quantity of drugs was some 428 times the trafficable quantity, with a considerable street value. 
     12   On the other hand, he noted that there were favourable subjective circumstances in the applicant's prior life and behaviour. He had lived a simple life prior to emigrating to Australia, and a decent life here, with long term employment. He had been a dedicated husband and father and, according to the large number of testimonials from various members of his community, he was a person who had put a lot of time and effort into that community, thus attracting a high reputation. 
     13   The only other matter on which he had come before the courts was for a traffic offence of driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol. 
     14   In respect of that good character, his Honour observed:- 
      
       
        
        ""I accept that the prisoner was of previous good character, however, due to the type of offence he has committed, not a lot of weight can be given to that matter."" 
        
       
     15   His Honour adverted to the numerous pronouncements of the courts concerning the necessity to deter those that play a part in this evil trade, and had regard to the various matters to which his attention was required to be given under s.16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
     16   His Honour then turned in his remarks on sentence to the sentences of the co-accused. In respect of the man Rahme, his Honour had been provided, by the prosecution, with a three page note of considerations that had been expressed by Rahme's sentencing judge, Judge Wall. 
     17   The offenders had come to be sentenced separately, since this offender had not been found guilty at an initial trial with the others before Judge Wall and had gone to trial subsequently before the sentencing judge. 
     18   No advertence was then made by either Judge Wall or the sentencing judge to what course was likely to be taken in relation to the third offender, Bunevski, since his sentence had, at the time of the sentencing of both other offenders, been put over, due to a heart condition. Subsequently, we are informed he was sentenced to the same sentence as was passed on his co-offender. 
     19   Here, his Honour noted that Judge Wall had sentenced Rahme to six years imprisonment with four years non parole. His Honour noted that that was a sentence passed, notwithstanding that Rahme had a previous drug offence, but in a context where that offence was very old. His Honour said:- 
      
       
        
        ""I am satisfied that parity is desirable between the offenders. In addition, I do not see any reason to order a non parole period different to that which was set in Rahme's case."" 
        
       
     20   His Honour then passed the sentence of six years imprisonment, but to date from 14 July 2000, taking into account previous custody, and directing a non-parole period of four years, which thus would expire on 13 July 2004. 
     21   Various grounds are asserted to show that his Honour fell into error. They include that his Honour erred in considering that the applicant's prior good character should be disregarded, or at least given ""not a lot of weight"", for this type of offence. 
     22   It was asserted that his Honour had erred in failing to discount the sentence for good character in itself. It was also asserted that his Honour had erred on a parity basis, he having sentenced on that basis, in failing to give to the applicant the benefit of his prior good character in circumstances where it was clear that Rahme was not entitled to such a benefit, the judge who sentenced him having held of Rahme:- 
      
       
        
        ""The approach I take in relation to his criminal antecedents is to note the record and to view the history of the drugs as being a matter which prevents the prisoner from having the benefit of being considered a first offender and that his criminal history does not assist him in that regard."" 
        
       
     23   It was also asserted that Judge Wall had fallen into error in regarding the quantity of drugs as falling in the upper level trafficable quantity category, and reference was made to the decision of this court in the guideline judgment of Regina v. Wong & Leung (1999) 108 A. Crim. R. 531. It was asserted that the error seems to have been carried forward by some sort of silent but implicit acceptance into the sentence of this applicant. 
     24   For my part, I am not satisfied of that, or of the other asserted error; that is, that the role of the offender should have been estimated by the trial judge other than as he did; that is to say, on the basis his Honour was unable to say that his role was greater or lesser than the others or was a lesser role comparable with a bare or mere courier. 
     25   In respect, however, of the argument that his Honour failed to have regard to the offender's prior good character, whilst I am not satisfied that in respect of the head sentence such significant weight should be attached to that matter that one could conclude that there was a manifest disparity warranting interference, I am satisfied that when his Honour came to consider the question of the non parole period he did not afford to this matter such significance as was necessary. It appears that his Honour has simply proceeded to fix the non parole period on a comparison with that fixed in Rahme's case, without regard to this particular circumstance, which bears so much more heavily on the appropriateness of a non parole period as allowing an opportunity for rehabilitation in the context of the prospect of the individual to be rehabilitated. 
     26   Judge Wall had found Rahme's prospects for rehabilitation, in consequence of his prior offences having been some time ago and in consequence of his expression that he was abandoning the taking of drugs, to be fair. To compare that with this applicant's entirely satisfactory previous character is, having regard to how prior good character has been referred to in Ryan v. The Queen [2001] HCA 21, in my view, to err, particularly by mistaking the impact of the matters that need to be considered on fixing a non-parole period. 
     27   In those circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that his Honour fell into error in fixing the non parole period, though I am not persuaded that there is any other error such as would warrant interference by this court. That interference, of course, is only to be made in cases where some other sentence, warranted in law and significantly less, should have been passed. So, I have concluded that in this case it is appropriate that the non parole period should be reduced by a figure of some six months. I would propose, in that regard, that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal upheld, but only insofar as the non-parole period should be varied to provide for a non parole period of three years, six months, to expire on 13 January 2004. 
     28   HODGSON, JA: I agree. 
     29   ADAMS, J: I also agree. 
     30   HODGSON, JA: The order of the court is leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is upheld in relation to the specification of the non-parole period. The non-parole period is now specified as a period of three and a half years, commencing 14 July 2000, and expiring on 13 January 2004.

      WILKE v ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS PTY LIMITED & ANOR 
      
     FACTSThe appellant, Mr W, fell from a ceiling onto a concrete floor whilst working at the premises of the first respondent, Astra Pharmaceuticals Pty Limited. He suffered injuries to the left scaphoid. Astra had engaged Rondal Pty Limited, the second respondent, as an independent contractor to conduct building alterations on their factory. Rondal in turn engaged Mr W’s private company, again as an independent contractor, to obtain his services as an electrician. The trial judge held that neither of the respondents owed the appellant a duty of care and that in any case, neither of them were negligent in relation to the accident. The appellant appealed both findings against both respondents. HELD per Meagher JA (Foster AJA & Grove J agreeing):(i) The first respondent was not in breach of its duty of care. Its only duty was to use reasonable skill in engaging an apparently competent contractor, which it did.(ii) The second respondent had an obligation to provide a safe system of work for the appellant. Its failure to take any steps to see that the appellant was protected from falling constitutes negligence.Per Grove J: The second respondent’s pleadings on contributory negligence and volenti non fit injuria should not be determined in its favour. Per Meagher JA (Foster AJA agreeing):(iii) Damages for future economic loss should be increased to $193,609. Per Grove J (dissenting):Damages for future economic loss should be increased, but only to $138,788.ORDERS1 Appeal against verdict and judgment in favour of the first respondent dismissed with costs. 2 Appeal against verdict and judgment in favour of the second respondent allowed.3 In lieu of the verdict and judgment in favour of the second respondent, substitute a verdict and judgment in favour of the appellant in the sum of $425,409.4 Order that the second respondent pay the plaintiff’s costs below and of the appeal (including the costs enforceable to Order 1), the second respondent to have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act. 5 Cross-appeal dismissed with costs.

       Friday, 11 May 2001 
       
      
       
      WILKE v ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS PTY LIMITED & ANOR 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
     1   MEAGHER JA: This is an appeal by a disappointed plaintiff who failed to obtain a verdict in a trial before Master Harrison. The plaintiff was a skilled electrician. 
     2   The plaintiff fell about 4 metres from a ceiling onto a concrete floor whilst working at the premises of the first respondent, Astra Pharmaceuticals Pty Limited (Astra), at 10 Khartoum Road, North Ryde (which we were informed is a suburb of Sydney). He was working at great speed, as Christmas was approaching, although on reduced hours (only 12 hours a day). 
     3   Astra is a company which manufactures pills. Each year at Christmas time its factory would close for a number of weeks to enable building alterations to take place. These alterations were often significant, and this was the case in December 1992. The alterations in that year involved the removal of walls and doors and the re-routing of air conditioning. These alterations necessarily resulted in alterations to the ceiling of the building. 
     4   On 24 December 1992 the plaintiff, Mr Wilke, was working on the ceiling. He was installing cabling around an air conditioning duct. The ceiling normally had joists running from wall to wall, about 2 feet apart. Perpendicularly to these ran trimmers, lengths of wood whose function it was to join the joists to each other. Both the trimmers and the joists were two inches across and four inches in depth. Above the maze of joists and trimmers were flat sheets of plywood, on which it was usually safe to walk. Sometimes - indeed often - the joists had to be cut, in which event each cut part would be nailed to a new trimmer. 
     5   Exactly how Mr Wilke met his fate is unclear. Nobody observed the cause of the fall. But either he was kneeling on a joist, and his foot slipped off it, or, alternatively he was kneeling on a trimmer which could not take his weight (although that was hardly possible). In any event, a co-worker, Mr Baldwin, opined that for Mr Wilke to be safe he should have used a plank to kneel on, or lie on. Nobody suggested this was impossible, but it was contended that it would have added to the time of the job. Instead of a plank, the re-instalment of part of the plywood, which had been removed, would have sufficed. 
     6   Mr Wilke’s injuries were to the left scaphoid, but, whilst serious enough, were not as catastrophic as they might have been. No thanks to the defendants, his back was not broken. 
     7   Both defendants, the two respondents to this appeal, argued strenuously that neither of them were in any way negligent, and indeed that neither owed Mr Wilke any duty. The Master acceded to their submissions. She held that Mr Wilke had nobody but himself to blame for his misfortune. I must say that, at first blanch, this strikes me as more than a little odd. For a manager (to use a neutral term) to expect a workman to do his job on a narrow beam twelve feet above a concrete floor in a hurry and for extended hours without having some obligation to see that the workman is in some way protected from falling is to indulge in an extreme form of Gradgrindism. 
     8   I say that “manager” is a neutral term, because this is no employer-employee relationship at any point. Astra was the occupier of the premises; it did not employ Rondal Pty Limited (Rondal); it as principal engaged Rondal, the second defendant and second respondent, as an independent contractor; Rondal described itself as a specialist in “Construction Management Factory Maintenance”; Rondal in turn engaged, but did not employ, Mr Wilke’s private company in order to obtain his services as an electrician. One gains the impression that in the building game one always uses independent contractors, not employees, in the (I hope, vain) belief that the statutory safeguards relating to work safety will no longer apply. 
     9   There was no written contract between Astra and Rondal. The contract between these parties consisted of a simple oral acceptance by Astra of a quotation from Rondal “for the demolition, building works and services to carry out the alteration work to the Khartoum Road address as per recent discussion”. There were no plans drawn up. The plaintiff described the operation as “organised chaos”. 
     10   Rondal, soi-disant experts in “construction management”, was controlled by two gentlemen called Ron and Dale. They employed a manager, called Norm Fritter. They also employed an innominate engineer. None of these four gentlemen seem to have been in evidence on the day of the accident, and none of them gave testimony before Master Harrison. 
     11   In these circumstances, I cannot imagine a clearer case of negligence against Rondal Pty Limited. It was in precisely the same situation as the principal in Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Limited (1986) 160 CLR 16. In that case, Mason J at 21 said: 
      
       
        
        “While individual fellers, sniggers and truck drivers may have been responsible for their own safety with regard to carrying out their own functions, they had little choice but to rely on the care and skill of Brodribb in the arrangements which it made for the disposition of the work, and on the care and skill of the persons engaged by Brodribb in the execution of the work. The interdependence of the activities carried out in the forest, the need for co-ordination by Brodribb of those activities and the distinct risk of personal injury to those engaged in the operations, called for the prescription and provision of a safe system by Brodribb. Omission to prescribe and provide such a system would expose the workers to an obvious risk of injury. Although the obligation to provide a safe system of work has been regarded as one attaching to an employer, there is no reason why it should be so confined. If an entrepreneur engages independent contractors to do work which might as readily be done by employees in circumstances where there is a risk to them of injury arising from the nature of the work and where there is a need for him to give directions as to when and where the work is to be done and to co-ordinate the various activities, he has an obligation to prescribe a safe system of work. The fact that they are not employees, or that he does not retain a right to control them in the manner in which they carry out their work, should not affect the existence of an obligation to prescribe a safe system. Brodribb’s ability to prescribe such a system was not affected by its inability to direct the contractors as to how they should operate their machines.” 
        
       
       
      These words, substituting “Rondal” for “Brodribb”, apply precisely to the present case. Thus, I think Mr Wilke’s appeal against Rondal should succeed. 
       
     12   The same does not apply to the appeal against Astra. Astra submitted, and I think the submission should be accepted, that its only duty was to use reasonable skill in engaging an apparently competent contractor. This it did. 
     13   As to damages, Miss Norton expressed satisfaction with the Master’s quantification of damage (a course which the Master undertook in case her findings on liability were disturbed) except on the question of future economic loss. The Master found that Mr Wilke, but for the accident, would have in the future earned $800 to $900 per week. His Group Certificate shows that his wage for the year ended 30 June 1999 showed him earning the sum of $571 net per week. On these figures the future loss component of his damages should be, Miss Norton correctly submitted, $193,609 - not $69,394 as found by Master Harrison. Interest should be paid on past loss of wages. 
     14   The amount of damages, therefore, to which Mr Wilke is entitled is $425,409, made up of: 
      
       General Damages $ 80,000 
       
       Interest Thereon $ 5,200 
       
       Past Loss of Wages $ 97,855 
       
       Interest on past wages $ 27,138 
       
       Out of Pocket Expenses $ 19,807 
       
       Future Treatment $ 1,800 
       
       Future Economic Loss $193,609 
       
       
        
      TOTAL $425,409 
       
     15   The orders which I propose are as follows: 
      
       
        
        1. Appeal against verdict and judgment in favour of the first defendant dismissed with costs. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Appeal against verdict and judgment in favour of the second defendant allowed. 
        
       
       
        
        3. In lieu of the verdict and judgment in favour of the second defendant, substitute a verdict and judgment in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $425,409. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Order that the second defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs below and of the appeal (including the costs enforceable to Order 1), the second defendant to have a Certificate under the Suitors Fund Act.  
        
       
       
        
        5. Cross-appeal dismissed with costs. 
        
       
     16   FOSTER AJA: I agree with Meagher JA. 
     17   GROVE J: I have had the opportunity to read the judgment of Meagher JA in draft form. I agree with the conclusion on the issue of liability but I have a slightly different view on some minor detail and an aspect of damage and I can express it briefly, gratefully adopting his Honour’s analysis of the essential issues. 
     18   My understanding of the evidence is that the first respondent’s (Astra) manufacturing operations were shut down for a workforce vacation as is commonly the case in many industries near the end of the year. The cessation of manufacture presented an opportunity for structural changes to the premises including building works such as those in which the appellant participated. The extravagant daily hours and pressure for speed was inferentially provoked by a desire to resume manufacture as soon as the shutdown period expired and thus avoid any inconvenience in trying to operate during the works or perhaps have the workforce relatively idle whilst they were being completed. 
     19   Of course, urgency would presumably reflect the desires of Astra but the second respondent (Rondal) - self described specialists in “Construction Management Factory Maintenance” - were the coordinators of activity and should have fulfilled the need to give directions as to when and where the work was actually to be done. To engage in disposition of work to subcontractors, without plans, the presence of supervisors, engineers or the like for work at height on insecure foothold, was so plainly lacking in due care on the part of Rondal towards those engaged in the work that elaboration would be surplusage. 
     20   I do not share the impression that the frequent use of independent contractors to do tasks traditionally performed by employees is inspired by hope to avoid responsibility to comply with statutory safeguards but my impression is rather that it derives from a fashionable belief that it is “economically rational” management practice so to do. Any view of mine as to the validity of such a belief is irrelevant. 
     21   However, as Meagher JA has concluded and I respectfully agree, Astra has discharged its relevant duty by using reasonable care and skill in engaging Rondal. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates the negligence of the latter. Contributory negligence and volenti non fit injuria were pleaded. In the light of the evidence, although these issues were not required to be dealt with by the learned Master following her determination on liability, neither should be determined in favour of Rondal. The cross appeal by Astra should also be dismissed. It was observed by counsel that Rondal did not appeal against the dismissal of the cross claim brought by it. 
     22   I turn to damages. The items of general damages ($80,000); interest on portion thereof ($5,200); out of pocket expenses ($19,807); and future treatment ($1,800) have ceased to be controversial. It is also agreed that the appellant has received subvention by way of worker’s compensation benefit totalling $38,135. 
     23   Economic loss to date of trial in accordance with the Master’s provisional findings can be calculated at $97,855, but she also indicated that “interest due” would be awarded. The only relevant amelioration of the differential loss which the lastmentioned figure represents appears to be the worker’s compensation payments. Assuming that the out of pockets are within the agreed sum interest would accrue on $79,527. This figure is calculated as follows: ($97,855 - ($38,135 - $19,807) = $79,527). The guide rates in Schedule J to the Rules have fluctuated during the period of six and half years between tort and assessment but they average approximately 10.5 percent. This should be halved to allow for the gradual accrual of loss during that period and hence $27,138 can be calculated as the appropriate award for interest on the particular item.  
     24   The Master selected $100 per week as an estimate of ongoing loss of earning capacity for guidance purposes. Meagher JA accepted a submission on behalf of the appellant which capitalized in the conventional fashion the difference between projected earnings by the appellant and his current earnings. In my opinion that differential does not reflect aspects of the evidence to which the appellant himself testified. Included were his intentions to alter his business or trade activity. I would also pay heed to the unlikelihood that he would continue in the long term to work at the extremely pressured rate which he was undertaking at the time of the accident and which no doubt was reflected in his earnings. For those reasons I consider that the adopted guide factor of $279 per week was too high, whilst on the other hand I consider the figure of $100 selected by the Master as manifestly too low. However the loss of ability to conduct business as a contract electrician should not be ignored and I would select a figure of $200 per week as a guide and apply the same method as used in the submission accepted by Meagher JA ($200 x 816.4 less 15%). I would therefore include $138,788 in the award for future economic loss. 
     25   The ingredients of damages which I would award are: 
      
       
        
        General damages 
         
          
          $80,000 
          
        
        
        Interest on part thereof 
         
          
          $5,200 
          
        
        
        Past Economic Loss 
         
          
          $97,855 
          
        
        
        Interest on past Economic Loss 
         
          
          $27,138 
          
        
        
        Out of pocket expenses 
         
          
          $19,807 
          
        
        
        Future treatment 
         
          
          $1,800 
          
        
        
        Future economic loss 
         
          
          $138,788 
          
        
        
        Total: 
         
          
          $370,588 
          
        
       
      
      
       
      I agree with the orders proposed by Meagher JA save that I would order judgment for the plaintiff for $370,588 in lieu of $425,409 which he has proposed.

       No 70085/00 
       
      
    Reasons for judgment1     HIS HONOUR: The accused, Christopher Charles Mason, has pleaded not guilty to a charge that on 5 January 2000 at St Mary's he did murder Linda Anne Hynes. The only issue in this trial is whether he was mentally ill at the time. It is not in dispute that he killed Ms Hynes and that he did so with the intent requisite to the crime of murder. 
     
      
       
      
    2     He has elected to be tried by judge alone. Although the central issue in this case is his mental state at the time of the killing there is no suggestion that he is now unfit to plead and I accept that he has been capable of making that election in an informed manner. He has been represented by senior and junior counsel before me. 
     
      
       
      
    3     As an infant the accused was adopted by the Mason family. It is unnecessary to deal with his background except for two important matters. In 1998 an adopted brother, to whom he was very close, died in circumstances from which it appears that he had suicided. In the same year his adopted mother died, I take it, through natural causes. He was then a man in his 20's. He was born on 12 December 1971. 
     
      
       
      
    4     The victim of this crime was a young woman with whom he had had an intimate relationship. The crime occurred at her home in the small hours of 5 January 2000. It would be distressing to recount the circumstances in any detail and it is unnecessary to do so. It is sufficient to say that he strangled her with a telephone extension cord. 
     
      
       
      
    5     What led to the killing is extremely difficult to determine. In a recorded interview with police the accused spoke of being angry but it is by no means clear about what. There is some suggestion that he may have had a belief that she was being unfaithful to him but there appears to be no foundation for any such belief. The accused was interviewed on two occasions by police, admitting his involvement in the killing only on the second of those occasions. But those interviews, which were video recorded, show signs of disordered thinking and an inability to understand what was going through his mind at the time of the killing. 
     
      
       
      
    6     That same afternoon the accused attended the Emergency Department of the Nepean Hospital, where he was observed to be in a very disturbed state. Two days later he was admitted to the Bloomfield Hospital at Orange, where he was observed to be very distressed and was considered to be exhibiting schizophreniform psychosis, probably drug induced. He was arrested the following day, 8 January 2000, and within days of being taken into custody he was admitted to the psychiatric ward at the hospital at Long Bay Prison. 
     
      
       
      
    7     The Crown obtained a psychiatric assessment more recently by Dr Olav Nielssen and the accused's legal advisers obtained a report by Dr Bruce Westmore. Those psychiatrists are well known in the forensic sphere and are highly respected. To each of them the accused gave a history of the events of that fateful day, which betrayed a loss of memory of those events since his interview by police, but which clearly demonstrated seriously disordered thinking at the relevant time. Both psychiatrists recorded a history of delusions and auditory hallucinations, arising to a significant extent, it seems, from his preoccupation with the death of his brother and, indeed, his mother. 
     
      
       
      
    8     Both the accused and the unfortunate victim abused drugs. It is clear that the accused had been abusing a variety of drugs, including alcohol, for a significant period of time prior to this tragic event, and it is also clear that he was significantly affected by drugs on the occasion in question. 
     
      
       
      
    9     Dr Nielssen's conclusion, based upon the history provided to him by the accused and a review of the proof of evidence obtained by the prosecution, was that at the relevant time the accused was “acutely mentally ill…as a result of a combination of amphetamine induced psychosis and intoxication with amphetamine”. The doctor went on, “At the time of the offence itself his acutely disturbed mental state may have deprived him of the ability to recognise that what he was doing was morally wrong.” 
     
      
       
      
    10     Dr Westmore concluded that the accused suffered “a psychotic episode”. He went on to say, “The differential diagnosis would include a drug induced psychosis or a schizophrenic illness.” The doctor also noted, “a history of depression, possibly a complicated grief reaction”. By that, no doubt, the doctor was referring to the loss of his mother and brother. 
     
      
       
      
    11     Dr Westmore also concluded that at the relevant time the accused was suffering from “An acute mental illness”. The doctor added, “It is likely that his capacity to know that he ought not to do the act and that his act was wrong in a moral sense were both compromised.” 
     
      
       
      
    12     Of course, the accused bears the burden of establishing on the balance of probabilities that he was, at the relevant time, mentally ill, as the criminal law understands that expression. I am satisfied that he was. Indeed, the Crown Prosecutor responsibly has not submitted to the contrary. 
     
      
       
      
    13     That does not alter the fact that this is a tragic, senseless killing. I can well understand that the relatives and loved ones of the deceased would have little concern for the accused's mental state and would see him as deserving of severe punishment. It is for that reason it is helpful to examine the rationale of the defence of mental illness. It was perhaps never better explained than by Sir Owen Dixon sitting as a trial judge in the case of R v Porter in 1933. His Honour's summing-up in that case is to be found in 55 CLR at 183. Among other things his Honour stated this to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The purpose of the law in punishing people is to prevent others from committing a like crime or crimes. Its prime purpose is to deter people from committing offences. It may be that there is an element of retribution in the criminal law so that when people have committed offences the law considers that they merit punishment, but its prime purpose is to preserve society from the depredation of dangerous and vicious people. Now, it is perfectly useless for the law to attempt, by threatening punishment, to deter people from committing crimes if their mental condition is such that they cannot be in the least influenced by the possibility or probability of subsequent punishment; if they cannot understand what they are doing or cannot understand the ground upon which the law proceeds. The law is not directed, as medical science is, to curing mental infirmities. 
         
        
        
       Later in the summing-up, in directing the jury as to the crucial question which they were called upon to decide, his Honour stated this: 
        
        
         
         If through the disordered condition of the mind he (that is, the accused) could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ‘wrong’? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people. 
         
        
       
      
    14     There is some evidence that the accused may have sought to cover his tracks over this killing, including the disposing of the body of his victim into the Nepean River. Even that may have its genesis in his psychotic state but, as far as his subsequent actions may suggest an attempt to avoid detection, they do not alter my conclusion that at the time of killing he was quite unable to reason about the moral quality of his act. 
     
      
       
      
    15     Of course, the result of finding the defence made out is not that he is a free man. He must be detained for as long as the responsible authorities consider necessary in his interests and the interests of the community. 
     
      
       
      
    16     I find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
     
      
       
      
    17     I order that the accused be detained at the Prison Hospital at Long Bay, or such other place as may be from time to time determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, until he is released by due process of law. 
     
      
       
      
    18     The Court expresses its sympathy for the family and all those affected by the death of the deceased.

      FRIDAY 11 MAY 2001 
      
      REGINA v. ROBERT GEORGE CHAPPLE 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on the applicant in the District Court after pleas of guilty to two charges, one of attempting to obtain possession of a prohibited import, namely a trafficable quantity of cocaine; the other being knowingly concerned in the importation of a trafficable quantity of cocaine. 
     2   The applicant was sentenced by the learned trial judge on the first count to a sentence of five years penal servitude, with a non-parole period of three and a half years, such sentence to date from 9 June 1999. On the second count, his Honour imposed penal servitude for a fixed term of 12 months from that date. 
     3   Those offences embraced common elements and referred to the one common transaction of importing. That was the reason why his Honour imposed the fixed term and the sentence on the first count, and then made them concurrent. 
     4   His Honour noted that the applicant had pleaded guilty and he referred to the circumstances of the offences by finding that, at some stage, the brother of an associate of the applicant, with whom he had a romantic interest in South America, had contacted him and, in consequence, he had obtained post office boxes in a false name and obtained from South America, through the post, the trafficable quantity of cocaine to which I have referred. His Honour noted that quantity as 109.4 grams, with a street value of $21,880. 
     5   His Honour noted that the accused spoke of the quantity, on admissions made on the plea, as of 79 grams. It seems now to be common ground that the 79 grams figure represents the quantity of pure cocaine; the 109.4 grams figure the gross quantity. For the purposes of the Customs Act 1901 it is to the pure quantity to which reference should be made. 
     6   When the applicant came forward for sentence before his Honour, he adverted to prior offences and the barbarous circumstances of his imprisonment for them. They confirm that the prisoner has suffered a most tragic life as a result of his involvement in drugs. The conclusion his Honour came to that the prisoner had been addicted to cocaine for many years was an inevitable one. His Honour went so far as to point out that the prisoner's physical appearance was demonstrative of that long term addiction. His Honour remarked upon the difference between this prisoner's case and that of many of those sentenced for such crimes as ""these who commit those crimes out of greed"". 
     7   His Honour categorised the prisoner as a principal on his own behalf. By that description his Honour apparently meant that this was a person who had arranged his own importation and was taking the benefit of that importation. Such a description became a matter crucial to his Honour's decision on sentence, as his Honour concluded, by comparison with those whose roles are generally described in the guideline judgment of Regina v. Wong & Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 430, the prisoner was a person who fell into a category above a courier. His Honour considered the prisoner's culpability should be so described because he is, ""after all, at this end of the transaction, the moving and it seems the only force receiving the cocaine here in the mail"". 
     8   His Honour, when he came to calculating the sentence, referred to the applicant as ""more than a courier, perhaps marginally so"". His Honour seemed to think that the appropriate course, when comparing this man's circumstances with that of those described in Wong & Leung (supra), was to treat him as a principal and thereby liable to have applied to him the range appropriate to couriers, having regard to various of the quantities, plus a year or two for being a principal. His Honour expressed it as ""that he be considered for a head sentence at the top of the courier scale, plus a year or two for being a principal"", though his Honour was of the view that that might be harsh. 
     9   His Honour was of the view that the calculations in Wong & Leung (supra) and the figures there referred to, if applied to this prisoner, would lead to a sentence of nine years but, as has been pointed out by the Crown in its submissions, fell into error in that he failed to have regard to that sentence, as expressed in Wong & Leung (supra), having applied to it the s.16G discount customarily of one-third. 
     10   The Crown conceded that the process by which his Honour dealt with that matter in respect of dealing with the figures as though they had not had the s.16G discount applied to them was in error, but submitted that, of course, that discount, if applied in the way in which his Honour did, would yield a benefit to the prisoner such that the error at least should not result in a sentence reduction to the prisoner's favour in an appeal of this sort. 
     11   The Crown also conceded that his Honour had erred in passing the sentence in that he ordered the applicant was to be released on entering a recognisance to be of good behaviour at the end of the non-parole period. The Crown's written submissions point out that pursuant to s.19AB(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), a sentencing judge must either fix a non-parole period or make a recognisance release order, not do both. 
     12   In that respect the Crown accepted that the sentencing process had miscarried, although, again, it was submitted that that was not a miscarriage which so tainted what had occurred as to require the setting aside of the sentences his Honour passed. Indeed, it was the Crown's submission that on a consideration of the whole of what his Honour did, even if error might be found, on a re-sentencing exercise the same or a not significantly different result such as would not attract intervention would result so that leave to appeal should not be granted and the appeal upheld. 
     13   The applicant has submitted that, having regard to his Honour's finding that the applicant's undoubted addiction meant that some quantity of what was imported, ""quite possibly the lion's share"" of the amount that he was importing, might have been destined for his own use, meant that his Honour had fallen into error at where he placed the applicant's culpability in the scale, even if one did apply the analogy of Wong & Leung (supra), to this somewhat different factual picture. 
     14   It was also submitted that his Honour had erred in embarking upon a tiered approach to sentencing, whereby individual factors were arithmetically weighed without continuous and consistent regard for the totality of what is after all an intuitive synthesis. Reference in this regard was made to the remarks of McHugh, J. in AB v. The Queen (1999) 73 ALJR at 1385. 
     15   It was contended that in all of the circumstances his Honour had erred, that he had erred in having regard to too great a quantity, that he had erred in assessing the applicant's role, and that he had erred in failing to give a sufficient discount, as is required by s.16G of the Crimes Act 1901. The discount his Honour had given was of the order of 28.57%. An appropriate discount, so it was submitted, would have been of the order of 33%. 
     16   It was further submitted that his Honour had erred, even when he had imposed a non-parole period, insofar as that that period was some 70% of the head sentence that he had imposed. The contention is that, notwithstanding the applicant's appalling prior record, which here and overseas included three major prior drug offences, for two of which he had been dealt with in South American countries, in circumstances of what, on the evidence before his Honour, was barbarity, even though this applicant was not to be dissuaded from committing such offences, this offence being remarkably similar to that which he had previously committed in Australia, the 70% was too high and his Honour had fallen into error. 
     17   It is notable, when considering those matters, that if one starts the sentence calculation with nine years and applies to that a s.16G discount, one reaches a figure of six years and to that six years one would apply such considerations as appropriate in mitigating sentence as have not been embraced in the nine years starting point. 
     18   Given that, it might well have been that the sentence could have been supported, except that it appears that his Honour specifically found in favour of the applicant for his early plea, yet does not appear, at least to me, to have given to the applicant any such value of that plea, on utilitarian grounds alone, as one would expect, if he had applied to this sentencing exercise the principles referred to in Regina v. Thomson & Houlton. (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 
     19   Those principles have already been held by this court today to be principles to which regard should be had, even when sentencing in respect of Commonwealth offences, as these are. 
     20   What his Honour said concerning the plea was said in the context of his Honour commencing his reasoning process with a starting point of a sentence of nine years, to which his Honour said:- 
      
       
        
        ""Discount must be applied by reason of the man's age, the age of his parents, and an entitlement for him to look forward to assisting them in their advanced years some day."" 
        
       
     21   Further, his Honour was of the view that the more onerous aspect of a period in custody awaiting sentence required the nine years again to be mitigated. 
     22   When turning to the guilty plea, he said that it must be regarded, at least in part, as being demonstrative of remorse and contrition, although one cannot lightly dismiss the fact that the case against the applicant was virtually irresistible. His Honour concluded that that latter fact does not deprive him of some benefit not insignificant and that there was some prospect of rehabilitation, but his Honour at no point, other than by noting that the plea was early, gave the prisoner any benefit for the utilitarian considerations involved in the saving of the cost and inconvenience of a trial to the community. 
     23   Such a benefit would normally be expressed in the range of 10 to 25%. This plea was as early as could conceivably have been entered, and it was not accompanied by a full and frank statement to the police on the occasion of the arrest. Nonetheless, the prisoner did inform the police of circumstances relating to the use of scales, clip lock bags, and the like, found in his premises and related to a prior importation. He was not sentenced with any aggravation of his sentence by reason of that prior importation, but it was on the basis of those admissions and the contamination of those items with the drug that his Honour found that some portion of the drug might be sold. His Honour thereby dealt with him more severely than his Honour would have dealt with a person who had been sentenced solely on the basis that the drug was imported for his own use. 
     24   It is not at all clear to me that he should not have been dealt with as a person who had imported the drug, either for his own use or to sell, but only to the extent of that required to meet his own addiction. It does not seem to me that admissions of that kind should discount in any way the plea being early and of assistance, to the extent at least of the avoiding of a trial. 
     25   It would not be inappropriate in those circumstances, then, to apply that 25% discount. That would lead, on its own, without more, to a head sentence of the order of four years. 
     26   His Honour noted the prospects of rehabilitation and said, noting the prisoner's advances within the custodial system, that a sentence should not crush any late prospects of rehabilitation. He said:- 
      
       
        
        ""If he is ever going to rehabilitate from cocaine it will be now. I do not think there will be any further chances for him because he will be released from his non-parole period and if he were to commit any other offences of importation during that time I do not know what sentences he might eventually face."" 
        
       
     27   The prisoner gave evidence. The issue was not his willingness to abandon his addiction but his ability, with the assistance of the authorities and medical science, to achieve it in his own case. The non-parole period should afford him some such opportunity as is possible to do what can be done to take that last chance. 
     28   I am of the view, in those circumstances, that it would not be inappropriate, having regard to the considerations referred to by the High Court in Bugmy v. The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525 to impose a non-parole period affording the prisoner a substantial opportunity for rehabilitation. I would propose a non-parole period of two and a half years be fixed in respect of the head sentence of four years, and that that sentence be expressed to commence on 9 June 1999, to expire on 8 June 2003, with a non-parole period to expire on 8 December 2001. I would not disturb the second sentence. 
     29   HODGSON, JA: I agree. The sentencing judge's decision took place prior to the publication of the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision in Thomson & Houlton (supra), although the basic principles had previously been set out in cases such as Winchester (1992) 58 A. Crim. R. 345. The difference that Thomson & Houlton (supra) made, in my understanding, is that it made explicit what was an appropriate prima facie range of discounts, and also made explicit that this particular element of discount could appropriately be specified separately from other discounts, notwithstanding the general position that all matters of discount and amelioration should be taken into account in a global assessment. 
     30   In relation to the non-parole period, the court has also received evidence of work done and courses undertaken by the applicant during his time so far as spent in custody in relation to this matter, and this does confirm that, despite his addiction and his previous record, there is a prospect of rehabilitation. That is a matter that I take into account also in fixing the period for non-parole. 
     31   ADAMS, J: I agree with what has fallen from both the learned presiding judge and Greg James, J. 
     32   HODGSON JA: So the order of the court is leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is upheld in relation to the sentence on count one. In lieu of that sentence, a head sentence is imposed of four years, commencing 9 June 1999, with a non parole period of two and a half years, commencing 9 June 1999 and expiring on 8 December 2001.

      REGINA v VIKASH GOUNDAR 
     The respondent pleaded guilty to an indictment containing one count of aid and abet armed robbery. He was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 months. The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against the leniency of the sentence imposed on the grounds that (1) his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the objective seriousness of the offence; (2) there was a lack of reasonable proportionality between the weight given to the objective gravity of the crime and the subjective features of the respondent. Held: (Appeal allowed):Ground 1: failure to give sufficient weight to the objective seriousnessThe respondent pleaded guilty as an aider and abettor to armed robbery and his objective criminality should therefore be considered in the context of that offence. The respondent provided considerable encouragement and assistance in the commission of the robbery and clearly contemplated the use of a machete. His Honour’s conclusions as to the degree of objective criminality could not be supported by the evidence. A significant sentence of full time custody was required which carried an obvious element of general deterrence, by reason of the fact that the offence was committed in the early hours of the morning and where the victim was vulnerable due to his occupation.Webster (1999) NSWCCA 313; Doorey (2000) NSWCCA 456; Readman (1990) 47 A Crim R; Thwaites NSWCCA 16 October 1993; Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 applied. Govinden [1999] NSWCCA 118 distinguished. Ground 2: Lack of reasonable proportionality between weight given to the objective gravity of crime and subjective features of respondentAlthough it was true that the respondent was a first offender and this was his first sentence of imprisonment, his subjective circumstances were not particularly remarkable. While prison is to be avoided for young persons, unless that course is necessary, the gravity of the crime must be kept steadfastly in mind, otherwise the protective aspect of the court’s function will cease to operate. Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128; Mostronardi (2000) NSWCCA 12; Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 applied.

     1   WOOD CJ at CL: On 26 February 2001 the respondent pleaded guilty to an indictment containing one count of aid and abet armed robbery, an offence attracting the same penalty as that applicable for the substantive offence of armed robbery, namely imprisonment for 20 years. 
     2   It would appear that prior to this plea being offered and accepted, counsel for the respondent had written to the Director of Public Prosecutions inviting acceptance of a plea of accessory after the fact to armed robbery, an offence which it might be noted carries a lesser penalty, namely one of imprisonment for 14 years. 
     3   That offer was rejected and the matter was listed for trial upon an indictment charging the substantive offence. However, shortly before the matter was called on for hearing, counsel for the respondent indicated that a plea to the alternative aid and abet offence would be offered. The respondent was arraigned on that basis and entered a plea of guilty. 
     4   It was made plain, in the course of the debate on prior to sentence that the respondent was always regarded as a principal in the second degree, and that he could equally well have been charged with the substantive offence. 
     5   For the offence to which he pleaded guilty he was sentenced by his Honour Judge Sides QC to imprisonment for 18 months with a non-parole period of seven months, each to date from 7 August 2000. 
     6   The Director of Public Prosecutions now appeals against the leniency of that sentence pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
      
       
      Facts 
       
     7   At about 2am on 7 August 2000 a console operator at the Volume Plus Service Station at Liverpool was held up by two offenders each of whom was wearing a balaclava and a bulky jacket. One of these men jumped the counter and held a machete to the face of the console operator. He demanded money from the till and from the victim's wallet.  
     8   The offenders got away with approximately $300 as well as some confectionary and cigarettes. Shortly afterwards the police observed the respondent and a co-offender, Sitan Mishra, standing beside a motor vehicle parked in a nearby street. A machete was found in a garbage bin adjacent to the vehicle. Inside the motor vehicle, which was owned by the respondent, police found cigarettes and confectionary from the service station as well as a jacket of the same kind as that worn by of the offenders. 
     9   When interviewed by police the respondent admitted that he had been party to the plan to rob the service station and that he knew that a machete was to be used. His role he said was to drive the co-offenders to and from the scene of the robbery. 
     10   He named his co-offenders as people whom he knew only as C2 and Candy. C2, who was in fact Mishra, similarly admitted to police his involvement in the robbery when interviewed. 
     11   At the time when he committed the offence to which he pleaded, the respondent was aged 18 years and four months. By the time he appeared for sentence he was aged 19 years. He had no prior convictions. 
     12   The co-offender Mishra was sentenced by his Honour Robison DCJ after pleading guilty to armed robbery to imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of two years. He was aged 22 years at the time that he appeared for sentence and he had a minor criminal record for driving offences and for driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner for which he had received a bond. 
     13   He was sentenced on the basis that he had acted as a look-out who had waited outside the service station while the offence was committed. 
     14   The other co-offender, Kanderpan Sathiamoorthy, was sentenced by his Honour Goldring DCJ, in respect of the armed robbery, to five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and four months, to commence at the expiry of an existing sentence. He was sentenced at the same time to a fixed term of six months for an unrelated offence of robbery, taking into account, on a Form 1, an offence of larceny which had been committed at the same time as the robbery. 
     15   He was also aged 22 years at the time he appeared for sentence and he had prior convictions for robbery, steal motor vehicle, stealing and robbery in company. He was on parole at the time of this offence and he was sentenced upon the basis that he had been one of the offenders who had entered the service station and threatened the attendant. 
     16   All three offenders were treated by the respective sentencing judges as having drug problems, a circumstance which may have helped to explain their criminality but which did not operate in mitigation of sentence. 
     17   In dealing with the respondent his Honour gave him the benefit of a discount of 20 per cent for the plea of guilty and for his contrition including that which had been demonstrated by his co-operation with the police in the interview with him. 
     18   The co-offender Sathiamoorthy was similarly given a discount of almost 20 per cent. The extent of the discount given to Mishra was not expressly identified nor was it otherwise discernible from the judgment, although Robison DCJ did make it clear that he had taken both his plea and his contrition into account. 
     19   Each of the co-offenders had been sentenced before the respondent and his Honour had available the reasons for the sentences which had been imposed. In dealing with the respondent on a basis which was markedly more lenient when compared with the sentences for the co-offenders, it appears that his Honour was influenced by two factors:  
      
      (a) the conclusion which he reached that the respondent had performed a lesser role than the co-offenders in acting as a driver, and in waiting in the get-away car which had been parked some little distance from the target premises, and  
       
      (b) the 
        
      fact that he was younger than the two co-offenders 
      . 
       
     20   In relation to the first of these two factors, it appears that there was some apprehension on the part of counsel, and on the part of his Honour, that the offer and acceptance of the plea to the alternative aid and abet count, meant inevitably that his criminality was of a lesser order than it would have been if he had pleaded to, or been found guilty of, the substantive offence even though the maximum penalty for the two offences was the same. 
      
        
       
      Appeal 
       
     21   The sentence imposed, the Crown submits, was manifestly inadequate to the point of disclosing error in the sentencing exercise, having regard to the principles discussed in House (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. In addition specific error was said to arise in two respects. To those I will now turn. 
      
       
      Objective Criminality Of The Respondent 
       
     22   The Crown submits his Honour erred, firstly, in failing to give sufficient weight to the objective seriousness of the offence committed by the respondent. 
     23   In my view this submission has been made good. The respondent was an aider and abbetor to the armed robbery and his objective criminality was to be considered in the context of that offence being the one to which he had pleaded guilty. 
     24   Although it was put that there was some implicit holding out by the Crown or a belief formed on the part of counsel for the respondent that, having regard to the manner in which the matter proceeded, he was to be considered as having a lesser role than would have been otherwise the case, the fact is, as has been accepted by counsel this morning, that there was no moderation or attenuation of the facts upon which his criminality was to be assessed. 
     25   On the contrary there was agreement that the full facts were placed before his Honour and that it was appropriate for him to sentence the respondent in the light of the offence before him, and in the light of a weighing of the objective criminality disclosed by those facts. The weighing of that objective criminality was properly a matter for his Honour, to be made upon the evidence, irrespective of any belief which may have been held by Counsel. 
     26   In my view, the objective criminality of the respondent was significant. Indeed, that was indicated by the finding of his Honour that the robbery may well not have taken place without his assistance, and by the further findings that he had been made aware in advance of what was to happen, and that a machete was being taken to the scene. 
     27   While it is true that the respondent did not personally offer any threat of violence, he clearly contemplated the use of the machete, or at least the threat of its use, in order to discourage any resistance to the robbery. 
     28   Despite the strenuous efforts by Mr Thomas this morning to minimise the strength of the admissions contained in the ERISP, on the basis of the respondent's youth, and upon the basis that he was not personally present at the premises as distinct from waiting nearby, the position remains that the respondent was a principal in the second degree who provided assistance in taking the co-offenders to the scene and who was available to drive them away from it. In these ways it seems to me he provided encouragement and assistance, which was of a considerable kind. 
     29   In all those circumstances I am of the view that his Honour's conclusion as to the degree of objective criminality attributed to the respondent was not one that was open on the evidence. Of particular significance in this regard was the assessment that Mishra's criminality had exceeded that of the respondent because he was “placed much closer to the scene and was in a position to more readily render active assistance to the principals"". 
     30   In Breedon NSWCCA 3 December 1992 this Court considered the case of a similar offender who had been the driver of a motor vehicle and who had been charged with the same offence as the present respondent. That offender received the same sentence as the co-offender who had entered the various premises where the offences had been committed and had there threatened the victim with a weapon. 
     31   This Court approved the observation of the sentencing judge, when assessing the objective criminality of the offenders, as ""being of the same quality"" upon the basis that they had involved themselves ""in a course of criminal conduct which could be described as a joint criminal enterprise"". 
     32   This does not automatically mean that every participant in such an enterprise shares the same degree of objective criminality. The assessment does, however, begin or should begin with the proposition that each intended the crime and each set out to carry it into effect.  
     33   On some occasions cause will arise for differentiation between them, for example, if one offender stands out as the obvious ring-leader, or abuses some inside knowledge or connection with the premises to carry the crime into effect, or is the person who actually elects to carry out the threat of violence by using the weapon offensively to cause injury to the victim. 
     34   The present case, however, was not such a case since the robbery went according to plan, without violence beyond that contemplated and threatened by the presence of the weapon. 
     35   Consistent with authority in this Court, particularly recent authority such as Webster (1999) NSWCCA 313, Doorey (2000) NSWCCA 456 and Readman (1990) 47 A Crim R 181, a significant sentence of full-time custody was here required for each offender. Moreover, it should have been one that carried with it an obvious element of general deterrence by reason of the fact that the offence was committed in the early hours of the morning and the further fact that the victim was a person who was vulnerable due to his occupation as a console operator at a service station. 
     36   As Campbell J observed in Thwaites NSWCCA 6 October 1993: 
      
       
        
        "" 
        The sentencing judge correctly emphasised the importance of general deterrence in such cases such as this. In doing so he complied with the often repeated direction of this Court that cases of armed robbery should in general be treated with severity and in particular garage attendants, taxi drivers and other people whose occupations place them in vulnerable situations should so far as can be done be protected by deterrent sentences."" 
        
       
     37   The offence was one for which the guideline judgment in Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 also had a relevance, subject to some qualification in relation to the strength of the Crown case. All of the features of that case for which the guideline was intended were here present.  
     38   There was no reference by his Honour to this decision and the inference arises, both from that circumstance and from the gulf between the guideline of four to five years imprisonment there proposed, and the sentence here imposed that his Honour erroneously considered it to have no relevance to the case of a aider and abettor. 
     39   Reference was made by the respondent to the decision of this Court in Govinden [1999] NSWCCA 118 where a non-custodial sentence for an offence of the kind before the Court was permitted to stand.  
     40   As the Court there recognised it is only in the most exceptional circumstances that persons who commit armed robberies, and I would add those who aid and abet those offences, should not receive sentences involving at least some period of full-time custody.  41    Govinden was treated as such a case but there are three clear reasons for the conclusion reached which make it distinguishable so far as the present case is concerned. The first relates to the principle of parity in that each of the co-offenders had there received non-custodial sentences. The second relates to the assessment that the respondent showed exceptional prospects of rehabilitation having regard to the fact that he had returned to school, had commenced university and otherwise had shown himself to be of impeccable good character while awaiting sentence. It was a true cross-roads case and for that reason the Court adopted the approach which it did. 
     42   The third distinguishing circumstance is that Dunford J, when delivering the leading judgment, made it clear that he regarded as having sentence as having been ‘excessively lenient”. His Honour went on to note that he considere3d it appropriate for the appeal to be dismissed in the exercise of the Court’s discretion, since the only issue which had been fought on appeal was the question of full-time custody or not. 
     43   Subject to the next submission, to which I will now turn, I consider that an error of law has been here disclosed. 
      
       
      Lack Of Reasonable Proportionality Between The Weight Given 
       
      To The Objective Gravity Of The Crime And The Subjective Features Of The Respondent 
       
     44   It is true that the respondent's plea of guilty was timely, so far as it had been offered as soon as the alternative charge had become available, but so was that of each of the co-offenders. It is also true that the respondent was a first offender and that this was a first sentence of imprisonment for him. Otherwise his subjective circumstances do not seem to me to have been particularly remarkable. 
     45   After his parents had separated he had moved with his father from Fiji to New Zealand where he completed his education and entered the work force. He came to Australia when he was aged 18 years. Having done so he re-established contact with his mother from whom he had been separated, obtained work in an inner-city hotel, commenced to use drugs and then through a lack of other social relationships began to associate with the co-offenders who were older friends of his cousin. While in custody he had undertaken some courses and had remained drug free. 
     46   Upon the basis of this somewhat limited information his Honour assessed his prospects of rehabilitation as ""above average"". However, his co-offenders were similarly assessed as having favourable prospects of rehabilitation; Mishra more so than the third man as each had begun to address their drug problems while in custody. 
     47   The material before his Honour has been supplemented by an affidavit placed before us this morning which it is appropriate for the Court to take into account since I am of the view that it is necessary for the Court to undertake a re-sentencing exercise. That affidavit does not disclose very much that is new or that goes beyond the assessment which his Honour made. It does no more than disclose that since the respondent's release from custody on 6 March 2001, he has made numerous attempts to obtain employment and that from 7 May last he has undertaken employment on a building site. It also confirms that he has continued to abstain from drugs and from associating with the criminal element. We have been informed from the bar table this morning, additionally, that it is understood that the employment will remain available to the respondent even if he is returned to prison for a period of time.  
     48   While his Honour made reference to the decision of this Court in Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128, which did note that prison is to be avoided for young persons unless that course is necessary, it does not appear that his Honour attached sufficient significance to the caution, which was also given, that the gravity of the crime must be kept steadfastly in mind, otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court's function will cease to operate. 
     49   As Lee CJ at CL observed: 
      
       
        
        "" 
        deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes"". 
         
        
       
     50   More recently this Court had occasion in Mastronardi  (2000) NSWCCA 12 to observe that youth cannot be used as a cloak of convenience to enable an offender to shelter from accepting proper responsibility for his criminal behaviour 
     51   It was to be expected of his Honour that he would not allow the subjective features of the respondent to overwhelm the primary duty of giving appropriate weight to the objective features of the case. 
     52   For the reasons expressed in Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354 the respondent was properly entitled to some consideration for his relative youth and immaturity, which also permitted him to call in aid the general sentencing principle that the interest of rehabilitation has greater weight in such a case than those of punishment and deterrence. 
     53   However, that principle is also to be understood in the light of the decisions of this Court noted above and also in Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 which emphasise that it has less relevance when the offender has reached adulthood, or where the offence involves serious criminality of the kind committed by adults - see Tran (1999) NSWCCA 109 and Nguyen NSWCCA 14 April 1994. 
     54   Having regard to the error which I consider that his Honour made in relation to his assessment of the objective criminality of the respondent, and having regard also to my conclusion that there was here a lack of proportionality between the respondent’s criminality and the his objective circumstances, I am of the view that the Crown's appeal has been made good.  
     55   The sentence was, in my view, manifestly inadequate to the point where this Court should intervene, notwithstanding the discretion which attaches to Crown appeals against sentence, and notwithstanding the respect which must be extended to the sentencing exercise undertaken at first instance. 
     56   This Court will only intervene where material error of law or fact has been shown - see Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561; Griffiths (1977) 137 CLR 293 and Dinsdale (2000) HCA 54. 
     57   The principle of double jeopardy also applies and on this account it is appropriate, where the Court intervenes, to impose a sentence which would be somewhat less than that which it considers should have been imposed at first instance. It must, however, remain consistent with the objective and subjective circumstances of the case, and also with the principle of parity so far as the co-offenders are concerned. 
     58   I would quash the sentence below and substitute a sentence of imprisonment for two and a half years to commence on 7 August 2000 and to expire on 6 February 2003. I would set a non-parole period of 12 months similarly to date from 7 August 2000 and to expire on 6 August 2001. The earliest date for release on that basis would be 7 August 2001. 
     59   In fixing that non-parole period I would preserve the proportionality between the head sentence and the non-parole period which his Honour thought appropriate, in order to reflect the special circumstances which were found to exist. 
     60   I would withdraw the observation about the earliest date. Having regard to the reduction in the sentence, the order which the Court should make is that he is to be released on parole at the end of the non-parole period, that is on 7 August 2001. 
     61   POWELL JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Wood CJ at CL and with his Honour's reasons for so doing. 
     62   SULLY J: So also do I agree. 
     63   POWELL JA: The orders of the Court are, thus, those that have been proposed by Wood CJ at CL and I would direct the respondent now to be taken into custody.

      Regina v Edward Arthur PITT 
     The applicant pleaded guilty to offences of malicious damage by fire; s 195(b) Crimes Act and malicious damage; s 195(a) Crimes Act. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment for the first offence with a non parole period of three and a half years; and to a concurrent fixed term of two years for the second offence. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence on the grounds that (1) his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s background; (2) his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the plea of guilty; (3) the sentence was outside the range and manifestly excessive. HELD: (Appeal dismissed):Ground 1: His Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s backgroundThe evidence concerning the applicant’s background was limited. There was nothing of an exceptional kind in the Aboriginality or upbringing of the applicant that called for particular mitigation of sentence. As pointed out in Ceissman there is a danger of misinterpreting Fernando as a decision justifying special leniency on account of an offender’s Aboriginality. It is a mistake to rely on Fernando as authority for the proposition that Aboriginal heritage of itself is a mitigating circumstance. Ceissman (2001) NSWCCA 73; Powell (2000) NSWCCA 108 applied. Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 distinguished. Ground 2: Insufficient weight was given to the plea of guiltyThe plea of guilty was timely and the applicant was entitled to the utilitarian value of that factor, the charges were, however, unanswerable and the sentencing Judge expressly stated that he had given a discount for the plea as required by s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Thomson and Houlten (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 applied. Ground 3: Sentence outside rangeAlthough the applicant had an extensive criminal history and had committed a serious offence, when taking into account the circumstances in which the offences occurred, the plea, and the applicant’s contrition, the sentence standing alone would have been outside the appropriate range. At the time the applicant appeared for sentence, however, his Honour had only partial information concerning two offences that were outstanding, and which led to him subsequently being sentenced imprisonment for two years and three months with a non parole period of one year and three months, to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed by Bell DCJ. When the true effect of the combined sentencing orders is taken into account, along with the totality of the criminality involved and the fact that the malicious damage offences were committed by the applicant when he was on bail, no sentence other than that imposed by Bell DCJ was warranted. Richards (1981) 2 NSWLR 464ORDERS PROPOSED:(1) Leave to appeal granted.(2) Appeal dismissed.

       JUDGMENT 
       
      
     1   WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant was sentenced on 14 June 2000, by His Honour Judge P.R. Bell, following his plea of guilty to the offences of malicious damage by fire (S 195(b) Crimes Act 1900) and of malicious damage (S195(a) Crimes Act). He received a term of imprisonment of six years for the first offence, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for ten years, with a non parole period of three and a half years to expire on 30 June 2003; and a concurrent fixed term of two years for the second offence for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years. The sentences and the non parole period were fixed to date from 1 January 2000, being the date on which he was taken into custody. He now seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
      
       
      Facts 
       
     2   The applicant was, at the time of the offences, in a de facto relationship with Susan Briggs. She was the occupier of a house owned by the Department of Housing at Moree. At about 10pm. on 31 December 1999, she went to the Moree RSL Club, where she had arranged to meet the applicant to celebrate New Years Eve. He arrived there later in an angry state, affected by alcohol and amphetamines. He confronted her with questions as to where she had been and who she had been with, apparently suspecting her of having been guilty of sexual infidelity. 
     3   He returned to the house where, at about 3am, he began to smash items such as stereo equipment and other household objects. He then set fire to a curtain. The flames spread and occasioned considerable damage to the premises, the cost of the repairs to which were estimated to be in the order of $19,000. The house, it would seem, was only saved due to the efforts of the local Fire Brigade.  
     4   When interviewed by police later that morning the applicant made full admissions as to his responsibility in causing the damage and in lighting the fire. He attributed his conduct to the fact that he had returned home, and had become suspicious when he found that his de facto was not there. He claimed to have consumed a considerable quantity of beer and bourbon during the day preceding the offence. In later reports taken from him he added that he had also used cannabis during the day and evening preceding the offence. 
     5   In an interview with Dr. Bettesworth, the applicant explained, as he had to police, that he had become frustrated, angry and jealous, and that it was in this state that he smashed the household items and set the fire. This his Honour accepted to have been the case. 
     6   The applicant demonstrated remorse for his conduct both in his statement to police and in the apologies which he had offered to Ms Briggs. She remained supportive of him notwithstanding the offences, and gave evidence to the effect that there had been no occasion on which physical violence had been directed towards her by the applicant. The evidence in this regard was accepted. 
     7   His Honour also accepted that the alcohol and drugs consumed by the applicant meant that he had acted out of “spontaneous frustration” and not with any element of planning or premeditation. 
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
     8   These showed that the applicant was aged thirty at the time of the offences. According to a history provided to Dr. Bettesworth, he had grown up on a mission in Moree, where he had suffered at the hands of a drunken and violent father. He left school after repeating Year 8, and had an irregular work history. 
     9   He also had a verified history of self harm and of suicide attempts, including some which occurred during the extensive periods of imprisonment which he had served. 
     10   His criminal antecedents dated back to 1983, and were lengthy. They included convictions for offences of stealing, several convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, malicious damage, malicious wounding, and assaults of prison officers, as well as convictions for street offences. As a consequence of this record he had spent a considerable period of time in gaol, where he had also accumulated an unsatisfactory record for misbehaviour. His record regrettably was one of violence, of repetitive offending and of disregard for law and order.  
     11   There were other charges outstanding when he appeared for sentence, as was disclosed in the pre sentence report. I shall return to their significance for this application. 
     12   His Honour accepted that the case was one where special circumstances existed. These arose out of the applicant’s background, particularly from the fact that he had spent much of his life in institutions or corrective centres, and from his need for a larger than normal period of readjustment in order to return to the community. His Honour also noted his need for counselling in relation to his drug taking and his fluctuating depressive moods. 
     13   In coming to the sentence which was imposed his Honour summarised the matter in terms, which could hardly be questioned, as follows: 
      
       
        
        “… in an act of frustration and pique with self-induced reduced powers of reasoning but still in charge of his faculties he set about a course of smashing up property and setting fire to a house. The matters are objectively very, very serious. His long record is something that does not increase the penalty but it does mean that he is not entitled to as much consideration as would be a person who did not possess a lengthy criminal record. The fact of his contrition and his plea of guilty are matters to be taken into account, and to be accorded a discount in relation to the matter of sentence, and that will be accorded to him.” 
        
       
       
      Failure to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s background 
       
     14   It was submitted first that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the background of the applicant, and in particular to the degree of privation which he had suffered in his developmental years. The failure of his Honour to make express reference to that history was said to constitute an error of law. Reliance in that regard was placed upon the observations of Smart AJ in Powell [2000] NSW CCA 108, where his Honour said: 
      
       
        
        “15 Violent acts in domestic situations must be treated with real seriousness. The principal attack of counsel for the applicant was that the judge had failed to consider the principles referred to in  
        Fernando 
         76 A Crim R 58. It was the applicant’s case that Fernando recognised that there could be cases where the background of an accused was of such a nature that the offences themselves should be seen in that context. Of particular importance in this case is the applicant growing up in an area where alcoholic consumption from an early age was the norm. The family background of the applicant was distressing and disadvantaged. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        17 The judge, while noting these submissions on behalf of counsel, did not herself embark upon any of the considerations referred to in  
        Fernando 
        . At no stage in her remarks does the judge mention or deal with the applicant’s entrenched pattern of disadvantage and the effects of his unsatisfactory upbringing. No reference is made to  
        Fernando 
         or the later cases which followed it, nor does the judge purport to apply those principles. This was a case where those principle should have been applied. The valiant effort made by the Crown to suggest, in effect, that the judge applied the  
        Fernando 
         principles and, alternatively, that they had no weight in this case, cannot succeed. The applicant has established error and this Court must re sentence.” 
        
       
     15   The difficulty with this submission is that the evidence concerning the applicant’s background was quite limited. No evidence was led from the applicant or from his family concerning it. Dr. Allnutt’s report, apart from noting the applicant’s history of substance abuse, self harm and suicide attempts, was relevantly confined to the following observation: 
      
       
        
        “He was born to a large aboriginal family of seven children, of which he was the eldest. He described a fairly good relationship with his mother but a difficult and conflictual relationship with his father, who he described as having difficulties with alcohol and who tended to express anger in an aggressive way towards the family, especially while in an intoxicated state. As a consequence he felt his upbringing was difficult. He maintained good relationships with his brothers and sisters during his developmental years, however he maintains little contact with them currently stating that they had grown apart. Both parents remained married throughout his life. He established relationships with extended family members, including his grandmother when he was younger, with whom he had a close relationship. 
        
       
       
        
        He left school and did not pursue any tertiary education although he did do a carpentry course and has done some seasonal work. He has never had a regular occupation and (sic) states because he’s been uneducated and unskilled. 
        
       
       
        
        He first met his de facto at age 24 in Moree and the couple have been going out for two years. He noted that she has a child by another marriage and notes that they have a good relationship with arguments but no physical abuse between the two of them. He did not identify any significant problems in the relationship currently. She remained supportive of him, visiting him regularly. The couple plan to have a family and get married when he leaves prison. He noted an indifferent relationship between himself and her family and believes that her family may not be happy with him.” 
        
       
     16   Dr. Bettesworth’s report carried the matter only a little further, so far as she noted: 
      
       
        
        “He is the eldest of seven children growing upon a mission in Moree. His father has always been employed, and is currently an Aboriginal Liaison Officer working for the Education Department. Edward’s youngest sibling is now twenty. He says that two of his brothers have spent short periods in gaol, but none of his siblings have criminal records, or psychological problems such as he has. 
        
       
       
        
        He said that he carries a huge resentment towards his father, who “came home drunk every night and flogged us.” At the age of about sixteen, Edward retaliated against his father, after his father had broken Edward’s nose. After this floggings of all the children ceased. Edward’s father sustained a laceration to the scalp. Thus, this episode of violence had a positive result, in that he and his siblings were no longer bashed. Edward admits that “it was the one and only” episode of his violent behaviour, which led to anything which was other than negative. 
        
       
       
        
        Edward told me that he has spent most of his life since the age of eighteen in gaol. Upon further questioning it seems that most of the serious assaults have been related to disputes between Edward’s family, and other families.” 
        
       
     17   While these reports did disclose some history of disadvantage and of an unsatisfactory upbringing, it was not of such an entrenched kind or degree as would minimise the applicant’s resort to substance abuse or to criminal behaviour. 
     18   Dr. Bettesworth’s diagnosis of a personality disorder with explosive and poor impulse control, which was supported by Dr. Allnutt’s assessment that he has manifested a long history of impulsive and, at times, aggressive behaviour that had been compounded and aggravated by substance abuse, were consistent with the applicant’s criminal antecedents. However, so far as I can see there was nothing of an exceptional kind, in the aboriginality or upbringing of the applicant, that called for any particular mitigation of sentence. Regrettably, his childhood experiences have been shared by many persons across a wide range of ethnic, social and racial backgrounds, and the present was not a case of an offender having been brought up within a wholly dysfunctional community that was dominated by substance abuse. 
     19   As I pointed out in Ceissman (2001) NSWCCA 73, there is a danger of misinterpreting Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 as a decision justifying special leniency on account of an offender’s aboriginality. The error in that approach was recognised in Hickey NSWCCA 27 September 1994, where Simpson J noted that the first of the eight propositions stated by me in Fernando, was “that sentencing principles are not discriminatory in that they apply to all accused without differentiating by reason of the offender’s membership of a particular racial or ethnic group.” 
     20   In Powell, Simpson J similarly noted that it is a mistake to rely on Fernando as authority for a proposition that aboriginal heritage of itself is a mitigating circumstance, and warned that care must be taken to ensure that recognition of the social and economic problems that frequently attend aboriginal communities, and the principles stated in Fernando, do not have the unintended consequence of devaluing the effect of offences on victims. 
     21   What Fernando sought to do was to give recognition to the fact that disadvantages which arise out of membership of a particular group, which is economically, socially or otherwise deprived to a significant and systemic extent, may help to explain or throw light upon the particular offence and upon the individual circumstances of the offender. In that way an understanding of them may assist in the framing of an appropriate sentencing order that serves each of the punitive, rehabilitative and deterrent objects of sentencing. 
     22   In the present case his Honour expressly referred to the reports of Drs Allnutt and Bettesworth, to the applicant’s history of substance abuse, and to the need for his problems to be addressed in the way identified by each of these medical witnesses. I am quite unpersuaded that, as a very experienced Judge, his Honour overlooked the histories which were identified in those reports. While the applicant’s background and the unsatisfactory aspects of his bringing up were relevant to an understanding of his current situation, I am not persuaded that there were here present, to the requisite degree, the factors of the kind identified in Fernando that required mitigation of sentence, or that were not appropriately addressed by the reduction of the non-parole period. 
      
       
      Insufficient weight to the plea of guilty 
       
     23   It was next submitted that his Honour gave insufficient weight to the early pleas of guilty which were offered at committal. Clearly they were timely and the applicant was entitled to the utilitarian benefit of that factor, as has since been explained in the decision of Thomson and Houlten (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, and for the independently demonstrated remorse. However, the charges were unanswerable, and his Honour expressly stated that he had given a discount for the plea, as was required by S22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am not persuaded that error of law was shown in the absence of any quantification of the discount. 
     24   This ground is, however, irretrievably bound up with the next ground, since it is appropriate to give consideration to whether both before and after discount, his Honour set a sentence that was outside the permissible range. That inevitably invites consideration of what might have been the sentence but for the plea, which in turn invites consideration of the question whether latent error has been shown.  
      
       
      The sentence was outside the range 
       
     25   It was submitted, in this regard, that a sentence of imprisonment for six years for an unpremeditated setting fire to a house by a person who was intoxicated, who acted out of pique, who immediately confessed to his criminality, and who demonstrated genuine remorse, was manifestly excessive.  
     26   Counsel pointed to the fact that the sentence fell at the very top of the range for the S195(b) offence, as revealed by the statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission, in that only one of the eighty-two cases there sampled had attracted a full term of six years or more, and that, in no case involving a plea of guilty was there a full term in excess of five years. 
     27   The obvious weight of this submission needs to be considered in the light of the extensive criminal history of the applicant, and in the light of the fact that this was a particularly serious offence of its kind, that involved wanton damage to and disregard for, public housing. As such a considerable element of personal and general deterrence was called for, since it needs to be understood that resources for public housing are hard pressed, and that the diversion of funds for their replacement or for the repair of wanton damage, is only likely to disadvantage other persons in need. 
     28   Notwithstanding these considerations, the sentence imposed represented 60% of the maximum. The starting point, before taking into account the applicant’s plea of guilty and contrition, must accordingly have been very close to the maximum, even though the offence was unpremeditated and committed in circumstances where, as his Honour pointed out, the applicant’s powers of reasoning were reduced, albeit that such reduction was self induced. 
     29   It is always difficult to engage in a comparative exercise utilising the Judicial Commissions statistics, since they cover a very broad spectrum of objective and subjective cases. They provide a useful background, but otherwise they need to be considered with some circumspection. Particularly is that so in the case of a S195(b) offence, since it is an offence that is likely to include cases of children setting fires in a variety of circumstances, ranging from the very serious to the trivial, as well as incidents of deliberate destruction by adult offenders, involving serious premeditated criminality. 
     30   Nevertheless, it seems to me that, once the timely plea and contrition of the applicant are taken into account, along with the circumstances in which the offence was committed, the sentence was outside the range and that this Court should reconsider the matter. 
     31   This brings me to the additional circumstance, of which his Honour had only partial information, via the pre sentence report, concerning an offence that was outstanding at the time that the applicant appeared for sentence. Since we have to consider re-sentencing him by reference to principles of totality, and by reference to any sentence that the applicant is to be taken as serving, then we must take this additional matter into account. To fail to do so would be to risk the applicant being insufficiently punished either for the other offence, or for the one with which we are concerned. 
     32   The additional material available to us reveals that the applicant was sentenced by Bellear DCJ, in the District Court at Penrith, on 1 December 2000, for offences of using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent or hinder an investigation, and for assault. For the first offence, taking into account two other offences of malicious damage and assault, he was sentenced to two years seven months imprisonment to commence that day, with a non parole period of one year three months, to expire on 31 March 2002. For the assault he was sentenced to a concurrent fixed term of one year and four months. Each of these offences predated the offence dealt with by Bell DCJ, and each was serious. They were found by his Honour to have arisen out of the following circumstances: 
     33   On 31 July 1998, the prisoner and his younger brother, Shane Pitt, went to premises in Moree in search of one Athol Craigie. The premises they visited were those of his invalid brother, Frederick Craigie. The prisoner was armed with a rifle, Shane Pitt was armed with an iron bar and knife. While there, Shane Pitt struck the verandah post with the bar, causing it damage, and called out “We’ve come to kill Pappy (Athol Craigie)”. 
     34   When the two offenders realised “Pappy” was not there, they walked off. In a vacant block nearby they confronted another brother of “Pappy”, Noel Frederick Craigie. Shane Pitt held a knife to his throat; the present prisoner held his rifle. They questioned him as to “Pappy’s” whereabouts, and at one stage Shane Pitt threatened to cut his throat.  
     35   While this was occurring, the three men were seen in the vacant block by Senior Constable Brooks. He challenged them, whereupon the prisoner raised his rifle and pointed it at the police officer. After another challenge he began to run. A final challenge was made to him to stop and surrender his firearm. He stopped, raised the firearm and pointed it towards the police officer, who drew his service pistol and discharged one round. The prisoner then decamped. His brother was arrested at the scene, and the prisoner surrendered himself to police later. 
     36   The offences were found to have arisen out of a family feud between the Pitts and the Craigies, but that provided no excuse for the criminality involved. As his Honour found, the offences were very serious objectively.  
     37   A discount of 20% for the plea and contrition were allowed against the sentence of three years six months, which his Honour considered appropriate. Somewhat favourably for the applicant, in an arithmetic sense, his Honour calculated this to result in a full term of two years and seven months. The non parole period, which was set at one year four months, represented 50% of the full term. 
     38   The sentences so imposed, including the non parole period, it can be seen were wholly subsumed within the full term and the non parole period set by Bell DCJ. While his Honour noted that the applicant was already serving a sentence, no mention was made of its terms, or of the facts giving rise to it, or of the principle of totality. 
     39   An additional circumstance emerges from this material, in that it is now apparent that the applicant was on bail for the 1998 offences which were subsequently dealt with by Bellear DCJ, when he committed the two S195 offences. That was a circumstance of considerable aggravation, particularly in the light of his record: Richards (1981) 2 NSWLR 464 at 465. 
     40   As a consequence of the sentences imposed by Bellear DCJ, which were in effect to be served wholly concurrently with that imposed by Bell DCJ, the effective non parole period served by the applicant exclusively in relation to the S195(b) offence, would be reduced from one of three years six months to one of two years and two months, made up of a period of eleven months between 1 January 2000 and 1 December 2000, and of an additional period of one year three months, from 1st April 2002 to 30 June 2003. The full term applicable to the S195(b) offence alone would correspondingly be reduced by the sentence imposed by Bellear DCJ from one of six years to one of three years five months. 
     41   When the true effect of the combined sentencing orders is taken into account and the totality of the criminality now revealed is taken into account, along with the fact that the two S195 offences were committed by the applicant while he was on bail for very serious offences, I am of the view that to now intervene, and to reduce the sentence imposed by Bell DCJ, would be to bring about a sentencing order that was manifestly inadequate and not warranted as a matter of law.  
     42   I would accordingly grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal. 
     43   SULLY J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

      1     
      GROVE J : 
        
       On 29 September 1999 the appellant was arraigned before his Honour Judge Nield at Parramatta District Court upon an indictment containing three counts charging first, that on 13 November 1997 he uttered a false birth certificate in the name of Ahmet Oz, knowing it to be false; second that on 3 December 1997 at Parramatta he used an instrument namely a learner’s drivers licence in the name of Ahmet Oz which he knew to be false with the intention of inducing someone to accept that instrument as genuine and because of that acceptance to register a BMW motor vehicle to that other or to another person’s prejudice, and third, that on 22 December 1997 at Lidcombe he used the learner’s drivers licence in the name of Ahmet Oz which he knew to be false with the intention of inducing someone to accept it as genuine and issue a replacement certificate of registration for the BMW motor vehicle mentioned in the previous count.  
       
        
       
      2     
      He asked that two further offences be taken into account pursuant to s21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1996. These offences charged that on or about 5 January 1998 the appellant was accessory before the fact to the disposal of the BMW motor vehicle mentioned in the indictment and that on 5 June 1998 he was in possession of a false instrument (a driver’s licence in the name of Mohamed Beyrouthi).

      A record of proceedings on 29 September 1999, signed and dated by his Honour includes the following: 
       
        
         
          
          “Indictment presented.

      Further notations refer to obtaining a report from Probation and Parole Service and continuation of bail.  
       
        
       
      5     
      On the remand date (19 November 1999) written material comprising the Crown case was tendered and his Honour adjourned to read it and thereafter returned to hear evidence from the appellant and his wife. Counsel addressed and the final transcript note of proceedings on that day reads as follows: 
       
        
         
          
          “HIS HONOUR: Mr Punch, I will sentence your client in two weeks’ time when I return from Cowra. 
          
         
         
          
          DISCUSSION AS TO SUITABLE DATE. 
          
         
         
          
          STOOD OVER FOR SENTENCE ON FRIDAY 10 DECEMBER 1999 at 9.30 am. 
          
         
         
          
          BAIL CONTINUED.” 
          
         
        
       
      6     
      On 10 December 1999 his Honour ordered that on each count of the indictment and to be served concurrently, the appellant be sentenced to a minimum term of one year and three months imprisonment with an additional term of one year and three months; that the minimum terms be served by periodic detention and that the appellant pay compensation of $46,000 for Paul and Dominic Romeo (the purchasers of the “rebirthed” BMW motor car) and $39,570 for the insurer which had paid the original owner in respect of the theft of the car.  
       
        
       
      7     
      The learned judge epitomized the facts in his remarks on sentence and I extract the following therefrom.

      On 25 October 1997 a BMW sedan owned by Vitascope Pty Limited was stolen. Its value was approximately $77,300.  
       
        
       
      9     
      On 13 November 1997 the appellant applied to the Roads and Traffic Authority for a learner’s drivers licence in the name of Ahmet Oz and produced a birth certificate in the name of Ahmet Oz. This constituted the offence charged in the first count of the indictment. 
       
        
       
      10     
      On 3 December 1997 the appellant using the name of Ahmet Oz applied to the Roads and Traffic Authority for registration of the BMW sedan which had been stolen on 25 October 1997 into the name of Ahmet Oz. This conduct constituted the second count of the indictment.  
       
        
       
      11     
      On 22 December 1997 the appellant, again using the name of Ahmet Oz, applied to the Roads and Traffic Authority for a replacement registration of the BMW sedan which had been registered in the name of Ahmet Oz on 3 December 1997. This conduct constituted the third count in the indictment.  
       
        
       
      12     
      On 5 January 1998 Paul and Dominic Romeo purchased a BMW sedan from a man using the name of Ahmet Oz for the sum of $46,000. They received the vehicle which had been stolen in October and which belonged to Vitascope Pty Limited. The person with whom the Romeos dealt and who was using the name of Ahmet Oz was not the appellant. The first offence taken into account on the Form 1 related to the appellant having acted as an accessory before the fact to this disposal of the motor car to the Romeos.  
       
        
       
      13     
      As a result of damage to the one of the keys which had been provided, the Romeos sought a replacement key from a BMW dealer and a consequent check identified the vehicle as having been stolen and it was in due course seized by police.  
       
        
       
      14     
      Investigation including the development of a fingerprint upon a document submitted to the Roads and Transport Authority led to police arriving at the appellant’s home on 5 June 1998. They were at the time in possession of a search warrant which was executed. During the search a driver’s licence in the name of Mohamed Beyrouthi, but bearing the appellant’s photograph was found and this founded the second charge on the Form 1 document.  
       
        
       
      15     
      The charges would appear to comprehend all the allegations of criminal misconduct by the appellant. As his Honour remarked in the course of proceedings, it could be inferred that there was a serious criminal enterprise under way, the BMW possibly being stolen “to order”. Save stating that he was recruited by a school acquaintance to do what he did, the appellant asserted that he could give no further information to authority for fear of reprisal against himself and family and his Honour impliedly accepted that this was the case and it was left unchallenged by the Crown. 
       
        
       
      16     
      The relief sought by the appellant is limited to seeking the quashing or variation of the compensation orders. No challenge is offered against the orders for imprisonment. 
       
        
       
      17     
      His Honour did not express the source of power upon which he drew to make the compensation orders and the alleged effect of changes to the relevant legislative framework and the powers vested thereby are contended to vitiate the orders. It is however convenient to deal with the elements of compensation to the respective recipients separately.  
       
        
       
      18     
      I deal first with the compensation payable to the insurer. The specified sum of $39,570 represents the difference between the payout to the insured victim of the theft (Vitascope Pty Limited) and receipts from the sale of the vehicle after its recovery. As above stated the theft took place on 25 October 1997. The evidence showed that the insurer paid the claim on 6 November 1997. The first offence of any sort charged against the appellant was committed on 13 November 1997. It is perhaps important, even if self evident, to observe that no allegation was made that the appellant was involved in the theft. Irrespective of the identity of particular statutory provisions which may be applicable, no order can be made unless, at the very least, there is some causative link between the conduct charged against the offender and the loss by the intended recipient of compensation. As senior counsel for the Crown candidly observed “it is difficult to see how the insurance company suffered loss through or by reason of what (the appellant) later did”. I agree with that observation. Irrespective of what approach is adopted there is no basis for ordering the appellant to compensate the insurer for paying out on the risk against which it insured and that part of the order made below must be quashed. 
       
        
       
      19     
      The balance of compensation order required payment of $46,000 for the benefit of the Romeos. 
       
        
       
      20     
      Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that, in the absence of specification by his Honour, it appeared that the purported source of power was s77B of the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996. That provision and those surrounding it (s77A and s77C) are contained in Part 4 of the Act which was proclaimed to commence on 8 December 1999, that is two days before the pronouncement of sentence and orders against the appellant. Clause 8(1) of Schedule 3 is pertinent: 
       
        
         
          
          “8(1) Part 4 of this Act applies to persons convicted or found guilty of offences after the commencement of that Part even though the proceedings were commenced before that commencement.” 
          
         
        
       
      21     
      The relevant provisions are: 
       
        
         
          
          “77A In this Division: 
          
         
         
          
          aggrieved person 
          , in relation to an offence, means a person who has sustained loss through or by reason of: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) an offence for which the offender has been convicted or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) a further offence that a court has taken into account under Division 3 of Part 3 in imposing a penalty for an offence for which the offender has been convicted. 
          
         
         
          
          Court 
           means the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal, the District Court or a Local Court. 
          
         
         
          
          Direction for compensation 
           means a direction for compensation under section 77B. 
          
         
         
          
          77B (1) If a person is convicted by a court of an offence, the court may (on the conviction or at any time afterwards) on notice given to the offender direct that a specified sum be paid out of the property of the offender: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) to any aggrieved person, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) to any aggrieved persons in such proportions as may be specified in the direction, by way of compensation for any loss sustained through, or by reason of, the offence or, if applicable, any further offence that the court has taken into account under Division 3 of Part 3 in imposing a penalty for an offence for which the offender has been convicted. 
          
         
         
          
           (2) A direction for compensation may be given by a court on its own initiative or on an application made to it by or on behalf of the aggrieved person. 
          
         
         
          
          77C A court may not give a direction for compensation: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) for any loss for which compensation is payable under Part 2 or under Division 1 of this Part, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) for an amount in excess of the maximum amount that, in its civil jurisdiction, the court is empowered to award in proceedings for the recovery of a debt.”  
          
         
        
       
      22     
      Unless those provisions are applicable the compensation which could have been ordered was governed by a provision in the then named Victims Compensation Act 1996 limiting the amount to $50,000. The maximum of the civil jurisdiction of the District Court (which is the limit if s77C applies) is $750,000.  
       
        
       
      23     
      A threshold question arises therefore when was the appellant convicted? 
       
        
       
      24     
      As observed by Dawson and McHugh JJ in  
      Maxwell v The Queen  
      (1996)184 CLR 501 @ 507: 
       
        
         
          
          “The question of what amounts to a conviction admits of no single comprehensive answer. Indeed, the answer to the question rather depends upon the context in which it is asked.” 
          
         
        
       
      25     
      Their Honours referred to the judgment of Tindal CJ in  
      Burgess v Boetefeur 
       (1844) 7 Man & G 481: 
       
        
         
          
          “The word ‘conviction’ is undoubtedly verbum aequivocum. It is sometimes used as meaning the verdict of a jury, and at other times, in its more strictly legal sense, for the sentence of the court.” 
          
         
        
       
      26     
      However as Toohey J dissenting in the result in  
      Maxwell, 
       but also referring to that dictum of Tindal C.J., pointed out: 
       
        
         
          
          “…….in  
          Cobiac v Liddy 
           (1969) 119 CLR 257 at 271, Windeyer J said that if ‘more strictly legal sense’ meant use by lawyers: ‘I think the opposite of what he said is more accurate.’ ” 
          
         
        
       
      27     
      Gaudron and Gummow JJ examined cases of what constituted conviction in the context of pleas of autrefois convict or autrefois acquit and in  
      Maxwell 
       applied a test that for conviction to occur there must be some act on the part of the court by which it has indicated a determination of the question of guilt.  
       
        
       
      28     
      Reference was also made to  
      Hinton v The Queen 
       [2000] FCA 1019 where it was said that: 
       
        
         
          
          “A court will not be taken to have convicted a person unless it does some act which unequivocally indicates that this was its intention”. 
          
         
         
        It is observed that this statement was made in the context of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, noting that an appeal to a Full Court lies from a judgment which is entered upon a verdict in a criminal trial and not a verdict, because s4 of the Federal Court Act does not include the verdict of a jury in its definition of judgment.  
         
        
       
      29     
      Senior counsel relied upon the circumstance that on 10 December Nield DCJ formally included in his remarks on sentence the words “for each of the three offences to which you have pleaded you are guilty, you are convicted” and contended that this, added to the total compensation order exceeding the amount available if conviction occurred before 8 December demonstrated that his Honour did not intend and had not convicted the appellant until 10 December. 
       
        
       
      30     
      Whilst I would acknowledge that conviction did not take place upon the pleas of guilty being made at the arraignment hearing on 19 September, I am of opinion that guilt had been determined and conviction had taken place by the conclusion of the hearing on 19 November. His Honour had received the evidence in the Crown case and specifically adjourned for the purpose of reading it. That he had done so was manifest in some of the questions which he asked during the evidence on behalf of the appellant which followed. His final remark that the appellant would be sentenced upon his return from circuit plainly conveyed that his Honour had been satisfied of and had therefore determined the guilt of the appellant at that point. 
       
        
       
      31     
      In  
      Maxwell 
      , Gaudron and Gummow JJ had opined that “……. conviction only occurs when the court does some act which indicates that it has determined guilt or, which is the same thing, that it has accepted that the accused is criminally responsible for the offence in question” @ p 531. Their Honours went on to cite with approval  
      R v Jerome & McMahon 
       1964 Qd R 595 where it was said that (conviction) may appear “……. even perhaps by adjourning the proceedings to enable information relevant only to the question of sentence to be obtained.” As at 19 November 1999 the proceedings had gone far beyond that, evidence relevant to guilt and to sentence had been received and completed, addresses had concluded and there remained only imposition and accompanying remarks both of which necessarily follow subsequent to conviction. 
       
        
       
      32     
      Part 4 of the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act was therefore not applicable to the proceedings and any question of compensation was governed by s71(1) of the Victims Compensation Act. 
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      33     
      That provision was: 
       
        
         
          
          “71(1) If a person is convicted by a court of an offence, the court may (on the conviction or at any time afterwards) on notice given to the offender direct that a sum not exceeding $50,000 be paid out of the property of the offender: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) to any aggrieved person, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) to any aggrieved persons in such proportions as may be specified in the direction, 
          
         
         
          
          by way of compensation for any injury or loss sustained through, or by reason of, the offence or, if applicable, any other offence taken into account (under section 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986) when sentence was passed on the offender for that offence.” 
          
         
        
       
      34     
      The appellant contends that there is no causal connection between any offence committed by him and the loss by the Romeos. His Honour made no finding of what specific conduct of the appellant (comprised in which offence or offences) caused their loss. The absence of findings upon which the order was based or reasons for it, is demonstrative of error and the matter is thereby opened up for reassessment by this Court. 
       
        
       
      35     
      I understood senior counsel for the Crown to rely upon the offences charged in count 2 of the indictment and the first on Form 1 as providing a sufficient basis for the order. None of the other offences could conceivably be causally connected with loss by the Romeos. I agree that the words “through, or by reason of” in s71(1) should be construed in a broad and comprehensive fashion: cf  
      Fagan v The Crimes Compensation Tribunal 
       1982 150 CLR 666 but construction must be applied in a commonsense way. 
       
        
       
      36     
      I have already extracted his Honour’s epitome of the facts concerning count 2 in the indictment. The evidence (in the form of the material tendered by the Crown) shows that when the Romeos paid “Ahmet Oz” they received no registration papers and I am unable to perceive any significant nexus between what the appellant had done on 3 December previously and their loss. Given that the person presenting himself as “Ahmet Oz” was not the appellant and that the Romeos paid him their money in exchange for delivery of the vehicle without registration papers it is open to inference that the transaction would have taken place no matter what name in which the vehicle was registered provided the fraudster with whom they were obviously willing to deal, adopted that name.  
       
        
       
      37     
      Although it must be conceded that there was a link in the sense that the particular vehicle which was handed over was registered in the name of Ahmet Oz and the appellant had procured that registration I do not consider that that supports a finding that the registration was causative of Romeos’ loss. 
       
        
       
      38     
      It was submitted by the Crown that, but for the appellant’s action, if Mr Paul Romeo checked with REVS (the Register of Encumbered Vehicles maintained by the Department of Fair Trading) he would have learned that the vehicle had been stolen. It was accepted however that REVS is not a register of title. There is no evidence whether it was ever the subject of encumbrance. I am unpersuaded that the finding suggested should be made. 
       
        
       
      39     
      The acts or omissions of the appellant constituting the first offence listed in the Form 1 are difficult to identify beyond what was charged in counts 2 and 3 of the indictment. As I have indicated I am unpersuaded that the isolated act of re-registration of the car caused the loss to the Romeos. The Crown has not pointed to any other facts giving rise to potential liability. More importantly, the learned sentencing judge did not make any finding as to what constituted the appellant’s offence first scheduled on the Form 1 beyond that he had procured the registration of the vehicle which the Romeos in fact purchased. The deficiency was mentioned in argument but the relief sought was limited to seeking a quashing of the compensation order. In a general sense there is almost by definition a nexus between the actions of an accessory before the fact to a crime and the victim of that crime and the seeming incongruity of finding that it is absent in this case is not overlooked. However, in the circumstances it will suffice to make the order sought by the appellant without exploring other possible forms of relief. 
       
        
       
      40     
      In the light of those views, even if I am wrong in concluding that conviction occurred before 8 December 1999, the orders for compensation should not be sustained. I have, however, expressed my opinion on the “conviction” point in deference to the argument presented by both parties in that regard. 
       
        
       
      41     
      I propose the following orders: 
       
        
         
        (1) Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
         
        (2) Appeal allowed in part. 
         
        (3) Order for payment of compensation quashed, save which the sentences imposed in the District Court should stand. 
         
        
       
      42     
      SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders of Grove J and with his reasons therefor. 
       
        
       
      43     
      McCLELLAN J: I agree with Grove J.

       Regina v Frank BERA 
       
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
     1    STEIN JA:  
      
      Introduction 
       
     2    This appeal is confined to a single ground of appeal, that of an unreasonable verdict. However, counsel for the appellant, in his submissions, developed a sub-set of the ground contending that the learned trial judge failed to comply with the requirements of s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in that he failed to include in his judgment the principles of law applied and the findings of fact relied on. 
     3    As Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250 makes plain, such an omission is to make a wrong decision on a question of law within the second limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     4    The appellant, Frank Bera, was indicted before Woods DCJ on two counts under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Act). He pleaded guilty to knowingly taking part in the supply of not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine between 20 May 1997 and 20 September 1997. That is, a quantity in excess of 250g but less than 1kg. 
     5    He was also charged with the supply on 19 September 1997 of not less than the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. That is, over 1kg. He pleaded not guilty to this charge and the trial proceeded before his Honour without a jury. 
     6    On 3 March 2000 his Honour found the appellant guilty. On 2 May 2000 his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years from 27 November 1999 with respect to the first count, to which the appellant had pleaded guilty. With respect to the second count, his Honour imposed a total sentence of 7 years imprisonment, comprising a minimum term of 4 years to date from 27 November 1999. 
     7    The brief facts are that as part of a police investigation into drug operations, electronic surveillance of the home of David Parker at 22 Vaisey Close, Kariong, was carried out. This included a listening device and telephone intercept. A number of tapes, recorded between 27 May 1997 and 19 September 1997, were admitted into evidence. They revealed a relationship between the appellant and Parker concerned with the supply of drugs. A listening device tape recorded on the telephone of Les Kalache revealed a relationship for the supply of drugs between Parker, Kalache and the appellant. 
     8    On the 14 September 1997, five days before the arrest of the appellant and Parker, a listening device recorded the appellant and Parker discussing amounts of amphetamine and preparing it into packages. I will return to the transcript of this tape later. 
      
       
      Summary of Facts 
       
     9    Some time before 6.14 am on 19 September 1997 the appellant arrived at Parker’s house at Kariong in his own motor vehicle. At 6.50 am the appellant drove Parker’s car out of the home with Parker travelling as a passenger. Acting on police instructions a highway patrol vehicle pulled the car over at Wahroonga and gave the appellant driver a random breath test. Parker was seated in the front passenger seat. At 7.50 am investigating police arrived and the car was searched. In the rear passenger floor of the car a black and brown sports bag was located wrapped in a blue spray jacket. Inside the bag were plastic bags containing a powder substance found to be methylamphetamine having a combined weight of approximately 1.885kg. A number of the bags were wrapped in a white paper towel with pictures of ducks along the edge. The paper towel was wrapped in some pages of the Daily Telegraph dated 18 September 1997. 
     10    Both the appellant and Parker denied knowledge of the bags and both declined to participate in an ERISP. 
     11    There were no finger prints found on any of the items. A search warrant was executed at Parker’s house later in the day. Paper towels with a border of ducks was found, as well as a Daily Telegraph of 18 September 1997, which was missing two pages. 
      
       
      The judgment of the Primary Judge 
       
     12    His Honour commenced his decision by directing himself on the standard of proof and that the case was one where the Crown alleged joint possession for supply with Parker under the extended definition of supply in the Act. Also in his introduction, his Honour alluded to the requirement of knowledge, including knowledge of the quantity of the drug involved. His Honour noted that the quantity of the methylamphetamine in the motor vehicle was 1.99kg, which exceeded the definition of large commercial quantity in the Act, which is 1kg. In fact, the quantity was 1.885kg (not 1.99kg) but I do not think that anything turns on the faulty arithmetic. 
     13    The trial judge also noted that it was the Crown case that the knowledge of the accused was a matter of inference from the circumstances surrounding the commission of the alleged offence. He continued: 
      
       
        
        I am therefore obliged to direct myself in terms of the requirement of proof of circumstances. The relevant test is that the Crown must demonstrate that there is no other reasonable hypothesis than that for which it contends which is available, and in this case the Crown contends that the knowledge is knowledge which in shorthand may be referred to as “wilful blindness”. 
        
       
       
        
        The High Court has indicated that where that term is used, care must be taken to ensure that the tribunal of fact is aware that the question remains at all times one of actual knowledge and it is never the case that if (sic) something less than knowledge may be treated as satisfying a requirement of actual knowledge.  
        
       
     14    His Honour then recited the facts of the case, repeating that the case was one where the prosecution alleged joint possession on the part of the appellant and Parker. In this regard, his Honour instructed himself that proof of possession required proof of knowledge that the drugs were in the car; proof of knowledge of the quantity of drugs and proof of knowledge of a purpose to supply. 
     15    The trial judge then referred in some detail to the listening device tape of 14 September 1997, five days before the arrest. In particular, he discussed the references therein to quantities of drugs, ‘elbows’ and ‘fourteen pounds’. He then made reference to the oral evidence of the appellant in which Mr Bera admitted that he participated in the cutting up or breaking up of drugs into smaller amounts on 14 September 1997 and that this involved a fairly large quantity. The appellant also accepted that 14 pounds was the amount of drugs being prepared on that date. 
     16    Woods DCJ observed that the appellant denied that he knew what was going to happen on 19 September 1997. With regard to the defence case, his Honour accepted that there had been a falling out between the appellant and Parker on 17 September 1997 over the appellant gambling away $8,000 of Parker’s money. His Honour accepted that this placed a considerable strain on the longstanding friendship and resulted in the appellant’s effective demotion to the role of Parker’s driver. 
     17    The trial judge noted that when the appellant arrived at Parker’s house early in the morning of 19 September, he went inside but did not discuss drugs and that the appellant did not carry the bag of drugs to the car. His Honour also recorded that the appellant was not the source of the drugs. 
     18    His Honour referred to the appellant’s evidence that no mention was made by Parker of the bag, which the appellant said he did not notice, and no mention was made by Parker as to what was to happen that day. 
     19    Reference was also made to exhibit 5, being a tape of a conversation between Parker and Brett on 17 September 1997, where it was said that the appellant was a ‘goat’, referring to Bera’s gambling away of Parker’s $8,000. 
     20    His Honour referred to the submission of the accused’s counsel (Mr Rowe) that it was a reasonable hypothesis that his client may not have known of the drugs in the car since he was demoted by Parker to the role of driver and that he may have thought that the trip was for some innocent purpose. 
     21    Of this submission his Honour said: 
      
       
        
        However, taking into account the whole of the evidence of the relationship between Parker and Bera, I am driven to the conclusion that this is merely fanciful. Before 19 September, Bera well knew that Parker was a major drug dealer. …  
        
       
     22    He continued: 
      
       
        
        Bera used to drop money off for Parker, the drug dealer … Mr Bera denies dropping drugs off from Parker to Kalache … but in the light of the whole of the evidence, I do not accept this denial. 
        
       
       
        
        His explanation of the relationship between Parker and Kalache … was unconvincing and I reject it. Only five days before the arrest, Parker was involved in a discussion with Bera about cutting the drugs to create quantities made up in pounds weight. … 
        
       
       
        
        The conversation included reference to fourteen pounds and Bera’s answer that he had no idea what fourteen pounds referred to is unconvincing and I reject it. The hiccough in the relationship between Bera and Parker which arose through Bera gambling away $8,000 of money, (which I infer to be the proceeds of drug sales, although, that is not a necessary foundation of my judgment) did not alter Bera’s knowledge of Parker activities.  
        
       
     23    Woods DCJ concluded: 
      
       
        
        … not only that Bera knew on the nineteenth that the car trip would somehow be related to drugs: I have no doubt that he well knew, (a) that Parker was going to and did use the trip as a mans of conveying a very large quantity of methylamphetamine; (b) that the quantity involved was well in excess of a large commercial quantity; and (c) that the purpose of the exercise was unlawful supply of the drug. 
        
       
       
        
        The alternative hypothesis advanced by Mr Rowe and carefully and diligently argued by him on behalf of his client, I do not find reasonably credible so as to raise any doubt in my mind.  
        
       
     24    Accordingly, it was concluded that the appellant knew the drugs were in the car and that the quantity exceeded 1kg. Furthermore, he and Parker were found to have had joint possession for the purposes of supply within s 3 of the Act. The appellant was accordingly found guilty. 
      
       
      The appeal 
       
     25    In order to understood the case before the District Court it is necessary to comprehend the content of the surveillance evidence and the appellant’s evidence, including his responses to questions about the content of the tapes. 
     26    The surveillance evidence covers a period of almost 4 months, from 27 May 1997 to 17 September 1997, two days before the arrest. It includes conversations between, inter alia, the appellant and Parker, the appellant and Kalache, and Parker and Kalache and others. The subject matter of the conversations is often drugs, and on occasions, quite large amounts of drugs. 
     27    For example, the conversation between the appellant and Parker on 21 August 1997, less than a month before the arrest, contains references to 8 pound, to 5 pounds and 4 pound. In his evidence the appellant conceded that this was a conversation about the preparation for drug dealing and his involvement with Parker in dividing up quantities of drugs.  
     28    His Honour highlighted the importance of exhibit Y, being the tape of the 14 September 1997. As his Honour observed, this was only five days before the arrest. I will set forth some extracts from this transcript. FB is the appellant Frank Bera and DP is David Parker.

     29    An ‘elbow’ is the colloquial drug term to describe one pounds weight. A pound is about 454g, thus 450g is about one pound or one elbow. One kilogram is a little in excess of two pounds (which is 908g). To be more precise 1kg equals 2.205 pounds. Fourteen pounds would be about 6kgs. 
     30    The appellant was cross-examined about the tape of the 14 September 1997. He agreed that he and Parker were preparing ‘speed’ into packages. Further, he recalled being at Parker’s home on the occasion when drugs were being broken up into small amounts. While the appellant denied knowing the quantity, he accepted that the reference to ‘elbows’ suggested a fairly large quantity. He was somewhat less forthcoming on the reference to 14 pounds. 
     31    Some of the other surveillance evidence may be briefly mentioned. The tape of 27 May 1997 clearly shows the appellant’s knowledge of and participation in drug supply by Kalache and Arthur Launt. The tape of 23 June 1997 also reveals the appellant’s participation in drugs with Kalache. See also, the tape of 27 June 1997. 
     32    The conversation between the appellant and Parker of 8 August 1997 (Ex K) is illuminating. Parker tells the appellant that his dog dug up ‘one and half elbows’ which had been buried in his garden. Parker told him that the dog had chewed a hole in every bag. However, Parker made it clear to the appellant that it was not ‘all gone’ - ‘only one and a half’. In his oral evidence the appellant agreed that it was amphetamines which were buried by Parker. At this point in his cross-examination the appellant was a little more candid (than earlier) and agreed that by 8 August 1997 he realised that Parker was heavily involved in drugs and most probably was a major trafficker.  
     33    The tapes of 10, 13 and 18 August 1997 also reveal the appellant’s involvement in drugs with Parker. 
     34    One of the tapes of 21 August 1997 (Ex ‘V’) also demonstrates the appellant and Parker discussing large quantities of drugs. Parker mentions ‘eight pound’ and ‘290 and 370’, later 2500 and 250, while the appellant refers to ‘that’s four pound’. Parker then says - ‘that’s four pound and five pound’. Earlier Parker refers to ‘make it to ten pounds worth’. This conversation looks remarkably like the two of them cutting up quantities of drugs. In cross-examination the appellant agreed that what was happening was the preparation for drug dealing and conceded that he was involved in the splitting up.  
     35    During my discussion of some of the surveillance evidence I have referred to parts of the oral evidence, particularly the cross-examination, of the appellant. However, the whole of his evidence bears reading. The Court of Criminal Appeal has none of the advantages of a trial court. We only have the black and white of the typed transcript. Quite clearly his Honour did not believe the appellant on crucial issues. The appellant’s credit was, of course, critical to his defence. 
     36    When the appellant’s evidence is examined, it is plain that he commenced by seeking to minimise his knowledge of drug dealings, particularly those of Parker. He started off by admitting that he knew Parker sold drugs but didn’t know that he (Parker) was heavily involved. While the appellant was prepared to admit that drug preparation happened in his presence, and that he was even involved in it, he was chary about any real knowledge of the quantities of drugs involved. 
     37    When pressed about his knowledge of Parker’s involvement in large quantities of drugs (amphetamines) he said that he didn’t know exactly ‘but I presumed’. Later, he was pressed further and conceded that he realised that Parker was heavily involved in drug trafficking. 38    When cross-examined about the 14 September 1997 the appellant accepted that he was prepared to assist Parker in dividing up and preparing the ‘speed’ into packages. However, he was careful to say that he had no idea of the quantity. When asked about the reference to ‘fourteen pounds’, he said that he had no idea what that was about. 
     39    His Honour quoted this part of the evidence in his judgment and clearly rejected the appellant’s denials. Was he entitled to do so? 
     40    The appellant’s evidence, as well as the surveillance tapes over a considerable period, make it plain beyond argument that he was deeply and intimately involved with Parker (and others) in the supply of amphetamines, often involving large quantities. He grew up with Parker and had been his very close friend for around 20 years. They spoke to each other almost daily. He collected moneys for Parker from drugs and gambling. His ‘errands’ for Parker sometimes involved delivering drugs. On occasions the appellant dropped money off to Kalache from Parker. He used drugs Parker gave him. 
     41    The appellant was eventually forced to concede that he knew that Parker was heavily involved in illegal drugs and most probably a major trafficker.42    Woods DCJ, who had the benefit of assessing the demeanour of the appellant in the witness box, was entitled to reject the appellant’s crucial denials of knowledge of 19 September 1997. This is particularly so bearing in mind the context of the whole relationship between him and Parker revealed by the surveillance evidence and in the appellant’s own evidence. 
     43    It seems to me that his Honour was entitled to reject Bera’s evidence that Parker told him ‘just to drive around’ and that he had no idea what the purpose of the trip was, nor knowledge of the bag of drugs in the vehicle. The evidence was such that it was open to his Honour to conclude that the appellant’s answers were not credible. One significant piece of evidence was the appellant’s answer to the question: ‘Did it occur to you that the purpose of going to Sydney was possibly to do with a drug deal? His answer was equivocal - ‘Might have done but? 
     44    It further appears to me that when one examines the long time relationship between the appellant and Parker and, in particular, what Parker says to the appellant about their friendship when he ‘demotes’ him to his driver, it was open to his Honour to describe this as a ‘hiccup’ in the relationship but one which did not alter the appellant’s knowledge of Parker’s activities. 
     45    In my opinion, it was open to his Honour to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the car trip on 19 September 1997 would be related to drugs and that Parker was going to use the trip to convey a very large quantity of methylamphetamine. His Honour was entitled to find that the purpose of the exercise was the unlawful supply of the drug. No other reasonable hypothesis was available. 
     46    His Honour also found that the appellant knew that the quantity of the drug in the vehicle was well in excess of a large commercial quantity, that is, more than 1kg. As we know it was in fact 1.885kg. However, counsel for the appellant, Mr Bodor QC, submits that it was a leap of logic for his Honour to so find. There was no direct evidence and the remaining evidence was such that no inference could be drawn as to the quantity. Accordingly, he submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.47    However, his Honour was entitled to reject the appellant’s evidence about his lack of knowledge of the quantity of drugs in the car on 19 September 1997. According to his Honour, the appellant was simply, not credible in his denials. Bearing in mind the very large quantities of amphetamine that the appellant was involved in preparing for supply only 5 days before, and also on earlier occasions, and the whole of the relationship with Parker over an extended period, his Honour was entitled to infer that the appellant knew that more than 1kg was present in the car on the date in question. In my opinion, the inference was properly open from the proven facts and does not involve any impermissible ‘quantum leap’. The inference drawn was justifiable and followed logically on the earlier findings regarding the evidence and the appellant’s credibility. 
     48    In my opinion, on a review of the whole of the evidence, it was open to the trial judge to find as he did. See R v Winner (1995) 79 A Crim R 528 at 541 (Kirby ACJ) applying M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. 
     49    I mentioned at the outset that the appellant also contended that the verdict was unreasonable on the basis of a failure of his Honour to comply with the requirements articulated by the High Court in Fleming. At para [28] the Court said that while s 33(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act (now s 17(2)) did not include the expression “reasons for judgment” the provision should not be satisfied ‘merely by a bare statement of the principles of law that the judge has applied and the findings of fact’ made. ‘Rather, there must be exposed the reasoning process linking them and justifying the latter and, ultimately, the verdict that is reached’. 
     50    In Winner, Kirby ACJ opined that it would not seem necessary for the judge to expressly refer to rudimentary and uncontested principles. However, the judge’s reasons must be adequate and appropriate to sustain the orders. He continued 
      
       
        
        But I am far from convinced that the absence from such reasons of express references to judicial instruction which might be required for a jury trial will necessarily indicate the kind or errors that would invite and authorise the intervention of a Court of Criminal Appeal. One of the obvious advantages intended by Parliament in the procedure of trial before a judge sitting alone is the saving of time, the consideration of the case by a trained and experienced decision-maker and the provision of reasons for the decision which may be reviewed on appeal. [at 531] 
         
        
       
     51    In R v Schubert [2000] NSWSC 1127, Unreported, 5 December 2000, Greg James J had occasion to refer to the requirement of a judge (in a judge alone trial) to disclose his process of reasoning for what had been accepted or rejected. He concluded: 
      
       
        
        But it is not necessary, in my view, nor desirable, that reasons should be given beyond that, where the tribunal has, as I have here, come to the view that the accused should be acquitted of the offences charged. [at 7] 
        
       
     52    In my opinion, his Honour did not breach s 17(2), as explained in Fleming. He sufficiently referred to the principles of law to be applied and the findings of fact upon which he relied. A fair reading of the decision, understood in light of the evidence before his Honour and his view of it, does not reveal that he failed to expose his reasoning process. In my view he did and the manner in which he linked it with the evidence and inferences rationally available to be drawn justified the verdict reached. 
     53    That his Honour’s reasons could have been fuller or more detailed is no valid criticism provided that there is a sufficient exposure of the reasoning process by which the judge reached an available conclusion. I can discern no breach of s 17(2). 
     54    Accordingly, it is my view that while leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     55    FOSTER AJA: I agree with Stein JA.

      JUDGMENT 
     1    STEIN JA: I agree with McClellan J. 
      
       
     2    FOSTER AJA: I agree. 
      
       
     3    McCLELLAN J: The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against the sentence imposed on Tony Cappadona and Dorothy Cappadona for breaches of s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act) The respondents each pleaded guilty to eight charges under s 29D of the Act 
      
       
     4    The respondents had engaged in a deliberate and systematic fraud on the Australian Taxation Office over a period in excess of five years failing to make tax payments totalling $3,550,774. 
      
       
        
       The general facts: 
       
     5    Mindgrove Pty Limited (Mindgrove) was incorporated on 1 November 1993 and was a trustee for the Capazzo Trust referred to as the trust. The sole beneficiary of the trust was Atirey Pty Limited. The nature of the trust business was to provide formwork and some concreting and steelwork on various building sites around Sydney including the Olympic site at Homebush. Mindgrove was registered with the Australian Taxation Office as a remitter of payments pursuant to the prescribed payment system, PPS, for subcontractors and pay as you earn, PAYE, deductions for employees. Income tax returns for the trust indicate that in the 1997 year it had 299 employees and 51 subcontractors. In the 1998 year it had 480 employees and 72 subcontractors. Mindgrove (NSW) Pty Ltd (Mindgrove NSW) was incorporated on 24 April 1998. It also operated as a formworker and was registered with the ATO as a PAYE and PPS group employer. 
      
       
     6    Between December 1993 and February 1998 Mindgrove acting as trustee for the trust and Mindgrove (NSW) made cash payments for overtime to many employees and subcontractors of the trust without deducting and remitting tax instalment deductions to the ATO or otherwise declaring the payments as income thereby defrauding the Commonwealth. During the relevant period Tom Cappadona and Vincenzo Milazzo were the managers of Mindgrove, the managers and directors of Mindgrove (NSW) and the directors and equal shareholders of Atirey. Tom Cappadona was also registered as the company secretary of Mindgrove (NSW). Dorothy Cappadona was the bookkeeper and administration manager for Mindgrove, Mindgrove (NSW) and the trust and prepared taxation returns and employees group certificates. She was the authorised group certificate signatory for both companies and together with Vincenzo Milazzo signed as payer on PPS payee declarations. She worked at the registered office of the companies at 106 Wetherill Street, Silverwater, referred to as the office, and she and Carmela Milazzo were equal shareholders of Mindgrove and together with Tom Cappadona were the directors. 
      
       
     7    During the relevant period the employees and subcontractors of Mindgrove and Mindgrove (NSW) were paid for their normal working hours usually by cheque or by direct credit into their bank accounts. Overtime was paid in the same manner to some of the employees and subcontractors and the remainder were paid overtime in cash. These cash amounts were not declared to the ATO as income by either the employer or the employees and subcontractors. On some occasions this was by way of verbal agreement and on other occasions agreement was implied. The foreman at each job site would prepare weekly time sheets indicating the normal and overtime hours worked by each employee and subcontractor at that particular site. The foreman would then forward the time sheets to Tom Cappadona who would calculate and indicate the overtime on the sheets to be paid in cash and not declared, for the benefit of Dorothy Cappadona and the bookkeeper's assistant in the preparation of payments. The cash withdrawals were accounted for in the trust books as cash payments to suppliers and its bank statements annotated with the words cash cheques. The cash was usually withdrawn on Wednesdays by way of cash cheques, signed by Tom or Dorothy Cappadona and Vincenzo Milazzo. The pay envelopes were prepared by Dorothy Cappadona at the office and she and Tom Cappadona would add the cash payments. The following day Tom Cappadona and/or Vincenzo Milazzo would take the envelopes to the building sites for distribution. A search by Australian Federal Police officers of the residence of Vincenzo Milazzo on the morning of Thursday 18 February 1999 revealed a bag containing 231 pay envelopes each marked Mindgrove (NSW) in a different worker's name. All but two contained a pay slip advice and all but 39 contained an amount of cash. The total amount of cash in the envelopes was $69,394. The contents of the pay slips had been prepared the night before by Tom and Dorothy Cappadona at the office and provided to Vincenzo Milazzo. 
      
       
     8    The fraud was discovered when an informant approached the Australian Taxation Office followed by interviews which were conducted on 24 September 1997. A three month audit of Mindgrove was commenced in January 1998 and on 16 February 1998 Tom Cappadona was interviewed having been formally authorised in writing by Dorothy Cappadona to answer questions in relation to the taxation audit. He stated that some suppliers were paid by cash cheque, all subcontractors were paid by cheque and neither the subcontractors nor the employees received cash payments. He was asked to supply invoices to support the cash withdrawals indicated in the books as payments to suppliers. Invoices, bank statements and cheque butts were eventually supplied. Examination and further inquiries of the suppliers by the officers of the Australian Taxation Office revealed that they were not genuine, that is they had been altered or fabricated so they purported to refer to cash payments. The words cash cheque were removed from the bank statements, details on the cheque butts had details blanked out and/or new details added and invoices supplied to support Tom Cappadona's explanation that withdrawals were for payments to suppliers. 
      
       
     9    In September 1998 the Australian Federal Police took over the investigation and in February 1999 executed the search warrant on the registered office of the companies. The search yielded the original altered invoices, cheque butts and bank statements. The amount of undeclared cash payments made by each company to employees and subcontractors was $8,876,935 and a conservative estimate of the quantum of tax instalment deductions not remitted, is $3,550,774. 
      
       
     10    Mindgrove and Mindgrove (NSW) and Atirey have entered into terms of settlement with the Australian Taxation Office in respect of moneys owed by them and also by their employees and subcontractors to the Australian Taxation Office. Mindgrove and Mindgrove (NSW) agreed to pay $2,854,368 for the tax liability of payments made to employees and subcontractors between 1 July 1993 and 30 June 1999. Tom and Dorothy Cappadona and Vincenzo and Carmela Milazzo each entered into terms of settlement whereby each agreed to be assessed for an additional sum of $50,000 income for each of the three financial years from 1997 to 1999 and to pay an additional tax of seventy-five per cent for the tax shortfall for the first of those years. The total agreed debt in respect of the failure to deduct and pay tax instalments deductions, prescribed payments, income tax, additional tax and interest is $3,229,368. It is secured by mortgages over three properties, the residence of the Cappadonas and Milazzos and the company's office, the debt to be paid in monthly instalments, the last being due on 30 June 2003. The agreement which relates to the charges before the court does not include any penalty payment nor is expressed to be in lieu of the payment of any penalty. 
      
       
     11    Both respondents entered pleas of guilty at the earliest possible opportunity and both gave evidence at the sentence hearings. Neither has any prior convictions. Evidence was led before the sentencing judge of their good character which was not contested by the Crown. 
      
       
     12    The sentence hearing occupied more than one day. After the first day both respondents agreed to be interviewed by the police and disclosed their knowledge of the involvement of others in the offence. The appellant accepts that both respondents have provided a ""full and frank"" disclosure of their own involvement and the involvement of others. Both respondents have signed undertakings to cooperate with the authorities and give evidence in any future proceedings. No proceedings have presently been commenced. 
      
       
        
       The approach of the sentencing judge. 
        
       
     13    The sentencing judge concluded that these were very serious frauds involving a large sum of money. Accepting the need to reflect the objective of general deterrence in any sentence imposed in relation to an offence involving systematic revenue fraud, his Honour found that there were further aggravating features. These were identified as the substantial amount of the fraud, estimated to be $3.5 million; the period of five years over which the frauds were committed; the element of planning in the offences; cash payments to suppliers; the provision of false documentation to the Australian Taxation Office in an attempt to avoid detection and the breach of duty owed to the Australian Taxation Office to ensure that the amounts of tax were debited from employees and subcontractors and remitted to the Australian Taxation Office. 
      
       
     14    Having identified these matters the sentencing judge set out the background facts and other matters relevant to any leniency which could be afforded the respondents. Of Tom Cappadona he said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Mr Tom Cappadona is aged fifty-one. He was born in Italy and emigrated to Australia with his mother when four years old. His father had immigrated two years earlier. He is a man of prior good character and record. Upon leaving school he undertook an apprenticeship in construction carpentry and spent seven years in the formwork building industry until he established his own formwork business in 1978 the company he runs today. Mr Cappadona is clearly a hard working man who has build one of the most successful formwork businesses in Sydney. Projects undertaken include the construction of the Olympic Stadium at Homebush. There is extensive favourable character evidence all of which I accept. This reveals that his company has been responsible for the formwork construction of many large scale buildings in Sydney, that he is an excellent subcontractor and tradesman who is regarded throughout the industry as honest and reliable. The testimonial evidence also shows that he is regarded as one, if not the best, in the industry who would readily be engaged in the future. There is evidence within the union movement that he is regarded as honest and reasonable in industrial matters and being ""fair to his men within the top five per cent of employers"". Clearly also he has an excellent family and has educated his children up to university level. I accept all of the evidence of past impeccable record, integrity and good character, devotion to family and contribution to the community. 
         
        
        
         
         A pre-sentence report reveals Mr Cappadona attributes these offences to being under significant financial pressure to complete the building contracts that his company had undertaken. He claims that the demand for labour in the building industry at that time was very high and some of his employees refused to work overtime unless they were paid in cash without being subject to personal tax. He feels that his accountant did not fully explain to him the consequences of the business' actions in doing what it did. 
         
        
        
         
         I accept the evidence that Mr Cappadona is contrite and remorseful. I regard it as extremely unlikely that he would ever re-offend. The Crown accepts that the prisoners indicated that they propose to plead guilty at a very early stage of the proceedings. The Crown also accepts that the early pleas of guilty avoided a relatively complex and potential very lengthy trial and were therefore of considerable utilitarian value. I think that any trial in this matter would have been complex and would have extended over many several months and in my opinion the value of the pleas here lie primarily in the utilitarian effect of having saved the community the cost of a trial. They are also indicative of the prisoner's contrition. 
         
        
        
         
         I accept also that Mr Cappadona has suffered shame and humiliation as a result of these matters and that it has had a devastating effect on his family. There have been strains in the marriage as a result which it is hoped can be reconciled when this matter is finalised. Any prison sentence will cause hardship to the prisoner and his family and will make it difficult for him to maintain his commitments to repayment. 
         
        
        
         
         As already said Mindgrove and Mindgrove (NSW) and Atirey have entered into terms of settlement with the Australian Taxation Office in respect of moneys owed by them and also by their employees and subcontractors to the Australian Taxation Office. Mindgrove and Mindgrove (NSW) agreed to pay $2,854,368 for the tax liability of payments made to employees and subcontractors between 1 July 1993 and 30 June 1999, and Tom and Dorothy Cappadona and Vincenzo and Carmela Milazzo each entered into terms of settlement whereby each agreed to be assessed for an additional sum of $50,000 income for each of the three financial years from 1997 to 1999 and to pay an additional tax of seventy-five per cent for the tax shortfall for the first of those years. As I already indicated the total agreed debt in respect of the failure to deduct pay tax instalment deductions, prescribed payments, income tax, additional tax and interest is $3,228,368 and is secured by mortgages over three properties, the residence of the Cappadonas, Milazzo and the company's office. The debt is to be paid in monthly instalments the last being due on 30 June 2003. The agreement which pertains to these charges before the court does not include any penalty payments nor is it expressed to be in lieu of the payment of any penalty. 
         
        
        
         
         I am satisfied that there has been a substantial degree of sacrifice involved in the repayments and that it is a matter which may properly be taken into account by way of mitigation."" 
         
        
       
     15    His Honour concluded that the gravity of the offence and the need for deterrence in matters involving systematic revenue fraud called for a full time custodial sentence. However his Honour was aware that both respondents had agreed to provide assistance to the authorities and had participated in recorded interviews with the Australian Federal Police. He was also told that they had both signed undertakings to cooperate in future proceedings in accordance with s 21E of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. 
      
       
     16    Having regard to these matters the sentencing judge formed the view that both prisoners had given high level co-operation and concluded that it is clearly in the public interest that offenders should be encouraged to supply information to the authorities which will assist them to bring other offenders to justice. See R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243. 
      
       
     17    His Honour stated: 
      
       
        
         
         ""I am satisfied that both prisoners have given full and frank co-operation and have acted out of remorse and have genuinely co-operated with the authorities. This information could significantly assist the authorities. The information revealed substantial documentation and has the potential for further prosecution against at least seven other persons. I do not here set out the details of that information but it is acknowledged by the appropriate authorities that both prisoners have made a full and frank disclosure of their involvement in offences in relation to the taxation affairs of Mindgrove companies and full and frank disclosure of their knowledge of other persons involved including matters pertaining to ten other companies which were defrauding the Australian Taxation Office by paying cash wages to their employees. I am satisfied as I have said that this is high level assistance to the authorities and is deserving of the extension of leniency."" 
         
        
        
       
     18    With respect to Dorothy Cappadona the sentencing judge also set out the background facts and matters relevant to leniency. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Mrs Dorothy Cappadona is aged forty-nine. She is a person of prior good character and record. She resides in the family home with her three adult children, two sons aged twenty-four and eighteen and a daughter who is twenty-one. She was born in Australia to parents of Italian descent. Her father is deceased and her eighty-seven year old mother experiences health problems and she shares the responsibility of caring for her. A pre-sentence report indicates, and I accept that evidence, that she was raised in a strict Italian Catholic environment whereby females are traditionally taught that marriage is the ultimate goal and it is the responsibility of the wife to nurture and maintain the relationship. Following difficulties in the relationship she has sought professional counselling on a regular basis. She obtained her School Certificate in 1976 and completed twelve months secretarial course at TAFE. After various positions as a clerk and secretarial assistance and then in 1978 she commenced work with her husband when he started the building company and she has worked in that business ever since. It is apparent that she has played an important role in the success of this company. Her current position is that of office administrator. A pre-sentence report states as follows: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'Mrs Cappadona accepts responsibility for her role in the commission of these offences. It is of note that she reports complaining to her husband and his partner several times that she was not comfortable with the method of paying cash in hand and in 1998 she said that she withdrew her name as a company director because she did not like the way the company was run. She does state that in the building industry it was traditional for workers to be paid in cash for overtime in order to meet deadlines without industrial conflict. However, in making this statement the offender concedes that she was aware that this practice was illegal.' 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         That is confirmed in her own evidence where she stated that she knew that what was being done was wrong but has been forthright in admitting that she was part of the process of concealment. 
         
        
        
         
         I accept all of the testimonial evidence which shows that Mrs Cappadona has been a person of absolute integrity and described as a very special person and an honest and decent human being. She has been an excellent mother in a close knit and devoted family and has striven hard for the sake of her children. It is quite apparent that she is deeply and genuinely remorseful and has suffered shame and humiliation over what has happened. It is also apparent that this has had a great effect upon her and her family, all of which has been devastating as I have said. 
         
        
        
         
         On the evidence before me it does not appear that Mrs Cappadona gained much of anything from these frauds. I accept also that in the cultural environment in which she was raised and lived there was an element of having to obey or follow what she was instructed to do by her husband. It is acknowledged by her husband that he instructed his wife to conceal these frauds in her capacity as office administrator. She has been described as an impeccable bookkeeper. Nevertheless she has acknowledged that she knew what she did was wrong and that she was a part of concealing these matters. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown concedes that Mrs Cappadona's culpability is less than that of her husband and that a lesser punishment would be justified. I have already referred to her early plea of guilty entitling her to an element of leniency and the discount she is entitled to for the significant assistance rendered to the authorities in the full and frank disclosure which she has made and to the substantial degree of sacrifice involved in repayment including the mortgaging of all the property that she jointly owns. 
         
        
        
         
         Mrs Cappadona in your case you would normally receive a sentence in this matter of two and a half years imprisonment. That sentence is adjusted under the provisions of s 16G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act to a period of one year eight months imprisonment to take into account the absence of remissions in New South Wales. That sentence is further reduced to a period of twelve months due to the early plea of guilty. See The Crown v Thompson unreported, NSWCCA, 17 August 2000. Under s 21E of the Crimes Act I specify that but for your co-operation I would have sentenced you to imprisonment for twelve months but as a result of your co-operation and in the special circumstance which I have outlined the sentence of twelve months imposed is suspended under the provisions of s 21B of the Crimes Act 1914. 
         
        
        
       The sentencing judge's conclusions with respect to Tom Cappadona 
       
     19    In relation to Tom Cappadona the sentencing judge concluded that the appropriate sentence would normally be four years imprisonment but that the sentence required adjustment pursuant to s 16G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and should be adjusted to two years and eight months. His Honour further reduced the sentence to two years due to the early plea of guilty. He also determined that due to the prior good character and cooperation of the appellant and in particular his willingness to assist the authorities the sentence should be mitigated to be served by way of periodic detention. 
      
       
        
       The sentencing judge's conclusions with respect to Dorothy Cappadona 
        
       
     20    In relation to Dorothy Cappadona the sentencing judge found that her culpability was less than her husband and accordingly a lesser punishment was justified. He found that the appropriate sentence was two and a half years imprisonment but after adjustment pursuant to s 16G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, and making allowances for an early plea of guilty the appropriate sentence was twelve months. 
      
       
     21    The sentencing judge further determined that as a result of the respondent's co-operation and other special circumstances, by which I assume he was referring to her cultural background, her sentence should be suspended pursuant to s 21B of the Crimes Act. 
      
       
       Principles when sentencing for revenue fraud 
        
       
     22    This Court comprehensively reviewed the approach to be taken to sentencing with respect to revenue fraud in Director of Public Prosecutions v Hamman, 1 December 1998, Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, in which the majority judgment was delivered by Sheller JA.  
      
       
     23    The appropriate principles including matters of general application are: 
      
       
       (a) in determining the sentence appropriate to any offence regard must be had to its gravity viewed objectively; 
        
        
       (b) the maximum sentence fixed by the legislature defines the limits of sentence for cases in the most grave category; 
        
        
       (c) general deterrence is a predominate consideration when sentencing for offences of defrauding the revenue; 
        
        
       (d) a sentence by way of periodic detention has a strong degree of leniency built into it and is outwardly less severe in its denunciation of the crime. Many in the community would regard a total deprivation of liberty for a period of months as more punishing than a number of short term deprivations extending over a long period; 
        
        
       (e) although a matter to be taken into account it is of small account that when caught out the offender pays the tax due and additional tax by way of penalty; 
        
        
       (f) past integrity and good character carry little weight against systematic defrauding of the revenue over a significant period of time; 
        
        
       The competing submissions: 
       
     24    The Director of Public Prosecutions submits that both sentences were manifestly inadequate in all the circumstances. Although not identifying an explicit error of principle or specific error of law it is submitted that the resulting sentences were ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" (see House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505) and this Court should intervene. 
      
       
     25    It is submitted that the starting point adopted by his Honour was too low with the end result that after the various adjustments and deductions the sentences are ""so far out of touch with the circumstance of the particular offence and the particular offender that …. it constitutes an affront to community standards"". R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 232.  
      
       
     26    The Director of Public Prosecutions submits Tom Cappadona should have received a sentence of full time custody and Dorothy Cappadona, at the least, a sentence of periodic detention. 
      
       
     27    For the respondent it is submitted that the acceptance by them of the obligation to pay all of the tax payable by the employees and subcontractors, the fact that he did not directly benefit from a significant proportion of the fraud and the need to maintain the business, were reasons why leniency was appropriate. Accordingly, it was submitted that a sentence other than by way of full time custody was appropriate. 
      
       
       Conclusions 
       
     28    Having regard to the principle adopted by this Court in Hamman (see also R v Kelvin (2000) 46 ATR 1) I am of the opinion that the submission of the Director of Public Prosecutions should be accepted with respect to Tom Cappadona but not with respect to Dorothy Cappadona. 
      
       
     29    The offences committed by Tom Cappadona involved a systematic fraud over a period in excess of five years. In an attempt to avoid detection he created fake business records and when the frauds were uncovered, provided false information and documentation to the Australian Taxation Office in an attempt to avoid detection. The frauds involved a very large sum of revenue - at least $3.5 million. 
      
       
     30    In my opinion this evidences very serious criminal conduct by Tom Cappadona. Although this is not an offence of the most grave category, even after making allowance for the favourable matters identified by the trial judge, a custodial sentence was required. Only a custodial sentence can achieve the objective of general deterrence for this type of fraud. 
      
       
     31    It is obvious that in the civil construction industry, with many employees and subcontractors and large and complex undertakings, the opportunity for dishonest contractors to defraud the Australian Taxation Office are significant. When offenders are caught the sentence imposed should be adequate to ensure that others will be dissuaded from similar criminal activity.  
      
       
     32    I appreciate the need for the sentence to reflect the cooperation which an offender has given to the authorities but, having regard to the extent of the wrongdoing, only a full time custodial sentence was appropriate. 
      
       
     33    In my opinion the decision of the sentencing judge does not adequately recognise the fact that general deterrence is a predominate consideration when sentencing for offences of defrauding the revenue. 
      
       
     34    Accordingly, I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case for this Court to intervene. Everett v the Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299. In my opinion the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate and should be quashed. Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 175 ALR 315. 
      
       
     35    With respect to Dorothy Cappadona I am of the opinion that this Court should not intervene. The evidence indicated that although she played a part in concealing the fraud she was not responsible for it and had complained about the fact that she was being required to participate in the fraudulent processes.  
      
       
     36    In 1998 she apparently withdrew her name as a company director because she did not like the way the company was being run. I accept that the cultural environment of her upbringing had the result that she believed it to be important that she obey her husband's instructions in many matters including business. Friction over these matters has apparently imposed significant strains on the relationship with her husband. Otherwise evidence was given of her integrity and genuine remorse, shame and humiliation. 
      
       
     37    Although as I have indicated general deterrence is a predominant consideration when sentencing for offences of defrauding the revenue the personal circumstances of Dorothy Cappadona were such that she had little real choice but to accept and participate in the fraudulent activities of her husband. Having regard to these matters I am of the opinion that a custodial sentence was not required and although periodic detention or a community service order may have been appropriate I have decided in all the circumstances, this Court should not intervene with the decision of the sentencing judge. 
      
       
        
        
        
       The appropriate sentence for Tom Cappadona 
       
     38    Having determined that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge on Tom Cappadona should be quashed the appropriate sentence must be determined. It does not follow that a different sentence must be imposed (Hamman p 29). Although I am of the view that the failure to impose a full time custodial sentence indicates error this Court, when exercising the sentencing discretion must have regard to the consequences which have already followed from the imposition of the original sentence. That sentence was imposed on 14 November 2000 and the respondent has been deprived of his liberty during each subsequent weekend. Furthermore, when exercising the sentencing discretion this Court must be mindful of the fact that for the second time the respondent's freedom is put in jeopardy. Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295at 298. It must be accepted that to impose a full time custodial sentence will impose significant hardship on the respondent. 
      
       
     39    In the present case, notwithstanding those considerations, I am satisfied that it is appropriate for the court to intervene. In my opinion the gravity of the offence demands that a full time custodial sentence be imposed by this Court. 
      
       
     40    Divisions 2 and 3 of Pt 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 set out the matters relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion. Section 16A(1) requires the court to impose a sentence of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. Subs(2) requires that in addition to any other matters the court must take into account such of the matters as are there set out in lettered paragraphs and are relevant and known to the court. 
      
       
     41    Section 17A requires the court to be satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case and section 16G requires the sentence to be adjusted on account of the fact that being served in a prison in New South Wales the sentence is not subject to remission or reduction. 
      
       
     42    In my opinion having regard to the fact that the fraud was carefully organised, continued for five years and involved a great many individual criminal acts which deprived the revenue of $3.5 million the appropriate sentence on each charge was a term of imprisonment for five years to be served concurrently. The appropriate adjustment having regard to s 16G would provide a sentence of three years and four months. That sentence should be further reduced having regard to the early plea of guilty to two years and six months. 
      
       
     43    The fact that the sentencing discretion is being re-exercised should be recognised by reducing the sentence by six months and in addition, the time served by way of periodic detention should be counted in discharge of part of the full time custodial sentence. 
      
       
     44    Having regard to the serious nature of the offences and the fact that they involved a multiplicity of criminal acts over an extended period, a non parole period or recognisance release order is not appropriate. 
      
       
     45    The respondent is also entitled to a further reduction on account of the assistance to the authorities in investigating other aspects of the fraud and the involvement of third parties. Although these are revenue crimes the potential impact on the respondent of such cooperation should not be underestimated. 
      
       
     46    In my opinion the sentence should be reduced by a further six months on account of this cooperation. Accordingly I specify for the purpose of s 21E that but for the respondent's cooperation I would have imposed a sentence of two years but because of that cooperation the sentence should be reduced to a period of eighteen months. As I have indicated the time served by way of periodic detention should be counted and accordingly the sentence will expire on 13 May 2002. 
      
       
     47    I propose the following orders: 
      
       
       Tom Cappadona 
        
        
       1. The appeal is allowed. 
        
        
       2. The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge is quashed. 
        
        
       3. In lieu thereof the respondent Tom Cappadona is sentenced to eighteen months full time imprisonment for each offence to be served concurrently. Such sentence to commence on 14 November 2000 and expiring on 13 May 2002 with time already served by way of periodic detention to count. 
        
        
       Dorothy Cappadona 
        
        
       1. Appeal dismissed.

      R v Stanley John MILLER 
      
      
       
        
       
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1    GILES JA: The appellant was charged on an indictment containing two counts. The first was that between 1 June 1998 and 20 June 1998 he had sexual intercourse with JW without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting. The second was that between the same dates he “being a step-father did unlawfully and carnally know [JW] … she being then between the age of 16 and 17 years and his step-daughter”. 
      
       
        
       
     2    The first count was laid under s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (“the Act”). The second count was laid under s 73 of the Act, which provides - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “Whosoever, being a schoolmaster or other teacher, or a father, or step-father, unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of 16 years, and under the age of 17 years, being his pupil, or daughter, or step-daughter, shall be liable to imprisonment for 8 years.” 
          
         
         
          
         
        
       
     3    On 12 July 2000 the appellant entered a plea of not guilty to the first count and a plea of guilty to the second count. The Crown accepted the plea of guilty in full discharge of the indictment. The matter was adjourned to a later date for sentence. It came before Freeman DCJ on 20 November 2000. 
      
       
        
       
     4    The Crown tendered an agreed statement of facts. The statement of facts began - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “In November of 1997 the accused and the victims [sic] mother began to co-habit at [an address] where the victim also lived. The relationship between the victim and the accused was a one [sic] of father figure though little control was exercised by the accused, control being exercised in the main by the victim’s mother … “. 
          
         
         
          
         
        After an account of an occasion of sexual intercourse “sometime in June 1998”, it was said that “some weeks later the accused and the victim’s mother were married”.  
         
        
       
     5    Counsel for the appellant raised for his Honour’s consideration whether on these facts there was the relationship of step-father and step-daughter necessary for the offence. It was indicated that, if a plea of guilty to the second count in the indictment was not available, there would be an issue as to consent on the first count. The appellant maintained his plea of guilty and the Crown remained willing to accept the plea in full discharge of the indictment, but both counsel for the appellant and the Crown indicated uncertainty as to the availability of the plea. 
      
       
        
       
     6    The appellant gave evidence. He agreed with the proposition that the mother of JW was his “de facto wife” at the time of the alleged offence, and said that he had been “in that relationship with her” for about seven or eight months. He said that he and the mother of JW were married on 20 June 1998, and that they separated in December 1998 and were subsequently divorced.  
      
       
        
       
     7    It is apparent that the question of the relationship of step-father and step-daughter troubled his Honour, because he said that he had “better think about this plea”. The Crown then sought an adjournment in order to give further thought to the question, to which the appellant consented. The matter was again adjourned.  
      
       
        
       
     8    On 14 December 2000 the Crown applied to withdraw its acceptance of the plea of guilty, submitting that the plea should be rejected because marriage between the appellant and the mother of JW was necessary for the relationship of step-father and step-daughter. The appellant opposed the application. Neither counsel for the appellant nor the Crown was able to refer his Honour to clear authority, although there was reference to R v Dawson (1927) 27 SR 78, and the submissions were not extensive. His Honour gave a judgment in which he granted leave to withdraw the Crown’s acceptance of the plea. He held that he could “only construe stepfather as being a person linked by marriage with the victim’s mother”, while saying that the question was “clearly an open one” and that he would grant a certificate to the appellant in order that he could have it decided. 
      
       
        
       
     9    In due course his Honour certified, as contemplated by s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (“the Appeal Act”), that his judgment was a proper one for determination on appeal, saying that there was - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “ … an issue of law as to whether the term ‘stepfather’ means only a person who is married to the mother of the complainant child in question or, whether the term ‘stepfather’ includes also a person who lives in a relationship of de facto marriage with the mother of that child.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     10    On 9 January 2001 the appellant appealed against his Honour’s judgment pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Appeal Act. He stated as the grounds of appeal - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “1. That the term ‘stepfather’ under section 73 of the  
          Crimes Act 
           1900 is not restricted to a male offender who is married to the complainant’s mother at the time of the commission of the offence but can include a male offender who is the de-facto husband of the complainant’s mother living in the same household as the complainant and her mother at the time of the commission of the offence and assumes the role of father over the complainant. 
           
           
           2. That the term ‘stepdaughter’ within that provision has a corresponding meaning and is not restricted to the daughter of as [sic] female who is married to a male offender but can include the daughter of a female who is in a de-facto relationship living with a male offender who lives in the same household as her mother and her de-facto husband and assumes the role of daughter to the offender; 
           
           
           3. That ‘stepfather’ within that provision means someone who is not the complainant’s biological father but who is in a position of authority or control over the complainant at the time of the commission of the offence.” 
           
           
          
         
        
       
     11    It will be noted that the grounds of appeal were not expressed simply in terms of a relationship of de facto marriage between the offender and the mother of the child. In the first two grounds of appeal elements additional to a relationship of de facto marriage were postulated, namely that the child is living in the same household as the offender and the child’s mother at the time of the commission of the offence and that the offender assumes the role of father over the child. The third ground of appeal abandoned any element of a relationship of de facto marriage, and postulated only that the offender is in a position of authority or control over the child at the time of the commission of the offence. 
      
       
        
       
     12    To the extent to which , because of non-conformity between the certificate and the grounds of appeal, leave to appeal is required pursuant to s 5F(3)(a) of the Appeal Act, I consider that it should be granted. 
      
       
        
         
        Legislation  
         
        
       
     13    The origin of s 73 of the Act is in the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1883 (“the 1883 Act”), described as an act “to consolidate and amend in certain respects the Criminal Law”. It included as s 43 - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “Whosoever being a schoolmaster or other teacher unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of ten years and under the age of sixteen years being his pupil and whosoever being a father carnally knows any girl between such ages being his daughter shall be liable to penal servitude for fourteen years. And whosoever being such schoolmaster or teacher or father assaults any such girl with intent to have such knowledge or by any means attempts to have such knowledge shall be liable to penal servitude for seven years. And the consent of the pupil or daughter shall be no defence to any charge under this section. Provided that nothing in this clause contained shall prevent such schoolmaster teacher or parent from being prosecuted under either section forty-one or forty-two of this Act.” 
          
         
         
          
         
        Sections 41 and 42 provided for offences of carnal knowledge and assault with intent to have carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 10 years and of carnal knowledge and assault with intent to have carnal knowledge of a girl of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years. 
         
        
       
     14    Section 73 of the Act as it stood in 1900, dealing with the first subject-matter of s 43 of the 1883 Act, did not extent to carnal knowledge by a step-father of his step-daughter. It read - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “Whosoever, being a schoolmaster, or other teacher, or a father, unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of ten years, and under the age of sixteen years, being his pupil or daughter, shall be liable to penal servitude for fourteen years.” 
          
         
         
         
        Sections 74, 76 and 75 of the Act respectively dealt with assault and attempt, consent, and other prosecution previously part of s 43 of the 1883 Act. Section 75 was in the terms that nothing in s 73 prevented “such schoolmaster, teacher, or father” from being prosecuted for carnal knowledge or attempted carnal knowledge of a girl of or above the age of 10 years. 
         
        
       
     15    Surrounding provisions in the part of the Act containing s 73, all under the heading “Rape and similar offences” (ss 62-78), were concerned with rape and attempted rape (ss 63-65); procuring carnal knowledge by fraud (s 66); carnal knowledge and attempted carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 10 years (ss 67-70); carnal knowledge and attempted carnal knowledge of a girl of or above the age of 10 years but under the age of 14 years, and corresponding assault (ss 71, 72); indecent assault of a girl under the age of 10 years (s 77); and indecent assault of a female of or above the age of 14 years (s 78).  
      
       
        
       
     16    By s 3 of the Crimes (Girls’ Protection) Act 1910 s 73 was amended by adding after “father” the words “or step-father” and after “daughter” the words “or step-daughter”; by s 2 the age of 17 years was substituted for the age of 16 years. Section 75 was correspondingly amended. In the second reading speech it was said (New South Wales Parliamentary Debates (Second Series) Volume 33 p 780) - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “The object of the bill is to protect girls under the age of 16 years, and, so far as parents and guardians are concerned, girls under the age of 17, against the offences which are dealt with under sections 64, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 77 and 78 of the Crimes Act of 1900; and it is further to extend the protection of that act to step-daughters, as well as to daughters, in certain cases.” 
          
         
         
          
         
        The extension of protection to step-daughters, relevant only to ss 73 and 75 of the Act, was not otherwise explained. 
         
        
       
     17    By s 5 of the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1924 (“the 1924 Act”) the existing s 73 and a number of the surrounding provisions were omitted and replaced, and some additional provisions were inserted. Of the replacement provisions, s 73 was unchanged from its predecessor. The second reading speech of the Attorney-General in the Legislative Assembly was relevantly uninformative (New South Wales Parliamentary Debates (Second Series) Vol XCII p 1713). In the second reading speech in the Legislative Council it was relevantly said that s 5 was “nothing but a codification” and that “[t]he Girls’ Protection Act is being repealed and its sections are being taken into the Crimes Bill” (New South Wales Parliamentary Debates (Second Series ) Vol XCVI p 1254). This was not accurate, but nothing turns on the inaccuracy.  
      
       
        
       
     18    The additional provisions inserted by the 1924 Act included ss 78A-78C concerned with offences of incest, for which provision had first been made by the Punishment of Incest Act 1908. The essence of the offences was carnal knowledge between a male and his mother, sister, daughter or grand-daughter “whether in any such case the relationship is of half or full blood, or is or is not traced through lawful wedlock”. Section 78D took up a provision of the Punishment of Incest Act, by which a person convicted of incest could be removed from “all authority” over the female and from any guardianship over her, and extended it to conviction for the offence in s 73 of the Act. It provided - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “On the conviction of a father or step-father of an offence under section seventy-three or section seventy-four of this Act or of a male person of an offence under section 72A or under section 78A or under section 78B of this Act, the court may divest the offender of all authority over the female with whom the offence has been committed, and if the offender is the guardian of such female, may remove the offender from such guardianship, and in any such case may appoint any person or persons to be the guardian or guardians of such female during her minority, or for any greater or less period.” 
          
         
         
        
       
     19    The Crimes (Amendment) Act 1984 brought into the Act extensive provisions concerning homosexual offences. They included the offence in s 78N corresponding to that in s 73 - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “A male person who, being a schoolmaster or other teacher, or a father, or step-father, has homosexual intercourse with any male person of or above the age of 10 years, and under the age of 18 years, being his pupil, son or step-son shall be liable to penal servitude for 14 years.” 
          
         
         
        
       
     20    Section 73 of the Act was amended in 1985 by omitting the age boundaries of 10 and 17 years and providing simply for a girl “of the age of 16 years”, and by reducing the penalty to 8 years imprisonment. The amendments, by the Crimes (Child Assault) Amendment Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”), were associated with a raft of new provisions concerned with sexual offences against children under 10 and of and above the age of 10 but under the age of 16, and consequential repeal and amendment of surrounding provisions. None of the new provisions had as an ingredient a familial or pedagogical relationship, but a number of the new provisions had as an ingredient that the child was “under the authority” of the offender. By the new s 61A(5), a person was under the authority of another person if “in the care, or under the supervision or authority” of that person.  
      
       
        
       
     21    As an example, there was added to the offence of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years in s 61D(1) of the Act the offence in s 61D(1A) - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who -  
          
         
         
          
          (a) is under the age of 16 years; and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) is (whether generally or at the time of the sexual intercourse only) under the authority of the person, 
           
           
          without the consent of the other person and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse shall be liable to penal servitude for 12 years.” 
          
         
         
          
         
        The penalty was higher than the penalty for the offence in s 61D(1).  
         
        
       
     22    Like additions were made in 61E (indecent assault and act of indecency on a person under the age of 16 years), and by s 66C - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “66C(1) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of 10 years, and under the age of 16 years, shall be liable to penal servitude for 8 years. 
           
          
          
          (2) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who - 
          
         
         
          
          (a) is of or above the age of 10 years, and under the age of 16 years, and  
           
           
          (b) is (whether generally or at the time of the sexual intercourse only) under the authority of the person, 
           
           
          shall be liable to penal servitude for 10 years.” 
          
         
         
        
       
     23    In the second reading speech in the Legislative Assembly the Premier said (New South Wales Parliamentary Debates (Third Series) Vol 187 p 9325) - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “The new range of offences also gives special emphasis to the relationship of the offender to the victim. If the offender is found to be in a position of care, supervision or authority over the child, then harsher penalties apply. Thus the law recognizes far more comprehensively than it did before, the more serious nature of abuse by a parent, de facto parent, person in charge of an institution or family friend.” 
          
         
         
        
       
     24    The 1985 Act did not have corresponding new provisions concerned with homosexual offences. 
      
       
        
       
     25    In 1987 s 73 was again amended to express the age to which it applied as “of or above the age of 16 years, and under the age of 17 years”. 
      
       
        
       
     26    At no time has “step-father” or “step-daughter” been defined in the Act, nor has “father” or “daughter”.  
      
       
        
         
        The ordinary meaning of ‘step-father” and “step-daughter” 
         
        
       
     27    Dictionary definitions of these words involve marriage between the putative step-father and the mother of the putative step-daughter. As examples, in the Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed, 1989) step-father is defined as “a man who has married one’s mother after one’s father’s death or divorce”, and step-daughter is defined as “a daughter, by a former marriage, of one’s husband or wife”; in the Macquarie Dictionary (3rd ed, 1997) step-father is defined as “a man who occupies one’s father’s place by marriage to one’s mother”, step-daughter is defined as “a daughter of one’s husband or wife by a former marriage”, and “step-“ is defined as “a prefix indicating connection between members of a family by the remarriage of a parent and not by blood”. 
      
       
        
       
     28    These meanings have been taken up in, for example, the Family Law Act 1975 (C’th) in its provisions concerning proper parenting of children: the definition of “step-parent” in s 60D is a person who is not a parent of the child, is or has been married to the parent of the child, and treats or at any time during the marriage treated the child as a member of the family formed with the parent. 
      
       
        
       
     29    The meanings have also been recognised in the cases as the meaning according to ordinary usage, with marriage between the step-parent and the parent of the child a necessary ingredient. 
      
       
        
       
     30    In re Cook; ex parte C (1985) 59 ALJR 669 a provision of the Family Law Act, deeming an ex-nuptial child of the husband or the wife to be a child of the marriage if ordinarily a member of the household of the husband and wife at the relevant time, was held to be invalid because not within the power to make laws with respect to marriage. On the facts, the wife was unmarried at the time of the child’s birth and subsequently married the husband. Gibbs CJ and Mason, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ, all of whom considered the provision wholly invalid, evidently did not think this material. Deane J, who dissented, considered that the provision was valid at least where there had been such a marriage, and so discussed the part played by marriage in a step-relationship. 
      
       
        
       
     31    His Honour said (at 674) - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “It is true that, strictly speaking, an ex-nuptial child of a husband or a wife cannot, without adoption or legitimation, become a child of that or any other marriage. If, however, the natural parent of an ex-nuptial child marries someone other than the child’s other natural parent and the child is an infant who ordinarily resides in their matrimonial home, the child has a close and direct connection with that marriage. It is not only that he or she lives in the matrimonial home as a child of one party to the marriage. It is that, as a matter of well-established social custom in this and other countries of the common law world, the child acquires a special familial relationship with the other party to the marriage by reason of the marriage itself. That special relationship is acknowledged, as a matter of ordinary language, by the terms ‘stepfather’ or ‘stepmother’ and ‘stepson’ or ‘stepdaughter’. 
          
         
         
          
          The relationship between step-parent and stepchild is one of affinity as distinct from consanguinity. The basis of the relationship is the marriage of the step-parent with the natural parent.” 
          
         
         
          
         
        
       
     32    His Honour then cited (also at 674) instances of the law recognising a step-relationship based on the marriage of the step-father with the natural parent as creating rights and obligations. They included -  
      
       
        
         
          
          “(v) incest or carnal knowledge (see, eg,  
          Rex v Frith 
           (1914) VLR 658; Crimes Act 1958 (Vic), s 52(1) and (2); Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), ss 73, 74, 77, 78N and 78O)"". 
          
         
         
        
       
     33    His Honour continued (at 674-5) - 
      
       
        
         
          
           
          “The nature of the relationship between step-parent and stepchild has been considered in numerous cases in common law jurisdictions. The relationship has been correctly described as a ‘quasi parental’ one (see, eg  
          Rex v Frith 
           [(1914) VLR 658] at 660. It arises regardless of whether the child was an ex-nuptial child or was the child of a previous marriage: see  
          Lineham v Lineham 
           [(1974) 1 NZLR 686];  
          Rex v Frith 
          . The direct connection between the relationship of step-parent and stepchild and the marriage of which it arises has often been stressed. Thus it has been recognised that the relationship will only arise if the marriage of parent and putative step-parent was a valid one (see  
          Wilkinson v Joughin 
           (1866) LR 2 Eq Cas 319 at 322) and it has been held that the relationship will only persist while the marriage, by reason of which it arises, remains undissolved ( 
          Mander v O’Toole 
           [(1948) NZLR 909] at 912-913), at least if there are no children born of the marriage: cf. 2A  
          Corpus Juris Secundum 
          , p 514. If the marriage remains undissolved at the time of death of the natural parent, the relationship of affinity between step-parent and stepchild will continue: see, eg.  
          McGaughey v Grand Lodge AOUW of State of Minnesota 
           (1921) 180 NW 1001;  
          Brotherhood of 
            
          Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen v Hogan 
           [(1934) 5 Fed Supp 598] at 603-604. It has been said that the word ‘stepchild’ should, in a particular statutory context, be interpreted as ‘referring to the acquisition of a new relationship by a child when its parent remarries’ and ‘that the child acquires this new relationship towards the person the parent remarries’: see per Lord Sorn,  
          Commissioners of Inland Revenue v A B Russell 
           (1955) 36 TC 83 at 86.” 
          
         
        
        
         
          
         
        
       
     34    In Wilkinson v Joughin (1866) LR 2 Eq Cas 319, to which his Honour referred, the testator bequeathed property to “my step-daughter Sarah Ward”. The marriage between the testator and the mother of the child was void, because the mother was married to another man. The bequest was upheld on the ground that, although the testator had been defrauded by the mother of the child and “induced to believe that the child was his step-daughter” (at 326), there was nonetheless a sufficient description of the child as the person intended to be benefited. The child was not the testator’s step-daughter, but was identified by name. 
      
       
        
       
     35    In Mander v O’Toole (1948) NZLR 909, to which his Honour also referred, the question was whether the son by a previous marriage of the deceased’s former wife, they having been divorced, was a “step-son” of the deceased and so could claim under the Deaths by Accident Compensation Act 1908 (NZ). “Step-son” was not defined. Finlay J held that it extended only to children “who possessed that character by virtue of a subsisting marriage when the cause of action sought to be enforced under the Act arose” (at 912-3). 
      
       
        
       
     36    In re Burt (1988) 1 Qd R 23 the question was whether a step-relationship subsisted after the termination of the marriage which created it for the purposes of an application allowed under the Succession Act 1867-1977 (Qld) to a step-child of the testatrix. It was held that it did not. “Step-child” was defined in relation to any person as a child by a former marriage of that person’s husband or wife, and marriage at some time was therefore necessary: the question turned on the termination of the marriage. But the reasons included consideration of the ordinary meaning of the word. 
      
       
        
       
     37    McPherson J said (at 26-7) - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “Apart from these considerations of strict statutory interpretation, there is also the natural meaning of the word ‘stepchild’. The  
          New Webster Encyclopaedic Dictionary 
           (1980 ed) gives as the meaning of the word ‘The child of a husband or wife by a former husband or wife’. That may be said to support the contention of the respondents on this appeal; but it differs from an earlier definition in  
          Webster’s New International Dictionary 
          , which was: ‘A child of one’s wife or husband by a former marriage’. See  
          Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen v Hogan 
           5 Fed Supp 598 (1934), at 600. The most precise correspondence with the definition of ‘stepchild’ adopted by the Queensland amendment in 1943 tends to suggest that the draftsman of that amendment used the earlier Webster as his source. In  
          Hogan’s 
           case, which was referred to by Dean J in  
          Re Cook 
           (1985) 59 ALJR 669, 674, Nordbye J, undertook an extensive survey of decisions on the meaning of the word ‘stepchild’ in various American insurance policies and in statutes in which relationship by ‘affinity’ is a criterion. His Honour appears to have accepted, as correctly reflecting the effect of the majority of those decisions, the proposition then stated in 2 Corpus Juris 379 that ‘death of the spouse terminates the relationship by affinity … “. The basis of the underlying reasoning is that a step-relationship is one created by marriage, which therefore comes to an end when the marriage that brought [sic] into existence is terminated by the [sic] death or a fortiori by divorce.” 
          
         
         
          
         
        
       
     38    His Honour then considered Mander v O’Toole, and said (at 27-8) that it and the United States authorities showed that “there was an ordinary and natural meaning of the word ‘stepchild’ and that the relationship it connotes is ordinarily regarded as coming to an end upon termination of the marriage that gave rise to it”.  
      
       
        
       
     39    Andrews CJ expressed broad agreement with the reasons of McPherson and Thomas JJ. Thomas J’s reasons were to the same effect as those of McPherson J, and included (at 32) that the “direct connection between the relationship of step-parent and stepchild and the marriage from which is [sic: it] arises” was recognised in re Cook; ex parte C and the United States cases. 
      
       
        
       
     40    Closer to the present case, in R v Umanski (1961) VR 242 the applicant had been convicted of incest, an offence under s 52 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) which relevantly provided - 
      
       
        
         
          “52(1) Whosoever unlawfully and carnally knows a woman or girl of or above the age of ten years such woman or girl being to his knowledge his daughter or other lineal descendant or his step-daughter shall be guilty of felony …”. 
         
         
          
         
        One of the issues was whether the Crown had proved the step-relationship. The complainant was the daughter by another man of a woman whom the applicant had subsequently married.  
         
        
       
     41    It was said (at 245, per Herring CJ, Dean and Adam JJ) - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “It was therefore necessary to prove that the girl was his step-daughter. It was proved that she was the daughter of Mrs Umanski and that the applicant knew this. But it was also necessary for the Crown to prove that applicant and Mrs Umanski had been lawfully married, for unless this was so, then the girl was not the applicant’s step-daughter.”  
          
         
         
          
         
        It was held that the marriage had not been proved, and the applicant’s conviction was quashed. 
         
        
       
     42    There is thus substantial support for the conclusion to which Freeman DCJ came. Marriage between the step-parent and the parent of the child is the basis of the step-relationship, and this is underlined by the decisions that the step-relationship comes to an end on the termination of the marriage. In the present case it is not necessary to consider whether or not a common law marriage would be sufficient, as a common law marriage is more than a de facto relationship and the appellant disclaimed reliance on the existence of a common law marriage prior to the marriage of 20 June 1998.  
      
       
        
       
     43    R v Dawson does not stand to the contrary of this necessity for marriage. In accord with R v Frith (1914) VLR 658, cited by Deane J in re Cook; ex parte C, it was there held that a step-daughter in s 73 of the Act included an illegitimate daughter of the offender’s wife, and marriage between the offender and the wife was not in question. But the appellant sought to gain support from R v Frith and R v Dawson in another way. 
      
       
        
         
        The appellant’s argument 
         
        
       
     44    Perhaps unusually for an alleged offender, the appellant argued that s 73 should be given an operation wider than that flowing from this ordinary meaning of “step-father” and “step-daughter”, an operation as expressed in the grounds of appeal. As has been seen, the grounds of appeal in fact put forward more than one meaning, and the meanings did not involve only the existence of a de facto marriage. 
      
       
        
       
     45    Emphasising that s 73 is not confined to familial relationships, but extends to the relationship of school master or other teacher and pupil, the appellant submitted that it was intended to provide a distinct and more serious offence of carnal knowledge where the offender was in a position of authority or control over the child. Section 73 was particularly contrasted with ss 78A-78C of the Act concerned with incest. In R v Geddeson (1906) 25 NZLR 323 it was held that a stepfather was not the “father” of the child within an incest provision because there was no blood relationship, and the appellant said that in lieu of a blood relationship s 73 looked to a relationship of authority or control.  
      
       
        
       
     46    It was here that the appellant sought to gain support from R v Frith and R v Dawson.  
      
       
        
       
     47    In the latter case Street CJ said (at 80) - 
      
       
        
         
          
          “Obviously the object is to protect young girls against offences upon them by persons who are in a position of authority or control over them. Which method of interpretation will be more consonant with the intention of the legislature? The narrow view that, in speaking of step-daughters, the legislature referred only to legitimate daughters of a woman who afterwards married another man, or the view that the intention was to impose a punishment on a man who had carnal knowledge with the daughter whether legitimate or illegitimate, of a woman whom he had married? The mischief is the same in the one case as in the other, and in my opinion we should be putting too limited an interpretation upon the section if we were to hold that it was limited to daughters or step-daughters born in lawful wedlock.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     48    The Chief Justice then referred to R v Frith, in which a similar provision was seen as directed to the abuse of authority incidental to parental or quasi parental relations, whether or not founded in legitimacy.  
      
       
        
       
     49    The appellant sought to gain similar support from cases not concerned with s 73 of the Act. In R v Reid (1901) 3 WALR 109 “sister” in an incest provision was held to include a half-sister, the wider meaning being adopted because it was considered that the legislature intended “to prevent immorality of such a serious nature amongst families” (per Onslow CJ at 110) or “to endeavour to preserve the purity of family life” (per Hensman J at 110-1). In R v Campbell (1968) Tas SR 38 it was held that “daughter” in an incest provision included an adopted daughter: the decision turned on the effect of the Adoption of Children Act 1920 (Tas), but it was noted (at 40-1) that the result was “consonant with the nature of the crime of incest and the purposes for which the law punishes it” because incest was just as disruptive of the proper relationship between father and adopted child as when the child was truly the father’s child.  
      
       
        
         
        Discussion 
         
        
       
     50    I do not find the last-mentioned cases of assistance, save so far as they illustrate regard to the social setting and legislative purpose of a provision when addressing its meaning. Nor does it seem to me that the appellant’s submission gains support from his reliance on R v Frith and R v Dawson.  
      
       
        
       
     51    Let it be accepted that the purpose of s 73 of the Act was and is to protect young girls from abuse by persons who are in positions of authority and control over them. Nonetheless the legislature has chosen to fulfil the purpose by stating particular relationships which will normally bring authority and control - teacher and pupil, father and daughter, step-father and step-daughter. It has not used the criterion of authority and control. An offender who is (say) the father of the child will be caught although not in fact having authority and control over the child, and an offender who is not a teacher, the father or a step-father of the child will not be caught although in fact having authority and control over the child. 
      
       
        
       
     52    The relationships stated are relatively precise and readily understood criteria. The meanings of the words used for the relationships can not be put aside. In the case of the step-relationship, the words used by the legislature can not be replaced by a complex criterion of de facto relationship between the offender and the child’s mother plus assumption of roles of father and daughter (as the first and second grounds of appeal suggest), still less abandoned in favour of an even less precise criterion of assumption of roles of husband and wife and existence of authority and control (as the third ground of appeal suggests). Nor can an underlying purpose seen in s 73 supplant the meanings of the words used if there be accepted meanings of those words. 
      
       
        
       
     53    In using the words “step-father” and “step-daughter” the legislature has used words with accepted meanings which can be applied with certainty. The appellant’s arguments would substitute for those meanings the imprecision and uncertainty of the existence of a de facto relationship and the existence of authority and control by the offender over the child. A de facto relationship between the offender and the mother of the child does not as a matter of law bring any authority of the former over the latter, and as a matter of fact may or may not do so: the possibility of authority and control does not make a step-relationship. An inquiry into actual authority and control would depart from the precision of the stated criterion. (In the present case this is well illustrated: what is to be made of the agreement in the statement of facts that “the relationship between the victim and the accused was one of father figure though little control was exercised by the accused … “?)  
      
       
        
       
     54    It must be remembered that s 73 of the Act provides for a criminal offence. While the rule that statutes creating offences are to be strictly construed (see for example Tuck & Sons v Priester (1887) QBD 629 at 638) is perhaps not now applied with the rigour of earlier days, it remains that ambiguity or doubt should be resolved in favour of the subject: Beckwith v R (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 576; Waugh v Kippen (1986) 160 CLR 156 at 164. As was affirmed by Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Murphy v Farmer (1988) 165 CLR 19 at 28, citing from Dickenson v Fletcher (1873) LR 9 CP 1 at 7, “[t]hose who contend that [a] penalty must be inflicted, must shew that the words of the Act distinctly enact that it shall be incurred under the present circumstances”. It is not consonant with this so to interpret s 73 that it would have a wide and uncertain reach in place of that given by taking its words in their accepted meanings; nor should a purposive construction be given to it if that would depart from the accepted meanings (see R v Arnold (1992) 65 A Crim R 337 at 338, 346).  
      
       
        
       
     55    As has been seen, the criterion of a step-relationship was brought into s 73 of the Act in 1910, was taken up in 1924 in s 78D, and was again employed in 1984 in s 78N. It was first used at a time before de facto relationships had received the recognition in the law which they came to have through, for example, the De Facto Relationships Act 1984, and when there were the accepted meanings of “step-father” and “step-daughter” to which I have referred. The criterion was retained when offences with the different criterion of being under the authority of the offender were introduced in 1985, according to the second reading speech specifically in order to provide for harsher penalties where the offender was in a position of care, supervision or authority over the child and contemplating that a family friend could be in that position. Section 78D recognised that the offender might have authority over the child, but s 73 of the Act was confined by the statement of relationships which would normally bring authority, and the relevant relationship had to be found. If it had been intended in 1910 that a de facto relationship by which there was authority and control should be the criterion, rather than one of the stated relationships, that could have been said, as something perhaps wider than that was said in 1985. 
      
       
        
       
     56    The legislature has not chosen to extent the reach of s 73 of the Act, as has occurred elsewhere. For example, the Western Australian incest provisions were extended to offences against de facto children by a definition which includes “a step-child of the offender or a child or step-child of a person … who lives with the offender as if they were married” (Criminal Code s 329, inserted by Acts Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 1992 (WA)). The same has occurred in the Australian Capital Territory through a definition whereby “step-child” in relation to a person means a person in relation to whom that person stands in loco parentis (Crimes Act 1900 s 92 L(7), inserted by the Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance (No 5) 1985). Where the legislature has not gone, this Court should not venture 
      
       
        
       
     57    There is, in my opinion, good reason why, in the absence of specific legislative attention, the ordinary meanings of “step-father” and “step-daughter” should not be expanded by treating a de facto relationship between the offender and the wife of the child as sufficient for a step-relationship. Even without additional regard to the roles of the offender and the child, or the roles of the offender and the mother of the child plus the existence of authority and control, as the grounds of appeal suggest, a de facto relationship is an uncertain state.  
      
       
        
       
     58    In R v Brown (CCA, 9 December 1998, unreported) this Court declined to extend a wife’s immunity from prosecution as an accessory after the fact to her husband’s felony to a de facto wife and the offence of misprision of felony. Relevantly to the present question, the reasons of Hulme J, with whom McInerney and Barr JJ agreed, referred to suggested bases for a wife’s immunity, and continued (the apparent corruption after “ … but one difference” is in the original) - 
      
       
        
         
          
           
          “But whatever the explanation be, the immunity has arisen out of a relationship with attributes significantly different from and additional to those necessarily involved in a de facto relationship. It may be that for many a marriage does not turn out to be ‘a voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others’ -  
          Hyde v Hyde 
           (1866) LR 1 B & D 130 but for many it does and I suspect for virtually all that is the aim. On the other hand, the description ‘de facto relationship’ covers a myriad situations and commonly involves no commitment beyond convenience. Even in those areas where the law has granted recognition to such a relationship and rights arising out of it, commonly those rights are circumscribed or attended with further conditions. Thus, by virtue of s 17 an application under s 14 of the De Facto Relationships Act can only be made where the relationship has existed for at least two years, or in a limited range of other situations. Where the Evidence Act enables de facto spouses (and married persons) to object to giving evidence, it requires the court to take into account the nature of the relationship involved and the nature and extent of the harm that would be caused if evidence were compelled. We were referred by counsel for the appellant during the course of argument to a book ‘Husband and Wife’ by John Fraser Queen, (1905 edition). It was pointed out that the English common law recognises marriages effected merely by the consent of the parties thereto without any attendant religious service. However, accepting that that is so, the publication makes it clear that such a marriage still was a radically different institution to that encompassed by the term ‘de facto relationship’. I mention but one difference. relationship so created was so significantly different that I see no ground for regarding a de facto relationship as conferring the immunity claimed. While I accept that for some a de facto relationship may involve the same degree of permanence, commitment, support, and most of the other attributes of marriage, such a wide range of relationships is covered by that expression that I can see no justification for departing from one of the essential conditions of the existence of the immunity and extending it to the myriad circumstances embraced by the term ‘de facto relationship’; and this whether the expression is understood as defined in, for example, the Evidence or Defacto Relationships Acts or otherwise.” 
          
         
        
        
         
          
         
        
       
     59    These remarks were in a different context, in which the formality of marriage was relevant to the relationship between the husband and the wife, whereas in the present case it is the relationship between the offender and the child which is in question. Nonetheless they are a reminder of valid concerns in making a de facto relationship the source of criminal liability. The short-lived association between the appellant and the mother of the child in the present case, albeit arriving at a brief marriage, illustrates the uncertainty of the state. 
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
     60    In R v G (1997) 91 A Crim R 590 it was held that “guardian” in the then s 190 of the Criminal Code, under which it was an offence for any person “who, being a guardian, employer, teacher, or school-master of any girl or woman under the age of 17 years” to have carnal knowledge of the girl or woman, referred to a legal guardian, that is, to one who was a guardian at common law or was validly appointed as such by will, deed, or court order, and that a step-father was not a guardian.  
      
       
        
       
     61    Franklyn J, with whom Walsh J agreed, referred (at 597-8) to the need for “guardian” to have a clear and unambiguous meaning, free of variables and inconsistencies to which his Honour had earlier referred. The common law meaning was known, and in the absence of a definition in the Criminal Code was to be applied. His Honour said (at 599) that the law did not recognise as a guardian a person who merely assumed a responsibility for the care and protection of an infant, and that it was essential that the identity of a guardian and the fact of his or her guardianship be ascertainable by established principles. The stepfather was not a guardian according to those principles.  
      
       
        
       
     62    The reasons of Kennedy J were to similar effect, and his Honour noted (at 592) the general rule that where terms which have acquired a legal meaning are used in a statute, the legislature intended to use them with that meaning unless a contrary intention clearly appeared from the context. 
      
       
        
         
        The result 
         
        
       
     63    In my opinion, a de facto relationship between the offender and the wife of the child does not give rise to the relationship of step-father and step-daughter between the offender and the child for the purposes of s 73 of the Act; nor should the meanings of “step-father” and “step-daughter” put forward in the grounds of appeal be accepted. 
      
       
        
       
     64    The appellant’s plea of guilty was not available, and Freeman DCJ was correct to grant leave to withdraw the acceptance of the plea. The appeal should be dismissed.

      REGINA v. ALLAN BAKER 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      (Application under s.13A of the Sentencing Act 1989) 
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: By application dated 22 July 1997, filed in this court on 1 August 1997, Allan Baker, seeks, pursuant to s.13A of the Sentencing Act 1989, an order determining a minimum term and an additional term for the life sentences imposed upon him in this court on 20 June 1974 following his convictions for murder and conspiracy to murder. 
    2   The applicant submits that, in the light of, in particular, his exemplary conduct for many years in gaol and reports holding out strong prospects for his rehabilitation, he should be afforded a minimum term or non-parole period on his life sentence to enable a possibility of release at some time in the future. He points to the re-determination of the sentence of his co-offender by McInerney, J. (in the application of Kevin Garry Crump (unreported 24 April 1997)) and submits that he should be afforded parity of treatment. 
    3   The Crown, however, submits by reason of particular provisions of s.13A, that he is not eligible to make the application in that the court would not be satisfied that special reasons exist that justify making such a determination; that the application should be declined; and the court should direct that he never re-apply under the section. 
    4   There was produced to me and marked for identification, a statement which was described as a victim's impact statement. As I indicated during the hearing I would do, I have treated it as is required by the principles set out in Regina v. Previtera (1997) 94 A. Crim. R. 76. 
     
      
     The original sentences 
      
    5   The applicant had been charged together with Kevin Gary Crump that he had murdered Ian James Lamb on 3 November 1973 near Narrabri. He was further charged that he had conspired with Crump on 7 November 1973 near Collarenebri and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales to murder Virginia Gai Morse. 
    6   In addition to those two matters, both he and Crump had been convicted at that trial of malicious wounding a police officer with intent to prevent their lawful apprehension and, with a similar intent, maliciously shooting at two other police officers. 
    7   The applicant and his co-accused were convicted of all the charged offences after having been found guilty by a jury following an eight day trial. They were both sentenced as follows. First count - life imprisonment; second count - life imprisonment; third count - 15 years hard labour to date from 15 November 1973; fourth count - 15 years hard labour to date from 15 November 1973. No non-parole period was specified. 
    8   Although the sentences were dated to commence from 15 November 1973, it is apparent from the charge sheets that the offenders were apprehended on the afternoon of 13 November 1973, initially charged by police on 17 November 1973 and remanded in custody on 19 November 1973 by the magistrate at Maitland. 
    9   The applicant was born on 16 January 1948 and, as at the date of sentence, had the following criminal record.

    10   Entry number five included an offence in which the applicant obtained an unlicensed pistol and fired it at a police officer who was endeavouring to arrest him. There were, in addition to the offences charged on indictment, on that occasion three matters contained in a Schedule taken into account by the learned Chairman of Quarter Sessions, his Honour Judge Prior. One of those matters related to the theft of a rifle and some 100 rounds of ammunition. 
    11   It can be seen from the applicant's record that he has spent the greater part of his life from the age of 12 in custody or under supervision. He was 26 years old when sentenced to life imprisonment. He is now 53 years of age. He has now been in custody serving the sentences then imposed for nearly 27 years. 
    12   The present maximum sentence of imprisonment prescribed by the law for the crime of conspiracy of murder is 25 years. The trial judge did not stipulate when the sentence he imposed for that offence, or the other life sentence, was to commence. Section 441A of the Crimes Act 1900, which was inserted in 1955 and which was in effect at the time of sentence, provided that a sentence shall take effect from the time when it was passed unless the court otherwise directs. The sentences were concurrent. The applicant has therefore served the whole of the sentences imposed on the shooting counts and has served a period in excess of the period currently prescribed as the maximum for the offence of conspiracy to murder, given that the effect of the trial judge's sentences was that each sentence would commence on the day of imposition. Absent any other considerations, that is a matter which might be crucial to the re-determination of the life sentences. 
    13   Indeed, in argument, the Crown declined to submit that in the event the sentences were to be re-determined, I should act otherwise than McInerney, J. did, in the case of the co-offender, and re-determine the sentence for conspiracy to murder to the presently applicable maximum. However, it was also submitted that if I were to decline to re-determine the sentence for the murder, there would be little point, even if it were open to me to do so, to re-determine the sentence for the conspiracy to murder. I do not understand the applicant to submit to the contrary. It was accepted by the Crown in their submissions that it was not open to me to give a direction the applicant not re-apply in respect of the sentence for conspiracy to murder. It was submitted that I should re-determine the sentence for the conspiracy to murder to 25 years and the sentence for the murder to an additional term of a life sentence with a minimum term or non-parole period which would permit some prospect the authorities might allow the applicant liberty some time. 
    14   The Crown contends that not only should there be no re-determination but argues that the murder was a most serious case of murder and it is in the public interest that a direction that the applicant never re-apply be made, although the Crown accepts that that killing, viewed in isolation of the other offences, cannot be so categorised, although it does submit that, in the context of the other offences, it should properly be categorised in that way. 
    15   At the time at which the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment, that sentence was mandatory for the crime of murder and the maximum sentence for the crime of conspiracy to murder. 
     
      
     The views of the trial judge 
      
    16   When the jury returned with their verdicts of guilty on 20 June 1974, his Honour immediately sentenced each accused on the count of murder to life imprisonment. He then invited counsel for the applicant to address him in relation to the sentences on the remaining counts. The sequence of those events is of some significance as will be seen. 
    17   The applicant's antecedents were put before his Honour. Then, after hearing addresses, his Honour passed sentence on the remaining convictions. He noted that, although the appellants had not been charged with the murder of Virginia Gai Morse, he was of the view that he was entitled to take into consideration that the agreement to murder her was carried into effect and carried into effect by them abducting her, they having waited until her menfolk had gone from the homestead, which was in the north-west part of the State and until the children had gone to school. He found they had seized her, the present applicant being armed with a loaded rifle, bound, gagged and abducted her from her home by force. 
    18   His Honour found that their intention was to kill her in due course but, first, to use her to gratify their lust. He found she had been raped on at least two occasions and that she had been bound with ropes and driven hundreds of miles, bound and gagged in the car. After pleading for her life, she was raped again and then shot by the applicant's co-accused. 
    19   His Honour adverted to conduct by this present applicant in relation to the woman's body that was excluded from evidence at the trial. I need not detail that conduct. 
    20   His Honour made specific reference to the present applicant having worked for the deceased's husband and having lived on the property. He noted there was no animosity or reason for it between the applicant and the deceased's husband. He said:- 
     
      
       
       ""For sheer cruelty, for callous indifference to suffering, for a complete disregard of humanity, for the complete absence of a spark of human decency, what you have done to this woman and to her children and to her husband is without parallel in my experience, and I have sat here many times over the years. You have outraged all accepted standards of the behaviour of men. The description 'men' ill becomes you. You would be more aptly described as animals, and obscene animals at that."" 
       
      
    21   His Honour referred shortly to the circumstances of the murder charge and described the killing of Mr. Lamb for $20, the petrol in his car, his clothes and his ""pitifully poor"" possessions. He referred to the act of this applicant in shooting a man he did not know at point blank range as he was roused from his sleep. 
    22   Concluding that the conspiracy to murder was one of the worst cases, his Honour imposed on that count a sentence of life imprisonment and passed the other sentences to which I have referred. 
    23   His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
       ""I believe that you should spend the rest of your lives in gaol and there you should die. 
       
      
      
       
       If ever there was a case where life imprisonment should mean what it says - the imprisonment for the whole of your lives - this is it. 
       
      
      
       
       If, in the future, some application is made that you be released on the grounds of clemency or of mercy, then I would venture to suggest to those who are entrusted with the task of determining whether you are entitled to it or not, that the measure of your entitlement to either should be the clemency and mercy you extended to this woman when she begged you for her life."" 
       
      
    24   In addition, his Honour gave as his reason for not fixing a non-parole period:- 
     
      
       
       ""My reasons are what I have earlier said and because of the sentences I have already imposed."" 
       
      
    25   The reference there seems to be to the two life sentences which could not, under the then law or now, except on a re-determination like this, attract a non-parole period (but see Regina v. Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469). 
     
      
     The recommendation the applicant never be released 
      
    26   Before me in argument on this application, it was accepted that his Honour made a recommendation that the applicant and his co-accused never be released, when, in giving his reasons, he said:- 
     
      
       
       ""If ever there was a case where life imprisonment should mean what it says - imprisonment for the whole of your lives - this is it."" 
       
      
    27   Whether that recommendation was made in respect of both of the charges upon which the life sentence had been passed or merely in respect of the charge of conspiracy to murder, is a matter to which I will return. However, I note that in his Honour's remarks on sentence, before passing sentence on the conspiracy to murder and shooting offences, when discussing the killing of Lamb, his Honour referred to his having already passed sentence of imprisonment for life on the applicant and his co-accused for that crime. 
     
      
     Prior applications 
      
    28   In 1990, the present applicant sought a re-determination of his life sentences following on the change to sentencing law in New South Wales effected by the passing of the Sentencing Act 1989. I will later refer to the relevant provisions of that statute and the changes in the statutory regime effected by various amendments. The application came before Sully, J. who declined to set a minimum and additional term. An appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed on 23 May 1994. 
    29   The co-offender made an application for re-determination on 5 March 1990. That application was refused by Loveday, J. on 10 December 1992. An appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed on 30 May 1994. Special leave to appeal against that decision was refused by the High Court on 11 May 1995. 
    30   A second application, however, by that offender was granted by McInerney, J. on 24 April 1997. His Honour re-determined the sentences. 
     
      
     The facts of the offences 
      
    31   The trial judge did not refer to the facts other than broadly, as I have already indicated. In the various later judgments there appear recitals of the facts of the crimes committed by the applicant and his co-offender. It is, however, not necessary to compare those recitals, since the present application has gone forward on the basis of a statement of facts filed by the Solicitor for Public Prosecutions in accordance with Practice Note 57. Except in limited respects, there has been no demurrer to the outline of the facts as set forth in that document. It is convenient to set those facts out here:- 
     
      
       
       ""The applicant and his co-offender, Kevin Garry Crump, had known each other for a couple of years prior to the offences in November 1973. 
       
      
      
       
       In October 1972, the applicant spent three weeks doing casual work on the property of Brian Morse at 'Banarway' near Collarenebri. During this period he was brought meals by Mrs. Virginia Morse and got to know the three Morse children. 
       
      
      
       
       On 26 September 1973, the applicant commenced employment as a casual tractor driver at 'Fairfield' Station , Boggabilla. He set up camp on the station property. 
       
      
      
       
       On 26 October 1973, Crump stole a high powered motor vehicle, the property of Philip McBride from Aberdare in the Hunter District, an area where he had lived for a number of years. 
       
      
      
       
       On 28 October 1973, Crump joined the applicant in employment at Fairfield Station and set up camp with him. 
       
      
      
       
       The employment of both men ceased temporarily on 2 November 1973 as wet weather prevented them from carrying out their operations as casual tractor drivers. 
       
      
      
       
       On 3 November 1973, the applicant, accompanied by Crump, purchased a Mauser .308 rifle at Goondiwindi in Queensland just across the border from Boggabilla. 
       
      
      
       
       On 7 November 1973 at 1.30 pm, the body of Ian James Lamb was found in his motor vehicle on the Bald Hill Road near Narrabri. A post-mortem examination carried out on 8 November 1973 disclosed the cause of death to be a bullet wound to the neck just below the jaw line which had shattered the first, second and third cervical vertebrae and severed the spinal chord. 
       
      
      
       
       At about 10.30 am on 7 November 1973, Mr. Morse set off in his truck from his 'Banarway' homestead leaving Mrs. Virginia Morse alone on the property. When Mr. Morse returned at about 7.00 pm, he found his wife to be missing. An examination of the homestead revealed that certain items, including two rifles had been stolen. 
       
      
      
       
       On 9 November 1973, both the applicant and Crump resumed work at 'Fairfield' Station. 
       
      
      
       
       On 13 November 1973, after a member of the public informed Maitland Police that he had observed the car which had been stolen from Aberdare on 26 October 1973, in the area, police located the car and set out in pursuit. 
       
      
      
       
       Three separate police cars took part in the chase which started at Maitland at about 11.00 am and finished up to Woodville some three hours later where the chase was continued on foot. The police vehicle which were occupied by Constable Neale, Senior Constable Jones, Constable Millward, Senior Constable Snedden and Constable Hore each came within close proximity of the stolen car driven by Crump with the applicant as his passenger at various stages of the pursuit. 
       
      
      
       
       Constable Neale's vehicle was side swiped by the fugitives' car and was forced off the road before resuming the case. There were a few exchanges of shots between Constable Jones in the police vehicle driven by Constable Millward and the applicant. During the last exchange of shots in Maitland a bullet from the applicant's rifle shattered the windscreen of the police vehicle and struck Constable Millward in the head. He was treated at Maitland Hospital for a gunshot wound to the head and discharged some six days later. 
       
      
      
       
       The Snedden/Hore police car was fired at by the applicant on two occasions, one of the bullets striking the vehicle. 
       
      
      
       
       The stolen car came to a stop in a lucerne paddock in the Woodville area with the Snedden/Hore police car still in close pursuit. Both the applicant and Crump alighted from their vehicle with each in possession of a rifle. Both fired at pursuing police before they were finally arrested, the applicant at 2.00 pm and Crump at 2.15. The rifles used by both men and ammunition were recovered at the scene of the arrests. 
       
      
      
       
       Both men were taken to Maitland Police Station where they took part in records of interview which contained full admissions in respect of all offences with which they were subsequently charged."" 
       
      
    32   The applicant had given four recorded interviews to the police as follows - 1.00 pm on 14 November 1973 regarding the murder of Ian Lamb; 3.10 pm on 14 November 1973 regarding the conspiracy to murder Virginia Morse; 9.15 am on 17 November 1973 regarding the conspiracy to murder Mrs. Morse; and 6.20 pm on 13 November 1973 regarding the s.33 offences. 
    33   A synopsis of the admissions follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""The applicant and Crump decided on their return from Goondiwindi on 3 November 1973 to hold up the driver of a car with a view to obtaining petrol and some money. The applicant remembered having earlier observed a car parked near a rest area on a Narrabri Road so they went there first and found the car still in that position. 
       
      
      
       
       The applicant took a loaded rifle over to the car and (after Crump had checked to see that the driver was alone in the vehicle) 'knocked on the door with my hands and said, ""Hey, you"". The bloke sat up and I pulled the trigger and shot him. It hit him in the voice box'. 
       
      
      
       
       The applicant then took about $20 out of the deceased's pocket before driving Mr. Lamb's car for some 16 or 17 miles. He and Crump then took certain other items from the car before departing. Both the applicant and Crump wore face masks during this incident. 
       
      
      
       
       On 7 November 1973, the applicant and Crump kept the Morse homestead under observation through binoculars. At about 10.30 am they saw Mr. Morse leave in his truck after having earlier taken his children down to catch the school bus. 
       
      
      
       
       Both offenders then went into the house, overpowered Mrs. Morse then bound and gagged her. They then ransacked the house, removing two rifles amongst other items before carrying Mrs. Morse to her husband's car and driving with her to where they had earlier secreted the car which had been stolen from Aberdare on 26 October 1973. 
       
      
      
       
       The two offenders then stole petrol from Mr. Morse's car which they transferred to the McBride vehicle before secreting Mr. Morse's car in the place which had earlier held the McBride car. 
       
      
      
       
       Both men then placed Mrs. Morse, bound, gagged and blindfolded into the stolen vehicle of McBride before driving away in a northerly direction with her. 
       
      
      
       
       At the first stop made by them they removed Mrs. Morse from the vehicle, took off her lower garments, extended and secured above her head her bound arms, separated and extended her legs and secured them apart with ropes and while she was so immobilised and incapable of resistance each in turn raped her. 
       
      
      
       
       Resuming the journey they crossed the Queensland border and stopped near the Patterson River where Mrs. Morse was again raped by both men. 
       
      
      
       
       The circumstances of Mrs. Morse's murder were described by the applicant in the following terms:- 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         'She wasn't tied to the tree, her hands were tied in front of her with handkerchiefs, she wasn't crying because I think she was beyond that, she'd been crying most of the time, she was gagged and blindfolded. I aimed at her with the .308 and Kevin had the .22 and it was going to be like a firing squad and Kevin pulled the trigger and she fell to the ground before I could pull the trigger of my gun. If he hadn't of shot her, I would because we both decided to kill her because we done those terrible things to her and she would have been able to identify me because I used to work for her husband and I know if she reported me we would be in a lot of trouble and she just had to be shot.' 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       The bullet struck Mrs. Morse between her eyes and the right hand side of her nose. 
       
      
      
       
       The applicant then stripped the deceased and both men concealed her naked body in a nearby stream before disposing of her clothing and other objects associated with her and the slaying. 
       
      
      
       
       It might be noted that in his record of interview, Crump stated, 'I didn't shoot her. Allan Baker did'. 
       
      
      
       
       However, on 16 November 1973, both men escorted by police went to near the intersection of the Goodar Road and the Leichhardt Development Road in Southern Queensland. There Crump pointed out to police where Mrs. Morse was shot and was asked, 'where were you when Mrs. Morse was shot?'. His response was, 'it's not going to make any difference, I shot her. I was standing behind that three there'. He then indicated a tree about nine feet east of the tree where Mrs. Morse had been sitting when she was shot. 
       
      
      
       
       Crump was then asked whether he had aimed for any particular portion of her body when he fired and he replied, 'yes, right here', indicating the inside portion of his right eye. 'Because Allan said, 'if I shot her there it would probably kill her straight out'. He added that Baker was with him and was aiming the other gun at Mrs. Morse. Both men then directed police to the spot from which Mrs. Morse's body was recovered. 
       
      
      
       
       In the record of interview of 13 November 1973, the applicant admitted being with Crump in the McBride vehicle during the police chase and firing 'about four shots' at the police car one of which hit a police officer. He stated that at one stage the men had changed positions and Crump had then fired at a pursuing police car while he drove. They then changed over again and the applicant had fired 'a couple more shots' at the yellow (police) car. 
       
      
      
       
       The applicant also admitted firing at police after he and Crump had alighted from their car. When the chase commenced he though the police were on to them about the job (a break and enter) they had done that morning. 
       
      
      
       
       At his trial, the applicant made the following unsworn statement:- 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         'Your Honour, gentlemen of the jury, I am not guilty of the charges of murder of conspiracy to murder. I did not mean to shoot the man in the car. The gun was a scare weapon. All I meant to do was tie the man up and rob him. When I went over to the car and knocked on the door I said, 'hey, you', and the guy in the car sat up suddenly and made a noise and I jumped backwards and the gun went off. I didn't know I had shot the man until Kevin Crump told me. I didn't know my finger had pulled the trigger. I had no reason to shoot the man, he did not know us. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         As I told the police, it was dark at the time and we had masks on. I never told them that I intended to shoot or kill the man in the car and I have never told that to anyone, because it is not true. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I know we are responsible for the death of Mrs. Morse. I cannot forget it, and I know I should be punished for that, but we didn't agree to kill her till the day she died. Even then, we didn't really agree to kill her. It is true that Kevin never wanted to shoot Mrs. Morse. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         When the police were questioning me about Mrs. Morse I felt so bad about it I just agreed to everything. That's all I can say.'"" 
         
        
       
      
    34   The limited exceptions to which I have referred are that the applicant had worked at Banarway Station, he contends for seven weeks not three weeks and that the rapes of Mrs. Morse occurred after the applicant and Crump had crossed the Queensland border. Other than in the unsworn statement and in those respects, there is no challenge to the accuracy of the above account of the applicant's actions, notwithstanding that account plainly admits the commission of further serious criminal offences other than those for which he was sentenced. 
     
      
     The former statutory provisions 
      
    35   The statutory provisions permitting an application of this kind have varied from time to time. The history of those provisions to that time is set out in the judgment of McInerney, J. of 24 April 1997. 
    36   Upon the coming into effect of the Sentencing Act 1989, that Act made provision for prisoners previously sentenced to imprisonment for life to make application for the sentence to be re-determined for a minimum term and an additional term pursuant to s.13A of that Act. That provision was in consequence of amendments (which have subsequently been themselves amended) to the Crimes Act 1900 having the effect that sentences of life imprisonment (and formerly penal servitude for life) were to be served for the whole of the offender's life without hope of release. I have discussed such sentences and the now relevant provisions in Regina v. Petrinovic [1999] NSWSC 1131. 
    37   The original form of s.13A(4) was:- 
     
      
       
       ""The Supreme Court may, on application duly made for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term for a sentence:- 
       
      
      
       
       (a) set both:- 
       
      
      
       
        (i) a minimum term of imprisonment that the person must serve for the offence for which the sentence was originally imposed; and 
       
      
      
       
        (ii) an additional term during which the person may be released on parole (being either an additional term for a specified period or for the remainder of the person's natural life); or 
       
      
      
       
       (b) decline to determine a minimum term and an additional term."" 
       
      
    38   Section 13A and the principles to be applied on a re-determination under that section as it then stood, have been considered in many cases and are considered in detail by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the judgment of Badgery-Parker, J. in Regina v. Cribb (CCA, unreported 4 November 1994). Those principles have been considered and applied to the first application by Sully, J. and the Court of Criminal Appeal in the light of the legislation as it then stood. 
     
      
     The decision on the first application 
      
    39   It is appropriate to consider the views taken by the courts of the gravity of these crimes in previous judgments, particularly for the purpose of ascertaining the objective seriousness of the crime in the context of the consideration of an application for re-determination made after previous applications, and with a view to considering how substantial might be the weight accorded to the views of the trial judge and whether those views should be adopted or given effect to. 
    40   Sully, J. had declined to determine a minimum and additional term. He had observed:- 
     
      
       
       ""The two crimes for which the applicant was so convicted and sentenced were as wicked as can be imagined."" 
       
      
    41   He described the facts of the crime. He said:- 
     
      
       
       ""That bare description does not begin to capture the true nature and extent of the horrors to which Mrs. Morse was subjected at the hands of the two offenders. The details have been canvassed publicly and on several occasions and they need not now be repeated in all their shocking detail. Suffice it to say, that what was done to Mrs. Morse is as terrible a tale of deliberate inhumanity as can be imagined, even in a society as plagued by violence and depravity as our own."" 
       
      
    42   The approach his Honour took consonant with that taken in other matters, bearing in mind the form of the statutory provision at that time, was first to look at the range of sentences properly available to the sentencing judge, had the sentencing judge been proceeding in accordance with the Sentencing Act 1989. That approach is consistent with the observations in Cribb (supra), Regina v. Purdey (1992) 65 A. Crim. R. 441 and The Queen v. Johnstone (Badgery-Parker, J., unreported 20 December 1992) concerning the carrying out of the function of the court under s.13A as it then stood. 
    43   His Honour was of the view that approaching the matter in that way, it was open to a sentencing judge, passing sentence for these crimes under the law as it stood after the amendments to the life sentence provisions including those of the Crimes Act 1900, in accordance with the truth in sentencing regime, to have passed sentences of penal servitude for life under which, at law, the applicant would never be released. 
    44   His Honour had regard to the report of the Serious Offenders' Review Board that was then before him. That report included in the summary to that report, reference to the applicant regretting his crimes, accepting his punishment and having an exemplary conduct and work record in custody. His Honour noted from other reports that the applicant had been, in recent years, a model prisoner, a good and constant worker who had made real efforts to improve his personal vocation and living skills; that he had reached such a level of self-awareness and self-discipline as to make it an acceptable prospect from the point of view of public safety, that he be considered for release back into the general community at some future determined time and that he had progressed through the prison system as far as he could while ever he is burdened with an indeterminate sentence. 
    45   He noted impressive evidence given on the applicant's behalf by Ms. Alysan Pender who observed:- 
     
      
       
       ""In the past 10 years I have known Mr. Baker, I have never been able to see any resemblance between the decent man I observe day to day in the gaol and the man who committed two well-documented murders. 
       
      
      
       
       I believe he is not a threat to society, but is wasting his time and our money in gaol. He has committed an offence, the memory of which will haunt him for the rest of his life, whether he is in gaol or out of gaol."" 
       
      
    46   His Honour noted that on Crump's appeal from the conviction and sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal, that court said that it agreed ""entirely"" with the comment of Taylor, J. that life imprisonment should mean, in the cases of the applicant and his co-offender, exactly what it says. His Honour reviewed the then current law of sentencing and in particular the requirement of a sentencing judge to give the requisite degree of attention to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively and the aims of punishment set out in the well-known passage quoted by Crockett, J. in The Queen v. Williscroft & Ors (1975) VR 292 at 300 from the comments made by Sir John Barry. 
    47   His Honour concluded that an appropriate approach to the application would be based on an:- 
     
      
       
       ""Understanding that the crimes here in question are so extreme that it can be accepted more readily than might be possible in a different type of case, that the 'general moral sense of the community' would accord precisely with the perception of Taylor, J., that the applicant's case is one, if ever there was a case, where life imprisonment should mean exactly what it says."" 
       
      
      
     The view of the Court of Criminal Appeal 
      
    48   That approach was described by Gleeson, CJ. in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Baker (unreported, 23 May 1994) with reference to the crimes:- 
     
      
       
       ""They were so heinous in their nature that, in his Honour's view, this is a case where life imprisonment should mean exactly what it says."" 
       
      
    49   The Chief Justice went on to observe that the same view had previously been expressed by other judges who had dealt with the case. His Honour was of the view he was unable to conclude Sully, J. erred in that respect. Smart, J. regarded the crimes as of the gravest kind requiring emphasis on the importance of protection of the public and deterrence. Notwithstanding the progress of the applicant to rehabilitation, his Honour was of the view that it was not appropriate to set a minimum term at that stage. Studdert, J., with whom the Chief Justice and Smart, J. agreed, reviewed all of the favourable material before Sully, J. and detected no error in his Honour's approach. 
     
      
     The decision of McInerney, J. 
      
    50   Section 13A was amended by the Sentencing (Life Sentences) Amendment Act 1993. By that amendment, subsections (8), (8A), (8B) and (8C) were inserted. Subsequently, the latter three subsections have been amended to alter the period referred to therein from two years to three years. By that amendment, provision was made to enable the court to direct that a person who made the application might, if the court declined to determine a minimum term and an additional term, be the subject of a direction never to re-apply to the court or not to re-apply for a specified period. Such a direction might only be given if:- 
     
      
       
       ""8C(a) the person was sentenced for the crime or murder; and 
       
      
      
       
       (b) it is a most serious case of murder and it is in the public interest that the determination be made."" 
       
      
    51   These provisions were considered by McInerney, J. in the light of the Second Reading Speech by the then Attorney-General, Mr. John P. Hannaford, on 9 November 1993. The Attorney-General referred, in that speech, to the recommendation that a prisoner never be released in this way:- 
     
      
       
       ""The judiciary have the discretion under the old system to recommend that a prisoner never be released, due to the gravity of the crime and the danger to the community. This was, however, a recommendation only and could be over-ridden by the old system of remissions and Executive early release on licence, abused by the former Labour Government. The truth in sentencing legislation now provides that offenders sentenced under the system must actually serve the term of imprisonment set by the judiciary. Life now means life"". 
       
      
    52   The Attorney referred to the Bill as conferring power on the court, in effect, to confirm the life sentence by barring future applications for the protection of the community. But he also said:- 
     
      
       
       ""The Government is conscious that these additional powers given to the Supreme Court should be reserved for only the most serious cases involving the crime of murder and where the public interest so demands. These criteria are specifically stated in the Bill. 
       
      
      
       
       In summary, the Bill reflects the Government's commitment to ensure that any decision can never release an old life prisoner will remain with the judiciary, where it properly resides, free of Executive interference. Those cases deserving life imprisonment under the old system will now truly receive life under the Act. Truth in sentencing will thereby be fully achieved in these cases."" 
       
      
    53   The amendment inserting the subsections replaced the previous recommendations to the Executive that an offender never be released, a recommendation of no binding legal effect, with a judicial direction there be no further application, which is made upon an application for re-determination and which does have final legal effect. That effect precludes the Executive from acting to release a prisoner if such a direction has been given, subject to the remaining prospects for pardon or the exercise of the royal prerogative, insofar as they are not excluded by the legislation. 
    54   McInerney, J., in considering the re-determination of the sentences of Crump, considered the effect of those amendments. He concluded that the amending provision did not apply to the crime of conspiracy to murder and noted that the Crimes Act 1900 had been amended to substitute a maximum sentence of imprisonment for conspiracy to murder of 25 years in lieu of the life sentence formerly provided. His Honour concluded, after examining the limited involvement of Crump in that crime, that Crump's involvement in the murder of Mr. Lamb was not such as to bring his offence within the worst case category and thus it was not, in his case, ""a most serious case of murder"" and ""such that it is in the public interest that the determination be made"", notwithstanding the Crown asserted an aggravation of his criminality arising from his involvement in the conspiracy to murder Mrs. Morse. His Honour sharply distinguished between the roles of the two offenders in the killing of Mr. Lamb. 
    55   His Honour acting under that legislative regime and, having regard to the particular circumstances of Crump, concluded that, even having regard to the multiple offences and the totality of criminality involved, he was not disposed to make an order that Crump not re-apply either in respect of the involvement in Mr. Lamb's murder or in respect of the conspiracy to murder Mrs. Morse. As to the first, on the basis that it did not fall within the statutory criteria, and as to the second, because it was not the offence of murder, to which crime only, the relevant statutory provisions applied. 
    56   His Honour was of the view that in those circumstances, he should exercise his discretion to set a minimum and additional term and to proceed to re-sentence in the way described by Badgery-Parker, J. in Cribb (supra), as was described by Hunt, J. in  Purdey (supra) and again by Badgery-Parker, J. in Johnstone (supra). 
    57   His Honour concluded, after examination of the legislation as it then stood and the facts referrable to Crump, that he should re-determine Crump's sentences and in lieu of the two life sentences, imposed a minimum term of penal servitude for 30 years commencing on 13 November 1973 and concluding 12 November 2003 for the murder of Mr. Lamb. He set an additional term for the remainder of Crump's natural life. For the conspiracy to murder Mrs. Morse, he sentenced Crump to the maximum sentence then available according to law of 25 years penal servitude commencing on 13 November 1973 and concluding on 12 November 1998. 
    58   There has been no appeal against his Honour's determination. One of the submissions advanced to justify a re-determination of the applicant's sentences is that he should receive parity of treatment with Crump. 
     
      
     The legislation applicable to the present application 
      
    59   The Crown submitted that the relevant legislation applicable to the consideration of the present application, notwithstanding the repeal of the Sentencing Act 1989 by reason of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was s.13A as it stood as amended in the Sentencing Act 1989 in 1997 when the application was made. 
    60   It was submitted that the application was made, prior to the commencement of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and is an application referred to in Clause 8(1) of Schedule 2A to the 1989 Act. That clause, as amended, provided that the amendments to s.13A of the Sentencing Act 1989, effected by the Sentencing Legislation Further Amendment Act 1997, No. 6, applied to applications made before the date on which the bill for the amending Act was introduced into Parliament (as well as in relation to applications made on or after that date) (subject to an exception not necessary to consider). That date was 8 May 1997. Thus, since the application was made on 22 July 1997, filed on 1 July 1997, the form of s.13A, as it was after the 1997 amendments, would be applicable. The result of those amendments was that the section under which this application must be dealt with was materially different in a number of respects from that applicable to the earlier application and to Crump's application. 
    61   The applicant did not submit that I should not follow the Crown submissions in this regard. 
    62   Section 13A, as applicable, provides:- 
     
      
       
       ""(1) In this section:- 
       
      
      
       
        'existing life sentence' means a sentence of imprisonment for life imposed before or after the commencement of this section, but does not include a sentence for the term of a person's natural life under s.19A of the Crimes Act 1900 or s.33A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 
       
      
      
       
        'non-release recommendation', in relation to a person serving an existing life sentence, means a recommendation or observation, or an expression of opinion, by the original sentencing court that (or to the effect that) the person should never be released from imprisonment. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) A person serving an existing life sentence may apply to the Supreme Court for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term for the sentence. 
       
      
      
       
       (3) A person is not eligible to make such an application unless the person has served:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) at least eight years of the sentence concerned, except where paragraph (b) applies, or 
       
      
      
       
        (b) at least 20 years of the sentence concerned, if the person was the subject of a non-release recommendation. 
       
      
      
       
       (3A) A person who is the subject of a non-release recommendation is not eligible for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term under this section, unless the Supreme Court, when consider the person's application under this section, is satisfied that special reasons exist that justify making the determination. 
       
      
      
       
       (4) The Supreme Court may, on application duly made for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term for a sentence:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) set both:- 
       
      
      
       
        (i) a minimum term of imprisonment that the person must serve for the offence for which the sentence was originally imposed; and 
       
      
      
       
        (ii) an additional term during which the person may be released on parole (being either an additional term for a specified period or for the remainder of the person's natural life); or 
       
      
      
       
        (b) decline to determine a minimum term and an additional term. 
       
      
      
       
       (4A) In considering such an application, the Supreme Court is to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the offence for which the life sentence was imposed, and all offences, wherever committed, of which the person has been convicted at any time (so far as this information is reasonably available to the Supreme Court). 
       
      
      
       
       (5) A minimum term set under this section is to commence on the date on which the original sentence commenced or, if the person was remanded in custody for the offence, the date on which the first such remand commenced. 
       
      
      
       
       (6) If the Supreme Court sets a minimum term and an additional term under this section, the sentence comprising those terms replaces the original sentence of imprisonment for life. 
       
      
      
       
       (7) A minimum term and an additional term set under this section are to be taken to have been set under this Part but are not required to comply with the other provisions of this Part. 
       
      
      
       
       (8) If the Supreme Court declines to determine a minimum term and an additional term, the court may (when making that decision) direct that the person who made the application:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) never re-apply to the court under this section; or 
       
      
      
       
        (b) not re-apply to the court under this section for a specified period. 
       
      
      
       
       (8A) If the court gives a direction under subsection (8) that a person may never re-apply to the court under this section, the person is to serve the existing life sentence for the term of the person's natural life. 
       
      
      
       
       (8B) If the court does not give a direction under subsection (8), the person may not re-apply within the period of three years from the date of the court's decision to decline to determine a minimum term and an additional term. 
       
      
      
       
       (8C) A direction under subsection (8) that a person may never re-apply to the court under this section or not re-apply for a period exceeding three years may be given only if:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) the person was sentenced for the crime of murder; and 
       
      
      
       
        (b) it is a most serious case of murder and it is in the public interest that the determination be made. 
       
      
      
       
       (9) The Supreme Court, in exercising its functions under this section, is to have regard to:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) the knowledge of the original sentencing court that a person sentenced to imprisonment for life was eligible to be released on licence under s.463 of the Crimes Act 1900 and of the practice relating the issue of such licences; and 
       
      
      
       
        (b) any report on the person made by the Review Council and any other relevant reports prepared after sentence (including, for example, reports on the person's rehabilitation), being in either case reports made available to the Supreme Court; and 
       
      
      
       
        (c) the need to preserve the safety of the community, and 
       
      
      
       
        (d) the age of the person (at the time the person committed the offence and also at the time the Supreme Court deals with the application), 
       
      
      
       
        and may have regard to any other relevant matter. 
       
      
      
       
       (10) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to reports referred to in subsection (9), including provisions relating to the matters to be dealt with in reports and the making of reports available to the Supreme Court. 
       
      
      
       
       (10A) The Supreme Court, in exercising its functions under this section:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) must have regard to and give substantial weight to any relevant recommendations, observations and comments made by the original sentencing court when imposing the sentence concerned, and 
       
      
      
       
        (b) must give consideration to adopting or giving effect to their substance and the intention of the original sentencing court when making them, and 
       
      
      
       
        (c) must, to the extent that it declines to adopt or give effect to those matters, state its reasons for doing so. 
       
      
      
       
       (11) The Supreme Court may make a determination for a minimum term and an additional term for a sentence even though the court was not the sentencing court, or the court is not constituted in the same way as it was when the applicant was sentenced.  
       
      
      
       
       (12) An appeal lies to the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) the determination of a minimum term and an additional term under this section; or 
       
      
      
       
        (b) a decision to decline to make such a determination; or 
       
      
      
       
        (c) a direction that a person my never re-apply for such a determination or not re-apply for a period exceeding three years. 
       
      
      
       
        The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 applies to such an appeal in the same way as it applies to an appeal against a sentence. 
       
      
      
       
       (13) The reference in subsection (4A) to an offence of which a person has been convicted:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) includes:- 
       
      
      
       
        (i) a finding that an offence has been proved without proceeding to a conviction against the person, or 
       
      
      
       
        (ii) any offence taken into account when sentence was passed against the person, but 
       
      
      
       
        (b) does not include:- 
       
      
      
       
        (i) an offence that has been quashed or set aside within the meaning of Part 4 of the Criminal Records Act 1991, or 
       
      
      
       
        (ii) an offence of a class or description prescribed by the regulations for the purpose of this paragraph."" 
       
      
    63   The word ""determination"" in subsection (8C)(b) has been held to refer to the direction never to re-apply, rather than the determination of the application: see Regina v. Kalajzich (1997) 94 A. Crim. R. 41 at 47.  
     
      
     Present features of s.13A 
      
    64   Importantly, the section in this form differs markedly from that which applied when Sully, J. considered the first application. It also differs from that which applied when McInerney, J. came to consider the application of the co-offender. It is no longer enough to treat the consideration of the application as a fresh sentencing exercise with the benefit of the knowledge of what has transpired since the sentence was imposed and, hence, with the benefit of a more advantageous predictive position, as the authorities I have referred to had held was the approach formerly to be taken. 
    65   The person serving the life sentence, if subject to a non-release recommendation, is not eligible to make application unless, at least, 20 years have been served (subsection (3)(b)) and the court is satisfied that special reasons exist that justify making that application (subsection (3A)). The power in the court to re-determine sentence is predicated, where there is a non-release recommendation in relation to a person serving an existing life sentence, on those matters being made out when the court is considering the application. It is only on an application duly made that the court may consider determining the sentence. In considering the application, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the offence for which the life sentence was imposed and to the other offences of which the person has been convicted. Thus, the court is to take those matters into account when considering what, if any, reasons for a determination exist and whether they have such a special character as would justify making the determination. It is, therefore, necessary to consider the other offences for which the applicant was sentenced and their circumstances when considering the determination of either or both of the life sentences. 
    66   In addition, subsection (9) and subsection (10A) require that the court have regard, as is in each subsection set out, to the matters referred to therein. Subsection (10A) requires that the court, in exercising its function, have regard to the relevant recommendations, observations and comments made when the sentence concerned was imposed and requires that the court must give consideration to adopting or giving effect to their substance and intent. In addition, the legislature places such importance on the relevant recommendations, observations and comments of the trial judge, that the court is directed that it must, to the extent that it declines to adopt or give effect to them, state in writing its reasons for so doing. 
    67   It is apparent that both when having regard to whether a non-release recommendation has been made and when considering the person's application to ascertain whether it is satisfied that special reasons exist that justify making the determination, the court is exercising a function. Subsections (9) and (10A) must be taken into account when the court is exercising a function. Consequently, the matters referred to by those subsections must be considered, not only when considering whether a non-release recommendation has been made, but also, upon considering a re-determination as well as when considering whether a direction never to apply should be given. Thus, the court must consider the non-release recommendation and the observations or expressions of opinion of the trial judge and the trial judge's comments as well as all the surrounding circumstances and the matters referred to in subsection (9). But it is required to give substantial weight to the recommendations, observations and comments referred to in subsection (10A). 
    68   It would seem that the special reasons justifying the making of the determination must be such as would warrant not applying a non-release recommendation and accompanying comments that the offender is never to be released. In this case, bearing in mind those recommendations, observations and comments of the trial judge I have set out, the surrounding circumstances and other offences, to justify the determination, the reasons would have to be so powerful and, thus, special that it is not necessary for me to further consider the precise ambit of that term ""special"" in this context. I cannot envisage reasons that could have such an effect which would not, in this context, be special. 
    69   It, therefore, becomes most important to determine in the light of what was said by way of recommendation, observation or comment by the trial judge, whether it was said in respect of both life sentences and, given that the applicant has served in excess of 20 years of the life sentences passed upon him, to identify what matters are said to amount to the special reasons which it is submitted justify making the determination. 
    70   As I have said, it is necessary that on the consideration regard will be paid to the surrounding circumstances and the other offences of which the applicant was convicted, although it will not to offences of which the applicant has not been convicted. Importantly, in order to consider the significance of what had been said by the trial judge and its contents and, in particular, in respect to the offence against Mrs. Morse, I may be assisted by the observations of Sully, J. and those in the judgments in the Court of Criminal Appeal that I have already set out concerning those matters. 
    71   It will also be necessary to have regard to the knowledge of the original sentencing court of the applicant's potential eligibility to be released on licence and the practice relating to the issue of such licences. Further, it is necessary to have regard to the reports provided, the need to preserve the safety of the community and the age of the person. I have already referred to the matter of age. 
    72   To the matter relating to the knowledge of the sentencing court, I apply the observations of McInerney, J. at pp.33-36. I see no reason to differ from his Honour's description of those matters. In respect of the other matters, regard will need to be paid to the evidence before me, including that of the applicant, to which I will turn shortly. 
    73   In the event that it is concluded that a person who is the subject of a non-release recommendation is not eligible for the re-determination by reason of the lack of satisfaction of the requisite special reasons as provided for by subsection (3A), a question may arise as to whether the court would decline to determine a minimum term and an additional term and, as a result, consider directing that the applicant never re-apply or not re-apply for a specified period in accordance with the power conferred by subsection (8). 
     
      
     Direction not to re-apply 
      
    74   McInerney, J. has held that a direction not to re-apply may only be given in respect of the life sentence for murder and that he was not satisfied, in the circumstances applicable to Crump, that the murder met the requirements posed by subsection (8C)(b). I agree with the first of those observations. However, this applicant stands in a very different position to Crump in respect of that killing. I have regard to the views of McInerney, J. and the views of Loveday, J. (in the application of Kevin Garry Crump (unreported 10 December 1992)) expressed on a previous application by Crump, as well as the views of Mahoney, JA. and Allen, J. in the Court of Criminal Appeal (Regina v. Crump (CCA, unreported 30 May 1994). Particularly I note McInerney, J's. examination of Crump's complicity and his observations which are equally applicable to this applicant that no reasonable expectation could have been justifiably held of release on licence. 
    75   I have concluded that the applicant's culpability is akin to that of Crump's on the conspiracy to murder. However, in the murder of Mr. Lamb, the applicant was not only the principal but appeared to commit a callous and casual act of homicide as though it were an almost instinctive response to a situation where he was minded to take the opportunity to obtain the property of the deceased he could easily and safely have obtained without killing. It was not even necessary for him to hide his identity, since both offenders were masked. McInerney, J. refers to Crumps' complicity at p.12-19 of his judgment. He refers to the comparative positions of the two offenders at p.22, where he refers to the views of other judges concerning the culpability of Baker:- 
     
      
       
       ""The only judge who has described the murder of Mr. Lamb as being in the worst case category is Sully, J. (in Baker's application) when he referred to Baker's involvement, an involvement, in my view, much more heinous than Crump's involvement, as I have stated earlier."" 
       
      
    76   At the time of Sully, J.'s decision, there was no power to direct the applicant never re-apply and, thus, never be released. Had Sully, J. had the power, it is evident he would have exercised it. 
    77   McInerney, J. rejected the Crown submission that the murder of Mr. Lamb fell into the worst case category by reason of the other offences, including the conspiracy to murder Mrs. Morse, on his construction of subsection (8C) as confining the basis for such an order to the murder. 
    78   Relevantly, to this aspect of consideration of the application, subsection (4A) provides that the court is to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the offence for which the life sentence was imposed and the other offences on consideration of the application. The application of subsection (8), however, only arises if the court, having considered the application, declines it. Thus the effect is that subsection (4A) apparently does not relate to the giving of a direction under subsection (8). Subsection (4A) is not introduced by the words which commence subsections (9) and (10A) and which extend to the court's exercise of any of its functions under the section. These latter words are apt, not only to consideration of the making of the determination, but also, to any function under the section including directing the person to never re-apply. It would therefore seem that, in the event the court declines to determine a minimum term and an additional term, it may, in discretion, having regard to the matters referred to in subsection (9) and giving substantial weight to relevant recommendations, observations and comments made by the original sentencing court, and having given consideration to adopting or giving effect to their substance and intent, (subsection (10A)) direct the applicant never re-apply. But it is only to do so if the sentence for the crime of murder involved a most serious case of murder and it is in the public interest the determination be made (subsection (8C)). 
    79   Although, as I have said, McInerney, J. construed subsection (8C) by restricting its application to the murder sentence alone and s.13A has subsequently been amended as I have set out, it does not appear to me that provision has been made to overturn the construction preferred by McInerney, J, notwithstanding the amendments that were made after his decision. On such an important matter so affecting the prospect of liberty, in the way in which, if applied, the subsection would, I would construe the provision so as not to apply more widely than the language strictly construed would require. 
    80   I do not see any reason not to follow his Honour's views in that regard. Consequently, it is only if I should come to the view that ""it is a most serious case of murder"" and ""it is in the public interest that the direction be made"" that the discretion to direct that the person who made the application never re-apply, should be exercised to that end. 
    81   Even having regard to the much more serious role of this applicant in the killing, but having, as I have, reviewed the great bulk of judgments in this court and in the Court of Criminal Appeal on re-determination and life sentences imposed since the ""life means life"" sentence was introduced, including the recent decision in Harris (supra), I do not consider that this offence of murder, considered apart from the other offences, was such an offence as met the criteria I referred to in Petrinovic (supra) or those required to be met here (if they are different). 
    82   Should I decline to determine the application for re-determination of the life sentence for murder, I therefore will not direct the applicant never re-apply.  
    83   In reaching this view, I have regard to and give substantial weight to the recommendations, observations and comments of the sentencing judge in relation to both offences, but I consider that the restriction on the court's power to direct an applicant never re-apply in subsection (8C) does mean that I am not required to adopt or give effect to their substance and intent, so far as they amount to a non-release recommendation, because there is in the instant case no compliance with the restriction. For that reason and those that I have earlier given for my decision not to give such a direction, I decline to adopt or give effect to what his Honour, the trial judge, said to that extent. 
    84   My not granting this application, however, may mean that the applicant would only practically be able to re-apply in changed circumstances so powerful, in effect, as to have that special character I have referred to as special reasons. I am of the view that it would remain open for circumstances to occur in the future of such a kind, although I am presently unable to predict what they might be and I should not seek to preclude an application based on them. 
    85   Since the parties accepted that either both sentences or neither should be re-determined, it is only necessary for me to consider further the particular application of the trial judge's statements to the re-determination of the conspiracy sentence, should I come to the conclusion that the life sentence for murder might be re-determined. 
     
      
     Non-release recommendation 
      
    86   Although it was conceded in the submissions of the applicant until a relatively late stage of the hearing of the matter, that the debate had proceeded upon the basis that there was a non-release recommendation relevantly made which had the consequence that subsections (3A) and (3)(b) applied, after I considered the sequence of the passing of the sentences, it was submitted that no such recommendation was made in relation to the life sentence for murder. It was submitted that the sentencing judge's observations, recommendations and comments were not made ""when imposing the sentence concerned"", ie., the life sentence for murder. It was accepted that, having regard to the definition of ""non-release recommendation"", the recommendation here was a recommendation or observation or an expression of opinion by the original sentencing court but it was said subsection (10A) was only applicable to those statements if made when imposing the sentence concerned and, that, what was said here was not a recommendation in relation to the existing life sentence for murder or, at least, much of what was said was not a recommendation in relation to that sentence, since it was submitted most of what was said and, the critical matter, did not relate to the life sentence of murder but to that for the conspiracy to murder. It was thus submitted there was only one non-release recommendation and it related to the conspiracy. It was submitted that his Honour's last remarks related only to that offence. 
    87   That argument would allow great importance to the reduced maximum for the conspiracy offence as warranting the re-determining the sentence for that offence. If successful, that argument would mean that subsection (3A) would not apply to the murder sentence, nor subsection (10A). However, subsection (4A) would. 
    88   In particular it was put that the sequence of events and the last paragraph of his Honour's observations which is it is said is necessarily referrable only to the offence committed against Mrs. Morse, supports that submission. 
    89   The Crown submissions point out that the definition of non-release recommendation would extend to such a recommendation made at any time and whether or not it is applicable to another crime as well as to the crime of murder. It is submitted that a non-release recommendation could relate to the sentences for both crimes and, here, it does. 
    90   Considering those other offences to the murder, for myself, and the circumstances surrounding them, even ignoring what other judges have said, but considering, also, the weight I must give to the circumstances of those offences, there is a question as to how much practical utility there is in the applicant's submission. I consider that the totality of the criminality of the offences, considered objectively, is such that the applicant has, absent the most powerful reasons, forfeited the right to ever walk free. Much weight is, however, put on the references in the section to the ""sentence concerned"" as pointing to a discrete consideration of matters relating to each sentence. The argument also turns on the severability of his Honour's remarks. 
    91   As I have said, the Crown submits that the recommendations here should properly be interpreted as applying to both of the counts for which life imprisonment was imposed, in part, because it appears at the end of a paragraph which deals with both counts in the learned trial judge's remarks and because the very nature of such a recommendation is that it should, if made, be made intending it to have the effect of preventing release under all sentences, not merely one sentence. 
    92   In essence, it is the Crown submission that one sentencing process occurred. I accept that submission. The record endorsed on the indictment suggests no such discrete consideration of the murder sentence from the sentencing exercise as has been submitted. Further, upon an examination of the proceedings before his Honour, it appears that his Honour passed the mandatory sentence but had not concluded what he wished to say. Before he added such recommendations, observations and comments as he was minded to add, he invited counsel for the prisoners to address him on the other sentences and the Crown Prosecutor sought that the prisoners' antecedents be given. The sentencing exercise had, at that point, not concluded. It would be artificial to divorce his Honour's remarks in their content from the life sentence for murder, particularly having regard to his observations concerning the facts underlying the killing of Mr. Lamb. 
    93   I do not see the legislation, in its use of the words ""sentence concerned"" and ""when imposing the sentence concerned"", to have drawn a line so narrowly as has been submitted on the applicant's behalf as not to have regard to what was said on the same occasion and plainly in reference to the subject matter of the murder sentence. 
    94   Although his Honour noted that he had already sentenced the prisoners to imprisonment for life on the charge of murder and before he passed to the imposition of the sentences on the charge of conspiracy to murder and thence to the sentences on the remaining charges, I do not understand his Honour to have been dealing with the charges in discrete compartments. It was one sentencing exercise. Indeed, his Honour was giving as his reasons for not fixing a non-parole period on the shooting offences his belief that the offenders should spend the rest of their lives in gaol and there die. Plainly, he, considering the prisoners' ages, was not talking only of the 15 year sentences at that point. His Honour then made that statement which the Crown categorises as the non-release recommendation. I would conclude that by using those words his Honour made a non-release recommendation and made it in respect of both of the sentences of life imprisonment he imposed and that what he said, with two exceptions, related to both life sentences. 
    95   His Honour's closing remarks in which he suggested that no clemency or mercy should be extended to the offenders should they seek it, were however made with specific reference to their treatment of Mrs. Morse when she begged for her life. His Honour suggested that, in the event of an application on grounds of clemency or mercy by the prisoners, they should not receive it. Those remarks do not appear to have been related to the life sentence imposed for murder. Nor do his Honour's remarks concerning the cruelty with which Mrs. Morse had been treated. 
    96   I would not regard them as attracting the operation of subsection (10A) on consideration of determining the life sentence for murder. 
     
      
     The special reasons 
      
    97   I consider that it is not enough that the reasons advanced be special in some general or abstract sense. They must be such as justify the making of the determination having regard to the applicable matters referred to in subsections (4A), (9) and (10A), so that the discretion reposing in the court to set a minimum term and an additional term, rather than to decline to determine those terms, might be exercised. Without such special reasons, the person is not eligible for such a determination and, hence, the opening words of subsection (4) which require the application to be duly made, are not satisfied. 
    98   The sufficiency of the reasons advanced here to meet the statutory description is to be ascertained with regard, in particular, to the circumstances of the offences and their gravity. Since this is a sentencing exercise, regard needs to be paid to all the offences (Regina v. Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610) and to whether a ""life means life"" sentence would ordinarily be called for for crimes like this (Harris (supra)). 
    99   Even on the appellant's submission, the appropriate head sentence remains that of life. The remaining question is, having regard to the matters referred to in those subsections to which I have referred whether there are special reasons which would justify fixing a minimum term such that subject to the appropriate determination by the Parole Board or other relevant authority, the applicant would not necessarily have to serve that sentence of imprisonment for the whole of his life, although it is possible he will so have to serve it. 
    100   It was submitted that the special reasons why there should be a re-determination to permit the imposition of a minimum term were:- 
     
      
     (1) Parity with the treatment of Crump. 
      
      
     (2) The almost 27 years the applicant has spent in custody and his youth at the time the offences were committed. 
      
      
     (3) The extent of his rehabilitation and the low risk of recidivism. 
      
      
     (4) That the crime of conspiracy to murder has had the applicable maximum sentence at law reduced to a maximum term of imprisonment of 25 years. 
      
      
     Parity with Crump 
      
    101   As will appear from what I have already said, the statutory regimes applicable to the consideration of the sentences of Crump and Baker from the point of view of their respective applications, are different. 
    102   Whatever effect might have had to be given by McInerney, J. to the recommendations of the trial judge, I am bound to proceed under the section as it is applicable to the consideration of this application and to my functions under the section. I have already referred to the factual differences. The applicant gave evidence before me of the circumstances of his killing of Mr. Lamb. He referred to obtaining the rifle for the purpose of robbing Mr. Lamb, that he got out of his vehicle and then loaded the rifle, yelled at Mr. Lamb and, when he sat up, the applicant pulled the trigger and shot him through the neck. He intended to kill Mr. Lamb, but he says he still doesn't know why. When he, later in evidence, asserted that he didn't mean to kill Mr. Lamb, however, I understood him to mean that he did not have that intent until determining to pull the trigger. He asserts that he had intended to take the loaded rifle to scare the victim. 
    103   For myself, I see no basis to compare the different factual situations such as would result in a favourable finding to the applicant on the basis of parity. In any event, the legislation requires that I treat his application differently to the way in which McInerney, J. was required to treat the application of Crump. It is not possible to adjust the result by reason of some analogy with the sentencing principles referred to in Regina v. Lowe (1984) 154 CLR 606 to provide for some outcome that the section would not otherwise permit to be achieved. 
    104   It is only if I should conclude that it is open to me under the section and appropriate by reason of some parity or fairness doctrine on the facts that a determination would be justified in this applicant's circumstances, because of what has occurred in respect of the co-offender, that I could regard that reason as special. Even taking that reason in combination with the other reasons, I do not regard it as having the necessary character. 
     
      
     Recidivism 
      
    105   As to the risk of recidivism, I was provided with statistics and the observations of the Australian Institute of Criminology in respect of homicides in Australia between 1992 and 1993, which became Exhibit 3 and the evidence of Dr. Lucas. It may be taken that the statistical risk of recidivism is very low and, for the reasons that I will give when discussing the question of rehabilitation, that the particular prospect of the applicant achieving rehabilitation such as to minimise danger to the community and personal recidivism, is very high but nonetheless, considering the culpability involved in the offences, and that in the light of the matters the section requires me to consider, I conclude that matter could at best be considered as context to the rehabilitation referred to. It is plainly not special in itself. 
    106   As to rehabilitation even in that context, the Court of Criminal Appeal in The Queen v. Garforth (unreported, 23 May 1994) concerning crimes so appalling and surrounding circumstances so grave as to parallel these, held:- 
     
      
       
       ""There are some cases where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met through the imposition of the maximum penalty."" 
       
      
    107   There, their Honours were referring to a sentence of life imprisonment, never to be released, in the context of the submission that, if there was some prospect of rehabilitation, that should mitigate against such a sentence being imposed. It is apparent their Honours were holding that in the cases to which they referred the prospect of rehabilitation had so little role to play compared with the community's interest in retribution and punishment that, notwithstanding that at some point in an offender's post-sentence career, the offender might be said to be fully rehabilitated and present no risk of recidivism, nonetheless such an offender should remain in custody until death. 
     
      
     Rehabilitation 
      
    108   The evidence as to rehabilitation prospects was not, to any real extent, challenged and was very powerful. 
    109   The evidence before me of Ms. Alysan Pender, which was not only in accord with the evidence she gave before Sully, J., but which went further to give unqualified support to the applicant's application, went so far as to suggest that within gaol, at least in recent years, the applicant's conduct has been absolutely exemplary, with no suggestion of any conduct as would pose a risk to the community. The applicant also has asserted in his evidence, his good behaviour in gaol, notwithstanding the onerous and sometimes provocative circumstances of his confinement and the restrictions and frustrations arising from his lack of progression within the system because of his indeterminate sentence. 
    110   He has asserted that he tried as best he could to behave as a peacemaker in the prison system even when assaulted. His evidence in this regard is corroborated by the official reports. He has given evidence he would wish to return to the community after a long time, a number of years, given that he is not fit to be released from prison, at present as he recognised he is institutionalised. 
    111   Dr. Lucas gave evidence in accord with various reports furnished by him that he was sure the applicant could adjust to being within the community if given a significant period of assistance, but that he has accepted his sentence uncomplainingly and has shown, for many years, a consistent attitude of remorse and insight. He said that if the applicant was given a good opportunity and proper management in prison and good planning for release, the applicant's prospects in the community were good and he did not present a significant threat to the community. He was of the view that Mr. Baker could go into the community without re-offending violently. He referred to Mr. Baker's aims to ""live quietly somewhere, pick up some old interests, grow vegetables, fish and largely mind his own business"". This would involve Mr. Baker being given the opportunity to be reclassified and properly prepared for release. 
    112   Christine Drayden-Thompson, who had known the present applicant for nine years as a forensic psychologist, and who had tested the applicant, gave evidence which accept entirely supported his contentions as to his exemplary behaviour within the prison system, his performance as an excellent worker, a counsellor and as a person who had achieved a great deal by way of rehabilitation such that his prospects of recidivism were very low. 
    113   The report of the Serious Offenders' Review Council, Exhibit C, which report includes the applicant's custodial history and reports on the incidence of that history throughout the entire period during which he has been detained, does not make, to me, any recommendation as to what appropriate course might be taken. It comments as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""In the event that the Supreme Court grants Baker's application for the re-determination of his indeterminate sentence, then the Serious Offenders Review Council will develop a plan for his management during the remainder of any minimum term imposed. If and when appropriate, Baker will be progressively reduced in security classification leading ultimately to his inclusion in unsupervised external leave programmes in preparation for his eventual return into the community. 
       
      
      
       
       In preparing and submitted this report, the Review Council has had regard to the matters to be considered under s.62AA of the Correctional Centres Act 1952."" 
       
      
    114   The effect of the material is such as to have shown that in recent years, at least, Baker's prison record confirms the views held of him by Ms. Pender, Dr. Lucas and Ms. Drayden-Thompson. 
    115   A supplementary report dated 17 August 1999 annexed reports dealing with the further management of the applicant and, in particular, reports from Ms. Pender and Ms. Drayden-Thompson, all of which were favourable on these aspects of rehabilitation and recidivism. The Council on that occasion commented:- 
     
      
       
       ""The Council re-iterates its comments made in its earlier report to the Supreme Court dated 14 April 1998. 
       
      
      
       
       Baker has continued to behave himself while in custody. He has endeavoured to use his time constructively and has demonstrated personal development throughout his period of incarceration. 
       
      
      
       
       In preparing and submitted this report, the Review Council has had regard to the matters to be considered under s.62AA of the Correctional Centres Act 1952."" 
       
      
    116   Additional material was provided by the Serious Offenders' Review Council comprising further reports from Ms. Pender, from a drug and alcohol worker, including Assessment Committee notes and a report from the a Manager of Industries at Grafton Correctional Centre, together with two minutes of Council meetings. 
    117   There is nothing in that material which would have any adverse effect on the application. 
    118   For the applicant, a notice of reply to the statement of facts and a supplementary notice were filed. With that notice was included valuable material comprising the reports of Dr. Lucas, Dr. W. John Taylor, Dr. William Barclay, Ms. Drayden-Thompson, references and achievement awards. The supplementary notice provided reports of 1999 from Ms. Pender, Dr. Lucas, Ms. Drayden-Thompson, Mr. Lancaster and Mr. Northey, the Manager, Centre Services and Employment. It also provided a transcript of Ms. Pender's evidence on the earlier re-determination application.  
    119   All of this material commands the acceptance of the applicant's senior counsel's submission that the applicant has become rehabilitated to the point that he is a very different man to that which he was when the offences were committed, and a better one. 
     
      
     Conclusion 
      
    120   It was submitted on the applicant's behalf:- 
     
      
       
       ""He was then a violent man who had himself been subjected to violence, an anti-social man, relatively young (25 years of age) with a poor record and a drinking problem: a classic 'loser'. He is now an insightful individual, who has been rehabilitated during 26.5 years of imprisonment, a peaceful man who contributes to society as best he is able, and a model worker and prisoner. To the extent he can, he has redeemed himself. 
       
      
      
       
       It would be a heartless community which insisted that such a man be kept in custody forever. To do that would discourage not just the individual, but others who have done extreme harm and then seek redemption. And it would give him no prospects, nothing to work towards, and would leave him stalled in the prison system. 
       
      
      
       
       Nothing Baker or (sic) the court can do will undo his crimes or their consequences. He has served a very long period of imprisonment, unusually he has benefited from it (in a manner and to an extent such that the Prisons Department can take pride in its work), and he should be allowed to live the last years of his life under supervision in the community. On the evidence, the attendant risks are extremely low. 
       
      
      
       
       Finally, it is acknowledged and stressed that nothing the court does will secure Baker's release. Rather, it will give rise to the prospect of that happening should the final arbiters see fit."" 
       
      
    121   These submissions were made in the context of the wider submission that:- 
     
      
       
       ""What must be done is to impose a sentence on Baker which is appropriate for the crimes he has committed, the court having regard to its knowledge of the man as he now is, as opposed to the man that he was, in November 1973."" 
       
      
    122   It may be accepted, in the light of all that material, that with proper management within the prisoner community prior to any release, the risk of future dangerousness or recidivism is very low. Indeed, the prospect of rehabilitation is very good. However, they are not the only matters to which I must give regard and, indeed, when one has regard to the statutory requirements in the context of the appalling nature of the applicant's crimes and their surrounding circumstances, I an unable, even taking into account that the offence of conspiracy to murder is now only punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment for 25 years, to conclude, considering all the reasons said to be special individually and together, that the special reasons criteria under the Act have been met. 
    123   Having regard to the appropriateness of the sentence that should be passed, now, on this applicant for the crimes he has committed even with the knowledge of the man he now is, applying to the consideration of this application the approach referred to in Cribb (supra) and the other authorities to which I have referred, but having regard to the statutory criteria as are applicable to an application commenced when this application was, I conclude that, notwithstanding the reasons asserted, the applicant is ineligible for the determination sought. 
    124   I see no basis upon which I should give a direction either under subsection (8)(a) or (b), even if I had power to, since I cannot envisage, at present, what special reasons may come to exist in the future, and when, they might arise and the applicant's rehabilitation is such that I would not make an order foreclosing consideration by another judge, some time in the future, of some such powerful exigency as might have the requisite character. 
    125   It is not clear to me that holding, as I have, that the applicant, by reason of failing to meet the requirements of subsection (3) is not eligible to make such an application, that I should decline to make a determination, since subsection (4) would only allow me to take that course on an application duly made for the determination. 
    126   I therefore declare that the applicant is not eligible to make the application.

        REGINA v RODNEY WARREN JACOBS (60248/99) 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
        
        
       
     1    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree with Badgery-Parker AJ. 
      
       
     2    BADGERY-PARKER AJ: On 8 February 1999 the applicant was indicted at Penrith District Court upon two charges laid under s 33B of the Crimes Act, of threatening injury with intent to prevent lawful apprehension. In respect of each matter the maximum penalty prescribed by the Act is imprisonment for twelve years. 
      
       
     3    On 16 October 1996, the applicant entered the Grace Bros store at Penrith; he was observed by security staff to place a number of items into a shopping bag. He left the store without attempting to pay and was approached by two members of the store security staff. They tried to arrest him for stealing, and a struggle followed, in the course of which the applicant, who was carrying a soft drink bottle, smashed the bottle on the ground and threatened the two men, with the broken bottle. A woman who was nearby attempted to assist the two men and the applicant struggled with her for a brief time before fleeing from the scene. When indicted the applicant pleaded guilty to both charges and was remanded for sentence on a date to be later fixed. 
      
       
     4    On 16 March1999 at Campbelltown District Court the applicant was indicted before his Honour Judge Keleman upon an indictment containing six counts, to which he pleaded not guilty. The trial of the applicant in respect of those matters then proceeded before the judge sitting without a jury. Following the luncheon adjournment that day, the accused was re-arraigned at his own request, and he then entered a plea of guilty to each of the six counts. All of the offences took place on 3 March 1997. There were two counts of theft of a car (counts 1 and 5), three counts of stealing from the person ( counts 2, 4 and 6) and one count of attempted stealing (count 3). Each of the three charges of stealing from the person carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment; each of the other charges carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. The facts were conveniently summarised by the sentencing judge as follows- 
      
       
        
         
         “ The first offence of steal from the person which is the second count in the indictment occurred at about 12.45p.m on 3 March 1997 when a twenty nine year old female was walking through the car park of a shopping centre at Kings Langley. A white Ford Falcon motor vehicle which had been stolen earlier that day moved along side the female. The prisoner who was the passenger in the vehicle leaned out of the window of the vehicle and pulled the female’s handbag which was over her right shoulder. After a short struggle the bag pulled away from the female and the vehicle moved out of the car park. The female’s handbag contained $100 in cash and other property which included a mobile phone and credit cards. 
         
        
        
         
         The charge of attempted steal which is the third count in the indictment occurred later that day at about 1.30 p.m. when the prisoner entered a newsagency at Schofields. He picked up a newspaper and went over to the cash register. The cash register was open and the prisoner attempted to remove money tray from the cash register. However, the newsagency employee held on to the power cord of the cash register preventing the removal of the money tray. The prisoner then left the shop and got into the front passenger seat of the white Ford Falcon vehicle that had been previously stolen and used in the earlier offence. The vehicle was then driven away by another male. 
          
          
         The second offence of steal from the person which is the fourth count of the indictment was committed later that day about 2.25 p.m when a thirty nine year old female was at her car outside a plaza at Thornleigh. She noticed the prisoner get out of the same white Ford Falcon vehicle. The prisoner attempted to take the female’s handbag which was in the boot of her car. She grabbed the prisoner and struggled with him while holding on to her bag. The driver of the vehicle pulled up next to the female who was struggling with the prisoner. The prisoner who was trying to pull the handbag away from the female got into the vehicle whilst still holding on to the handbag. The female let go of the handbag and the vehicle was driven away… 
          
          
         Between 2.30 p.m and 2.45 p.m on 3 March 1997 a burgundy Commodore vehicle was stolen from the Coles car park at Epping. The white Ford Falcon vehicle that had been used in the earlier offences was recovered from the same car park the following day. 
          
          
         The third offence of steal from the person which is the sixth count in the indictment was committed at about 2.45 p.m on 3 March 1997. A thirty six year old female had parked her car in a street in Carlingford near a fruit market. As the female began walking to the shop the prisoner came up behind her and grabbed her handbag. The female tried unsuccessfully to hold on to the handbag. The prisoner then got into the front passenger seat of the burgundy coloured Commodore that had been stolen earlier that afternoon from Coles car park at Epping and was driven away. Later that day between 5.30 p.m and 6.00p.m the prisoner was observed to get out from the driver’s seat of the same burgundy coloured Commodore which was recovered shortly after by police. 
          
          
         The first and fifth counts in the indictment, namely, charges of steal motor vehicle are based respectively on the prisoner’s presence in the stolen white Ford Falcon and the stolen burgundy commodore on 3 March 1997.” 
         
        
       
     5    At the time of both groups of offences- conveniently, but not entirely accurately- (which I may refer to as the Penrith offences and the Campbelltown ofences) the applicant was on parole for various offences of dishonesty, and for an earlier conviction in respect of the use of a weapon to prevent apprehension. In respect of those matters he had been sentenced in September 1994 to a minimum term of sixteen months and sixteen days commencing 22 September 1994 and expiring 6 February 1996, with an additional term thereafter of three years which was to expire on 6 February 1999. 
      
       
     6    Following his apprehension in respect of the Penrith offences the applicant was granted bail, and he was at conditional liberty pursuant to that bail at the time of the Campbelltown offences.  
      
       
     7     Following the termination of the trial in respect of the Campbelltown offences, arrangements were made for the Penrith offences also to be brought before Judge Keleman at Campbelltown, and he proceeded to sentence in respect of both groups. In sentencing for the Penrith matters, he was asked to take into account two matters on a schedule , namely the assault upon the courageous woman who had attempted to assist the security staff outside the Grace Bros store, and the offence of larceny relating to the goods stolen from the store. 
      
       
     8    The sentences imposed by Judge Keleman on 7 May 1999 were as follows :- 
      
       
        
       As to the Penrith indictments, in respect of each count ( and in respect of the first count taking into account the matters on the Form One )- A fixed term of imprisonment for eighteen months commencing 7 May 1999 and to expire on 6 November 2000.  
        
        
       As to the Campbelltown indictment- 
        
        
       First count (larceny of a motor vehicle) a fixed term of imprisonment for twelve months to commence on 7 November 2000 and to expire on 6 November 2001.  
        
        
        Second count (stealing from the person) a sentence of imprisonment for four and a half years to commence on 7 November 2000 and to expire on 6 May 2005. That sentence comprised a minimum term of two years which, commencing on 7 November 2000 would expire 6 November 2002, and an additional term thereafter of two and a half years. 
        
        
       Third count (attempted stealing) a fixed term of imprisonment for twelve months to commence on 7 November 2000 and to expire on 6 November 2001.  
        
        
        Fourth count (stealing from the person) a fixed term of imprisonment for two years commence on 7 November 2000 and to expire on 6 November 2002.  
        
        
        Fifth count (larceny of a motor vehicle) a fixed term of imprisonment for twelve months, to commence on 7 November 2000 and expire on 6 November 2001.  
        
        
        Sixth count (stealing from the person) a fixed term of two years imprisonment to commence 7 November 2000 and to expire 6 November 2002.  
        
       
     9     Effectively the applicant was subjected to a total sentence of six years commencing 7 May 1999 and expiring 6 May 2005, with a minimum term during which he must be detained in custody of three and a half years commencing 7 May 1999 and expiring 6 November 2002, and an additional term thereafter, during which he might be released on parole if the Parole Board should so order, commencing 7 November 2002 and expiring 6 May 2005. The 6 November 2002 was the earliest day upon which he might be eligible for release on parole. 
      
       
     10    At the date when the sentence was imposed, the applicant was in prison. I have noted previously that at the time of all of the offences he was on parole. That parole was revoked following his conviction ( upon his pleas of guilty on 16 March 1999) and he was returned into custody on 29 April 1999. The sentence that he was then required to serve will not expire until 19 August 2001. Hence the sentences imposed by Judge Keleman were, in respect of the period from 7 May 1999 to 19 August 2001, to be served concurrently with that balance of parole. Thus, the sentences imposed by Judge Keleman had the effect of increasing the applicant’s period in custody only by the period from 19 August 2001 to 6 November 2002, an increase in the applicant’s custody of less than fifteen months. 
      
       
     11    On the face of it, that represented the extension to the applicant of a quite exceptional degree of leniency, having regard to the objective circumstances of all of the offences, including in particular the circumstance that he was at the time of each group of offences at liberty only conditionally pursuant to parole orders or the grant of bail or both. 
      
       
     12    It is not surprising in those circumstances that the applicant’s legal advisers have at no time contended that the sentences imposed by his Honour were excessive, although in written submissions filed in August 2000 in anticipation of a hearing date of 9 August, the applicant’s counsel was bold enough to submit that the total sentence of six years was “ at the top of the range “. Be that as it may, it was not submitted that there was any error disclosed by his Honour’s remarks on sentence, and it was conceded that his Honour took into account the relevant sentencing principles and the applicant’s subjective case.  
      
       
     13    That subjective case included:· A close and supportive family environment . 
      
       
     · Three years of apprenticeship initially as an electrician and subsequently as a painter and decorator which regrettably came to end due to a recession in the building industry; subsequent casual work in the building and allied industries. 
      
       
     · From the age of sixteen years abuse of cannabis and, from about the age of twenty years, of heroin; but his use of both drugs ceased at the time of his imprisonment in 1994, and a pre-sentence report said that there were no indications of current drug problem. 
      
       
     · Heavy use of alcohol from about 1991, and a claim that at the time of the Penrith offences, he was affected by alcohol, but that since the commission of the Campbelltown offences he had abstained from the use of alcohol. 
      
       
     · The prisoner’s attribution of both his offences to a gambling problem, and his claim that he has not gambled since his release from jail in 1996. 
      
       
     · A psychological report describing him as highly anxious and depressed with pervasive feelings of low self-esteem, emotional insecurity and a deep reliance on others for support and nurture. The prisoner has sought assistance in dealing with these problems during his period in custody. 
      
       
     · A psychological opinion that the prisoner’s emotional state makes him vulnerable to the detrimental effects of incarceration and exposes him to be stood over by other inmates. 
      
       
     · The prisoner’s poor physical health. 
      
       
     14    In respect of the last matter the judge summarised the effect of the evidence before him as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          “ In April 1998 as a consequence of being hit by a motor vehicle he suffered multiple fractures to his lower right leg. The injury required surgery and post operative treatment. The fractures have still not properly healed and the prisoner requires ongoing care with the possibility of future operations including a bone graft. The prisoner suffers pain from his right leg and can only walk for short distances. He receives weekly physiotherapy and hydrotherapy sessions. He takes pain killers and Normison to help him sleep at night. He walks with an obvious limp and has limited mobility”. 
         
        
       
     15    The judge was properly conscious of the objective seriousness of the offences and the aggravating circumstance that he was on conditional liberty at the time, but gave a great deal of weight to the pleas of guilty and other indications of remorse; to the prospects of rehabilitation which emerge from the pre-sentence report; his vulnerability within the prison system and the probability that his term of imprisonment would be more onerous than would be the case with respect to other prisoners. The judge paid particular attention to the principle of totality and it is abundantly clear from the way in which the sentences were structured that his Honour gave a great deal of weight to that principle. 
      
       
     16    All of the foregoing would suggest that there is no justification for any intervention by this court - nor would there be, but for a substantial body of fresh evidence upon which the applicant seeks to rely. The Crown has not objected to the receipt of the fresh evidence, accepting that it was not available at the date of the original proceedings because it relates to medical investigation, carried out since and medical opinions, expressed on the basis of those later investigations but contends that the fresh evidence should not cause this court to interfere with the sentence.  
      
       
     17    The additional evidence having been admitted, it is in my view inevitable that we should accede to the application for leave to appeal and proceed to deal with the appeal on its merits. The additional medical evidence makes it clear that there is very real question for this court to consider as to whether the sentence imposed in the District Court should be allowed to stand or should be modified in some way.  
      
       
     18    The resolution of that question requires consideration of two separate bodies of authority and the relationship between them. 
      
       
     19    In Regina v Vachalec  (1981) 1 NSWLR 351 Street CJ (with whom Nagle CJ at CL and Lee J agreed) emphasised that the responsibility to provide appropriate medical care to prisoners rests with the Department of Corrective Services. Having first acknowledged that the hardship and deprivation which will always be caused by a sentence of imprisonment may be particularly aggravated by matters subjective to the prisoner, including in particular a state of ill health and a consequent need for medical treatment, the Chief Justice continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “This Court as the Court of Criminal Appeal functioning within its well-established jurisdictional boundaries is concerned, both in appeals against conviction and appeals against sentence, primarily to ascertain whether the decision of the first instance judge was in error and, if so, in what way it should be corrected. Normally error requires the evaluation of the material placed before the first instance court. There are, however, well-established bases upon which error in the first instance proceedings can be disclosed by fresh evidence or new evidence. In addition the Court’s jurisdiction is exercisable where it is shown that there has been a miscarriage of justice. But, as an Appeal Court, it is not its function, nor is it equipped, to fulfil a continuing supervisory role over the effect of imprisonment upon an individual. Such a matter involves essentially administrative considerations and remedial action involves essentially an exercise of administrative power that this Court does not possess. This Court exercises judicial power; it has no power or authority to give administrative directions regarding the treatment of prisoners. Nor has it power or authority by administrative order to change the character or concomitants of sentences or to bring about total or qualified release of persons in custody. That power and authority resides in the hands of the Executive Government. Administrative miscarriage in the working out of a sentence cannot be remedied by this court as it has no jurisdiction to enter the administrative field. There could, of course, be cases where significant administrative miscarriage was so plainly foreseeable at the time of sentence as to justify this Court finding error in the sentencing decision of the first instance court. Such cases will be rare, and the present is not among them. 
         
        
        
         
          
         The responsibility to provide adequate and proper medical treatment for prisoners rests squarely on the shoulders of the prison authorities…  
         
        
        
         
         The Corrective Services Department, as the Crown’s administrative body, has a clear obligation to ensure that adequate and proper medical and dental treatment is provided for persons in custody, equally as it has a clear obligation to provide food, clothing and shelter. These are basic human needs, and the government must ensure that they are available. As we pointed out in 
          R v Danhach 
          (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12th August 1977, unreported), a person deprived of his liberty is, in consequence, deprived of the ability to look after himself; this confers on him an entitlement to have his basic human needs met by the prison authorities.  
         
        
        
         
         The admissibility of the material upon which the appellant seeks to rely must be decided by the application of the established principles. The medical issue arose before Lincoln DCJ and was dealt with by him. There was evidence of the need for medical treatment and of the particular hardship which the appellant would undergo whilst imprisoned. This was evaluated by Lincoln DCJ in reaching his decision… If the appellant’s reasonable needs are not being met, and on this we state no opinion, then it is a matter for the authorities to remedy. If they cannot be remedied and the appellant’s need is sufficiently grave, then release on licence or some other similar administrative step would have to be considered by the relevant authorities. 
         
        
        
         
         In those circumstances, bearing in mind what has been said regarding the limitations upon this Court’s jurisdiction, we take the view that the appellant’s medical needs, that were considered by Lincoln DCJ at the time of sentence, are not available to be canvassed again before this Court”. 
         
        
       
     20    In Regina v Sopher  (1993) 70 A. Crim. R 570, Vachalec  was not referred to but the court expressed itself in terms consistent with that authority;- 
      
       
        
         
          “Health and age are relevant to the length of any sentence but usually of themselves would not lead to a gaol sentence not being imposed if it were otherwise warranted. Much depends on the circumstances. For example, a person may have but a short period to live or need intense treatment which cannot be provided in gaol. There may be circumstances where to keep a person in gaol will probably lead to his early death and this would not otherwise occur. The variety and combination of circumstances are legion. An appropriate balance has to be maintained between the criminality of the conduct in question and any damage to health or shortening of life. The Department of Corrective Services has the responsibility of providing for health care but there may be cases where what is required on a permanent basis extends beyond what it can provide and can be expected to provide. In almost all cases what the department is able to provide will suffice. If gaol is significantly harder for a person because of difficulties due to health and age this is a relevant matter to take into account (at pp573-574)”. 
         
        
        
        
       
     21     The court in Vachalec expressly referred to the principles which permit fresh evidence to be admitted in order to disclose error in the first instance proceedings. In Mickelberg v The Queen (1988/89) 167 CLR 259, the question related to circumstances in which fresh evidence might be adduced in a conviction appeal and in a familiar passage Toohey and Gauldron JJ expressed themselves thus (at p301) 
      
       
        
         
         “The underlying rationale for a Court of Criminal Appeal setting aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice”. 
         
        
        
       The rationale is the same where the appeal is against a sentence imposed after conviction: the issue is whether the sentencing proceedings resulted in a miscarriage of justice because, if the fresh evidence had been before the original sentencing judge, that judge would probably have imposed a sentence more lenient than that which was in fact imposed. 
        
       
     22    In a case such as this, where there was evidence before the sentencing judge of the existence of a significant medical condition and of the need thereby engendered for continuing medical treatment, and where the judge expressly adverted to those matters and moderated the severity of the sentence by reference to them, there is a very fine line between the exercise of the court’s undoubted jurisdiction to act upon fresh evidence in order to avoid or correct a miscarriage of justice, and on the other hand intervention in the administration of the corrections system which, for the reasons expressed in Vachalec, is not properly the function of this court. 
      
       
     23    The other body of authority which requires attention, therefore, is that which particularly deals with the admission on appeal to this court of fresh medical evidence relating to a medical condition of the applicant and the need for treatment thereof. The convenient starting point is Regina v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia. The appellant was convicted after a jury trial on 29 October 1986 and remanded in custody until sentenced on 3 December 1986. In May 1986 he had been diagnosed as having antibodies of the AIDS virus. Information as to his medical condition was before the sentencing judge. The relevant passage is in the judgment of King CJ at pp588-589: 
      
       
        
         
         “The task of the Court of Criminal appeal, speaking generally, is to see whether the trial judge went wrong on the material before him. There is power to receive fresh evidence subject to certain conditions. A clear distinction is necessary between fresh evidence as to events occurring before sentence and evidence as to events occurring after sentence. 
         
        
        
         
         While the evidence sought to be admitted on this appeal in a sense establishes the occurrence of events occurring after the passing of sentence, it does so for the purpose of explaining the full extent and implications of the appellant’s condition of health which existed at the time of sentence. I think that the authorities show that it is permissible to have regard to events occurring after sentence for the purpose of showing the true significance of facts which were in existence at the time of sentence... I think that the events occurring since sentence are admissible to show the extent and implications of the condition of health which the appellant was in when he was sentenced. The evidence which proves the occurrence of those events and which bears generally upon the extent and implications of the AIDS condition from which the appellant was suffering at the time of sentence, meets the tests referred to above for the admission of fresh evidence on appeal. We therefore admitted the evidence”. 
         
        
        
       The evidence in question there was to the effect that the appellant, while in prison, progressed to a more serious stage of his decision. The Chief Justice drew from that evidence the conclusion that  
       “there is a substantial risk that the stress associated with a further period of imprisonment will cause some deterioration in the condition which afflicts him”. 
        
       
     24    In Bailey the applicant was arrested on 26 August 1985 and on 2 May 1986 sentenced to terms of imprisonment which dated back to the time of his arrest. On 14 April 1986 he underwent a blood test, hoping to satisfy himself that he was in no danger from AIDS. The results of that test were not before the sentencing judge who heard the sentencing proceeding on 8 April 1986 and passed sentence on 2 May 1986. The applicant himself did not receive the results of the test, which were positive, until 7 May 1986. Lee J (who incidentally had been a party to the decision of this court in Vachalec) said (at p462): 
      
       
        
         
          “In my opinion in a case such as the present where it is clear that the disease with which the appellant is now suffering, was in fact, was in existence at the time he was sentence, it is proper for this court to allow evidence to that effect to be given on the appeal and to re-open the matter of the proper sentence to be imposed. This court has to take into account circumstances which make the incarceration of the prisoner more burdensome upon him than would be the case of the ordinary gaol inmate. Consideration of health are in this category”. 
         
        
       
     25    In Regina v Rodney White (CCA, unreported 7 April 1997) the court admitted evidence of the effect incarceration was in fact having upon the applicant’s medical condition (asthma and emphysema), notwithstanding that those conditions existed at the time of sentencing and could have been, but were not, the subject of appropriate medical evidence. Hidden J (with whom Simpson J agreed) admitted the evidence “not without some misgiving” on the basis that it was “admissible as evidence for the purpose of explaining the full extent and implication of the applicant’s condition of health which existed at the time of sentence” (citing Regina v Smith supra). 
      
       
        
       
     26    The applicant’s submission is that this is one of those rare cases where the department is not able to provide the treatment required by the applicant. That treatment would be available to him were he not in custody. In the absence of appropriate treatment he is in chronic pain and additionally is exposed to the risk of exacerbation of what is, on one view, an underlying infection in his leg with possible drastic complications which might include amputation of the limb. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
     27    At the time of the original listing of the appeal on 6 October 2000, the fresh evidence available was evidence from the applicant and his mother to the effect that treatment had not been available in the prison system as the sentencing judge had understood that it would be; and expert medical evidence that such conservative treatment as was available in prison had not been successful in treating the applicant’s leg; the only alternative suggested by the prison medical officer was amputation; but there was available in the private health system (but not in the public health system) a particular surgical procedure proposed by orthopaedic specialist Dr Tim O’Carrigan which offered a good prospect of relieving the applicant’s condition. 28    Shortly before the October hearing date, the Crown obtained information suggesting that suitable treatment in the private system was available to the applicant whilst in custody provided that the applicant was able to meet both the costs of the operation and the cost of the necessary Corrective Services escorts at the time of the operation and throughout a lengthy period of post operative treatment. The applicant proposed to adduce evidence from his mother that she was able and willing to meet the costs of the operation but could not afford to pay the additional costs of prison escorts. The Crown was granted an adjournment in order to obtain further material on that issue. The matter was subsequently listed for hearing on 21 February 2001 but was unable to proceed at that time because both parties were still engaged in investigating the medical condition - the treatment options available, the time which must elapse before treatment could be carried out, and the cost. The matter was further adjourned until11 May 2001. In the meantime, both parties have obtained clarifying reports from the orthopaedic specialist originally consulted by the applicant, Dr Tim O’Carrigan; from Dr Richard Matthews, the Chief Executive Officer of the Corrective Services Department; and from Dr Brett Courtenay, an orthopaedic specialist who has proposed to the Corrective Services authorities a different form of surgical treatment which would not be seriously hindered were the applicant still a prisoner serving a sentence at the time when the treatment was to be carried out. 
      
       
     29    The medical experts agree that there is established non-union of the fracture in the distal one-third of the right tibia. It is uncertain whether the fracture site is infected, although both specialists agree that the appearances are consistent with the presence of osteomyelitis. There have been some clinical signs of infection, from time to time, which, apparently respond to antibiotic therapy if given. Dr Courtenay seems more optimistic that there is no infection than Dr O’Carrigan. The question can only be finally determined by a biopsy procedure prior to any surgery or by inspection of the site in the course of surgery. In the absence of surgical intervention the applicant will continue to experience a great deal of pain and disability as is now the case. He is relatively immobile and unable to work or take part in other prison activities; he is subject to considerable pain for which palliative treatment has been not always available and the provision of which has, given the exigencies of a prison system, being sometimes delayed. It is clear that so long as the condition is not treated surgically his experience of imprisonment will be more onerous than would ordinarily be the case. 
      
       
     30    Three alternative surgical procedures have been discussed. An orthopaedic consultant to the Corrective Services Department, has proposed a below knee amputation. All agree that that would definitively dispose of the infection, and Dr Matthews, while not advocating that procedure, has acknowledged that it would remove pain and, with the use of a modern prosthesis, would improve function and mobility. The orthopaedic specialists, Dr O’Carrigan and Dr Courtenay are both strongly opposed to the idea of amputation (as, it may be added is the applicant himself). Dr O’Carrigan has proposed a procedure of bone resection using what is referred to as the Ilizarov apparatus, and Dr Courtenay acknowledges that this is an appropriate procedure. It involves, however, not only a great deal of initial expense but a lengthy period (probably 12 months) of close follow up by the treating surgeon, which would be difficult but not impossible to secure while the applicant remained a prison inmate. In the absence of timely reviews by the treating surgeon, the risk of complications and an unfavourable outcome would be considerable. Dr Courtenay has proposed a less radical procedure which involves the debridement of the fracture site and the insertion of an intramedullary nail. Dr O’Carrigan concedes that that procedure may be satisfactory, but says there are risks. In particular, if it turns out that the non-union is infected, the internal operation may stimulate the spread of infection to a point where, in any event, the Illizarov treatment would be required or, in a worst case, amputation could be necessary. The procedure would not restore the loss of length of the right limb which has occurred, and would not correct the varus (outward bowing) deformity of the ankle. Although there is a risk of spreading infection in the course of the internal fixation procedure, that risk is not thought to be very large; and both specialists agree that even in the presence of infection, successful union of the presently ununited fracture could be anticipated. 
      
       
     31    It is not for this Court or the Corrective Services authorities to dictate what treatment the applicant should or may have in respect of his condition. The choice is his, and should he choose ( as he has indicated he would) the procedure proposed by Dr O’Carrigan, the Court must in my view proceed on the assumption that he is entitled to have that procedure, either (if he is in a position to pay for it) in the private system or, if it is available, in the public system. 
      
       
     32    The most recent information from Dr O’Carrigan is that the procedure could now be carried out upon the applicant as a public patient at Liverpool District Hospital, where the appropriate apparatus has recently been made available. The procedure could be carried out there not immediately but in the latter months of the current year. As a private patient the applicant could have the treatment almost immediately. 
      
       
     33    Either way, if he has the treatment while he is a prison inmate, it would be necessary for prison officers to be assigned to escort him to and from his post operative consultations and, depending upon his prison classification, to stand guard over him in hospital. 
      
       
     34    He had expected by now to be classified C3, which would do away with the need for such guarding while in hospital; but that expectation of the applicant achieving reclassification as C3, had not in fact been fulfilled when this matter was before the court on 11 May 2001 because of an internal matter of prison discipline. Shortly, it appeared from a routine urine test that there were present in the applicant’s body drug residues which may have been consistent with his ingestion of heroin, contrary both to the law of the State and to prison discipline. However, other material before the court showed that the probability was that those traces merely reflected the applicant’s ingestion of prescribed analgesics for the relief of the pain in his damaged leg and the probability appear to be that the reclassification will soon proceed as was previously anticipated. 
      
       
     35     If the treatment is carried out while the applicant remains a prison inmate, even though full time guarding of him in hospital may not be required, the cost of escorting him to and from the consultation post-operatively will be considerable, and there might no doubt sometimes be a problem in securing his attendance punctually, given all of the demands upon the Corrective Services Department. The performance of the surgery while he is an inmate is clearly a less desirable course. If the procedure is delayed, the consequence is the prolongation of the time during which he must endure continuing pain and disability.  
      
       
     36     One of the more recent decisions of this court dealing with the problem of reconciling the need to insist on this court’s role strictly as a court of error, and the authorities referred to earlier dealing with the admission of fresh evidence, and the way in which this court should deal with such evidence consistently with the proper recognition of the limitations upon its jurisdiction, was Regina v L (unreported, 17 June 1996). The court said:  
      
       
        
         
         “The relevance to sentence of an offender’s illness has been the subject of a number of authorities in recent years in this court and elsewhere. From them a number of principles can be extracted.  
         
        
        
         
         The fact that an offender suffers from an illness does not necessarily mean that a prison sentence should not be imposed, or that the sentence should be less in the circumstances of the case would otherwise require. It is the responsibility of the executive to provide for the care and treatment of its prisoners;  
         R v Vachalec 
          (1981) 1 NSWLR 351 per Street CJ at 353-4. If a prisoner’s condition deteriorates during the course of the sentence such that his or her release ought to be permitted on humanitarian grounds, the executive is empowered to deal with the situation. Section 53 of the  
         Sentencing Act 
          1989 preserves the royal prerogative of mercy, and Section 25 A(I) of the act enables the Offender’s Review Board to grant parole at any time if the prisoner is dying or there are other “exceptional extenuating circumstances”: 
          R v Jones 
          (1993) 70 A. Crim. R 449 per Carruthers J at 457”. (See now,  
         Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
          1999, s102; and  
         Crimes (Administration of Sentences) 
          Act 1999, s160, conferring the like power on the Parole Board). 
         
        
       
     37    The court then referred to Smith, Bailey and other relevant cases, and observed-  
      
       
        
         
         “Where illness is seen to be relevant to the determination of sentence, its weight must be assessed in light of all the circumstances of the case. Obviously, one of those circumstances will be the seriousness of the offence”.  
         
        
       
     38     As indicated above, the applicant is presently serving (as he was at the time when sentenced by judge Keleman) the balance of his parole, following revocation of parole and his return to custody on 29 April 1999. The sentence that he is required to serve by reason of that revocation of parole will not expire until 19 August 2001. This court has no jurisdiction to interfere with that situation. If the applicant has any remedy in relation to it, it can only be by way of an application to the Parole Board. Further as observed above, the effect of the sentences imposed by Judge Keleman in respect of which this appeal has been brought was to increase the applicant’s period in custody only by the period from 19 August 2001 to 6 November 2002, an increase in the applicant’s custody of less than fifteen months. The fresh evidence certainly shows that during his whole period in custody the applicant will, if the suggested surgery is not performed, continue to suffer a great deal of pain and inconvenience. Making every allowance for that, but giving proper weight to the gravity of the offences with which we are concerned, I am of opinion that to reduce the sentences (or the minimum term) would result in a sentence of unacceptable leniency. 
      
       
     39    Noting that the evidence does not suggest a significant risk of deterioration in the applicant’s condition in the event that surgery is delayed, I have reached the conclusion that a case has not been established for the intervention of this court. 
      
       
     40    If, contrary to the present expectation of the medical experts, there were to occur a significant deterioration in the applicant’s condition later in the term of his imprisonment and before arrangements are made for surgery, it would of course, remain open to the applicant, to make an application to the Parole Board for compassionate release. 
      
       
     41    I propose that; leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.

       SMART, AJ. 
      MONDAY 28 MAY 2001 
      
      REGINA v. KING YOON TAN 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   DOWD, J: The court is in a position to give judgment on the appeal and I will ask Greg James, J. to give the first judgment. 
     2   GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon the applicant by Bellear, DCJ. in the District Court of New South Wales on 14 December 1999. 
     3   The applicant had pleaded guilty before a Magistrate under s.51A of the Justices Act 1902 to a charge of an offence of importing into Australia prohibited imports to which s.233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) applied, to wit narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) commonly known as ecstasy, being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that drug. 
     4   When the applicant came forward for sentence he was forty one years old, having been born on 11 May 1958. He came from Malaysia. He was a plumber by occupation. 
     5   The amount he imported was the sum of some 1.846 grams gross, the pure weight of the drug being some 736 grams. The commercial quantity is .5 kilograms, consequently the applicant had imported some 200 grams above the commercial quantity. The maximum penalty fixed by the Customs Act 1901, s.235, for this offence in this circumstance is life imprisonment. 
     6   The short facts were that the prisoner was apprehended at the Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport having flown from Kuala Lumpur. His luggage was searched and a body search was conducted which showed that a number of packages were secured about his body and inside his thighs with tape. The packages contained tablets of the forbidden drug. Also located in his possession was some $2,000 in Australian currency.  
     7   In due course he was spoken to and the learned trial judge summarised the effect of what he said in that interview in his remarks on sentence.  
     8   He said that he was told the packages contained something described as ""shake head drug"". He was told that after you take the drug you become ""dancy"". He collected the packages from somewhere in the centre of Kuala Lumpur. He had been contacted by a person he didn't know on a public telephone. He is not sure who told him to go to the phone box. An envelope containing the wherewithal for him to arrange through a travel agent his flight to Australia had been left for him at a cafe he frequented. He converted the balance of monies into Australian currency, after paying for his airfare and booking his accommodation. He was asked to come to Australia by someone he did not know. Someone he did not know was going to collect the packages from him and he was simply to wait in the De Vere Hotel for someone to contact him and collect the packages. 
     9   The learned trial judge was of the view, as is apparent from his findings, that the applicant was a bare or mere courier. He was given the benefit of a finding that he had entered the plea of guilty at an early stage and that the early plea was a reflection of his contrition. Further, that the plea had associated with it a substantial utilitarian component so that he had, in the findings of the trial judge, the benefit both of contrition and the saving of time and money to the community. 
     10   The trial judge, when assessing the level of culpability, considered that the applicant may have been recruited to bring the drugs into Australia for reward on one occasion only. Thus he was recorded as finding the applicant's role met the description of bare or minimum courier. His Honour treated such a person as being at the lower end of the spectrum of culpability. 
     11   His Honour also, having regard to matters referred to in the interview, held that the prisoner's motive for his role was to gain money for medical attention to be furnished to his mother for whom he apparently cared deeply and that the applicant's personal circumstances had apparently, until this time, been attended by prior good character, which his Honour took into account. He further took into account that the prisoner will suffer additional hardship by reason of being confined for a substantial period of time far away from his family, his culture and the prospects of contact with his loved ones and friends. 
     12   His Honour referred to the prisoner's family circumstances, his childhood and economic hardship, his recent divorce and the fact that he had custody of the two children of his marriage aged 16 and 14, who are being cared for by his elderly and ill mother.  
     13   Apparently, although he had attained trade qualifications in Singapore and had worked in France as a construction worker and kitchen hand he was unable there or in Singapore to earn the money necessary in his view to enable his mother to have the treatment to which he referred. 
     14   Thus it was that he came to commit the offence and thus it was that his Honour found that the prisoner presented to the Probation and Parole Service and to the trial judge as a man who was very committed to his family and was anxious to return to Malaysia to be reunited with them. 
     15   Notwithstanding all of those matters which his Honour took into account to the prisoner's advantage, his Honour properly had regard to the necessary general and personal deterrent factors and, in particular, to the clear sentencing pattern and the decisions of this court that sentences must be such that those who are involved in the drug trade bringing the commodity into this country for financial gain must be made aware that this country will meet such activities by a consistently tough sentencing policy. 
     16   His Honour concluded that no sentence other than a full time custodial sentence was appropriate in all the circumstances and that it was necessary to pass in this individual case a sentence of both general and person deterrent. 
     17   He had regard, of necessity, to reducing the sentence otherwise appropriate for the absence of remissions in this State, in accordance with the application of s.16G of the Crimes Act 1900 and concluded that an appropriate sentence of seven years commencing from the date on which the applicant went into custody, with a non-parole period of four years and six months, should be imposed. 
     18   The applicant has filed a letter of written submission dated 3 May 2001. That letter raised three matters, the first being that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account the prospect of the applicant being involved in a controlled delivery so as to enable the apprehension of those in Australia who might come to the hotel to collect the drugs. 
     19   Today he informed us he did not wish to maintain that ground, it having been inserted by mistake in the document by a friend upon whose advice he had relied, he having needed the assistance of someone proficient in English and aware of the system. No such matter or any indication of any such matter had been raised before the trial judge nor was there any evidence before the trial judge that would enable the applicant to take any active role in seeking to have those minded to obtain the drugs from him come to the hotel. On his account he did not know who might call and thus would be unable to make phone calls to have those persons come to the hotel. 
     20   Secondly, he raised a ground asserting that the trial judge had failed to give considerable weight to the early plea of guilty, previous good character and the hardship he will have to endure in a foreign land, particularly in the context of his mother's deteriorating health.  
     21   It is sufficient to say that I have already referred to the trial judge taking those very matters into account and giving them substantial weight.  
     22   He also submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Even taking into account the various matters personal to him and in his favour, that submission is simply not made out. 
     23   Although he referred to the sentence in the matter of Regina v. Hauser (CCA, unreported 11 December 1997) in which the appellant's original sentence of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three and a half years was reduced by this court to a sentence of four and a half years and a non-parole period of two and a half years, the circumstances in that case were entirely different. That was a case which involved an internal courier whose other offences under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1992 involved small amounts of money utterly unrelated to any drug activity but whose sentence otherwise regarded by the court as appropriate, indeed, lenient, was reduced according to the parity principle because of an even more lenient sentence imposed on a co-accused. Neither that decision nor those to which the Crown has taken us in their written submissions nor those shown in the sentencing statistics assists the applicant's case. 
     24   It is only if this court is persuaded that the trial judge has fallen into error in the exercise of his sentencing discretion and that some lesser sentence warranted in law should have been passed that the court is entitled in law to interfere with the trial judge's sentence. 
     25   No such ground has been made out here. 
     26   I therefore conclude that although the matter having been fully argued, leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     27   I would propose orders accordingly.  
     28   DOWD, J: I agree with the proposed orders and the reasons for those orders of Greg James, J. 
     29   SMART, AJ: I also agree. 
     30   DOWD, J: The orders, therefore, will be as proposed by Greg James, J.

        REGINA v Jaydon TADMAN 
         
         
        JUDGMENT 
         
         
        
        
        
         
        
       
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 28 January 1999 to an offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death contrary to s52A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The matter was referred to the District Court for sentencing pursuant to s51A of the Justices Act 1902. Mahoney DCJ sentenced the Applicant on 21 April 1999 to a total of seven years imprisonment comprising a minimum term of four years with an additional term of three years. The Applicant was disqualified from driving for five years. 
      
       
     2    Two other offences were to be taken into account on a Form 1 schedule. They were offences committed at the same time: self-administration of heroin and failing to stop after an accident. 
      
       
     3    As will presently appear, in the relevant accident one person died and a second person was injured. Nevertheless the Applicant was charged with one count under s52A(2) i.e. aggravated dangerous driving occasioning a death. There was no charge nor was the Court invited to take into account in sentencing, a further offence under s52A(4) of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm.  
      
       
     4    On 3 September 1998 the Applicant left his home at Baulkham Hills during the late afternoon and, eventually, went to Cabramatta where he bought heroin and injected himself. He then commenced to drive home. At 9.25pm the Applicant was seen by witnesses driving north in lane 3 (i.e. the lane closest to the median strip) of the Cumberland Highway at Wentworthville at a speed of about 65kph. Witnesses indicated a period of erratic driving on the part of the Applicant prior to the fatal impact. He was observed to be driving in an unsteady fashion and collided with the median strip on more than one occasion: up to three, according to one eye witness. 
      
       
     5    The Applicant was observed to veer into lane 2 and then back into lane 3. A short time later he veered sharply into lane 2 colliding with the driver’s side of a Mazda sedan driven by Mrs Ann Sparks. As a result of that impact the Mazda sedan spun out of control on to the other side of the road into the face of oncoming traffic and collided with a southbound taxi. Mrs Sparks was killed in the collision and the taxi driver suffered head injuries. 
      
       
     6    The Applicant did not stop after the collision. An eyewitness decided to follow him. The Applicant was seen to be swerving from lane to lane and accelerating, giving the driver following the impression that he was aware of being followed. The Applicant extinguished his car lights from time to time, it appears in an attempt to evade his pursuer. At the intersection of the Cumberland Highway and the Old Windsor Road the Applicant was forced to slow down approaching a set of traffic lights. The person following him drove his car across the path of the Applicant’s car to stop his progress. As the pursuer approached the driver’s side of the Applicant’s car, the Applicant reversed back, spinning his wheels, steered around the car of the pursuer and accelerated onto the Old Windsor Road, making his escape, although the pursuer had taken down his number plate. 
      
       
     7    Prior to the sentence hearing, Mahoney DCJ dealt with an application that the matter be referred to the Drug Court. His Honour refused the application, within the course of which his Honour received a considerable body of material about the incident and the circumstances of the Applicant.  
      
       
     8    When the matter came before his Honour for sentence the next week, his Honour had prepared a document entitled “Draft Reasons for Sentence” in which, without expressing a conclusion, his Honour had set out the facts of the offence, summarised other evidence put before the Court for purposes of sentence and outlined some preliminary views that his Honour had formed about the subjective features of the offence and the reliability of the prisoner as a witness. In another document entitled “Driving Causing Death” his Honour outlined an analysis of the law including the applicable factors, both mitigating and aggravating, which had been referred to in the judgment of this Court in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 esp at 231. His Honour described both these documents as indicating his “tentative views”. 
      
       
     9    When his Honour came to deliver his reasons on sentence he did not repeat the matters contained in the “Draft Reasons” but said (at p3) “take them as read”. By this I understand that his Honour treated the document headed “Draft Reasons” as if it were incorporated in his own reasons. His Honour had indicated that the pressure of matters to which he had to attend that day in the busy District Court at Parramatta was considerable. 
      
       
     10    With respect to the second document headed “Driving Causing Death” his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I refer to and incorporate those three pages into these reasons for judgment”. 
          
         
        
       
     11    This is an unusual course but on the basis I have outlined, i.e. that each document is deemed to have been incorporated by his Honour in his actual reasons, I do not believe that there is any basis for complaint that his Honour did not fully set out his reasons for reaching the judgment that his Honour made. It is notable that with respect to one of the matters contained in his Draft Reasons his Honour was satisfied, on the basis of evidence and submissions before the court, that he reached a different conclusion to that which he had tentatively indicated in the Draft as a preliminary view. 
      
       
     12    The primary submission of the Applicant was that the sentence was manifestly excessive. It was also submitted that the manner in which his Honour proceeded was inappropriate. It was submitted that his Honour approached the case on the basis that a starting point was three years based on Jurisic and to this had to be added a substantial component for the presence of a significant number of the aggravating factors identified in Jurisic and an additional one which his Honour identified as applicable in the circumstances of this case. 
      
       
     13    His Honour’s general approach was to indicate, it appears on the basis of Jurisic, that the appropriate sentence was at least three years and that “for the presence of any additional aggravating factors, that three years would have to be reviewed upwards”. His Honour identified a multiplicity of aggravating factors, emphasising that the process of taking these into account was not a “merely mechanical or mathematical exercise”. 
      
       
     14    In his application of the guideline judgment, in my opinion, his Honour adopted an inappropriate approach. The passage in Jurisic in which the guideline was set out did not distinguish between a minimum appropriate punishment, on the one hand, and aggravating factors, on the other. Indeed, it was only the presence of aggravating factors “to a material degree”, which reached the level where it could be said that the offender abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct, that the guideline indicated that a total sentence of less than three years should be regarded as exceptional. I went on to note in Jurisic at 231G, that once the threshold of abandoning responsibility had been reached, a period of three years should be regarded as a starting point but the presence of additional aggravating factors or the heightened intensity of any of the specific aggravating factors already taken into account “will determine the actual sentence”.  
      
       
     15    In my opinion his Honour erred in failing to recognise that the guideline in Jurisic took into account matters identified as aggravating factors in formulating the three year starting point. 
      
       
     16    In the present case, one of the aggravating factors was present to such a degree that the Applicant was charged under s52A(2), being the aggravated form of the offence, for which the maximum penalty is fourteen years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the basic offence under s52A(1) is ten years.  
      
       
     17    The relevant aggravation that distinguished this case from the basic offence was, it appears, the satisfaction of the standard found in s52A(7)(d):  
      
       
        
         
         “the accused’s ability to drive was very substantially impaired by the fact that the accused was under the influence of a drug …” 
         
        
       
     18    The “very substantially imposed” standard contrast with the “under the influence of … a drug” standard in s52A(1).  
      
       
     19    The offence committed was a serious one and entirely justified a substantial custodial sentence. The Applicant’s conduct led to the death of a woman. The Applicant continued to drive in a state where his ability to do so was, in accordance with his plea to the charge, “very seriously impaired”. That course of driving occurred on a busy road over a lengthy period of time during which he put at risk numerous members of the community.  
      
       
     20    A number of eye witnesses testified to the erratic course of his driving, including his bumping into the median strip on a number of occasions, which must have brought home to him the difficulty he was having with driving. It was submitted to this Court that there was no evidence to suggest that the Applicant was aware that his driving capacity would be as severely impaired as it was. There was no need for any such evidence. When a person takes a drug like heroin, or indeed alcohol, the Court will infer that he or she understood that his or her ability to drive will be impaired. If an accused wishes to contest this obvious inference, it will be up to the accused to give evidence to that effect. See R v Comber (NSWCCA, 11 November 1998, unreported). 
      
       
     21    In the present case the offence was substantially aggravated by the fact that the accused left the scene of the accident and evaded a driver who pursued him with a view to having him stop and, presumably, return to the scene of the accident. He may not have understood at that moment the full impact and horror of what he had done, however, he understood fully well that he had done something. 
      
       
     22    There are important subjective aspects which are entitled to substantial weight in the sentencing exercise. The Applicant was just under twenty-two years of age at the time of the offence. I attach particular weight to the fact that he had no prior criminal convictions of any character. There was only one traffic breach, for speeding, over a period of approximately five years since he had been licensed as an ‘L’ plate driver. The trial judge found, and I accept, that the Applicant’s sorrow and remorse was genuine and that the incident has had a very significant effect upon him. The intensity of his contrition is confirmed in the additional evidence filed in this Court. 
      
       
     23    His Honour had before him a pre-sentence report from the Probation and Parole Service and also a report from a psychologist. Much of the information in those reports was based, as is usually the case, on uncheckable assertions by the offender. His Honour found, correctly, that in some respects the offender’s version of prior events was not reliable.  
      
       
     24    The Applicant asserted that he had had an abusive father. He claimed that he had been the victim of a sexual assault at the age of ten or eleven and that he commenced drug use in a social context, as a result of feelings of discontent with his life and as a means of escaping painful memories of his childhood. He also claimed that he returned to sporadic use of heroin following a parachuting accident in which he suffered injuries which caused him continuing pain.  
      
       
     25    The pre-sentence report concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Tadman presents as a disturbed, vulnerable young man who sought the solace of drugs to address a number of issues in the past which has caused him both psychological and physical pain.” 
         
        
        
       Without accepting all of the details of the Applicant’s version of his life, this general conclusion appears to be correct. It represents an explanation for his heroin use, but other than as such explanation, does not detract from his responsibility for the death he has caused. 
        
       
     26    A number of statements were placed before the Court supportive of his character, the strength of his religious beliefs and of the remorse and contrition he has manifested since the accident. The evidence indicates that he maintained a strong and close relationship with his mother and that until the accident he held down a responsible and respectable job and was a useful member of the community. 
      
       
     27    Further evidence has been presented to this Court about his conduct in prison and this confirms the impression that his prospects for rehabilitation are high. 
      
       
     28    A report from the Welfare Officer at the Oberon Correctional Centre outlines his general approach and indicated that he was partaking in programmes well. That officer was impressed with him and his level of honesty and maturity and she expressed the further opinion that: 
      
       
        
         
         “... he has huge potential for personal growth whilst here at Oberon Correctional Centre and this view is shared by other colleagues here at the centre."" 
         
        
       
     29    He himself gave evidence as to the scope and nature of the courses that he has attended and to the counselling from a psychologist and a drug and alcohol counsellor of which he has availed himself whilst incarcerated. He indicated that he has remained drug free and that his religion and belief in God helps him to get through the difficulties that he has faced in that regard. He expresses the view that he is now fit and healthy.30    The information from the Department of Corrective Services as to his conduct in prison contains a range of complimentary remarks about his application to various opportunities made available to him during the course of his incarceration. Such comments include, in a document entitled “Inmate Assessment”, comments of the following character:· Always polite and professional· Always completes tasks· Always searching out work to be completed. 
      
       
       Comments of this character redound to his credit. 
        
       
     31    Finally, there are further supporting statements in the form of testimonials from his mother, Ms Wendy Mason, a church youth leader, Pastor Grygoruk, pastor of the Hills Church, Maree Calderwood, a friend and Leng Yeow, a friend and youth worker, all of which spoke highly of his application to his rehabilitation during the course of his incarceration. 
      
       
     32    This was, in my opinion, a strong subjective case, which has been confirmed by the evidence which had been tendered in this Court. This case is entitled to significant weight in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
      
       
     33    The Applicant pleaded guilty to the offence at the earliest opportunity, i.e. at the committal stage. Accordingly he is entitled to a discount for the significant utilitarian value of the plea. This discount ought to be at or towards the top of the range identified by this Court in R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 
      
       
     34    In my opinion, the appropriate sentence in this case would have been, but for the plea of guilty, a head sentence of seven years. With a discount for the plea, that should be reduced to a head sentence of five years and three months. 
      
       
     35    His Honour found that there were special circumstances in the present case and that the non-parole period would be set at lower than the statutory relationship. I agree that there are such special circumstances, particularly as the Applicant will need a longer than usual period of rehabilitation in order to ensure he has fully recovered from his heroin addiction and adjusted to the aspects of his past life that appear to have led him into that addiction. Accordingly, I would impose a non-parole period of two years and eight months. 
      
       
     36    His Honour imposed a disqualification for a period of five years. In doing so his Honour had in mind the fact that the minimum sentence was four years and, if his Honour had not imposed a longer than statutory period of disqualification, the Applicant would have been entitled to commence driving as soon as he left gaol.  
      
       
     37    In view of the fact that I propose to impose a non-parole period below the statutory period for disqualification, it is not necessary to vary that statutory period. 
      
       
     38    The orders I propose are: 
      
       
        
       1 Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
        
        
       2 Appeal allowed. 
        
        
       3 Sentence of the District Court of 21 April 1999 quashed. 
        
        
       4 The Appellant is sentenced to a period of five years and three months commencing on 12 April 1999 expiring on 11 July 2004 with a non-parole period of two years and eight months, commencing on 12 April 1999 and expiring on 11 December 2001 on which date he will be eligible for parole. 
        
       
     39    HULME J: The facts of this matter, both relating to the offence and the subjective circumstances of the Applicant both at the time of the sentence and since his incarceration, have been summarised in the judgment of the Chief Justice and I gratefully accept that summary. 
      
       
     40    I am content to proceed also on the assumption that the sentencing judge erred in his approach to Jurisic and to the sentencing of the Applicant. That said, I would not interfere with the sentence which has been imposed. 
      
       
     41    In my view, the Applicant’s conduct displayed a gross example of abandonment of responsibility, not just in his taking of heroin and driving when his driving ability was substantially impaired, but in disregarding the warnings which he must have had when he struck the median strip a few times prior to the final impact which resulted in the death of another citizen. That the Appellant was in a position to appreciate what was happening in the course of his driving was demonstrated by his conduct afterwards when pursued by another motorist, when quite clearly he had enough of his wits about him to adopt a number of steps directed to evading his pursuer and responsibility for the accident. 
      
       
     42    Parliament has provided a maximum penalty of fourteen years. In my view, anything else than a minimum term of four years and a total sentence of, or very close to, seven years gives insufficient recognition to what Parliament has provided and to the need for general deterrence. 
      
       
     43    I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     44    HOWIE J: I agree with the reasons and sentence imposed by the Chief Justice. 
      
       
     45    In determining the seriousness of an offence under s52A(2) as against the maximum penalty prescribed for that offence, it may not be the case that each of the aggravating features specified in s52A(7) are of the same seriousness or that, in an appropriate case, each require the maximum penalty prescribed to be imposed: See Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447. For example, it seems to me that the aggravating feature contained in s52A(7)(c) would generally be regarded as a more serious aggravating feature than perhaps the circumstance described in s52A(7)(d). However, for the purposes of the present appeal it is unnecessary to resolve that matter. 
      
       
     46    However, I wish to make it clear that the sentence proposed by the Chief Justice is lower than would generally be appropriate, in my view, to reflect the seriousness of the offence and the requirement for general deterrence. 
      
       
     47    I only agree to the sentence proposed because of the lack of any significant traffic record, which would indicate that the abandonment of the Applicant’s responsibility. On this particular occasion was an aberration on his part, the plea of guilty and the very strong evidence of remorse and, in particular, the evidence of the strong prospects of rehabilitation, which has been placed before the Court today. I would not normally accept that a non-parole period of the length proposed in this case would be sufficient to reflect the seriousness of the offence or the need for general deterrence. 
      
       
     48    The sentence which will be imposed by this Court is not to be considered as a general guide to an appropriate sentence for such a case as the objective facts of this matter disclose and, in my view, it is the very least sentence which could be imposed as justified by the subjective matters in this particular case. 
      
       
     49    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court are as I have indicated.

      REGINA v JOEL MARK HEMMELSTEIN 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
     FACTSH was convicted of knowingly importing a commercial quantity of cocaine and sentenced to nine years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years. The appellant relied on three grounds of appeal, all relating to the exclusion of evidence at trial. The first ground was that the trial judge wrongfully excluded evidence of out of court representations made by H to his brother as to his intention to play golf in Australia. The second ground of appeal was that the trial judge erred in excluding a note written by H’s solicitor, Mr Murphy, regarding a Mr Simonds. The third ground was that the trial judge erred in excluding evidence from H’s brother concerning a telephone call. HELD per Meagher JA & Hulme J, Smart AJ dissenting:(1) Appeal dismissed.Per Meagher JA: All of the evidence the subject of appeal was inadmissible.Per Hulme J: The first ground of appeal is made out. However, this evidence can have added no or so little significant weight to the appellant’s case that the exclusion of this evidence has not deprived him of any chance of acquittal otherwise open. There has been no substantial miscarriage of justice. Per Smart AJ: The appellant should succeed on all three grounds of appeal. The rejected evidence would have made the defence more credible. I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial. Per Hulme J & Smart AJ, Meagher JA dissenting:(i) Evidence of the appellant’s intention to play golf was both relevant and admissible. The Crown, by its conduct of the prosecution made the state of mind and intention of the appellant a fact in issue.  Per Meagher JA: Evidence of hearsay about intentions to play golf would not  rationally affect the assessment of the fact in issue; ie whether H had knowledge  that he was carrying cocaine.  Per Meagher JA, Hulme J agreeing, Smart AJ dissenting:(ii) The second ground of appeal must fail. The evidence of the note had no relevance to the facts in issue.  Per Smart AJ: Evidence of Mr Murphy as to statements made to him by Mr  Simonds is admissible pursuant to Evidence Act 1995, s65(8), subject to a  warning under s165(1)(a) of the Act.  Per Meagher JA, Hulme J agreeing, Smart AJ dissenting:(iii)The third ground of appeal must fail.  Per Smart AJ: The evidence was admissible pursuant to s65(8) of the Act, subject to a warning under s165(1)(a). ORDERS1 Appeal dismissed.

     1   MEAGHER JA: This is an application by Mr. Hemmelstein for leave to appeal against a trial sentence of 9 years (six years non-parole) imposed on him by Kinchington DCJ on 9 July 1999, after a trial before a jury lasting several days and resulting in a finding of guilt. The charge was knowingly importing a commercial quantity of cocaine into Australia. 
     2   The appellant has not appealed on severity. His learned senior counsel, Mr SJ Odgers SC, conceded that the evidence against the applicant justified a finding of guilty; indeed, that it was “strongish”. 
     3   When Mr Hemmelstein arrived at Mascot Airport on 27 July 1997, there was among his luggage a golf bag (containing golf clubs), which was itself contained in a hard sided golf carry case. In the false bottom of that carry case, 3 packages of cocaine were found containing 2152 grams of cocaine, with an estimated street value of over a million dollars. 
     4   He was arrested and questioned about the drugs. He denied any knowledge of them. That was the position he maintained at trial. In order to explain how the drugs may have got into the golf case without his knowledge, he provided an account relating to a man he called “Jim Simonds”. He claimed that Mr Jim Simonds was a property developer whom he had met some years before. They played golf together, and Mr Hemmelstein said Mr Simonds had given him the golf carry case. Mr Simonds is said to have looked after Mr Hemmelstein’s clubs on a number of occasions. He had given financial assistance to Mr Hemmelstein (although one might ask oneself why?) which enabled him to come and play golf in Australia in April 1997. He then took Mr Hemmelstein’s clubs back to the US after that visit. Mr Hemmelstein then returned to the US, where he recovered his golf clubs. Mr Simonds then, a second time, financed a trip by Mr Hemmelstein to Australia. He came here to play golf, nothing more. That is Mr Hemmelstein’s story. 
     5   That is a most unlikely story. It is the only one the jury had to consider. The issue was whether Mr Hemmelstein knew that he was carrying cocaine in his golf bag. 
     6   The Crown case against him was that he did know. The Crown relied on a multiplicity of circumstances, including the following: 
     · the significant quantity and value of the cocaine in the golf carry bag;· the appellant’s possession at the airport of the golf carry bag;· the appellant’s statement to Rajagopalan that he packed each of t he items of luggage found in his possession, including the golf carry bag;· the appellant’s statements that he was on a golfing holiday;· the fact of the appellant travelling alone;· the appellant’s statement to the AFP agents that a friend bought his airline ticket but he did not wish to identify that person;· the presence of the dirty clothes in the bottom of the golf carry bag;· the appellant’s evidence that the golf shoes found in the bag did not belong to him but to Simonds;· the unused state of some of the golfing equipment including the balls, tees and glove;· the discrepancy between the elaborate golf carry bag and the relatively cheap clubs, which had been purchased by the appellant for US$150.00;· the absence of any brochures or other documents about golfing in Australia, the only golfing literature being the two golfing magazines;· the absence of any golf type clothing and golf shoes of his own on the appellant’s luggage;· the screwdrivers in the golf bag, which were capable of fitting the screws in the plate under which the cocaine was concealed;· the appellant’s possession of keys to the golf carry bag;· the circumstances of the relationship between the appellant and the man Simonds including the payment of the appellant’s airfares to Australia by, it would seem, Simonds on two occasions; and· the unlikelihood of the appellant being selected as an innocent dupe to carry such a valuable consignment into Australia [AB 259-261] ;7   In putting these matters to Mr Hemmelstein, with a view to demonstrating that his story was bogus, the Crown put to him (and one can hardly wonder) that he had no intention to play golf in Australia. This may have been so, but it was to some extent beside the point. If he had no intention of playing golf, an inference of knowledge could have easily been drawn; but even if he had such an intention, that did not negative his knowledge of the cocaine. One can knowingly import cocaine and still find time to slot in a little golf. As the learned judge said, the jury had to decide whether the “only reason or prime reason” to make the trip to Australia was to import the cocaine.  
     8   The defence sought to lead evidence of out of court representations made by Mr Hemmelstein to his brother about his intention to play golf when he came to Australia on the second occasion. At common law, of course, such representation would be hearsay. By s 72 of the Evidence Act (1995) that objection is negated. Nor is it rendered inadmissible as a prior consistent statement: s 55 (2). But as the Crown contended, that is not the end of the story. Evidence which is relevant can only become admissible when “if it were accepted, [it] could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the possibility of the existence of a fact in issue in the process” (s55 (1)). There was only one fact in issue: knowledge. Evidence of remote hearsay about intentions to play golf would not rationally “affect” that issue. The first ground of appeal, which was that his Honour was wrong in rejecting this evidence, must therefore fail. 
     9   The second ground of appeal was that his Honour erred in rejecting a note written by Mr Christopher Murphy, Mr Hemmelstein’s solicitor, to the effect that someone calling himself “Jim Simonds” visited him, paid him US$18,00 on behalf of Mr. Hemmelstein’s costs, and said: 
      
       
        
        “That it was impossible that Joel’s fingerprints could be on the “packaging” of the cocaine found in his possession. When I pressed him as to how he knew he hinted that he put them there.” 
        
       
     10   “Joel” is, of course, Mr Hemmelstein. How that evidence could, if admitted, rationally affect anything is nearly impossible to see. To begin with, it is nearly meaningless. What is meant by “hint”? But even if it were an unambiguous representation, it would have no relevance: an allegation that Mr Hemmelstein knew he was carrying cocaine is not inconsistent with Mr Jim Simonds putting his fingerprints on the “packaging”. 
     11   The third ground of appeal verges on the ludicrous. It is that his Honour erred in excluding evidence from Mr Hemmelstein’s brother that somebody whose initials were “J. S.” had telephoned him to say that Mr Hemmelstein was not guilty. This submission only has to be stated to reveal its absurdity. 
     12   This application should be dismissed. 
     13   HULME J: In this matter, I have had the advantage of seeing the Reasons for Judgement of Meagher JA in draft form and can accordingly be brief.  
     14   As contemporaneous statements of intention and notwithstanding their hearsay nature, the out of court representations made by the Appellant to his brother to the effect that he had the intention of playing golf in Australia were, if relevant, admissible,. They were admissible at common law - see Sugden v Lord St Leonards (1876) LR 1 PD 154 at 227, 242 and 251 and under Section 72 of the Evidence Act. 
     15   I agree with Meagher JA that an intention to play golf in Australia was not inconsistent with the guilt of the Appellant on the charge he faced. However, the Appellant’s reason or reasons for coming to Australia were an issue in the case. The rejection or non-acceptance of the Appellant’s story that his trip here was motivated by golf was calculated to increase his prospects of conviction. Furthermore, the Crown Prosecutor on two occasions suggested in cross examination of the Appellant that he wasn’t “here to play golf at all”. Thus evidence of his intention to play golf was both relevant and admissible. 
     16   I agree with Meagher JA and for the reasons he has advanced that the pieces of evidence the subject of the second and third grounds of appeal were inadmissible.  
     17   In defence to the reasons of Smart AJ, I would add this. I do not doubt that hearsay statements including those by a third person confessing his guilt to the crime may in some circumstances be able to rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a face in issue in the proceedings within the terms of s55 of the Evidence Act and otherwise be admissible. My view that the statements the subject of the second and third grounds here are not admissible depends on the totality of their hearsay nature, their terms, what is known of the maker(s) and the totality of circumstances surrounding the making of the statements. 
     18   I turn then to a consideration of the proviso to Section 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. Meagher JA has listed the circumstances relied on by the Crown. They indicate that, at the least, the Crown case was strong. The Appellant gave evidence denying knowledge of the drugs, the subject of the charge. Demonstrably the jury did not believe him. It was part of the Crown case that the playing of golf, whether or not it was genuinely intended, was but a cover for the drug importation. Evidence, whether from the Appellant’s brother or otherwise that the Appellant had previously told his brother he intended to play golf can have added no or so little significant weight to the Appellant’s case that the exclusion of that evidence has not deprived him of any chance of acquittal otherwise open. I am satisfied that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice and that the appeal should be dismissed. 
     19   SMART AJ:  Mark Hemmelstein seeks an extension of time within which to appeal against his conviction by a jury of importing into Australia on 22 July 1997 prohibited imports to which s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 applied, to wit, narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of cocaine being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to cocaine. He was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years. 
     20   Initially, he sought leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence but that application was abandoned. It appears that the original notice of appeal went astray either in the gaol system or the court system. The time within which the applicant may appeal should be extended. I turn to consider his appeal. 
     21   The facts have been summarised in the judgment of Meagher JA. That summary reveals that the Crown case was a strong one.  
     22   The critical question was whether the appellant was aware of the presence of the drugs imported in the carry case of his golf bag. The Crown contended that the only rational inference to be drawn from the circumstances was that he must have known of the presence of the drugs. 
     23   Appeal Ground 1 reads: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            The trial judge erred in excluding evidence regarding representations by the appellant as to his golfing plans. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     24   The appellant sought to lead evidence of a conversation with his brother before he came to Australia in July 1997 in which he told his brother that he enjoyed being in Australia and enthused about the number of great golf courses in and around Sydney on which he could play without being a member and the lack of expense. Most seemed to be municipal courses. 
     25   This evidence would not usually be admissible. However, counsel for the appellant submitted that it was admissible and relevant because of the way in which the Crown had conducted its case. It appears from the summing-up that the Crown was at pains to rebut the story which the applicant had told the police and Customs, namely, that he was on a golfing holiday (SU25-27). The Crown relied on a series of circumstances which the judge enumerated. The judge said (SU26): 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            "" 
            The Crown says from all the circumstances you will be able to infer that what he says about his golfing trip was a front, that he was not a golfer"". 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     26   At SU48 the judge referred to the Crown Prosecutor's submission on that: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            "" 
            You will reject his version that he gave in his evidence about coming to Australia to play golf and that you will conclude that the only reason or the prime reason he came to Australia was to bring in the narcotic substance, the cocaine found in his bag"". 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     27   There was extensive cross-examination of the appellant to the effect that he was not coming to Australia to play golf at all. Indeed, this was put to him directly. As earlier mentioned, the critical issue was whether the applicant knew that he had narcotic goods in the golf case. Although the Crown could, without disadvantage have conducted its case without alleging that the accused had no intention of coming to Australia to play golf it did not do so. The Crown having raised the issue of the appellant's intention and state of mind as to the playing of golf, he was entitled to lead evidence in rebuttal. Despite the differing views in Walton v The Queen (1989) 166 CLR 283 as to the basis upon which the statements are admitted it is clear enough that relevant out of court statements are admissible to prove the maker's knowledge or state of mind in a case where that knowledge or state of mind is itself a fact in issue or provable (as against the party against whom the evidence is tendered) as a fact relevant to a fact in issue. In the present case the Crown by its conduct of the prosecution made the state of mind and intent of the appellant a fact in issue. Thus the statement of the appellant to his brother was admissible - see ss 55 and 72 of the Evidence Act (1995). 
     28   I appreciate that the Crown put that the appellant's primary purpose in travelling to Australia was to import the cocaine. It would suffice if one of his purposes was to import cocaine. However, none of this means that the appellant is not entitled to meet the case put by the Crown when it goes further than necessary. 
     29   The prosecution appears to have thought that the appellant's state of mind and intent were relevant to the question of his knowledge. 
     30   Appeal Ground 2 reads: 
      
       
        
         The trial judge erred in excluding evidence of the contents of conversations between Christopher Murphy and a man named James Simonds. 
        
       
       
     31   The conversation occurred after the arrest of the appellant. A statement by Mr Murphy was placed before the judge. That statement was based on contemporaneous notes made by Mr Murphy. The judge allowed Mr Murphy to give evidence of meetings he had with Mr James Simonds from the United States of America and of telephone conversations but not the content of what was said. The judge also permitted Mr Murphy to give evidence that Mr James Simonds had paid $US1800 to his firm on account of the appellant's legal costs. It was the appellant's case that Mr Simonds gave him the case, bag and clubs which he brought to Australia.32   Curiously, Mr James Simonds appeared in Mr Murphy's office on 23 July 1997, being the day following the appellant's arrest, paid the $US1800 mentioned and left a contact telephone number at the Sebel Town House. Mr Simonds telephoned later that day and on Mr Murphy stating that he was going to the gaol to see the appellant on the following day, stated that he would like to visit the appellant in gaol with Mr Murphy. On 24 July 1997 Mr Murphy visited the appellant in gaol. 
     33   On 25 July 1997 Mr Simonds went to Mr Murphy's office. He told him that the appellant stated that he was not guilty, knew nothing about how the drugs got into his luggage and believed that his bag may have been tampered with by airport staff at Reno. Mr Murphy told Mr Simonds that he would be pushing for a full fingerprint and DNA test and whatever else could be done to show that the appellant was not involved. 
     34   Later Mr Simonds telephoned and advised Mr Murphy that he had been advised against going to the gaol and that he would be out of town and not contactable. 
     35   On Monday 28 July 1997 Mr Simonds again telephoned Mr Murphy and advised that he would not be going to court on Tuesday. He was leaving Australia at 3.30 pm on Tuesday. At about 9.11 am on Tuesday Mr Simonds telephoned and advised that the appellant would not have packed drugs in his luggage. 
     36   Mr Murphy stated that on 1 August 1997 Mr Simonds telephoned and advised that he was travelling and would not be able to be in touch and that Mr Murphy should keep in touch with the appellant's family. Mr Simonds stated that it was impossible that the appellant's fingerprints could be on the packaging of the cocaine found in his possession. Mr Murphy stated that when he pressed Mr Simonds as to how he knew that, he hinted that he put them there. Mr Murphy asked if his (Mr Simonds') fingerprints could be found on them (the packaging) and were his prints on record. Mr Simonds replied that he did not have a criminal record and added ""I was in the Service"". It would have been better if Mr Murphy's file note had recorded what was said that led him to conclude that Mr Simonds was hinting that any fingerprints on the package containing the cocaine were his. The matter could have been developed if thought necessary. 
     37   On 3 September 1997 Mr Murphy was contacted by telephone by Mr G Niespolo of Sideman & Bancroft, attorneys, San Francisco on behalf of Mr Simonds. Mr Murphy told Mr Niespolo what the appellant wanted from Mr Simonds. Nobody heard from him or his representative. At the trial Mr Murphy detailed the extensive but unsuccessful steps which had been taken to locate Mr Simonds and get him to assist. Mr Simonds appears to have had good reasons to make himself unavailable. 
     38   The evidence called on behalf of the appellant would have been considerably stronger if all the evidence of Mr Murphy as to what Mr Simonds had said and done had been led. That evidence suggested, inter alia, that Mr Simonds had placed the cocaine in the golf bag carry case. The inference was available that this was without the consent or knowledge of the appellant. While a jury was likely to accept Mr Murphy's evidence, supported as it was by contemporaneous notes and the payment on account of legal costs by Mr Simonds, it does not necessarily follow that the appellant did not know that there was cocaine in the golf bag carry case, but the materials rejected point in that direction and make the difficult defence of the appellant more credible. If Mr Simonds put the cocaine in the golf bag carry case he may well not have told the appellant. 
     39   Section 65(1) of the Evidence Act provides that s 65 applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not able to give evidence about an asserted fact. The statement by Mr Simonds would have amounted to a previous representation - see the definitions of previous representation and representation in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act. 
     40   Section 65(8)(a) provides that the hearsay rule does not apply to oral evidence of a previous representation adduced by a defendant if the evidence is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made. 
     41   This important provision remedied a defect in the existing law as administered by the courts in this State. Hitherto, it had been difficult to adduce statements by a person other than the defendant to another that the speaker had committed the crime with which the defendant was charged, or had or had not done certain acts, which meant that the defendant had not committed the crime or that it was unlikely that he had done so. Sometimes these statements pointed to a third party having committed the crime. The person making the previous representation may not have been available for a variety of reasons including refusing to come to court or refusing to give evidence. In England, as a matter of practice objection was not usually taken to a defendant leading hearsay evidence which was capable of being believed when it tended to show that a defendant was not guilty. A stricter approach was taken by the prosecution in this State. Section 65(8) brings New South Wales into line with the English practice. 
     42   Section 65(8) involves a recognition of the fact that a defendant may not have the resources to obtain evidence and procure the attendance of witnesses. If the witness who is able to give the primary evidence is overseas and declines to come to Australia, the problem is magnified. It is not uncommon for a person, who informally concedes that it was he not the defendant who committed the crime or who informally makes concessions having that effect, to be unwilling to come to Court to give evidence to that effect. There are the further cases of the speaker dying or ""going underground"" for a period.  
     43   I think that the evidence of Mr Murphy as to statements made to him by Mr Simonds is admissible pursuant to s65(8). That material bolsters the defence case and makes it seem not so improbable. As the evidence is hearsay the judge would have to give the jury a warning pursuant to s 165(1)(a) and explain the reasons why the hearsay evidence may be unreliable.44   Appeal Ground 3 reads: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            The trial judge erred in excluding evidence of a conversation between Neal Hemmelstein and ""Jim"" soon after the arrest of the appellant. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     45   It was sought that the appellant's brother, Dr Neal Hemmelstein, give evidence that shortly after the appellant's arrest he received a telephone call from a man who identified himself as Jim, gave his initials as JS and stated that he was a golfing partner of the appellant. Dr Hemmelstein wrote: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""I told him I knew he (the appellant) had a golfing friend named Jim Simons (Simonds). He sounded very nervous and told me that he knew Joel was in gaol. He also told me that Joel had done nothing wrong. He told me he had contacted a defence lawyer in Sydney named Christopher Murphy to defend Joel. He gave me Murphy's phone number, said he had given Murphy a little money and that I should call this lawyer. This man did not stay on the phone very long and I have not heard from him again."" 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     46   The contents of the telephone call when taken with the evidence of Mr Murphy tend to suggest that the man who telephoned Dr Neal Hemmelstein was Mr Jim Simonds. I think that this is established as a matter of inference on the balance of probabilities. It is hard to think of anyone else who could have uttered the words deposed to by Dr Hemmelstein. In the context the statement that Joel had done nothing wrong is not without significance. It is capable of meaning that the appellant did not place the drugs in the golf bag carry case or know that they were there. This is probably so when this remark is coupled with Mr Simonds' statements to Mr Murphy. I think that this evidence was admissible pursuant to s 65(8) of the Evidence Act 1995, but it would have to be the subject of a warning under s 165(1)(a). It is important not to look at the various contested statements in isolation. They should be taken together. 
     47   This is not a case in which the proviso should be applied. The defence of the appellant was not easy to accept. The rejected evidence would have made the defence more credible in that it tended to point to someone else having put the drugs in the false bottom of the golf bag carry case and a reasonable possibility that the accused did not know that the drugs were there. Some of the material in the case tended to suggest that the accused was, at times, a little unworldly. I am not able to say that the rejected evidence would have made no difference. It would, of course, have been open to a jury either to reject the evidence or take the view that it was of no consequence. 
     48   I would allow the appeal. I would quash the conviction and order a new trial.

      REGINA v Robert Scott FLAVEL 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1   DOWD J: The Court is in a position now to give judgment in relation to the appeal of Robert Scott Flavel. In that respect Barr J will give the first judgment. 
      
       
     2   BARR J: Robert Scott Flavel appeals against his conviction by a District Court jury on the charge that between 1 September 1997 and 7 December 1998 he imported into Australia a prohibited import, namely narcotic goods consisting of a quantity not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine, and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by the trial judge, Ainslie-Wallace DCJ. The appellant was tried jointly with the co-appellant in this appeal, Beatriz Gonzalez-Betes. 
      
       
     3   The principal witness was an accomplice called Meggett. His evidence may be summarised as follows. Meggett met the appellant in about 1993. Meggett acted as crew for a man called Del Prado on a number of transatlantic voyages by boat. The appellant accompanied him on five of the voyages. 
      
       
     4   On each voyage the yacht carried a dinghy of a model called a Boston Whaler. At the conclusion of each voyage the dinghy was removed from the yacht in Spain and the yacht returned to its point of departure in the Caribbean. On one occasion Del Prado threatened Meggett with dire consequences if there should be any breach of the secrecy surrounding these journeys. The appellant was present and heard the threat. On one of the journeys Meggett and the appellant talked about places on the yacht in which things might be hidden. Meggett suggested the bilges but the appellant rejected the suggestion. Meggett mentioned the dinghy and the appellant nodded his head. 
      
       
     5   In 1997 Del Prado invited Meggett to make another voyage, this time across the Pacific, and offered him $400,000 to do so. Meggett told the appellant about the proposal and the money on offer. The appellant agreed to take part in the journey. Meggett went to Cuba where he met the co-appellant. They joined the yacht which was eventually used to make the journey, the Maeva. On a platform at the stern of the yacht was a Boston Whaler. Meggett, the co-appellant, and her husband sailed to the Netherlands Antilles and there met the appellant and Del Prado. Del Prado told Meggett to buy spares for the journey and asked the appellant to assist him. The appellant did as he was asked. 
      
       
     6   He and Meggett returned to the Netherlands Antilles where Del Prado gave instructions to the appellant to sail with Meggett and help him through the Panama Canal. They took the yacht together to Colon where Del Prado met them once again. He told them that he was leaving the next day to go to Colombia. He said the appellant was to sail with them and carry out the dinghy exchange while Meggett stayed out of sight. 
      
       
     7   The appellant took the yacht and about five days later returned with it to Colon. It was carrying a different Boston Whaler. They passed through the Panama Canal and the appellant left the yacht once again. Meggett set sail for Australia and during the journey kept in touch with the appellant, who met him in the Galapagos Islands and in Tonga. 
      
       
     8   The appellant instructed Meggett to sail to Lord Howe Island but he did not do so because of delays that had been experienced on the journey. He took the Maeva into Coffs Harbour, arriving on 5 December 1998. The appellant met the yacht there and assisted Meggett with customs procedures. On 7 December he directed Meggett to lower the dinghy from the yacht and assisted him in doing so. Meggett took it to the boat ramp where the co-appellant placed and secured it on a trailer. She was in the company of a co-offender called Campillo. He was later tried separately. The co-appellant, Campillo and Meggett were arrested at the boat ramp. The appellant was arrested at Coffs Harbour airport on his way to Sydney. The dinghy contained bulk cocaine weighing 244.8 kilograms, the equivalent of one hundred and seventy one kilograms of pure cocaine. 
      
       
     9   The defence case was that the appellant knew nothing about the presence of cocaine on board. He said that he was in a business which delivered craft and supplied parts for various parties who owned yachts and other vessels. He said that a man called John had offered him the job of taking the Maeva to Australia but that he had turned it down. Later on he found that Meggett had got the job and Meggett asked him to help. He agreed to help because he was a friend of Meggett. 
      
       
     10   He helped him take the vessel to Colon and through the Panama Canal. He assisted in getting visas and in obtaining repairs to damage which occurred to the boat en route. A representative of the owner got in touch with him when the yacht became overdue at Coffs Harbour and the appellant agreed to do all that he could to make sure that it arrived there. One reason why he did so was that Meggett was using his company name as he passed through various ports and he became concerned that if the yacht were delayed the reputation of his company might suffer. 
      
       
     11   The first ground of appeal complains about the admission of the evidence which I have summarised about the transatlantic journeys in which Meggett and the appellant took part and about the conversation they had about a good place to hide things. Timely objection was raised in the District Court and the point was decided before a judge other than the trial judge. The appellant’s rights were preserved before the trial judge without any need to re-argue the issue. 
      
       
     12   It was common ground at trial and on appeal that the evidence about those journeys did not establish that any narcotic goods were carried or, for that matter, that there was anything unlawful about the activity carried on. 
      
       
     13   It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the evidence was tendency evidence. It proved a tendency in the appellant to have a particular state of mind, that is to know that something suspicious was going on. It was put that the Crown case at trial was that the evidence proved that the appellant knew that some sort of contraband was being moved, concealed in the Boston Whalers. So the case was really one of “wilful blindness” as that term was used in He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1984-1985) 157 CLR 523 and other cases. Reference was also made to R v Pereira (1988) 35 A Crim R 382 and R v Leask [1999] NSWCCA 33. 
      
       
     14   The evidence, it was submitted, had therefore to pass the test set by s 101(2) Evidence Act, namely that it was inadmissible unless its probative value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect it may have. It did not pass that test. Alternatively it was submitted that the evidence should have been excluded under s 137 of the same Act because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
      
       
     15   In my opinion these submissions do not correctly describe the character of the evidence and the use to which the Crown was entitled to and did put it at trial. The evidence established that by the time the appellant undertook the Maeva voyage he knew about the journeys by yacht from the Caribbean to Spain, that Meggett had been involved in them, that on each voyage the yacht was met by Del Prado and the Whaler unloaded and taken away, that Del Prado had a strong desire to keep these events secret, that the appellant suspected that contraband was being carried in the dinghies, that he alone took each yacht to a location in the Caribbean and exchanged dinghies before each voyage and that the place where the dinghies were exchanged and his suspicion that contraband was being carried in them must have made him suspect that the contraband was cocaine. 
      
       
     16   The Crown was entitled to invite the jury to find against that background that the appellant must have believed when he began the Maeva voyage that the purpose of the transatlantic runs had been to carry cocaine, that Del Prado was probably a substantial trafficker in cocaine and that the purpose of the Maeva voyage would therefore be to transport cocaine. 
      
       
     17   For the evidence to be admissible upon that basis it was not in my opinion necessary that it should establish that narcotics or cocaine had been carried in any of the transatlantic journeys and it was enough that the evidence showed that the appellant’s experience of those journeys must have given him a suspicion about Del Prado’s purpose in organising the transpacific voyage. Thus the Crown did not rely upon the prior journeys to prove the transport of drugs. In my opinion it was admissible for the purpose that I have stated and in accordance with Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590. 
      
       
     18   Moreover, the Crown did not rely upon the evidence to prove that the appellant had a tendency to suspect Del Prado of smuggling cocaine concealed in dinghies. It relied upon the evidence to prove that he in fact suspected Del Prado of that activity. 
      
       
     19   In my opinion this ground of appeal should fail because the evidence was not tendency evidence. 
      
       
     20   The second ground of appeal complained about the summing-up. It was acknowledged for the purposes of this ground that the evidence was not admitted as tendency evidence but as evidence of knowledge. It was submitted that it was therefore necessary that the jury be properly directed as to how to use the evidence so that they did not use it for some purpose other than that for which it was admitted. Relevantly, her Honour said this: 
      
       
        
         
         Now, the Crown relies on the following evidence from which it asks you to conclude that Mr Flavel knew that the dinghy contained or was likely to contain drugs. 
         
        
       
     21   It was submitted that, given that there was no evidence that any contraband was carried on any of the transatlantic journeys, there was a real risk that the jury might unfairly use the evidence as evidence that the appellant in fact knowingly participated in the importation of narcotic drugs during any of those voyages. In the circumstances her Honour’s direction was insufficient to ensure that the jury did not misuse the evidence. 
      
       
     22   It seems to me that it must have been obvious to the jury that the Crown relied upon evidence of the transatlantic voyages only to show that the appellant must have suspected Del Prado’s purpose in organising them. That was the basis upon which the Crown Prosecutor made his final address to the jury. Nowhere was it suggested to the jury that the evidence proved the carriage of cocaine to Spain. This may explain why defence counsel sought no further direction after the portion of the summing-up now complained of. Her Honour was never requested to instruct the jury that they could not use the evidence of the transatlantic voyages as demonstrating any tendency of the appellant to import drugs. 
      
       
     23   In my opinion because of the way in which the case was conducted there was no risk of the misuse by the jury of the evidence for the purpose now contended for. I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
      
       
     24   The third ground of appeal asserted error in the trial judge in admitting evidence from certain witnesses, namely Aidan Banham, Allan Banham, Wendy McDonald and Judith McTaggett. 
      
       
     25   Aidan Banham said that in February 1998 he entered into an agreement with Campillo to let to him for cash a house in Taree. Campillo used to pay the rent in cash. 
      
       
     26   Allan Banham said that after falling into arrears, Campillo brought the rent up to date in October 1998, explaining that he had been overseas. The last payment was for four weeks made on 11 November 1998. 
      
       
     27   Wendy McDonald said that she saw Campillo when he moved into the house in February 1998. She saw him thereafter. She realised in August 1998 that she had not seen him for about three months. She saw him again later in the year. 
      
       
     28   Judith McTaggett said that on 13 March 1998 Campillo rented storage space from her and that in May the same year he paid her six months’ rent in advance. She said that he attended in December the same year and said that he had lost his keys and cut the lock to the storage unit. He went to another unit where he again cut off the lock, took out a boat trailer and attached it to the back of his four-wheel drive vehicle. 
      
       
     29   The evidence of these witnesses also established that on an occasion or occasions Campillo drove a red Commodore, which towed a boat trailer, and a green Range Rover. 
      
       
     30   It was submitted that the evidence ought not to have been admitted because it was irrelevant as being incapable of rationally affecting directly or indirectly the assessment of the probability of the existence of any fact in issue: Evidence Act s 56. It was submitted that the fact that Campillo rented premises was not by itself evidence of any preparation or relevant to any joint enterprise in relation to which the appellant was being tried. It was submitted that there was no evidence that the red Commodore and the boat trailer were not the items which were to be stored in the units. 
      
       
     31   Alternatively it was submitted that the evidence ought to have been excluded under what was called the discretion of the trial judge under s 137 Evidence Act. In fact, relevantly, the section contains no discretion because, for present purposes, all it provides is that if the probative value of any evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, the evidence must be excluded. 
      
       
     32   The evidence showed, if accepted, that on 8 October 1998 Campillo spoke by telephone from Adelaide to the co-appellant in Spain, telling her that he would “go up the east coast” and would “fix up everything and will pay all the bills and return”. The jury might have thought that conversation referred to an intention on the part of Campillo to pay up the rent which, according to the witnesses whose evidence is complained of, he ultimately did. The Crown case was that Campillo’s arrangements had only one purpose, namely to provide for the arrival of the cargo from the Maeva. In my opinion there is no substance in the submissions and this ground of appeal should fail. 
      
       
     33   The next ground of appeal complained about the way her Honour dealt with the evidence in the summing-up. Her Honour dealt with it only in summarising the case against the co-appellant. Even so, it is submitted on appeal that her Honour ought to have warned the jury that the evidence was admitted only against that party and not against the appellant. 
      
       
     34   The implication in the submission is that in the absence of such a direction the jury might misuse the evidence in the case against the appellant. It is not explained how that might have happened, and I do not understand how the jury could have misused the evidence. This may explain why her Honour was not asked to say any more about the matter. In my opinion the submissions are misconceived and I would refuse the leave which is necessary before the appellant may argue this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     35   The next ground of appeal complains about her Honour’s asserted failure to direct the jury that they could only use against the co-appellant evidence of out of court admissions made by her. According to the evidence of Meggett, the co-appellant told him that it was a good idea to put drugs in the dinghy and, on another occasion, that a Boston Whaler to which she was referring was exactly the same as one that they had brought in at Miami. 
      
       
     36   Before the jury was evidence of many admissions made by the appellant himself, including conversations with Meggett about the transatlantic voyages, conversations with Meggett and Del Prado about the voyage of the Maeva, in particular the arrangement made between the appellant and Del Prado to change over Maeva’s dinghy in the Caribbean, and in numerous intercepted telephone conversations between the appellant, the co-appellant and Campillo. 
      
       
     37   In the circumstances there was little risk that the jury would misuse admissions by the co-accused. This may explain why trial counsel did not request any direction such as is now contended for. I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
      
       
     38   The last ground argued in the appeal against conviction was that the verdict was unreasonable or incapable of being supported by the evidence. It was pointed out that there was no direct evidence of knowledge on the part of the appellant that the dinghy contained cocaine. It was submitted that the case put forward by the appellant, that he was assisting a friend in delivering a boat to Australia to refit it and sail it, was a reasonable conclusion on all the facts and consistent with the innocence of the appellant and that the jury ought therefore to have had a reasonable doubt about his guilt. 
      
       
     39   It seems to me that on Meggett’s evidence alone the jury were entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew full well that the cargo he was playing a part in importing was cocaine. 
      
       
     40   The other evidence supported such a conclusion, establishing that the appellant travelled from Florida to Coffs Harbour for no other purpose than to meet the Maeva, waiting there for the yacht for nine days, travelling to Sydney immediately after its arrival and after meeting Meggett only briefly, returning to Coffs Harbour and remaining there for about 18 hours and there doing nothing more than assist in getting the dinghy off the yacht and across to the boat ramp. 
      
       
     41   There was a further body of evidence which was capable independently in my view of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the dinghy contained narcotics. The transcripts are of conversations which took place on forty three occasions between 9 July and 7 December 1998 which are too numerous to set out in full in this judgment. The appellant participated in many of them. In my opinion they alone were capable of demonstrating beyond reasonable doubt that he had the knowledge that was necessary for the Crown to prove its case. 
      
       
     42   In my opinion this ground of appeal also should fail and the appeal against conviction should fail. 
      
       
     43   Her Honour sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for life and imposed a non-parole period of twenty five years. It was submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Her Honour found that the role of the applicant was more important than that of Meggett. She described him as “a mid level executive”. It was submitted that that finding was against the evidence and it was Meggett who had inveigled the appellant to become involved in the importation. 
      
       
     44   It was submitted that the finding about middle management was inconsistent with the evidence about what the appellant did on the journey between Central America and Australia, such as assisting in obtaining supplies and the like. It was submitted that the real role of the appellant was to be a contact between Meggett and Del Prado or alternatively that he assisted with funds and physical assistance. 
      
       
     45   I do not accept these submissions. This is not a Court of rehearing, but of error. There was evidence upon which her Honour could have found the facts about which the appellant complains, and her Honour was in my view entitled to make the findings that she did. 
      
       
     46   Then it was submitted that the categorisation alone of the appellant as of mid level management required the imposition of less than the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislation or at least pointed to a sentence less than the maximum. I disagree. What must be looked at in my opinion is what exactly the offender did. It seems to me that it rarely will be possible to know what an offender did merely by the use of a concise description or label. See R v Wong & Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420. 
      
       
     47   What her Honour did find after reciting the facts to which I have referred was that the appellant supervised the importation and reported to Del Prado from time to time. In my opinion the head sentence and the non-parole period were well within the range of her Honour’s sentencing discretion having found that that was substantially what the appellant did. 
      
       
     48   Finally, the appellant submitted that he had a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of a comparison with his sentence and that imposed on Meggett. Meggett was sentenced by Wood CJ at CL. His Honour found that Meggett was a mere courier. The starting point for the sentence his Honour imposed was thirty years’ imprisonment. That was reduced to take account of the lack of remissions in New South Wales and to allow for Meggett’s plea of guilty and other subjective matters. But for the assistance offered by Meggett his Honour would have imposed a sentence of sixteen years with a non-parole period of twelve years. 
      
       
     49   It was submitted that the relevant sentence for purposes of comparison was the commencing sentence of thirty years and that a sentence of life imprisonment was disproportionate. 
      
       
     50   In my opinion there is no substance in that submission. Given that Wood CJ at CL’s conclusion was that Meggett was a mere courier and that her Honour’s conclusion was that the appellant played a much more senior role in the importation, there appears to me to be no disparity at all between the individual sentences imposed. 
      
       
     51   I would dismiss the appeal against conviction, grant leave to appeal against the sentence but dismiss the appeal against sentence. 
      
       
     52   DOWD J: I agree with the orders proposed by Barr J and his reasons therefor. 
      
       
     53   GREG JAMES J: As I do also.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JFriday, 15 June 200170052/00 - REGINA v Whalid IRANI70210/00 - REGINA v Asipeli Ben SAKISISENTENCE1   HIS HONOUR: On 4 July 2000 and 12 July 2000 the offenders Whalid Irani and Asipeli Ben Sakisi were committed to this Court for trial on charges respectively of murder and accessory before the fact of murder. On 1 December 2000 Sakisi pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of accessory before the fact of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Irani pleaded not guilty and his trial was fixed to commence on 12 March 2001. On 5 February 2001 he changed his plea to guilty of murder. 
     
      
    2   The deceased, Richard Piech, was employed as an accountant by a large retail organisation. His duties included the supervision of accounting staff. One of his staff was an accounts payable clerk whom I shall call X. Between June 1999 and January 2000 X defrauded the company by substituting account particulars of herself and others for the particulars of legitimate creditors of the organisation, so diverting payments intended for those creditors into the accounts of herself and her colleagues. Altogether about $290,000 was diverted in this manner. X resigned her employment but agreed to work on until a replacement could be found. She intended to use the remaining period of her employment to execute one or more major fraudulent transfers to obtain further large sums of money. She feared that if she did so Mr Piech would find her out, so she devised a plan which if successful would make him unable to attend work for two or three weeks. She approached Sakisi, whom she knew, and told him that she wanted a person out of work for a little while. She wanted Sakisi to give him “a little touch up”, which he understood to mean “just hit him”. She said that she wanted the person bashed hard enough to be off work for two weeks. She asked Sakisi if he knew anybody who would do the job and said that she would pay $2,500 to $3,000. Sakisi got in touch with Irani, whom he knew but whom X did not know, and passed on the message. Irani expressed interest. X provided the two with details of Mr Piech, including a description of what he looked like and particulars of his residential address and car registration and telephone numbers. An agreement was made with X that Irani and Sakisi would receive $3,000 each. 
     
      
    3   On 17 December 1999 Irani, Sakisi and a friend of Sakisi, Ms Kaycee Salem, went in Irani’s car to the vicinity of Mr Piech’s home unit to reconnoitre. On 20 December 1999 the three went with X to a club where they expected Mr Piech to be. X pointed him out to Irani. Mr Piech left the club and Irani drove to the vicinity of Mr Piech’s home unit to await his arrival. He took with him a hammer an a knife. He encountered Mr Piech as he was walking along the footpath, took the hammer and hit him on the head. Mr Piech was stunned but managed to struggle with Irani, who dropped the hammer. Irani then produced the knife and stabbed Mr Piech six times. In the blow which killed him the knife entered the upper left chest, perforating the left lung and the aorta. The struggle between Irani and Mr Piech made enough noise to attract the attention of neighbours. One of them saw Irani get into his car and drive off. She recognised him as the man she had seen loitering near Mr Piech’s home unit on the earlier occasion. She gave a description of the car and the registration number sufficient for Irani to be traced. 
     
      
    4   On 13 January 2000 police spoke to Irani about the matter. In a formal interview at the police station he denied involvement in and knowledge of the murder of Mr Piech. He was released without charge. 
     
      
    5   The police continued their inquiries and arrested him on 25 January 2000. In a fresh interview he admitted killing Mr Piech. He said that Sakisi had introduced him to X about one to two months before the killing. X said that she wanted someone to break Mr Piech’s knees or legs or stab him in the hips or legs to make sure that he did not go to work. She promised money to whoever did the job and it was agreed that he and Sakisi would each receive $3,000. He admitted going to Mr Piech’s home unit on 17 December 1999 and waiting for him to go home on 20 December. He said that he would have attacked Mr Piech at the club, but he was in the company of a woman and there was a security guard nearby. He admitted walking past Mr Piech after he had parked his car, turning round and hitting him on the head with the hammer. He said that he dropped the hammer and that Mr Piech punched him. He admitted pulling out the knife and said that he went to stab him around the hip, leg or thigh. Mr Piech fell and Irani realised that he had stabbed him in the chest. He panicked, drove away and threw the knife into a river. He said that he had taken the knife “just in case something happened”. He said that he was desperate for cash to buy drugs and intended to injure Mr Piech but not to kill him. He said that he was prepared to give evidence against the other offenders. 
     
      
    6   On 8 February 2000, in a further formal interview, Irani confirmed his preparedness to give evidence. 
     
      
    7   On 25 January 2000 police arrested Sakisi and took him to the police station. In a formal interview he told them that he had introduced Irani to X about one month before the killing. He knew that X was taking money at work and that she suspected that Mr Piech knew something about it. He knew that she wanted him put off work for about two weeks and that she would pay money to whoever did it. He admitted going to Mr Piech’s home unit on 17 December 1999 and being at the club on 20 December. He recalled X saying something like, “stab him, bash him, kill him if you want, I don’t give a fuck as long as he doesn’t go to work”. 
     
      
    8   He said that he had received $600 from X on her first request and a further $500 after Mr Piech’s death, $450 of which he gave to Irani. 
     
      
    9   Ms Salem was arrested on 25 January 2000 and took part in a formal police interview. She told a series of untruths to a point at which the interview was interrupted and she spoke to Sakisi. When the interview was resumed she changed her story to one which accorded with the facts as I have generally outlined them and offered to give evidence if required. In due course she received an indemnity from the Attorney General on condition that she give evidence. 
     
      
    10   Irani was born on 1 January 1980 in Lebanon and grew up in a stable family. He came with them to Australia when he was eleven years old. He attended the local high school. He started smoking cannabis at age thirteen or fourteen years and at fifteen began smoking heroin. He was soon addicted. He tried selling drugs and stealing to fund his habit, which was costing him between $100 and $150 per day. He missed time from school and did poorly in the HSC. He began attending TAFE but dropped out of an accounting diploma after six months or so and out of an information technology course after a further two months. He has had a number of casual jobs, the longest as a printer for two and a half years, including four months full time. He began taking cocaine in 1998. He was concerned about his inability to shake off the habit and twice during 1999 was admitted to the Wollongong Crisis Centre to try to control his use of drugs. On the second occasion he completed a four-week course. That course proved ineffective, however, and when he was invited by Sakisi to arrange to assault Mr Piech for money he found the temptation irresistible. He intended to use the money to buy drugs. 
     
      
    11   Irani has been held in custody since his arrest on 25 January 2000. Since then he has undertaken elementary courses in business and information technology and hopes to commence an information technology course by external study with a tertiary institution. 
     
      
    12   A psychiatric report written by Dr Westmore and a psychological report written by Ms Barrier were put before the Court. In combination they show that Irani is selfish, impulsive, insensitive to the concerns of others and at times ruthless. He is anxious and despondent. There is no severe personality pathology and no mental illness. 
     
      
    13   In June 2000 Irani told Dr Westmore, that he had killed the deceased and gave an accurate description of events. He said that he knew that his behaviour was wrong. Even so, he continued to plead not guilty until his trial was imminent. 
     
      
    14   After he changed his plea to guilty he saw Ms Barrier. He told her that he recognised the seriousness of his crime and felt particularly sorry for Mr Piech’s mother. He wondered whether she would ever forgive him. 
     
      
    15   He told me in evidence that he felt really sorry for Mr Piech’s family. 
     
      
    16   I have some hesitation in accepting at face value Irani’s expressions of contrition in view of the fact that he delayed changing his plea until a point thirteen months after his arrest and a few weeks before his trial was due to commence. Even so, his expressions of remorse and his plea of guilty are some evidence of contrition. 
     
      
    17   His plea of guilty sounds independently in sentencing, however, because he has saved the community the time and expense of a trial. 
     
      
    18   Irani confirmed in evidence before me that he would provide a further statement for the police if asked and would give evidence against X in accordance with his statements. The Court may for that reason impose a lesser sentence than it otherwise would. S 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act sets forth matters the Court must consider when deciding whether to reduce the sentence in such circumstances and by how much. I will deal separately with those I consider important in the present case. 
     
      
    19   There is no evidence about the effect the death of Mr Piech has had upon his mother and the rest of his family, but their loss is grave and cannot be made good. They must have suffered and it is proper to infer that they will continue to suffer. 
     
      
    20   No assessment is yet possible of the significance and usefulness of the assistance Irani is likely to give, but if he gives evidence in accordance with the general account he has given it is proper to assume that the authorities will be significantly assisted when the offender gives evidence. The value of the assistance has to be seen in the light of the assistance the authorities have been entitled to expect following upon the indemnity granted to Ms Salem. 
     
      
    21   Although the offender offered his assistance when first interviewed by the police, that offer was of no value while he continued to exercise his right to plead not guilty. It is therefore inappropriate to deal with him as though his assistance had been made available at the earliest opportunity. 
     
      
    22   When this matter was first listed before me I adjourned the hearing at the request of defence counsel because it was desired to have the offender moved into a secure position within the Corrective Services system. Upon resumption the Court was informed that the offender no longer desired to be put into protective custody, though he did hope to be sent in due course to be held in a place where it would be difficult for anyone of ill will to come near him. In the circumstances I think it appropriate to suppose that the offender may need to go into protective custody and suffer thereby the restrictions that such a regime ordinarily implies, though I do not consider this matter of great relative importance. 
     
      
    23   It will often be appropriate for the Court to quantify the effect of a plea of guilty, especially of its utilitarian value, on a sentence. For entirely separate reasons it will often be desirable for the Court to say by how much any sentence is reduced on account of actual or promised assistance to the authorities. I do not consider it appropriate to quantify either discount in the present case because I am obliged to weigh the value not only of those two features but of the plea of guilty and of other matters as evidence of contrition. I think it inappropriate merely to quantify each of a number of separate favourable features each of which might qualify for a reduction in sentence and add them together. There is a substantial overlap between the considerations relevant to each. Moreover, the overall reduction must not produce a sentence less than is required to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    24   Irani has a record of offending that must be regarded as moderate in view of his heavy addiction to illegal drugs. He has never been convicted of any offence of violence. 
     
      
    25   His chances of rehabilitation seem to me to depend totally upon whether he can separate himself from the need to take the continuous cocktails of drugs he has consumed in recent times. I expect that he will be offered courses whilst in custody to help him to do so. He has already made some progress in completing such courses and is well regarded by those who have the care of him. 
     
      
    26   He has strong support from his family, who have visited him regularly in custody and they will continue to back him in his efforts at rehabilitation. 
     
      
    27   I think, in view of these matters and of the long non-parole period it will be necessary to impose, that there are reasonable prospects that he will be able to put drugs behind him, learn to take a responsible place in the community and not reoffend. 
     
      
    28   A contract murder done with intent to kill would have attracted the maximum sentence. No allowance would be appropriate for the offender’s addiction to drugs and what he saw as his lack of choice when offered money for his services. Of course, this was not a contract to kill and I am obliged to sentence the offender upon the basis that he agreed and intended only to do Mr Piech grievous bodily harm. That removes this murder from the worst category of murders, but the crime was still very serious because Irani acted in cold blood and for reward and planned his attack with a great deal of care. I consider it appropriate to impose a sentence comprising a term of years. I have reduced the sentence by about forty per cent to take account of all the favourable features I have mentioned. 
     
      
    29   I have considered whether to set a non-parole period less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence but I think that the period of parole I have allowed for will be adequate to achieve all the purposes of parole. 
     
      
    30   Sakisi was born on 31 August 1976 in New Zealand. His parents separated when he was a few months old and he went to live with relatives in Tonga. He came to Australia with his father and his de facto wife in 1998. The household was a violent one and his father was an alcoholic. The offender left and lived on the streets for some time. Later on he was adopted by an aunt and an uncle. Although he went to school, he stayed away a lot and received little education there. He studied for his school certificate whilst kept in a juvenile institution. He has completed the first stage of a pre-apprenticeship course in carpentry at TAFE. 
     
      
    31   Up to the age of seventeen years he was dealt with on a number of occasions in the Children’s Court for offences of violence. In 1995 he was sentenced by the Local Court to serve a fixed term of two months’ imprisonment for taking a conveyance without consent. In 1996 he was given a four year term, with a minimum term of two years six months, for a number of offences comprising maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and assault. 
     
      
    32   He began smoking cannabis at the age of fourteen years and continued to use it throughout his teenage years. In 1998 he began using heroin and cocaine. He is still addicted to the use of those drugs and intended to use the money he expected to receive from X to buy drugs. 
     
      
    33   He was assaulted when he was sixteen years old. He was apparently under the influence of alcohol at the time and suffered some loss of consciousness. He was taken to hospital and was kept there for some weeks. A depressed fracture of the left parietal skull was relieved. 
     
      
    34   He was interviewed for the purposes of sentence by Mr John Taylor, forensic psychologist and Dr Jonathan Carne, psychiatrist. Mr Taylor carried out neuropsychological tests and concluded that his intellectual functioning was in the low average range and that test results suggested that he had always probably functioned at about that level. He thought that the tests did not strongly indicate the presence of cognitive impairment arising from brain damage. 
     
      
    35   Dr Carne found no evidence of abnormality in thought processes, perceptions or beliefs and no evidence of psychosis, delusions or hallucinations. He thought that Sakisi had personality disorder with significant anti-social characteristics. 
     
      
    36   Mr Taylor thought it possible that the head injury had led to the impairment in Sakisi of judgmental abilities and may have resulted in greater impulsiveness. However, there is no support from the report of Dr Carne for those tentative conclusions and I do not think that such considerations are relevant in the present case. Sakisi did not act impulsively but took part in a number of steps designed to ensure that the attack was successfully carried out. 
     
      
    37   Sakisi volunteered to Mr Taylor and Dr Carne that he was sorry for what he had done. At the same time he said that he had had no desire to hurt the victim, which was plainly untrue insofar as Sakisi was speaking about his desire to have Mr Piech hurt. 
     
      
    38   However, I think that the expression of remorse was genuine in view of the early admissions Sakisi made to the investigating police officers and to the early plea of guilty. 
     
      
    39   For sentencing purposes the fact of the unfortunate death of Mr Piech must be put aside. The offence of which Sakisi has been convicted contemplated only the infliction of grievous bodily harm. The criminality involved the meetings and planning to which I have referred. It was done coolly and for financial gain and in utter contempt of Mr Piech, a man whom Sakisi did not know and who had done him no offence. These features combine to make the offence a very serious one of its kind. The fact that the money was required for drugs does not mitigate Sakisi’s criminality. 
     
      
    40   Because of his anti-social and aggressive personality and his addiction to drugs, Sakisi will not find it easy to serve his sentence. I note Dr Carne’s opinion about the risk that Sakisi may commit suicide in custody. For the same reasons he will not find rehabilitation easy to achieve, but I think that there are prospects that he may achieve it. It seems to me that his low intelligence and other personality difficulties combine to make it necessary to impose a non-parole period which is less than three-quarters of the sentence I intend to fix. 
     
      
    41   I have deducted about fifteen per cent for the utilitarian aspect only of the plea of guilty. That is because the community has been saved the expense of a trial which would have lasted two or three weeks. 
     
      
    42   Whalid Irani you are sentenced to imprisonment for a period of twenty years, commencing on 25 January 2000 and expiring on 24 January 2020. I fix a non-parole period of fifteen years, which will expire on 24 January 2015, on which day you will be eligible for release to parole. 
     
      
    43   Asipeli Ben Sakisi you are sentenced to imprisonment for a period of ten years commencing on 25 January 2000 and expiring on 24 January 2010. I fix a non-parole period of seven years which will expire on 24 January 2007. You will be eligible for release to parole on that day. 
     
      
    44   I direct that a copy of the report of Dr Carne dated 8 February 2001 be sent to the governor of the institution where Sakisi is confined.

       DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS v Malcolm SINTON 
       
      
      
       
      Summary of Facts: 
       
       
      The Respondent was charged with the indictable offences of Dangerous Driving Occasioning Death and Dangerous Driving Occasioning Grievous Bodily Harm. He was also charged with the related summary offence of Negligent Driving. He was acquitted on the indictable offences at trial. The prosecuting authority failed to hand up a certificate detailing the related summary offence at committal, as required under Part 10 of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
       1986. A Magistrate held that the failure to produce such a certificate meant that the respondent lost the opportunity to have the Negligent Driving charge determined at the time of trial and ordered a permanent stay. The respondent appealed to the Supreme Court, where O’Keefe J held that compliance by the prosecuting authority with Part 10 of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
       was essential and failure to do so vitiating. He also found that the respondent’s lost opportunity caused a sufficient prejudice to the respondent to justify a permanent stay. This is an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from the decision of O’Keefe J.  
       
       
      Held: 
       
       
      By Stein, Giles and Hodgson JJA agreeing: 
       
       
      1) Part 10 of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
       does not constitute a complete code so as to make the requirement of the provision of a certificate detailing related summary or back-up charges at committal absolute and thereby deprive the trial court of jurisdiction. 
       
       
      2) The respondent lost no opportunity to seek to have the trial court hear and determine the related summary offence of Negligent Driving. The respondent himself was not prevented from seeking that the trial court deal with the related charge. In any event, the trial judge retained a discretion not to hear the summary charge and the prosecuting authority’s consent to the determination of such at that time was necessary. 
       
       
      3) The failure of the prosecuting authority to produce a certificate at committal was not a fundamental defect going to the root of the trial so that there was nothing which could be done to relieve the unfair consequences. The circumstances cannot be seen as so unusual or exceptional to justify a permanent stay.

       DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS v Malcolm SINTON 
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1    STEIN JA: 
      
      Introduction 
       
     2    This is an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) for leave to appeal, and if granted an appeal, from a judgment of O’Keefe J delivered on 31 May 2000. The decision of his Honour was itself the hearing of a summons appealing from the decision of a magistrate permanently staying the prosecution of the respondent for negligent driving. 
      
       
      Facts 
     3    The respondent, a serving police officer, was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 5 November 1997 in which a person was killed and another injured. He was subsequently charged with the indictable offences of driving in a manner dangerous occasioning death and driving in a manner dangerous occasioning grievous bodily harm, under ss 52A(1) and 52A(3) respectively of the Crimes Act 1900. The respondent was also charged with the summary offence of negligent driving under s 4(1) of the Traffic Act 1909.4    At the Local Court on 23 September 1998 the respondent was committed for trial in the District Court on the two indictable offences. In the presence of the respondent and at the time of the committal, in compliance with s 34A(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (the Act), the prosecutor informed the magistrate that there was a ‘back-up charge’ (in fact a related offence) of negligent driving laid against the respondent. However, the prosecutor, by way of oversight, did not produce to the magistrate a certificate under s 34A(1)(b) of the Act specifying this charge. There was therefore a lack of compliance by the prosecuting authority with that sub-section of the Act.5    On 14 October 1998 a Notice of Readiness to Proceed was given by the DPP to the Criminal Listing Directorate under Regulation 9 of the Act. This notice included reference to ‘Related summary charges: Negligent Driving’.6    In July 1999 the respondent stood trial in the District Court on the two charges of dangerous driving, and on 29 July the jury, at the direction of the trial judge, returned verdicts of not guilty. After the delivery of the verdicts, no application was made by either the Crown or the respondent to have the trial judge deal with the related offence of negligent driving pursuant to s 35(2) of the Act.7    The negligent driving charge was subsequently listed before the Local Court at Wollongong. The respondent argued that, as the certificate had not been produced to the committing magistrate by the prosecuting authority, the charge of negligent driving was no longer within the jurisdiction of the Local Court. The magistrate rejected this submission. The respondent’s further argument, that the proceeding should be permanently stayed because of the failure of the prosecuting authority to produce such a certificate was, however, accepted by the magistrate. He found that the obligation upon the prosecuting authority to produce the certificate was mandatory, and that the failure to so produce it may have meant that the proceedings were not before the District Court at the time of trial and the respondent therefore lost the opportunity to have the negligent driving charge disposed of at the time of his trial, when all the evidence was before the judge. His Worship found that this lost opportunity may well have been an injustice to the respondent. Accordingly, on 13 December 1999, he ordered a permanent stay. 8    The DPP, by summons in the Supreme Court, appealed from the order of the magistrate and sought orders that the proceedings against the respondent for negligent driving be remitted to the magistrate to be heard and determined. O’Keefe J dismissed the summons on 31 May 2000, finding that compliance by the prosecuting authority with its obligation to produce a certificate to the committing magistrate was essential, and that non-compliance with the Act vitiating. His Honour found that the failure to produce a certificate deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to deal with the related offence under Part 10 of the Act, and further that the magistrate had correctly found that the respondent’s lost opportunity caused a sufficient prejudice to justify a permanent stay. 
      
      History and Purpose of Part 10 the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
       1986 
     9    Part 10 was inserted into the Act by the Criminal Procedure Legislation (Amendment) Act 1990. It allows a trial court to deal with a ‘related summary offence’, or back-up offence, at the conclusion of a trial, subject to the consent of the defendant and the prosecution. The provisions of Part 10 clearly demonstrate that it was principally concerned with the conferral of jurisdiction with respect to summary offences upon the Supreme Court and the District Court. It was directed at achieving a more efficient use of court time, and at reducing wastage of time and inconvenience to the parties and witnesses by avoiding the need to later return to the Local Court to have a related summary offence heard and determined.  
     10    In the second reading speech on 24 October 1990 the Attorney-General set out the purpose of adding Part 10 to the Act. He stated: 
      
       
        
        [The proposal] will allow a trial court to deal with back-up summary matters at the completion of a trial. At present these summary matters must be determined by the Local Court even where the trial judge has heard evidence which would be relevant to the summary matter. The bill will allow the trial judge, at the conclusion of the trial, to determine or dismiss any related summary offence. The consent of the defendant and the prosecution will be required before a matter can be dealt with in this manner and, should it be inappropriate for the matter to be dealt with in this way, it can be remitted to the Local Court to be disposed of in the usual manner. It is intended that summary matters which are complex or lengthy will not be dealt with in the trial court, but will instead be remitted to the Local Court for determination in the usual way. 
        
       
       
        
        I should explain that the present procedure is that where it is patently clear that a summary matter cannot proceed because the necessary ingredients - the head charge - in the particular trial is missing and will be missing in the summary offence, the police must take it back before the Local Court for mention. The matter then either does not proceed or no evidence is offered.  
        This is time consuming for prosecution authorities and, in some cases, for witnesses. 
         In appropriate cases this is a means of resolving the matter. In due course it will become obvious what are appropriate matters to be referred to the Local Court to be dealt with in the usual way. (emphasis added) (Hansard Legislative Assembly 24 October 1990 at p 9160) 
        
       
     11    Part 10 of the Act was amended by the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 1997, as it appeared that the 1990 provisions were being underutilised. The Minister introducing the Bill attributed the underutilisation of the provisions in part because: 
      
       
        
         … it is often unclear to the trial court, and to the prosecutor, which summary matters are related to which indictable matters, and in some cases whether or not those summary matters are actually ‘back-up’ matters or are merely other related summary matters. Accordingly, trial courts often decline to deal with any of the summary matters, electing instead to allow a Local Court to sort them out at some later time. The consequent management and disposal of pending back-up and related summary matters takes up a significant amount of Local Court time. … 
         
         
        …The amendments will require the prosecuting authority to tender to the Local Court, at the time of Committal for trial, a certificate detailing, in respect of each charge to be dealt with on indictment, any ‘back-up’ summary offences, and any other related summary offences… The proposal will ensure that clear information is provided to the trial court as to what summary matters exist, and whether those summary matters are ‘back-up’ summary matters or merely ‘related’ summary matters. (Hansard Legislative Assembly 7 May 1997 at p 8252) 
         
        
       
     12    The requirements upon the prosecuting authority under s 34A of the Act, to inform the magistrate of any related summary offence, and to produce a certificate to that effect, clearly sought to achieve a greater use by trial courts of the jurisdiction conferred upon them by Part 10 of the Act to determine such offences at the conclusion of the trial. However, it appears that there has been no procedure or requirement introduced which requires or facilitates the transmission of a certificate from the committing Local Court to the trial court.13    Further amendments to the Act in 1998 inserted new definitions of ‘related offence’ and ‘back-up offence’ into s 34. The purpose was to ensure that the trial court is able to address, not only related summary matters which arise under substantially the same circumstances as are the subject of the trial, but also related indictable matters that are capable of being dealt with summarily, thereby enhancing court efficiency as the need for a separate re-listing in the Local Court is removed. This left the sections most relevant to this case in the following form: 34 Definitions and application (1) In this Part: 
      
       
        
         
          
          back up offence

      Court means the Supreme Court or District Court. 
      
       
        
         
          
          Related offence 
          , in relation to an indictable offence, means an offence: 
           
           
          (a) that is: 
           
            
           
           (i) a summary offence, or 
           
           
            
            (ii) an indictable offence that is capable of being dealt with summarily by a Local Court in accordance with the provisions of Part 9A, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) that arises from substantially the same circumstances as those from which the first indictable offence has arisen, but does not include a back up offence. 
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (2) This Part extends to proceedings commenced, but not concluded, before the commencement of this Part. 
        
       
     34A Certification of back up and related offences (1) On committal for trial of a person charged with an indictable offence:  
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) the prosecuting authority must inform the Magistrate (or justice or justices) as to whether or not the person has been charged with any back up offence or related offence, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) if the person has been charged with any back up offence or related offence, the prosecuting authority is to produce to the court a certificate specifying each back up offence and related offence with which the person has been charged. 
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (2) This section does not prevent the person referred to in subsection (1) being charged with any offence after committal. 
        
       
     35 Manner of dealing with certain offences related to indictable offences 
      
       
        
        (1) If at the conclusion of the trial of an accused person for an indictable offence, a court finds the accused person guilty of the offence, the court: 
        
       
        
       
        
         
          
          (a) is (unless it considers it inappropriate in the circumstances to do so) to order that the charge in relation to each back up offence be dismissed, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) may deal with any back up offence the charge for which is not dismissed under paragraph (a) and any related offence with which the accused person has been charged in accordance with this Part. 
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (1A) If at the conclusion of the trial of an accused person for an indictable offence, a court finds the accused person not guilty of the offence, the court may deal with any back up offence or related offence with which the person has been charged in accordance with this Part. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A court may deal with any back up offence referred to in subsection (1)(b) or (1A) or a related offence on its own motion, or on the application of the accused person or the prosecutor, but may not do so unless both the accused person and the prosecutor have consented to the offence being deal with under this Part. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Except as provided by subsection (1), nothing in this section requires a court to deal with a back up offence or related offence under this Part. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A court may deal with a back up offence or related offence with which an accused person has been charged even though it is not doing so in relation to a back up offence or related offence with which another accused person in the same proceedings is charged. 
        
       
     14    Yet another amendment occurred with the Crime Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999 whereby Part 10 was renumbered Part 2 Division 4 of the Act and a new heading ‘Supreme Court and District Court may deal with certain summary offences relating to indictable offences’ inserted. At this time ss 34-37 were renumbered ss 35-39 respectively but were otherwise unchanged. For convenience, I will retain the old numbering of the relevant sections.15    In the Supreme Court O’Keefe J discussed the amendments to the Act and found that ‘as a consequence of this legislation a judicial gap was filled, albeit in a way that was entirely in the discretion of the Supreme Court or District Court’. His Honour held that the original 1990 amendments gave the trial court a general discretion as whether or not it would deal with a related summary offence, and as there was no requirement that the trial court address the matters, even with the consent of all parties, trial courts tended not to utilise the jurisdiction. This tendency resulted in further amendments to the Act. 
     16    It is apparent that the amendments with respect to back-up offences and related summary offences were designed to ensure the efficient administration of justice by conferring jurisdiction to deal with any such summary offences at the time of trial upon the District and Supreme Courts. The procedure to ensure that the trial court is aware of any such related summary offences involves the handing up of a certificate by the prosecuting authority detailing these charges at the time of committal. The question then arises as to whether a failure to so hand up a certificate, for which there is no clearly defined procedure (including its transmission to the court above), is fatal to the ability of the trial court to deal with the summary offence and results in such a prejudice to the respondent that a permanent stay of the summary proceedings is warranted. 
      
       
      The Decisions Below 
      
      
      The Local Court 
     17    As mentioned earlier, following the respondent’s acquittal in the District Court, the summons for negligent driving was relisted before a magistrate in the Local Court. After hearing argument, Mr Johnson LCM permanently stayed the prosecution of the respondent on the charge of negligent driving. He did not decide whether or not the failure to produce the certificate meant that the trial court had been without jurisdiction to deal with the summary offence. He considered the principles discussed by the High Court regarding the granting of a permanent stay, recognised that such a power was discretionary and to be exercised sparingly and only in exceptional cases, and held that a stay should be granted.18    The grounds upon which the magistrate exercised his discretion to grant a stay were the lost opportunity of the respondent to have the matter determined in the District Court, and the passage of time. These factors meant, according to his Worship, that the evidence which would have been presented before the Local Court would be unlikely to be the same as that which had been before the District Court. The magistrate noted that memories fade over time and, as a consequence, the re-creation of the situation from which the charges arose would not be as precise as it had been at the time of the trial. As a result of this and also of a different judicial mind being brought to bear on such evidence, a prospect existed of different findings being made in relation to the same set of circumstances. The magistrate held that this constituted a prejudice to the defendant which went to the root of the process of the hearing and determination of the matter, and that there was no means by which this prejudice could be relieved. He was accordingly of the view that: 
      
       
        
        This is one of those rare cases where exceptional circumstances have been established, where despite using the utmost caution, which I have endeavoured to do, it seems to me that this is a case where a permanent stay of proceedings should be granted and I do so. 
        
       
      
      
      The Supreme Court 
     19    The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed to the Supreme Court from the decision of the magistrate to grant a permanent stay seeking to have his decision set aside and the matter remitted for hearing and determination. 20    O’Keefe J discussed the purpose and effect of the statutory provisions in question and analysed the language used in s 34A of the Criminal Procedure Act with respect to informing the magistrate as to the charges and the production of a certificate as to the related summary charges. His Honour focused on the use of the phrase ‘must’ in s 34A(1)(a), where it is said that ‘The prosecuting authority must inform the magistrate (or justice or justices) as to whether or not the person has been charged with any back-up offence or related offence’, as compared to the use of the phrase ‘is to produce’ in s 34A(1)(b) where it is provided that ‘… the prosecuting authority is to produce to the court a certificate specifying each back-up offence and related offence with which the person has been charged.’ (emphasis added)21    His Honour examined, as an issue of construction, whether or not the phrase ‘is to produce’ is to be understood in the sense of a command or requirement, such as is the case with ‘must’, or whether it is merely facultative and enabling. O’Keefe J found that where like words or phrases are used within the same or related sections of an Act they will usually be given the same meaning. His Honour held that where a compound verb is used in Part 10 of the Act, it is used in the sense of a command and, therefore, the compound verb ‘is to produce’ should be understood as imposing a requirement. 22    His Honour discussed the benefits conferred by the adoption and later expansion of Part 10 of the Act. He referred to the benefits to the justice system, and noted what he regarded as valuable benefits conferred upon an accused. He stated: 
      
       
        
        When any [related or back-up] offences have been charged prior to the accused person’s committal for trial and the procedures specified in s 34A complied with, an accused person is put in a position of being able to make his or her election on an informed basis as to whether or not to give evidence at the trial of the indictable offence; a significant benefit that may impact upon, and be a very important factor in relation to, the trial process.  
        
       
     23    O’Keefe J went on to find that as: 
      
       
        
        The provision was not introduced solely for the benefit of the Crown. That being so, it is not up to the Crown to renounce such benefits by a failure or refusal to fulfil the commands included in s 34A(1)(a) and 1(b)…However as Sugerman J pointed out in  
        James v Roland 
         (1958) 75 WN (NSW) 473, where the procession is ‘something more than jus pro se introductum’, such an approach is inappropriate since a person ‘cannot renounce that which has been introduced for the benefit of another’ (at 478). 
        
       
     24    O’Keefe J held that s 34 is part of a ‘legislative continuum’ which is, in effect, a statutory code in which each provision is integral. He was of the opinion that Part 10 provides for and describes an entire process or regime, setting out a series of steps which must be followed so as to ensure a valid end result. Compliance by the Crown with s 34A is therefore regarded as a requirement within this process and, where such does not occur, the accused could suffer a substantial detriment. His Honour stated that ‘prosecuting authorities should know and comply with statutory provisions which require them to do something. They will not be encouraged to do so if they know they can fail to do so with impunity’. (at 21) His Honour purported to apply Tasker v Fullwood (1978) 1 NSWLR 20 and found that compliance with the provisions of Part 10 is essential and non-compliance vitiating.25    As a result of the failure of the prosecuting authority to hand up a certificate detailing any back-up or related charges at committal, his Honour held that the trial court was deprived of jurisdiction to deal with the negligent driving charge. The magistrate exercised his discretion in favour of the defendant on the grounds of the lost opportunity before the District Court and the passage of time, and this constituted a sufficient prejudice to justify a permanent stay. His Honour did not find any error in the exercise of discretion by the magistrate which constituted a proper basis for interfering, and therefore the permanent stay remained in place.  
      
      Arguments On Appeal 
     26    It was submitted on behalf of the DPP that while s 34A(1) imposes procedural obligations upon the prosecuting authority, it does not create any rights in a defendant. The failure to produce a certificate in no way affected the respondent’s rights at committal or his right to apply to have the related offence of negligent driving dealt with by the trial judge following his trial. As the respondent’s rights and entitlements were not affected by the absence of a certificate, it followed that the decision to grant a permanent stay was in error. 
     27    The DPP submitted that non-compliance by the prosecuting authority with s 34A(1)(b) of the Act did not deprive the District Court of jurisdiction to deal with a back-up or related offence. It contended that jurisdiction is not dependant upon compliance with s 34A(1) of the Act. Rather it is triggered by an application which is consented to, or by the Court’s own motion, and accordingly summary matters therefore remain in the Local Court unless and until jurisdiction is exercised under the Act. This submission is supported by the wording of s 34A(2), which does not prevent a person being charged with any summary offence after committal, and also by the omission of the legislature to include a requirement for the transmission of any such certificate from the committing Local Court to the trial court. This is said to be especially relevant when the lack of a central registry for Local Courts is considered. 28    It was further argued by the DPP that such a construction of the section is to be preferred as it promotes the purpose of Part 10, which is to facilitate and enhance court efficiency. Mr Marien, on behalf of the appellant, submitted that ‘the primary purpose was to assist the courts, both the trial court and the local court…by giving clarity’. His Honour’s construction would defeat these purposes because, even if the opponent made an application to have the trial judge hear the summary charge, which application was consented to by the Crown and accepted by the trial judge, it follows that as a certificate had not been presented, the trial court would lack jurisdiction. The appellant cited the majority decision in Project Blue Sky Inc v ABA (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 390 - 391 where it was said that the test in determining the validity of an act done in breach of a statutory requirement is: 
      
       
        
        [T]o ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid. This has been the preferred approach of courts in this country in recent years, particularly in NSW. In determining the question of purpose, regard must be had to ‘the language of the relevant provision and the scope and the object of the whole statute’.  
        
       
     29    The appellant further submitted that, in the event that this court found that the trial court was deprived of jurisdiction, the continuation of the proceedings in the Local Court did not constitute conduct of such an oppressive nature as to justify the exceptional step of ordering of a permanent stay. The respondent lost only the chance to have the summary charge dealt with by the trial judge, as any such hearing required the consent of the prosecution, and indeed the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion in favour of hearing and determining the matter. This, it argued, did not constitute a ‘fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial of such a nature that nothing that the trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences’: Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 111, Jago v District Court of NSW (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 34. 
     30    On the other hand, the respondent submitted that the decision of O’Keefe J was unexceptionable, as the obligation upon prosecuting authorities to produce a certificate, as set out in the Act, is positive and clear. The obligatory nature of the requirement, it was argued, can be drawn from the use of language in the legislation. It was submitted that a breach of the requirement must have real and tangible consequences, otherwise the statutory injunction in the provision would be nominal to the point of being meaningless. This proposition built upon the argument that the requirement to provide the certificate constituted a deliberate procedural step which is a necessary prerequisite for jurisdiction. The purpose of the legislation was submitted by senior counsel as being:  
      
       
        
        Firstly, to inform in a clear and specified way the committing magistrate as to what backup or related charges were also alleged against the defendant, but secondly to facilitate the passage of those summary proceedings from the Local Court to the District Court.  
        
       
     31    The respondent contended that the legislation constituted a ‘balanced package, which provides… obligations and benefits upon both sides of the criminal proceeding.’ 32    In addressing the prejudice found to exist by the magistrate, the respondent raised the issue of the seriousness of the charge involved, asserting that when this was taken into consideration, the prejudice suffered was no mere trifle.  
      
       
      Construction of the Act  
       
     33    The object and purpose of the relevant provisions is plain. It is to achieve a more efficient use of court time and to reduce time wastage and inconvenience to parties and witnesses in having to return to the Local Court to have a related summary offence determined. This was made abundantly clear by the second reading speech of the Attorney-General when Part 10 was introduced into the Act in 1990. 
     34    The objective was to save money, time and inconvenience for the court system and for the parties and witnesses. 
     35    However, by 1997, it had become apparent that the provisions were being under used. Back-up and related offences were still being dealt with by Local Courts and trial courts were often declining to deal with summary matters. 
     36    In an effort to rectify the situation the amendments introduced the requirement for the prosecutor to tender, at the time of committal in the Local Court, a certificate dealing with any back-up or related summary offence. The Minister, in the second reading speech, said that this would ‘ensure that clear information is provided to the trial court as to what summary matters exist … .’ 
     37    As I have mentioned, his Honour found that Part 10 provided and described an entire process or regime, setting forth a series of steps which must be followed. Failure of the Crown to follow this procedure could cause an accused to suffer a substantial detriment. 
     38    However, I am unable to accept that Part 10 provided for a complete code so as to make the requirement of the provision of a certificate to the Local Court at the time of committal absolute and lead to the deprivation of jurisdiction of the trial court. 
     39    There are a number of reasons why I have reached this view. First, the legislature did not, either by way of direct enactment or by way of reference to regulations, prescribe the form of the certificate or to specify who would be required to certify the accuracy of the information in the certificate. The DPP had to make up its own form of certificate. Secondly, and more importantly, the legislature failed to implement a system which required the Local Court to transmit the certificate to the trial court.  
     40    Neither the Act or regulation provides any guidance on these matters. Nor have any relevant rules of court been made. 
     41    If one of the objectives of the legislation is to provide clarity for the trial court and the parties, the lack of specificity in the statute fails fully to achieve this object. 
     42    His Honour found that the handing up of the certificate on committal was a procedural pre-condition to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Trial Court. I am unable to accept this construction. The prosecuting authorities are not bound by decisions made prior to committal regarding related or back-up summary offences. Under s 34A(2) summary charges can be brought after committal. There is no requirement for any certificate to be communicated to the Local or trial court if this occurs. 
     43    His Honour’s construction also leads to an obviously unintended consequence. The legislation provides in s 35(2) that a trial judge may deal with a related or back-up summary offence ‘on its own motion’ or on the application of either the accused or the prosecutor, if they both consent. In any event, s 35(3) makes it clear that the trial court still retains a discretion not to hear and determine the related or back-up summary offence. 
     44    The interpretation favoured by his Honour would mean that, absent a certificate, a trial judge could not deal with a related or back-up summary offence, of his or her motion, or at the request of both parties. For example, it would mean that if an accused, at the conclusion of the trial, asked the judge to deal with a related summary offence with the consent of the prosecutor, the trial court could not do so. His Honour’s construction would therefore defeat the purpose of the Act. 
     45    Further, and notwithstanding his Honour’s construction, if a related or back-up summary offence was charged after committal, the trial judge would have jurisdiction to deal with it, if seen fit, or if the parties consented to the court hearing and determining the matter. Again, this highlights the inconsistencies that his Honour’s construction may lead to. 
     46    There was an acknowledged failure on the part of the prosecutor to comply with s 34A(1)(b). The question to be asked is whether this breach results in the invalidity of any subsequent attempt to deal with the summary offence, either by the trial court at the conclusion of the trial, or subsequently by the Local Court. Given the object, scope and purpose of Part 10 of the Act, and the language used in s 34A(1), I cannot see how the failure was fatal to the process or affected the jurisdiction of either of the courts. 
     47    The better and most convenient construction of the provision, indeed of Part 10 as a whole, is the facilitation of the determination of related summary offences by the courts. It does not aid the clear objectives of the provision to find that a failure to tender a certificate upon committal is fatal to the whole system. Again, as I have said, his Honour’s construction defeats the obvious purpose of the provisions. 
     48    An accused person would be aware of any related or back-up summary charge, having been served with a summons. In this case, the respondent was in court at the time of committal when the prosecutor orally informed the magistrate of the existence of the summary related charge of negligent driving. He was also legally represented at the time. It is difficult to see what more the respondent would have learned from the handing up of the certificate. 
     49    Importantly, it seems clear that the respondent was not prevented from seeking that the trial court deal with the summary charge at the conclusion of his trial. His legal representative before the magistrate on 13 December 1999 acknowledged that no application was made to the trial judge and that, in any event, there was a need for the prosecutor to consent. He could have added that the trial judge retained a discretion not to hear the summary charge. 
     50    There may be many reasons why an accused would not make an application for a related summary offence to be dealt with at the end of a trial. These would often be matters of forensic tactics. We do not know the reason why no application was made to the District Court in this case. It could have been an oversight. It could have been with knowledge of the absence of the certificate, although there is no evidence of this. It could have been the desire to make a submission to the prosecuting authorities not to proceed with the summary offence. Indeed, this is what happened here. 
     51    It follows from the above that, in my opinion, the respondent lost no opportunity to seek to have the matter dealt with by the trial court, notwithstanding the absence of the certificate. His right to so seek, if it be properly seen as a right, was not curtailed, and was in any event a right subject to the consent of the prosecutor and the discretion of the judge. Further, the respondent has not been shown to have been misled in any way by the absence of the certificate. 
     52    In my discussion I have deliberately avoided reference to the mandatory/directory classification in determining the effect of non-compliance, applying Tasker v Fullwood as approved by the High Court in Project Blue Sky. 
     53    Further, I do not see that the issue is affected by his Honour’s construction of ‘is to produce’ in s 34A(1(b) as ‘must’, should that be correct. The same result flows from the construction which I favour. 
      
       
      Permanent Stay 
       
     54    On the construction which I favour, there being no loss of opportunity by the respondent to seek to have the negligent driving charge dealt with by the trial judge, the permanent stay imposed by the magistrate must go. It cannot be said that the failure to tender the certificate was a fundamental defect going to the root of the trial so that there was nothing which could be done to relieve the unfair consequences. See Barton v The Queen and Jago v The District Court of New South Wales. The prejudice suffered by the respondent, identified by the magistrate as failing memories and increased cost and delay, is not the type of relevant prejudice assigned by the High Court in Jago. See Mason CJ at 33 - 34. 
     55    The instant case is quite different from Brygel v Stewart-Thornton (1993) 67 A Crim R 243, relied on by the respondent, where the error in relation to the contents of the hand-up brief to be served on the defendant was seen as one which struck at the very root of the prescribed procedures. It had significance in the overall conduct of the committal. The consequences which flowed from the failure to comply with the requirement of the statute, having regard to its scope and purpose, lead to all that followed being rendered ineffective or null and void. Accident Compensation Commission v Murphy (1988) VR 444 applied. 
     56    In no way can the circumstances of this case be seen as so unusual or exceptional as to justify a permanent stay. The onus on the respondent to demonstrate that the prejudice he would suffer in the event of the matter proceeding in the Local Court could render that trial unfair, was not discharged. Indeed, far from it. The fact of fading memories, and the further delay and cost, were all possibilities if the prosecutor did not consent or the trial judge declined to hear the summary matter. In my opinion, the discretion inherent in the magistrate’s grant of a permanent stay clearly miscarried. 
     57    As observed by Bell J in R v Carver [1999] NSWCCA 135 (Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 11 June 1999) circumstances will ordinarily be extreme to justify a permanent stay. See The Queen v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 605 and 615 - 616 and Jago at 31, 60 and 76. See also Hunt CJ at CL in R v Helmling (Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 11 November 1993). 
     58    Accordingly, leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal upheld. The orders made by his Honour should be set aside. The permanent stay ordered by the magistrate should also be set aside and the information lain against the respondent should be remitted to the magistrate to hear and determine according to law. 
      
       
      Orders 
       
     59    The orders which I propose are as follows: 
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      2. Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      3. Respondent to pay the appellant’s costs of the appeal but receive a certificate under the  
      Suitor’s Fund Act  
      1951 if otherwise entitled. 
       
       
      4. The orders made by his Honour be set aside and the summons before his Honour be upheld with costs. 
       
       
      5. The order made by Mr Johnson LCM on 13 December 1999 permanently staying the respondent’s prosecution for negligent driving be set aside. 
       
       
      6. The information lain against the respondent for negligent driving be remitted to the magistrate to hear and determine according to law.

        REGINA v MARAK PYRDA 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
        
       
     1    HOWIE J: This an application for leave to appeal against what is asserted to be the severity of a sentence imposed upon the applicant by his Honour Judge Puckeridge QC. The applicant pleaded guilty before a magistrate to three offences of break enter and steal contrary to s 112 of the Crimes Act and was committed to the District Court for sentence pursuant to s 51A of the Justices Act. He adhered to his plea before his Honour and was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non parole period of 16 months. In imposing that sentence Judge Puckeridge took into account eight matters on a Form 1, three of which were for breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony. 
      
       
     2    The single ground of appeal is that his Honour failed to back-date the sentence to the date upon which the prisoner entered into custody for the offences for which he was sentenced. The sentencing judge dated the sentence and non-parole period from 14 December 2000 the date when sentence was imposed. The applicant, however, was arrested on 9 September 2000 and was in continuous custody solely by reason of these offences from 22 September 2000. 
      
       
     3    In light of the limited nature of the complaint made to this Court it is unnecessary to detail the facts of the matter. The three charges for which the applicant was committed for sentence were all committed on the one occasion as part of the one course of criminal activity. At sometime in the evening of 30 December or the early morning of 31 December 1999, the applicant gained entry into a group of professional rooms and from each of the three premises he took a small amount of cash that he found there. The total amount of money obtained by the applicant was $410. 
      
       
     4    The police were notified and on attending the premises located the fingerprints of the applicant in one of the offices. When he was arrested on 4 September 2000, the applicant denied any knowledge of the offences and refused to participate in a recorded interview. The applicant was released from custody on bail on 19 September 2000, but was rearrested for having possession of heroin and goods in custody on 22 September 2000 and thereafter refused bail. 
      
       
     5    The applicant, who is aged 21 years, has a record for offences of dishonesty dating from September 1995. He served a six month period of imprisonment from February 1999 after an appeal from sentences imposed in the Local Court for offences of dishonesty and assault were dismissed by the District Court. He was sentenced again in May of that year for offences of dishonesty and violence. On 31 August 1999 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court to 15 months imprisonment for an offence of break enter and steal. A non-parole period of 6 months was fixed to commence from 11 June 1999 with a parole period of 9 months. The applicant was released to parole on 10 December 1999 and was serving that parole when the offences for which he was sentenced by Judge Puckeridge were committed. 
      
       
     6    The question of the appropriate starting date of the sentences was raised by the sentencing judge during a discussion with the prosecutor about the custodial history of the applicant. His Honour expressed the view that because the applicant had breached his bail conditions by committing further offences on 22 September the sentence should start from the date sentence was imposed. During the address of the solicitor then appearing for the applicant, his Honour again indicated his view that, in light of the fact that the applicant had breached his bail conditions, the sentence should not be back-dated. However, it was submitted on the applicant’s behalf that the sentence should date from 22 September. 
      
       
     7    During his very brief remarks on sentence his Honour stated: 
      
       
        
         
         It has been submitted on behalf of the prisoner that the sentence should date back till the time that he was in custody, a date some time in September. However, I do not think it is appropriate that any sentence date back to that date. The offences occurred soon after the prisoner was released from custody on 10 December 2000 (sic), that is the offences which form the basis of the substantive charges and it would appear that the offences which occurred on 22 September 2000 occurred shortly after the prisoner was allowed bail in-- 
         
        
        
         
         LAW: It should be 1999, you said 2000. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: That is the offence, 22 September 2000, yes shortly after the prisoner was allowed bail. For these reasons the sentence imposed by the court will date from today’s date. 
         
        
       
     8    It seems clear that his Honour formed the view that the applicant should not have the benefit of a back-date in the sentence because he had committed the offences for which he was to be sentenced while on parole and because the applicant had committed two of the offences on the Form 1 while he was on bail for those offences. In my opinion his Honour was in error in coming to that conclusion. 
      
       
     9    On a number of occasions this Court has indicated the importance of a sentence being back-dated to commence on the date that the offender went into custody for the offence for which sentence is being passed; R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588; R v Deeble (NSWCCA, unreported, 19 September 1991); R v Close (1992) 32 NSWLR 743; R v Reid (NSWCCA, unreported, 26 March 1997); R v Cook [1999] NSWCCA 234; R v English [2000] NSWCCA 245. In R v Deeble Badgery-Parker J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, stated: 
      
       
        
         
         ..…It needs I think to be emphasised that, unless there is good reason to the contrary, it is always desirable that a sentencing judge should not only take into account pre-sentence custody in determining the sentence to be imposed but should back-date the sentence to the commencement of that pre-sentence custody. The reasons are several. 
         
        
        
         
         First of all, it secures clarity and leaves the prisoner concerned and any later court which comes to look at the matter in no doubt as to what has been done. Secondly, it is a means of ensuring that proper weight is attached to the pre-sentence custody, so that the prisoner has no doubt that he is being treated fairly. Thirdly, it allows the proper application of the statutory proportion between the minimum term and the additional term prescribed prima facie by s 5 of the  
         Sentencing Act 
         .  
          
         
        
       
     10    The same reasons apply to the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Further, there are provisions of that Act which mandate that the sentencing court take the period served in custody into account. Section 24(a) of that Act provides that the court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence. Section 47 relevantly provides: 
      
       
        
         
         1) 
          A sentence of imprisonment commences:  
          
           
           (a) subject to section 70 and to any direction under subsection (2), on the day on which the sentence is imposed, or  
            
           (b). …… 
           
          
         (2) 
          A court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment:  
          
           
           (a) is taken to have commenced on a day occurring before the day on which the sentence is imposed, or  
            
           (b)…..  
           
          
         (3) 
          In deciding whether or not to make a direction under subsection (2) (a) with respect to a sentence of imprisonment, and in deciding the day on which the sentence is taken to have commenced, the court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence to which the sentence relates.  
          
         
        
       
     11    These provisions require that the court takes into account the period served by the offender for the offence for which he is to be sentenced. That requirement can only be given effect if allowance is made for time served either by back-dating the sentence or by deducting the period from the sentence to be imposed. The preference, where there has been a continuous period of custody up until the date of sentence, is for the sentence to be back-dated. 
      
       
     12    His Honour determined that the applicant would not get the benefit of the period served because the offences were committed on parole and, in respect of two matters on the Form 1, on bail. That in my view was not an appropriate way to deal with those features of the offences before the court. They were circumstances of aggravation which the sentencing judge was obliged to take into account when determining the appropriate sentence. Because of the presence of these features his Honour was entitled to impose a heavier sentence than otherwise might have been justified in order to reflect both the increased seriousness of the applicant’s criminality for the offences for which he was to be sentenced and the need for general and specific deterrence. 
      
       
     13    For the reasons expressed by Badgery-Parker J which I have quoted earlier, it was appropriate that the sentences commence from the date that the applicant entered into continuous custody. His parole had not been revoked at the time that Judge Puckeridge sentenced the applicant and, therefore, the applicant had been in custody solely for the offences for which he was to be sentenced. That period should have been taken into account both when calculating the length of the sentence to be imposed and when determining the date upon which to commence the sentence under s 47(2)(a). 
      
       
     14    The Crown has submitted that there was no error in the present case because Judge Puckeridge, having determined not to back-date the sentence, did not appear to thereafter take into account the fact that the applicant was on parole or bail as a matter of aggravation. Therefore, so it was argued, it was not a case where the applicant appeared to be doubly punished for breaching parole such as occurred in R v Kaiva (NSWCCA, 9 November 1998). In that case this Court found that it was erroneous for a sentencing judge both to refuse to back-date a sentence and to take into account that the applicant was on parole when determining the sentence to be imposed. 
      
       
     15    I am not confident that his Honour addressed these aggravating features only when determining the date upon which to commence the sentences, without his Honour making it perfectly clear that this was the only way in which he was taking these matters into account. The fact that offences were committed while he was on parole and on bail were such serious features of the applicant’s offending and were so significant in an assessment of the likelihood of further offences and the prospects for rehabilitation that I find it difficult to see how they could be adequately reflected by a decision not to give a back-date of three months. In my view his Honour would have been in error in taking that approach if that is in fact what he did. 
      
       
     16    The Crown has argued that this Court should not intervene even if it finds there is error because, since the applicant was sentenced by Judge Puckeridge, the Parole Board has revoked the applicant’s parole and dated that revocation from 22 September 2000. Therefore, it is argued, the applicant was not in custody for the period between 22 September and the date of sentence only by reason of the offences for which he was sentenced because he is now to be taken as serving the balance of his parole during that period. 
      
       
     17    While I accept that the general rule is that an offender does not get credit for the period during which he or she is in custody serving some other sentence, see R v Sae (NSWCCA, 3 April 1997) that rule would not require this Court to refuse to intervene where the applicant was prejudiced by an error in passing sentence. If Judge Puckeridge had back-dated the sentence, as in my view he should have done, the balance of the applicant’s parole would have been served concurrently with the sentences imposed by him. If the Parole Board had come to the view that the applicant’s parole ought to have been revoked regardless of the outcome of the proceedings before the District Court, then it had power to do so before he was sentenced. 
      
       
     18    In my view an error in the sentencing of the applicant has been disclosed and it is one of such a nature that would normally require this Court to give leave to the applicant and to re-sentence him. In any event it will be necessary to re-sentence the applicant to the extent of allowing him the benefit of the period in custody from his arrest on 4 September until he was released to bail on 19 September 1999. The Crown has conceded that this adjustment should be made. 
      
       
     19    As I have already indicated the applicant is a young man who has a criminal record and has served prior periods in custody. His offending is a result of his drug addiction. Apparently he suffered physical violence at the hands of his father both before and after his parents separated. His schooling was disrupted by the family constantly moving to avoid his father. He told a psychologist that he used drugs to overcome his emotional problems as a result of his father’s abuse. The applicant gave evidence before his Honour to the effect that he had not used drugs while in custody on remand and had sought drug counselling. He indicated that he did not want to continue using drugs on his release from custody but accepted that he had been given chances by the courts before. 
      
       
     20    An affidavit of the applicant was presented to the Court in case the Court was required to re-sentence him. The applicant has been taking methadone while in custody and has attended for drug counselling. The applicant states that he has taken his first steps at rehabilitation in order to ensure that he does not return to gaol again. 
      
       
     21    Notwithstanding this material and that which was before Judge Puckeridge, I believe that the applicant’s sentence was unduly lenient even taking into account the refusal to back-date the sentence. The applicant committed the offences shortly after he was released from custody to parole. The offences were serious notwithstanding the small amount of money stolen. The applicant sawed through barred windows in order to gain entry to the premises. There were serious offences on the Form 1. 
      
       
     22    Judge Puckeridge found that there were special circumstances. However, the non-parole period fixed by his Honour seems to have been the result of some confusion on his part as to the application of s 44 of the Act. His Honour thought that applying the statutory proportion to a head sentence of three years would result in a non-parole period of two years. His Honour then reduced that non-parole period in light of his finding that there were special circumstances resulting in a non-parole period of 16 months. After imposing the sentence his Honour explained to the applicant that the non-parole period would have normally expired on 13 December 2002 (that is two years from the date of sentence) but that he had reduced it because of the applicant’s hope to rid himself of the drug habit and as a result the non-parole period would expire on 13 April 2002.  
      
       
     23    If I were to now re-sentence the applicant, I doubt that I would find there were special circumstances in light of the applicant’s criminal history and the fact that these matters were committed on parole and some on bail. Certainly I would not give him the benefit of a non-parole period of 16 months back-dated to 22 September 2000, such a sentence would be overly lenient. 
      
       
     24    Although the sentence should have been back-dated, in my view if this court were to re-sentence the applicant he would receive a heavier sentence than that imposed by Judge Puckeridge. In particular the non-parole period would be extended so that the applicant would no longer be released to parole in April of next year. As there is no Crown appeal it would not be appropriate to increase the applicant’s sentence. Therefore, the application should in substance be dismissed. 
      
       
     25    However, in light of the Crown’s concession that the applicant is entitled to a reduction of the sentence for the time spent in custody between 4 September and 19 September the appeal should be allowed to the extent of making the appropriate adjustment to the commencing date of the sentences. 
      
       
     26    I propose that the application for leave be granted and that the appeal be allowed to the extent that the sentences imposed by Judge Puckeridge are to commence from 29 November 2000 and the applicant is to be released to parole on 28 March 2002. The parole is to be subject to the conditions imposed by Judge Puckeridge. 
      
       
     27    SMART AJ: I agree with Howie J. 
      
       
     28    HOWIE J: The order of the court would be as I proposed.

        REGINA v PG 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    HOWIE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by O’Reilly DCJ at the Penrith District Court on 17 April 2000 following his plea of guilty to an indictment containing 6 counts of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act. The applicant had previously pleaded guilty to those matters before a magistrate and was committed for sentence under s 51A of the Justices Act. However, owing to a defect in the s 51A document, an indictment was presented to the District Court and the applicant pleaded guilty on arraignment. In addition, the applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account ten armed robbery matters and one unlicensed driver matter contained on a Form 1 pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
      
       
     2    On each count his Honour sentenced the applicant to concurrent terms of 7½ years imprisonment with non-parole periods of 5 years. The sentences were specified to commence on 16 August 1999, the date upon which the applicant was taken into custody, and the non-parole periods are to expire on 15 August 2004. Judge O’Reilly took the Form 1 matters into account on the sentence he imposed in respect of the first count on the indictment. 
      
       
     3    The six armed robberies to which the applicant pleaded guilty occurred between 30 April and 29 May 1999. The offences taken into account on the Form 1 were committed between 17 April 1999 and 7 June 1999 and formed part of a continuing course of conduct. All the armed robberies were committed in company, the applicant being armed with a replica pistol and the co-offender on most occasions being armed with a tomahawk. 
      
       
     4    The first offence on the indictment occurred on the evening of 30 April 1999 at Picnic Point Bowling Club. The applicant travelled to the club with a man, whom I shall refer to as F, in a vehicle that the latter had stolen from the Winmalee area. The applicant and F entered the club through the front door and ordered staff onto the floor. The staff were then forced to enter the cool room and the manager made to comply with their demands to hand over money that was located in the office safe. The applicant and F took $20,000 in notes and coins and left the club in the stolen vehicle. 
      
       
     5    The other offences both on the indictment and the Form 1 were similar to this offence. They involved assaults upon the staff of licensed clubs or retail premises. The usual modus operandi was that the applicant would threaten the manager or staff with the weapon while F obtained the money. The offences usually involved stolen vehicles and a third person, either a man I shall refer to as W or another I shall call C, acted as the get away driver. On at least one occasion staff were locked in a room, on other occasions they were forced to lie on the floor. The robbers were equipped with scanners to detect police movements and communicated with the driver by hand-held radios. A very substantial amount of money was taken as a result of the robberies, over $80,000 in the matters on the indictment alone. The applicant told police that he received little of it. 
      
       
     6    After the commission of a robbery at the Toongabbie Bowling Club a security tape was viewed by police. One of the detectives recognised F and surveillance was commenced on his premises at Greystanes. On the evening of 11 June 1999 the vehicle driven by F was stopped by police and both F and the applicant were found in the vehicle. They were both arrested for possession of a firearm which was located in that vehicle. 
      
       
     7    On 16 August 1999, after being identified by a witness from a photograph, the applicant was arrested for two robberies. The applicant then participated in two recorded interviews in which he detailed his involvement in the sixteen robberies for which he was sentenced by Judge O’Reilly. The applicant provided other information and assistance to the police which I will detail shortly. 
      
       
     8    Judge O’Reilly determined that the sentence should be discounted both under s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in relation to the applicant’s assistance to the authorities, and for the disclosure of unknown criminality in accordance with the principles enunciated by this Court in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. His Honour came to the view that an overall discount of 50 per cent was appropriate. Accordingly his Honour reduced what he thought to be the otherwise appropriate sentence of 15 years with a non-parole period of 11 years to the sentences which he imposed. 
      
       
     9    It is accepted by both parties that, in fixing the sentences he did, Judge O’Reilly did not follow the dictates of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. His Honour ought to have determined the sentence appropriate for each of the offences before him, taking into account the matters on the Form 1 when sentencing for the first offence in the indictment, and then arrived at an appropriate sentence to reflect the totality of the criminality by making the individual sentences either concurrent or cumulative. 
      
       
     10    It may well be that in this particular case there was no real prejudice suffered by the applicant, but that does not relieve this Court from re-sentencing the applicant even if it came to the view that the total sentence was otherwise appropriate. In my view the sentences imposed for counts two to six were in themselves manifestly excessive and will have to be reduced whatever view is taken of the sentence imposed for the first count while taking the Form 1 matters into account. 
      
       
     11    The applicant’s first ground of appeal is that the overall discount his Honour allowed was inadequate having regard to what are said to be the exceptional circumstances of this case. It was submitted that a discount of 60 per cent should have been allowed. The applicant did not submit that the starting point of a full term of fifteen years was inappropriate, although it was suggested that, by reference to other decisions of this Court and statistical information from the Judicial Commission, the starting sentence was “towards the top of the range”. 
      
       
     12    The assistance given by the applicant was described by the sentencing judge as “quite extraordinary”. It included the fact that the police had no evidence of the involvement of the applicant in relation to fourteen of the sixteen robberies and, in respect of the two that they believed were committed by him, the evidence was only visual identification and was not strong. There was other significant assistance given by the applicant to police and this is set out in an annexure which is not to be made public. 
      
       
     13    As a result of supplying this information to the police the applicant and his family have been threatened, his wife was assaulted, the applicant is being housed in the Special Purpose Prison and for a period his wife and children were under police protection. It is possible that both he and his family will be involved in the Witness Protection Scheme once the applicant is released from custody and probably they will have to relocate away from New South Wales. 
      
       
     14    The applicant is now aged 31 years. He has little criminal record before these offences were committed and until about 2 years before these armed robberies he had led the life of a responsible law-abiding citizen. His early life was unremarkable notwithstanding the separations of his parents when he was a young child. He is in his second marriage and had custody of the child of his first marriage before his arrest. He also is the father of a child from his present marriage. 
      
       
     15    About two years before these offences the applicant became involved with F and others who used amphetamines and the applicant became addicted to that drug. He then commenced to use heroin as well. After his arrest he was severely depressed and attempted to commit suicide. He has been receiving counselling and medication while in custody. Psychologists from the prison service have reported that the applicant appears to have gained insight into his behaviour and is making attempts to rehabilitate himself. The pre-sentence report indicated that the applicant’s problems appear to have been the result of his poor self-esteem, pessimism and a tendency towards impulsive behaviour. 
      
       
     16    Counsel for the applicant relied in support of this ground of appeal on other cases where a discount of the magnitude of 60 per cent has been granted as a result of assistance provided by the offender. Ms Burgess also cited R v Chu (NSWCCA, 16 October 1998) where Spigelman CJ, while stating that the customary discount in New South Wales was in the range of 20 percent to 50 percent, recognised that there were exceptions where a greater discount had been allowed. 
      
       
     17    It was also argued, relying upon the decision of this Court in R v Thompson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 that, if the applicant had been given the full benefit for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty and his contrition, a discount in the order of 35 per cent would have been appropriate. Therefore, the argument runs, the applicant was given less than 20 per cent discount for his assistance under s 23 of the Act and that discount was manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
     18    The Crown in response submitted that there was no error in anything his Honour said in his sentencing remarks and that the sentencing judge had expressly taken into account the applicant’s plea of guilty, the discount for the disclosure of unknown offences and the discount under s 23 for this applicant’s assistance generally. It was contended that an overall discount of 50 per cent was appropriate given the extremely serious objective features of these offences. 
      
       
     19    The Crown also submitted that the sentencing judge was required to take into account the principle of proportionality in sentencing. This applied both to the discount for assistance to the authorities under s 23(3) and to the Ellis discount: see  Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349. The Crown relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Huang (NSWCCA, 5 April 1995) where a Crown appeal was allowed on the ground that, in light of the extremely serious objective features of the offence, a discount of 60 per cent “constituted an affront to community standards”. 
      
       
     20    The Crown further submitted that it was erroneous to take a mathematical approach by separating and quantifying each of the individual discounts and then comparing them against the total discount given. The Crown argues that there is a degree of overlap between the matters which gave rise to the various discounts. Further, it was submitted that such an approach is antipathetic to the instinctive synthesis approach to sentencing which has been approved in decisions of both this Court and the High Court: R v Thompson and Houlton at [71], Pearce at [46]. 
      
       
     21    In my opinion this ground of appeal has not been made out substantially for the reasons put forward on behalf of the Crown. The starting sentence of 15 years was well within the sentencing judge’s discretion notwithstanding the fact that this was the one spree of criminal activity and that it seems to have been out of character for the accused. Those two factors are unfortunately not unusual. This is simply a case where the applicant became involved in the use of prohibited drugs for recreational purposes and having become addicted to them he committed serious criminal offences to be able to fund his addiction. There is nothing either remarkable or mitigating in that history. What is exceptional is the seriousness of the offences he was prepared to commit in light of his earlier good character. 
      
       
     22    The armed robberies were each offences falling within the most serious category of their kind. The offences were planned, they were committed in company and the applicant was armed with a replica firearm in order to terrify the victims. He played a significant role in the commission of each of the offences even though he suggested to police that he was often an unwilling participant. A large number of persons were put in fear by the applicant and F. The offences were committed over a period of almost two months and there is little doubt they would have continued but for the arrest of the applicant and his co-offender. 
      
       
     23    In one case a female employee had been so terrified by the conduct of the applicant and F that even the applicant was driven to show some compassion by telling her that the weapon was a replica. In light of the number of offences committed by the applicant during which he intentionally terrified a large number of persons by brandishing a weapon at them, there is no significant mitigation to be found in this isolated act of common humanity. 
      
       
     24    Each offence carried a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and there were sixteen of them. It is unnecessary for me to calculate the total sentence to which the prisoner was liable in order to indicate the criminality of these matters. Although the applicant is entitled to a significant element of leniency because of his confessions to the police, he cannot thereby avoid the consequences of his serious criminal conduct. Nor is the total criminality before the Court diminished by the fact that the majority of the offences were taken into account on a Form 1; R v Bavadra (2000) 115 A Crim R 152 at [158]. I do not believe that the starting sentence was near the top of the range for sentences involving such serious criminality. 
      
       
     25    In my view it is erroneous in the circumstances of this case to embark upon an exercise of calculating discounts to which the applicant would have been entitled had he not proffered the assistance that he did or if he had not confessed the extent of his criminality and then using those figures to determine whether he received sufficient benefit for any particular factor including the assistance he gave. It was recognised by the Chief Justice in Thompson and Houlton at [71] that it will not always be possible to separate the utilitarian factor from contrition or other factors. There is too much overlap between the policy considerations reflected in the various discounts and too many common elements involved in calculating them for any real assistance to be derived from such a mechanical dissection of the sentencing task undertaken by Judge O’Reilly. For example, it is well recognised that a plea of guilty, assistance to the authorities and the disclosure of unknown criminality each reflect, to some measure, an offender’s contrition and his resolve to put his life of crime behind him and make a fresh start: R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 227-228. 
      
       
     26    The amount of discount given is as much an exercise of sentencing discretion as is the determination of the starting sentence before the discount is applied. I am far from persuaded that it was not open to Judge O’Reilly to determine upon a discount of 50 per cent rather than say 55 per cent or the 60 per cent sought by the applicant. For this Court to vary the discount from 50 to 60 per cent on a sentence of 15 years without clear justification for doing so would simply be this Court re-exercising the sentencing judge’s discretion and might even be considered to be close to tinkering. 
      
       
     27    In any event, I do not believe that a 60 per cent discount would be appropriate on the facts of this matter. The cases indicate that such a discount is truly exceptional. I do not believe that this case comes within that category even though the assistance given by the applicant may properly be described as exceptional. The assistance and the discount to be given for it cannot be assessed in a vacuum. They have to be considered in the context of the seriousness of the offences committed and the relative importance of other factors to be reflected in the sentence such as retribution, denunciation and general deterrence. 
      
       
     28    It is worthwhile at the risk of making this judgment unduly lengthy to repeat what was said by this Court in Dodd at 354: 
      
       
        
         
         “As Jordan CJ said in  
         Geddes 
          (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554 at 556, making due allowance for all relevant considerations, there ought to be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime, and we consider it always important in seeking to determine the sentence appropriate to a particular crime to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without this assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place.” 
         
        
       
     29    I accept that there is some conflict between, on the one hand, giving a discount for utilitarian purposes such as the encouraging of early pleas and the assistance to police and prosecuting authorities and, on the other hand, the need to impose a sentence appropriate to reflect the other purposes of punishment. The resolution of those competing sentencing objectives in the particular case is a matter for the exercise of the discretion of the sentencing judge. I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion in that regard. In my view a sentence of 7½ years is not manifestly excessive having regard to the criminality for which the applicant was to be punished. 
      
       
     30    The second ground of appeal is that the non-parole period is excessive having regard to the particular circumstances of the applicant. Judge O’Reilly found special circumstances existed because the pre-sentence and psychological reports revealed that the applicant needed intensive and prolonged supervision on release, particularly with respect to his drug problem. His Honour in effect determined that there was a need for a longer parole period than would result from the normal application of s 44 of the Act. 
      
       
     31    His Honour determined that an appropriate sentence before the application of the discount would be 15 years with a non-parole period of 11 years. His Honour then applied the 50 percent discount but determined that there should be a non-parole period of 5 years as against a full term of 7½ years. It is not appropriate, in my view, to determine what the non-parole period would be before applying the discount. There is, with unfeigned respect to his Honour, little purpose to be served in doing so and it can lead to error in calculating the appropriate non-parole period in respect of the discounted full term. There are different considerations applying when determining whether there are special circumstances justifying a reduction in the non-parole period for a sentence of 15 years than in the case of a sentence of 7½ years. 
      
       
     32    Further, his Honour seems to have had regard only to what the length of the parole period should be rather than to what was required by way of a non-parole period. Section 44(2) speaks of special circumstances for the non-parole period being less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence. The focus is now upon what is necessary by way of a non-parole period rather than whether a longer parole period is justified in the circumstances of the case; cf Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446. Although the need for a longer parole period will automatically mean there are special circumstances for a lesser non-parole period: R v Carrion (1999) 49 NSWLR 149, that is not the only reason why it may be appropriate to reduce the non-parole period. 
      
       
     33    The applicant relies upon two arguments to support this ground of appeal. The first is that the parole period of 2½ years is an insufficient period for the assistance which the applicant will need after release to parole. The second is that his Honour failed to have sufficient regard to the nature of the applicant’s custody while serving the sentence. 
      
       
     34    I do not believe that either of these arguments have any merit. As to the first complaint, the parole period is in my view more than adequate for the needs of the applicant in light of the prospects for rehabilitation which have so far been revealed. In any event, this was a matter falling well within his Honour’s discretionary judgment. As to the second matter, the discount of the whole term on the basis of the assistance takes into account the fact that the applicant will serve his sentence in a more difficult and rigorous environment. Generally the benefit for assistance will be found in the reduction of the total term and not again in the reduction of the non-parole period unless there is a good reason to do so: R v S [2000] NSWCCA 13. 
      
       
     35    But in my view there is a good reason in the present case to further reduce the non-parole period as a result of the assistance given by the applicant in addition to the matters taken into account in discounting the full term. His Honour makes no reference to it in determining special circumstances and perhaps overlooked it because he concentrated on matters relevant to the length of the parole period. It has also become more apparent in the material which this Court has received on the basis that we may have to re-sentence the applicant. 
      
       
     36    It is evident now, as it was before his Honour, that because of the applicant’s assistance to police, the family of the applicant are in need of protection and that can only be achieved if they are placed in the Witness Protection Scheme or if they relocate to another state. Neither of those steps can realistically be taken while the applicant is in custody. The difficulties for the family have been made clearer than they were before his Honour by an affidavit of the applicant’s wife which is before this Court. She finds it virtually impossible to receive appropriate protection if she and the children are to remain in contact with the applicant in custody. 
      
       
     37    In my view the non-parole period should be further reduced in order to facilitate, as far as is reasonably possible, the re-establishing of the family so that they can either enter a protection scheme together or so that they can relocate. As the Crown points out, the non-parole period must not be disproportionate to the seriousness of the offence, but the risk to the applicant and his family is a matter to which regard should be had in determining whether the sentence is disproportionate: R v C (1994) 75 A Crim R 309. 
      
       
     38    In my opinion insufficient, if any, weight was given to this factor by his Honour and, therefore, this Court should intervene. I have taken into account the material placed before the Court by way of affidavits and certificates. I believe that an appropriate non-parole period in the exceptional circumstances of this case is one of 4 years. 
      
       
     39    Therefore, I propose that the application for leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be allowed and the sentences imposed by his Honour quashed in respect of the second to sixth counts and in lieu the applicant be sentence to a fixed term of 3½ years. I have chosen a fixed term because of the sentence that I propose should be imposed for the first count. Those sentences are to date from 16 August 1999 and to expire on 15 February 2003. In respect of the first count and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, I propose that the non-parole period be quashed and in lieu a non-parole period of 4 years be specified to expire on 15 August 2003 the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
      
       
     40    SMART AJ: I agree with Howie J. 
      
       
     41    HOWIE J: The order of the court would be as I proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
       
     1    HEYDON JA: I agree with Ipp AJA. 
      
       
     2    YOUNG CJ IN EQ: I also agree with Ipp AJA. 
      
       
     3    IPP AJA: This appeal concerns a claim for damages for personal injuries made by the respondent against the appellant as the owner and occupier of Guise Public School, Macquarie Fields.  
      
       
     4    On 29 January 1997 the respondent, who was then a teacher’s aide at the school, fell while walking across an earthen mound and thereby seriously injured her left leg.  
      
       
     5    The respondent brought an action in the District Court and alleged that her injuries were caused by the appellant’s negligence. Delaney DCJ upheld her claim. He found that the appellant was negligent and entirely responsible for the damages the respondent suffered. He assessed damages in the amount of $555,748 and ordered the appellant to pay that sum to her.  
      
       
     6    The appellant appeals against the orders so made. It challenges the finding that it was negligent and, in the alternative, contends that if it was negligent, the respondent was guilty of contributory negligence. The appellant further challenges his Honour’s assessment of damages.  
      
       
     7    The appellant was born on 10 October 1947. She left school at about age 15 years and then worked for a number of years in a bookbinder’s business. She was married in 1966 and had two children born in 1970 and 1973 respectively. Both her children went to Guise Public School.  
      
       
     8    The respondent’s house was adjacent to the school. The school was next to her back fence. At the time the respondent was injured, she had lived in that house with her family for approximately 18 or 19 years. 
      
       
     9    After her eldest child commenced her school career, the respondent began increasingly to be involved with the school in various voluntary capacities. She became supervisor of the canteen, president of the Parents’ and Children’s Association, and president of the Guise School Council and was holding these offices at the time of her accident. She gained the trust of the school authorities to the extent that she was given the task of opening the school for the police or anyone else who needed to obtain access to it after hours and she was provided with the master keys for that purpose.  
      
       
     10    For more than 10 years prior to the accident the respondent had been involved in the care of disabled children or children with special needs. Her interest in this area was aroused when she became foster mother to an intellectually disabled and sexually abused girl and began to care for a blind boy. The experience she so acquired led, in 1992, to her being employed by the school as a part-time teacher of children with physical or intellectual handicaps. In 1995 she obtained a Department of Education certificate as a teacher’s aide for children with special needs. At the time of her accident she was employed part-time at the school in that capacity. 
      
       
     11    Thus, for several years prior to the accident, the respondent spent a considerable amount of time in teaching and in performing various voluntary tasks at the school. She was required to go to the school virtually every day, and sometimes more than once a day, either in her paid capacity as a teacher’s aide or as a volunteer. She was regarded by the school authorities as a “very special person”. 
      
       
     12    Initially, when the respondent first began going to the school, the only route available to her was from her front door, along a public road, to the school buildings. This was about 350 metres long and she described it as a “long walk”. Mr Costa, the principal of the school until the end of 1996, described it in similar terms. To assist the respondent in gaining quick and shorter access to the school, Mr Costa helped her to persuade the Housing Commission to install a gate in the boundary fence between the back yard of her house and the school. Thereafter, to the knowledge of Mr Costa and the school authorities, the respondent, on a daily basis, walked across her back yard, through this gate, and across the school grounds to the school buildings in order to perform her various tasks. This was a far shorter and more convenient route than that which she had had to take before the gate was put in.  
      
       
     13    From photographs that were tendered in evidence it appears that the area over which the respondent walked when so going from her back yard through the gate to the school buildings was flat and grassed but with several bare patches.  
      
       
     14    For a long period of time prior to April 1996, the school had had to endure what was described as “quite serious flooding”. The flooding was caused by torrential downpours, usually in the summer months. There was a slope in the playground which led the water run-off directly to the school buildings.  
      
       
     15    In 1996 the school took advantage of an unemployment work scheme to construct certain earthworks on the school grounds. The earthworks were completed by earthmoving contractors in April 1996. Part of the earthworks included the construction of an open dish drain known as a swale. The swale ran across the entire width of the playground area for a distance of over 100 metres. The purpose of the swale was to channel the water away from the school buildings.  
      
       
     16    An earthen mound was constructed as part of the earthworks involving the swale. It is not entirely clear precisely where the mound was constructed in relation to the ditch, but it seems that the mound ran alongside the ditch for its entire length, immediately adjacent to it. I infer that the ditch and the mound constituted the swale.  
      
       
     17    The swale (and the mound) was constructed more or less parallel to the respondent’s back fence. The mound was about one to two feet wide and about one foot high. It was about 40 feet away from the gate in the respondent’s back fence. Thus, when walking from the gate across the school grounds to the school buildings, the respondent would - after 40 feet - have to cross the mound to be able to continue walking across the remainder of the grounds.  
      
       
     18    It remained an option to the respondent to walk from the front of her house, along the public road, to the school, but, as mentioned, this was a far longer journey and, after the completion of the construction of the swale, she continued following the route through the gate in the back fence and across the mound. As from the completion of the swale until the end of the school year in 1996, the respondent crossed the swale (and the mound) at least once a day. 
      
       
     19    The respondent was not the only person to walk across the mound at frequent intervals. Students and teachers regularly walked or ran across it at all points along its length. 
      
       
     20    After the swale was completed in April 1996, Mr Costa attempted, by sowing seed, to grow grass on the mound. He was, however, unsuccessful. In September or October 1996, the mound was turfed. Between then and the end of the year the newly laid turf was mowed twice by Mr Costa with a push mower and at least on one further occasion by an assistant who used a sit-on mower.  
      
       
     21    By 29 January 1997, it had been raining continuously for approximately two weeks. At that time, the respondent needed to go to the school buildings to open the school uniform shop for the school so that parents could purchase uniforms for their children before the new school year commenced. She decided to walk to the uniform shop through the gate in the back fence across the mound.  
      
       
     22    The respondent noticed that the ground where she was walking was “very wet” and, as she approached the mound, she became aware that it was “quite slippery”. As she stepped over the mound, she fell.  
      
       
     23    The evidence as to how she fell was brief but not entirely clear. She first said that she “slipped,” but then explained that “the turf gave away underneath my foot”. She was asked whether a little piece or a whole slab of the turf gave way and she said that it was a whole slab. She said that she did not merely slip on the grass. In describing how the turf “gave away” she pointed her hand in a downward motion indicating that she fell on the mound “almost on its down side”.  
      
       
     24    When Mr Costa gave evidence he was cross-examined by counsel for the respondent in an attempt to establish that he, personally, should have known that the mound was in a dangerous condition. He said, however, that he left the school in December 1996 and a new principal commenced in the 1997 school year. Therefore, he was not able to testify as to the condition of the mound in January 1997. When it was put to him in cross-examination that when the mound was wet people “might slip and fall on the wet grass”, he said that he could not answer the question as he had “not seen the swale work [sic-wet]”. He conceded, however, that “that may have been the case because apparently it rained quite a lot during that January break”. Earlier Mr Costa had been asked about the mound becoming slippery before turf was put down and he said that he could not recollect the swale being wet. On my understanding of Mr Costa’s evidence as a whole, it seems that while he was principal there was no occasion when the mound became wet and slippery. 
      
       
     25    Delaney DCJ found that the respondent fell because “portion of the grass that had been placed on the mound after the earthworks had been performed, moved”. Mr Taylor SC, senior counsel for the appellant, accepted this finding.  
      
       
     26    Delaney DCJ found further that “as a result of the rain which had fallen, … the area of earth and area of turf was not properly in place and … if a person walked upon it then more likely than not there could be some movement”. 
      
       
     27    His Honour went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         “There was a risk in the course of preparation of this area of the flood mitigation works. This risk was there because school children would soon be on the premises, the school year being about to commence, and children might come onto the school property at any time as was known to the [appellant]. It was also known that the [respondent] would, from time to time, walk across that property and that part of the property where the mound was situated. There [sic-these] were matters which should have been in the mind of ay defendant and the defendant in this particular case”. 
         
        
       
     28    Delaney DCJ proceeded: 
      
       
        
         
         “[T]here is no doubt that if an inspection had been carried out and shown that there was, as the [respondent] found and I accept, an area of turf which was not secure in its place and liable to move when stepped on, then it would have been an easy, cheap and appropriate response for the [appellant] in this case to have placed a warning sign or a rope or some barrier or a bridge across the mound to ensure that the risk of injury to a person such as the [respondent] would not have occurred. The failure to take that course in this case was, I find, a breach of the duty owed by the [appellant] to the [respondent] and the cause of the injury suffered by the [respondent] on the day”. 
         
        
        
       Mr Taylor contended that the evidence did not establish that an inspection would have revealed that an area of turf was not secure in its place and liable to move when stepped on. He submitted further that the appellant could not have known that the turf was unstable in any way. Therefore, he contended, the finding that there was a breach of duty on the appellant’s part was erroneous. 
        
       
     29    Delaney DCJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am satisfied that the [respondent], had she seen a warning sign advising her of the recent earthworks and the state of the mound, would have more likely than not avoided it, gone around it or taken some other evasive action. In those circumstances, more likely than not, the accident would not have occurred. There was a breach of the duty owed by the [appellant] to the [respondent] and the [respondent] is entitled to a verdict”. 
         
        
        
       Mr Taylor pointed to the fact that the respondent had not been asked whether she would have obeyed a warning sign and submitted that the finding of his Honour in this respect had no foundation.  
        
       
     30    When dealing with contributory negligence Delaney DCJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am satisfied that in the circumstances which the [respondent] described she found the mound there was nothing which she did or could have done to have avoided the incident and nothing she did which caused or contributed to the injuries that she suffered in this case. They came about, I find, due to the failure of the [appellant] to alert her of something which was specifically not obvious, namely the condition of the turf. The mound was obvious but the condition of it certainly was not”. 
         
        
        
       Mr Taylor submitted, generally, that these findings were erroneous. 
        
       
     31    Neither at trial nor in argument before this Court did the parties suggest that any special rules relating to the tortious liability of a public authority governed the duty of care owed by the appellant to persons entering the school grounds (see Brodie v Singleton Shire Council [2001] HCA 29). Rather, the respondent’s case against the appellant was put squarely on the basis of occupier’s liability and this was accepted by the appellant. 
      
       
     32    The duty of the appellant as occupier was to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risks of injury to persons entering the school grounds. The fundamental question was whether the appellant committed a breach of that duty.  
      
       
     33    The risk of injury in this case arose from the condition of the mound. There is therefore a need to focus on that condition at the relevant time. 
      
       
     34    In her evidence in chief, the respondent said that certain photographs taken on 5 February 1997 showed the condition of the mound, at the time of the accident, in the area in which she fell. The photographs indicate that the surface of the relevant part of the mound consisted of patchy areas of different kinds. Most obviously, there were patches of lush grass. This grass was relatively long and a dark rich green in colour. Interspersed amongst the lush grass were areas of short grass of a particularly pale colour. This grass had been closely cropped or had not grown much at all. Amongst the lush grass and the other grass were many bare spots of varying sizes (some being relatively large) where black soil is apparent on the surface of the mound. It is likely that this would have been the condition of the mound for some time prior to the heavy rains in January 1997.  
      
       
     35    It seems obvious from these photographs that, after two weeks of continuous rain, the part of the mound in question would not be safe for persons to walk across. The bare areas would have become particularly muddy and there was every prospect that the areas with the pale, short grass would have become muddy as well. As areas of uncovered black soil are discernible in the midst of the patches of lush grass, it is likely that those patches would also have become soft and tending to muddiness. These inferences are reinforced by the respondent’s testimony that after she fell she “felt a lot of mud and dirt”. She said that she was “totally covered in mud”. The area as a whole must have been muddy indeed. 
      
       
     36    I have mentioned that the appellant did not challenge the finding that the accident was caused by the movement of an insecure portion of the grass on the mound. The movement as found by Delaney DCJ must have been caused by the giving way of the turf underneath the respondent’s foot as she testified. That this may have occurred on the mound in the area in question after two weeks of continuous rain is readily understandable. I have pointed out that the entire area, to different degrees, was likely to have become muddy and soft. If a person stood on a particularly soft patch (even if it were grassed), their weight would push the soil downwards, and this in turn would be likely to displace other muddy soil and cause the patch on which the person was standing, and other patches in the immediate vicinity, to move. The surface of the mound was likely to have been generally unstable.  
      
       
     37    From Mr Costa’s evidence it seems that it had not rained on the mound in significant quantities until the two weeks prior to the accident. If that is correct, the stability of the mound in excessively wet and rainy conditions had not previously been tested. However, the fact that the mound would have to endure torrential rains was well known. The very reason that the swale was constructed was to combat the effect of torrential rains. 
      
       
     38    Within 48 hours of the respondent’s fall, the appellant caused work to be commenced on the construction of a bridge over the swale near the area where the respondent fell. The bridge was thereafter completed and the swale was covered in concrete. These measures, in my view, are an acknowledgment by the appellant of the danger that had been constituted by the earthen swale and the mound.  
      
       
     39    Mr Costa had mowed the mound on two occasions between October and December 1996. He left the school at the end of the year and his successor was appointed in January 1997. The mound must have been noticed by the new principal. It was a prominent feature in the school landscape, it was visible to all, and its condition was patently obvious. The school authorities (and, hence, the appellant) must be taken to have known of it.  
      
       
     40    The appellant also knew that it had been raining continuously for two weeks. From the prior condition of the mound, the appellant should have known that the area where the respondent fell would have become muddy and unstable in the manner I have described.  
      
       
     41    As I have mentioned, Mr Costa had assisted the respondent in having a gate installed in her back fence for the very purpose of allowing her to walk through that particular area to go to the school. She had taken advantage of the gate and had used that route for many years. She was a well-known personality at the school. The appellant must have known before the accident that the area on the mound where the respondent fell was the area that she traversed regularly on her way to school.  
      
       
     42    It follows that the appellant must have known that there was a significant risk that the respondent would walk over the mound in an area that was likely to be unsafe after heavy rains. The risk of harm to the respondent and, indeed, to any person in such circumstances, was obvious, and the appellant knew or should have known this. 
      
       
     43    Does it necessarily follow that the appellant was required to take appropriate measures to prevent risk of injury to the respondent (or, indeed, any person walking on the mound)? This depends on what has been variously described as the “measure” or “scope” or “content” of the duty of care: see Morgan v Sherton Pty Limited (1999) 46 NSWLR 141 per Sheller JA (at 145).  
      
       
     44    The starting point in this inquiry is the application of the principles set out by Mason J in the well-known passage in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47 to 48: 
      
       
        
         
         “In deciding whether there has been a breach of the duty of care the tribunal fact must first ask itself whether a reasonable man in the defendant’s position would have foreseen that his conduct involved a risk of injury to the plaintiff or to a class of persons including the plaintiff. If the answer be in the affirmative, it is then for the tribunal of fact to determine what a reasonable man would do by way of response to the risk. The perception of the reasonable man’s response calls for a consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of the probability of its occurrence, along with the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action and any other conflicting responsibilities which the defendant may have. It is only when these matters are balanced out that the tribunal of fact can confidently assert what is the standard of response to be ascribed to the reasonable man placed in the defendant’s position. 
         
        
        
         
         The considerations to which I have referred indicate that a risk of injury which is remote in the sense that it is extremely unlikely to occur may nevertheless constitute a foreseeable risk. A risk which is not far-fetched or fanciful is real and therefore foreseeable. 
           
         But, as we have seen, the existence of a foreseeable risk of injury does not in itself dispose of the question of breach of duty. The magnitude of the risk and its degree of probability remain to be considered with other relevant factors.”. 
         
        
       
     45    The “other relevant factors” are infinite in number. Some are mentioned in the following passage from the judgment of Kirby J in Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory (1998) 192 CLR 431 (at 478): 
      
       
        
         
         “The ordinary formulation of the common law is that a body such as the Commission must take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risks of injury to persons entering an area such as the reserve, including the cliffs, as of common right. However, that expression of a duty must be elaborated if it is to be of any practical guidance. The entrant is only entitled to expect a measure of care appropriate to the nature of the land or premises entered and to the relationship which exists between the entrant and the occupier. The measure of the care required will take into account the different ages, capacities, sobriety and advertence of the entrants. While account must be taken of the possibility of inadvertence or negligent conduct on the part of entrants, the occupier is generally entitled to assume that most entrants will take reasonable care for their own safety”. 
         
        
       
     46    Plainly, factors such as the magnitude of the risk, its degree of probability (or remoteness), and the possibility of inadvertence or negligent conduct on the part of entrants, are important in determining the scope of the duty of care. Others which may be relevant are the obviousness of the risk, and the circumstances under which the entrant engages in conduct that attracts the risk.  
      
       
     47    Where the entrant deliberately and for pleasure engages in hazardous recreational activities where the risks are obvious, the scope of the duty of care may be limited indeed: Agar v Hyde (2000) 74 ALJR 1219 (participation in a football game), Prast v Town of Cottesloe (2000) 22 WAR 474 (body-surfing in the ocean), Mountain Cattlemen’s Association of Victoria Inc v Barron [1998] 3 VR 302 (leading a horse over small and slippery rocks), Secretary to the Department of Natural Resources and Energy v Harper [2000] 1 VR 133 (visiting a forest reserve where there was an obvious danger of falling trees in high winds).  
      
       
     48    The scope of the duty may also be particularly limited where the risks materialise because of wayward or aberrant or unexpected conduct on the part of the entrant: Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory (walking at night at the top of an unfenced cliff edge), Phillis v Daly (1988) 15 NSWLR 65 (stepping onto a large log), Morgan v Sherton Pty Limited (jumping over a garden bed while returning to a parked car).  
      
       
     49    There is, however, far less reason to limit the scope of the duty where the entrant enters the property in an expected manner for an expected purpose and performs a mundane activity which is ordinarily without risk, but which has become obviously dangerous because of singular circumstances and which is inconvenient for the entrant to avoid. In such circumstances, human nature being what it is, depending on the nature, extent and likelihood of the risk and the degree of inconvenience involved, it may not be unexpected that the entrant will fail to take ordinary care for his or her own safety. Aganst this background, the scope of the duty of the occupier is more likely to include the duty to take care in regard to risks “arising from an entrant’s failure to exercise reasonable care for his or her own safety” (per Brennan J in Romeo at 445) and the occupier must have particular regard to “the possibility of inadvertence or negligent conduct on the part of entrants” (per Kirby J in the same case at 478).  
      
       
     50     In this case the respondent fell while walking in her usual way, taking her every day path from her house to her place of work, a path which to the appellant’s knowledge she had taken for several years.  
      
       
     51    In cross-examination it was put to the respondent that it would have been apparent to her as she walked to the swale that it was “quite wet” and she agreed. The next question was that she would have known from her “common knowledge of experience” that it would have been “naturally slippery” and she agreed with that, too. The point, however, is that the cross-examiner (in my view, rightly) assumed that the respondent would have first applied her mind to the condition of the mound as she walked towards it, and not before.  
      
       
     52    True it is that the respondent would have known that it had been raining for two weeks, but there was no reason for her to have thought about the condition of the mound until she was able to observe how it had been affected by the rain, and it was not suggested to her that she should have done so. The position of the respondent in this respect is to be contrasted with that of the appellant whose property was involved and who was charged with a duty of care for the safety of entrants generally.  
      
       
     53    It is probable that the respondent decided, probably sub-consciously, on the spur of the moment, to cross the mound. It was of course open to her to retrace her steps and take the longer and safer route to the school. For the sake of convenience, and to avoid walking an extra few hundred metres, she pressed on. While her conduct, in my view, was in itself careless, it could not be regarded as being unexpected. It was readily foreseeable that a person in the respondent’s position might take the risk and cross the mound.  
      
       
     54    In my opinion, the risk of a fall in the circumstances that obtained was not so remote that “a reasonable man, careful of the safety of his neighbour, would think it right to neglect it” (Overseas Tank Ship (UK) Limited v The Miller Steamship Company Pty Limited [1967] 1 AC 617 at 643, referred to by Kirby J in Romeo at 480).  
      
       
     55    Accordingly, in my view, the appellant should have taken reasonable steps to guard against the possibility of injury resulting from persons in general and the respondent in particular from walking across the mound after a severe bout of wet weather.  
      
       
     56    Preventative steps were easy and cheap. A rope barrier would have prevented the accident. Of course, the appellant could have constructed a bridge, as it did immediately after the respondent’s fall, but that would not have been essential. Roping off the area would have been sufficient.  
      
       
     57    In the circumstances, it is not necessary for me to deal with the assertion that the appellant should have placed a warning sign at the mound which, according to Mr Walmsley SC, senior counsel for the respondent, she would have obeyed.  
      
       
     58    Mr Taylor pointed to several matters of detail in the judgment of Delaney DCJ where he submitted his Honour had erred. There is force in many of the submissions so made, but even if those submissions were to be accepted, my conclusion that the appellant breached the duty of care it owed the respondent would not alter.  
      
       
     59    As regards contributory negligence, I am unable to agree with the findings of the learned judge. The basis of his decision that there was no contributory negligence was that the condition of the mound was not obvious. It seems that what his Honour had in mind was that it was not obvious that the turf would move when stepped on. In my opinion, however, as I have explained, the muddy nature of the entire mound in the area in question must have been patent and it must have been obvious that even the grassy patches were likely to be soft underfoot and likely to give way when stepped on.  
      
       
     60    In my view the respondent knew or should have known that the mound was muddy in several parts and hence there was a dangerous risk of instability in the ground where she walked. Her decision to proceed constituted contributory negligence on her part. 
      
       
     61    I do not regard the respondent’s negligence as serious as that of the appellant. I have pointed out that the appellant was charged with the overall duty of taking reasonable care for the safety of those persons who entered its property. It well knew that the respondent was likely to cross the mound at the point where she did. It knew or should have known that on the date of the accident the mound was in a dangerous condition. There were easy and cheap means available by which the accident could have been prevented. The appellant failed to take the necessary steps. The respondent, on the other hand, was guilty only of momentary carelessness in regard to her own safety. I would assess the degree of her contributory negligence at 25%. I consider therefore that she is entitled to 75% of the damages that she suffered. 
      
       
     62    I now turn to the challenges against the assessment of damages. The heads of damage that are challenged are loss of past earning capacity, loss of future earning capacity and past and future domestic assistance.  
      
       
     63    In regard to the first two heads Delaney DCJ found that, “subject to a small degree, she has lost her pre-accident earning capacity and has little, if any residual capacity”. There was ample basis on the evidence for this finding and it cannot be criticised.  
      
       
     64    In regard to loss of past earning capacity, Delaney DCJ allowed the respondent $4,611 for lost wages for the 1997 year and a global sum of $50,000 from 1998 to the date of judgment on 10 May 2000.  
      
       
     65    His Honour calculated the loss for 1997 on the basis that the respondent would work part time at 8 hours per week and assessed the loss of capacity to earn in the past on the basis that but for the accident the respondent would have worked full time. 
      
       
     66    Mr Taylor correctly pointed out that his Honour appears to have omitted in his calculations the income tax that the respondent would have paid on her earnings in 1998 and in 1999 to the date of judgment. The amounts involved, however, are not particularly large and may, to a degree, have been taken into account when his Honour made his “global” assessment.  
      
       
     67    More important is Mr Taylor’s submission that the learned judge wrongly based his assessment on the fact that from 1998 to the date of the trial the respondent would have worked full time. 
      
       
     68    By the time of the accident the respondent had never worked full time. In 1994, over the full 40 week school year, she had worked 7.88 hours per week, in 1995 she had worked 6.55 hours per week and 1996 she had worked 7.35 hours per week. It was not suggested that she had worked longer than eight hours per week before 1994.  
      
       
     69    In her evidence in chief the respondent said that before the accident she had hoped to acquire the skills to obtain full time work. She said, however, that it was “more like 1999 perhaps” when she intended to obtain full time employment (that is, as opposed to 1998). She was asked whether it was “realistic in the area in which you lived to get full time employment in the area in which you worked”. She replied “No, not really”. She said that in that area teachers involved with children with special needs were only employed on a full time basis at one other school nearby. She said that she could not say whether she might have looked beyond the school system “in the area of children with special needs” for work.  
      
       
     70    In the light of the respondent’s evidence, I accept that Delaney DCJ erred in assessing loss of past economic capacity on the basis that the respondent would have worked full time from 1998 to the date of judgment. On the basis that the respondent would have worked eight hours per week during the relevant period, and taking into account the contingency that she may have been able to work longer hours, I consider that she should be awarded $17,500 for loss of earning capacity to 10 May 2000. 
      
       
     71    Delaney DCJ awarded the respondent $150,000 for loss of future earning capacity. The basis of this calculation was the assumption that the respondent would earn $350 per week as from the date of judgment. On this basis the learned Judge arrived at a lump sum figure of $197,155 which he reduced by 25% for vicissitudes and other contingencies, thereby arriving at $150,000.  
      
       
     72    It is not clear on what basis the learned judge considered $350 per week to be the appropriate notional income, but it does seem that he used as his starting point $547.58 per week which is the income that the respondent would have earned had she worked full time. He then, apparently, reduced the $547.58 per week to $350 per week to allow for contingencies. The 25% reduction he later applied was a further reduction for contingencies. 
      
       
     73    As Mr Taylor pointed out, the sum of $547.58 per week was a gross weekly wage but his Honour wrongly assumed that it was nett of tax. The nett weekly wage, had the respondent worked full time, would have been about $450 per week. 
      
       
     74    Had the respondent not worked full time but worked 8 hours per week for the rest of her working life then, using the appropriate multiplier, her loss would be about $55,000. 
      
       
     75    The determination of the loss of future earning capacity requires an assessment of the chance of the respondent, but for the accident, working full time in the future. Mr Walmsley submitted that there would have been a very strong likelihood of that occurring, whereas Mr Taylor disputed this and submitted that allowance should be made for the contingency that the respondent might not have worked at all.  
      
       
     76    In my view, immediately prior to the accident, the prospects of the respondent working full time were fairly substantial. By then her two children had left school and had established themselves. She had the time to qualify herself further. There was no obstacle to her working full time were she to obtain an appropriate position. She was obviously a capable person who was highly regarded at the school and who was already qualified and worked well in a specialised area. True it is that there were difficulties in obtaining an appropriate job, and the vicissitudes of life might have been such that she might not have been able to work full time in any event. But even having due regard to these contingencies, a significant allowance must be made for the chance that the respondent would have worked full time until aged 65. Even on this basis, however, the award made by Delaney DCJ in this respect is, with respect, far too high. 
      
       
     77    Taking into account all relevant factors in this respect I consider that the sum of $110,000 would be an appropriate award for loss of future earning capacity. I consider that his Honour erred in awarding $150,000 under this head. 
      
       
     78    I now turn to the appeal against the awards made for the reasonable cost of domestic assistance. 
      
       
     79    The learned judge awarded $36,900 for the reasonable cost of domestic assistance for the period from 20 October 1997 to the date of judgment. He awarded $169,472 for the reasonable cost of future domestic assistance.  
      
       
     80    The challenge to his Honour’s decisions in regard to these heads was based on the proposition that the hours of domestic assistance that the respondent needed and would need, as found by his Honour, were excessive. In my view this submission can be dealt with shortly.  
      
       
     81    His Honour’s findings as to the number of hours in question were based on the evidence of the respondent’s husband and that of a medical practitioner, Dr Buckley. The respondent’s husband was not cross-examined in regard to his testimony as to the hours of assistance he had provided the respondent and the hours of assistance that she reasonably would need. Dr Buckley’s report was put into evidence by consent and the appellant did not seek to cross-examine him. The respondent was not cross-examined at all in regard to these matters. In the circumstances, in my view, his Honour was entitled to make the findings that he did and they are not susceptible to criticism on appeal. 
      
       
     82    In the result I consider that the damages as assessed by his Honour should be reduced as follows: 
      
       
        
       (a) Loss of past economic capacity from $54,611.00 to $17,500.00 (a deduction of $37,111.00). 
        
        
       (b) Loss of future earning capacity from $150,000.00 to $110,000.00 (a deduction of $40,000.00). 
        
       
     83    Therefore, the total damages awarded of $555,748.00 should be reduced by $77,111.00 to $478,637.00. 
      
       
     84    In the circumstances, I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       (1) The appeal be upheld and the orders made by Delaney DCJ be set aside. 
        
        
       (2) There be a verdict and judgment for the respondent in the sum of $358,977.75 (being 75% of $478,637.00) 
        
        
       (3) The appellant pay the respondent’s costs of the trial and the respondent pay the appellant’s costs of the appeal. 
        
        
       (4) The respondent have a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act.

      REGINA v THI XUA HUYNH 
       
       
        
      JUDGMENT 
     1   WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence of two years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of sixteen months, imposed by his Honour Acting Judge Woods in the District Court, following her conviction after trial by his Honour sitting without a jury. 
     2   The offence of which she was convicted was one of deemed supply of not less than a trafficable quantity of heroin, the relevant amount being 6.6 grams. 
     3   The facts, as found by his Honour, may be summarised fairly briefly. In the course of a surveillance operation, directed principally towards her son, police arrested the applicant while she was sitting in a motor vehicle. While there she was seen by police to throw out of the vehicle a bundle containing thirty-six balloons, each of which contained heroin.  
     4   As I have observed, the total weight of the substance found in these balloons was 6.6 grams, a quantity being not less than the trafficable quantity applicable for heroin. Also arrested at the same time was her son Anh Huynh Luong. He had been observed to throw onto her lap, when police arrived at the scene, five further balloons wrapped in tissue. The weight of the substance contained in those balloons was .83 grams. However, the conviction of the applicant was confined to the quantity contained in the thirty-six balloons.  
     5   The applicant does not seek to challenge the term of the sentence, the appeal being confined to the non-parole period.  
     6   In that regard, it is submitted that his Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances and, as a consequence, in not providing a sufficient reduction in the ratio between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence, in accordance with section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     7   Before turning to that submission, it may be noted that there was one clear error in the sentencing order, so far as his Honour failed to give effect to section 51 of the Act, which required him to direct the release of the applicant on parole, at the end of the period of sixteen months, which his Honour had fixed in that regard. 
     8   It is also possible that there was a further error arising from some confusion between the “exceptional circumstances” which this Court said, in R v Clarke (CCA NSW 15 March 1990 unreported), need to exist before a non-custodial sentence would be appropriate for a drug trafficker, and the “special circumstances” which need to exist before there can be a departure from the ratio specified by section 44(2) of the Act. Whether there was an error in that regard, or merely some infelicity of expression is not entirely clear, because it does appear that his Honour used the expression ""special circumstances"" and the expression ""exceptional circumstances"" somewhat interchangeably.  
     9   The difficulty in this regard is compounded by the fact that if his Honour, in fact, found there were no “special circumstances” then there was a mathematical error in that the statutory ratio would have called for a non-parole period of eighteen months rather than sixteen months which his Honour specified. That would have been an error operating in favour of the applicant. 
     10   Having regard to these possible difficulties in the reasons for sentence, I would be minded to grant leave to appeal, and thereafter to consider the submission which has been advanced this morning concerning “special circumstances”. It must be accepted that the offence was serious in that the applicant was involved in the deemed supply of heroin, and was actively assisting her son in that regard. 
     11   It is not the case, as distinct from the position with her son, that she was a user/dealer, but it may be accepted that she was engaged in this activity for the purpose of assisting him. He had his own problems in that regard, arising from a long-standing addiction to heroin and from the fact that the family was living in straitened circumstances with some financial commitments. The important considerations, however, which do arise concerning the applicant, relate to her deprived and difficult background, and to the medical sequelae arising from that background, and from a motor vehicle accident in which she had been involved shortly prior to the offence. 
     12   The evidence suggests, in this regard, that she had been born into a rural family environment in Vietnam where she had received no formal education.  
     13   She had been left by her husband, whom she married in 1967, when he escaped with two of their six children in 1979. When she eventually made her way to Australia in 1992 she was rejected by him as by then he had formed another relationship. She was divorced the following year and was left without financial support.  
     14   Thereafter, by reason of her limited ability with the English language and her lack of education, she had been unable to obtain employment and, as a result, had been suffering from anxiety and a depressive disorder. Additionally, she suffered from conditions of hypertension and arthritis as well as the sequelae of a whiplash injury sustained in the motor vehicle accident. She was at the time of the offence in receipt of sickness benefits.  
     15   Some material was placed before his Honour concerning her medical condition. This comprised a report from Dr Gordon Davies, a forensic and general psychiatrist, and also from Dr Thi Le-Anh, a general practitioner. 
     16   In Dr Davies' opinion, she suffered from “post concussive symptoms following her motor vehicle accident” which had been “superimposed on an underlaying chronic dysthymic illness which fundamentally relates to her difficult childhood and subsequent family problems”. Dr Davies thought it important that the applicant receive adequate psychiatric treatment on an ongoing basis, preferably by a Vietnamese speaking psychiatrist. He also thought it would be useful for this to be supported by the Probation and Parole Service. 
     17   Dr Thi Le-Anh dealt with the physical disabilities of the applicant relating to the conditions of hypertension, arthritis, peptic ulcer, and the post-concussive motor vehicle accident condition. In his opinion those health problems would be aggravated by her presence within a custodial situation, and that situation, he thought, would be detrimental to her already poor health. 
     18   The material placed before his Honour was taken into account but his Honour was not satisfied that they constituted special circumstances. It would appear in this regard that his Honour thought that any disabilities relating to her physical and mental state could be satisfactorily dealt with within the prison medical health system.  
     19   The evidence in this regard has been supplemented by a further report placed before the Court this morning from Dr Dong B Tran, a Vietnamese speaking general and forensic psychiatrist. His somewhat more comprehensive report confirms the significance of the matters placed before his Honour which Dr Dong Tran assessed as amounting to a “major depressive disorder, complicated by both unstable general medical conditions and multiple psycho social stressors”. He thought that she was “particularly vulnerable to the impact of custody and at risk of further psychiatric decompensation”.  
     20   Of particular concern, he noted, was the potential given her propensity to use avoidance as a coping mechanism and her inability to speak English, for deterioration in her medical and/or psychiatric conditions to go unnoticed. It was his opinion that her health could be “further compromised as a result of her remaining in custody”.  
     21   There were matters properly to the exercise of sentencing discretion since they were such as to visit exceptional hardship upon her while in custody, and were also such as to justify an extended period of rehabilitation post release.  
     22   Accordingly, I appears to me that, properly considered, these matters do constitute special circumstances, such that it would have been appropriate for there to have been an adjustment in the ratio between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence beyond that which was implicit in, or unintentionally achieved by the sentencing order. 
     23   In my opinion, the non-parole period should be reduced to one of twelve months to date from 10 November 2000 and to expire on 9 November 2001. I would propose, therefore, granting leave to appeal and allowing the appeal to the extent of reducing the non-parole period to one of twelve months, to date from 10 November 2000 and to expire on 9 November 2001. I would direct release on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. The parole is to be subject to the normal conditions applicable to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service for such period as that Service may determine. 
     24   HOWIE J: I agree. 
     25   WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court is as I have proposed.

        REGINA v ABDUL WAHABZADAH 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    HOWIE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Judge Phegan on 11 October 2000 for an offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 20 April 2000. The applicant is eligible for release to parole on 19 April 2003. 
      
       
     2    The applicant pleaded guilty to this offence before a magistrate and was committed for sentence to the District Court under s 51A of the Crimes Act. His Honour recognised that the applicant was entitled to a significant discount by reason of the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty alone. His Honour indicated that but for the plea, he would have sentenced the applicant to five years imprisonment. 
      
       
     3    Initially no complaint was made that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive or that the discount granted was inadequate. The fundamental ground of appeal argued was that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising from the fact that his co-offender was sentenced by Judge Phegan to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months. Because Judge Phegan distinguished the roles and conduct of the co-offenders in the commission of the crime it is necessary to indicate the facts of the matter in some detail. 
      
       
     4    On 20 April 2000, Maundy Thursday, the victim was working alone in a costume shop in Victoria Road, Gladesville. As she was preparing to close the store after late night trading, she heard a knock on the back door that opened onto a laneway running behind the shop. The victim opened the door believing it to be an acquaintance but found the applicant and his co-offender, Corneti Fusitua, standing on the doorstep. The applicant was standing in front of Fusitua and was holding a gun at the face of the victim. 
      
       
     5    Not surprisingly the victim was terrified. The two men pushed their way into the store and the victim was ordered to open the safe. She entered the combination, but because of a time delay the safe did not immediately open. When she explained why the safe had not opened, the applicant said to her, “If you’re lying then I’ll hurt you”. Fusitua said, “No she’s not, she is in shock”. He then said to the victim, “We’re here for the money, I’m not going to hurt you”. 
      
       
     6    The victim described the applicant as wearing a balaclava and being the more aggressive of the two men. While they were waiting for the safe to open the applicant said, “If she’s put the wrong combination in, I’m going to kill her”. Fusitua then started to tie the feet of the victim together with braid from the store and said to her, “Tell me if I’m tying it up too tight”. The victim told him he was not. Fusitua commenced to tie her hands together but stopped when the victim indicated that, if he did, she could not enter the pin number into the safe. 
      
       
     7    After a short delay the safe was opened and the victim placed the money from it into a backpack, which the robbers had brought with them. When the safe had been emptied, Fusitua tied the hands of the victim. When she complained that she would be left tied up all Easter, Fusitua said, “Don’t worry, you won’t be”. After taking the victim’s personal money and threatening her, the two men started to leave the premises. 
      
       
     8    Unfortunately for the applicant and his co-offender, the victim had been in the middle of a telephone call when she answered the door and the line had been left open. The person, to whom she had been speaking, overheard what was happening and alerted the police. The applicant and Fusitua were arrested before they were able to leave the premises. Initially both the applicant and his co-offender denied that there had been a gun used. However, Fusitua later indicated to police where the weapon, a replica pistol, had been hidden. The amount of money taken from the safe was $6,172. Both offenders refused to participate in a recorded interview after their arrest. The victim told police that the applicant was the meaner of the two men and Fusitua was a lot nicer to her. 
      
       
     9    In sentencing the applicant, Judge Phegan placed considerable reliance upon the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. His Honour believed that, for various reasons which he gave, a comparison of the offence committed by the applicant and his personal circumstances with the type of offence and offender described by the Chief Justice in determining the guideline showed that the applicant’s sentence should be toward the top end of the range specified in Henry. 
      
       
     10    At one stage in the proceedings Mr Dhanji, who appeared for the applicant, indicated that no complaint could be made about the sentence imposed upon the applicant if it were considered separately and apart from that imposed upon Fusitua. But some retreat from. or wavering in, that stance occurred during oral argument at least insofar as the non-parole period was concerned. I shall return to this matter later. Judge Phegan justified the apparent disparity in the two sentences on three bases: firstly, the role or conduct of the two accused during the commission of the offence; secondly, the assistance given by Fusitua in telling the police where the weapon was hidden; and thirdly their different subjective circumstances. In particular the differing non-parole periods can be seen to be a result of the fact that Judge Phegan found special circumstances under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were present in the case of Fusitua but not in the case of the applicant. 
      
       
     11    In light of the fact that no suggestion is made that the disparity in the head sentences imposed could give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant it is unnecessary to canvas in detail the matters upon which that distinction was made. Some criticism was made of the weight his Honour gave to the difference between the conduct of Fusitua and that of the appellant during the commission of the offence, especially in light of the fact that it was Fusitua who tied up the victim. 
      
       
     12    However, one way in which his Honour used the difference between the behaviour of the applicant and that of the co-offender towards the victim, was in looking at whether the conduct on the part of the particular offender was out of character. Fusitua had no prior criminal record and his Honour appropriately disregarded some outstanding matters in the Local Court. In those circumstances the conduct of Fusitua during the course of the offence took on more significance than it might otherwise have done. His Honour was entitled to view Fusitua’s conduct as consistent with his prior good character and that his involvement in such an offence was an aberration which manifested itself in the way he acted toward the victim. 
      
       
     13    On the other hand, the applicant had a record, which while not perhaps of the greatest seriousness, certainly disentitled him to the lenient approach which could be afforded to his co-offender. Perhaps more importantly, the record indicated that his behaviour on this night was not an aberration. There was in the applicant’s record an offence of demand money with menaces in respect of which the applicant had been ordered to serve community service. On the same date, the applicant was ordered to perform community service in respect of a conviction for carrying a cutting weapon. Although these offences were committed in 1997, they were not irrelevant to the exercise of his Honour’s discretion. The applicant also had other offences for dishonesty in his record. 
      
       
     14    As I have already indicated, a significant reason for the difference in the non-parole periods specified by his Honour, apart from the difference in the length of the terms of the sentence, is that Judge Phegan found special circumstances existed in the case of the co-offender but not in the applicant’s case. It has been submitted on the applicant’s behalf, that a disparity which is occasioned by such a finding is itself sufficient to warrant the intervention of this Court where there is material upon which a finding of special circumstances could have been made in favour of the applicant. I do not agree with this submission. 
      
       
     15    While I accept, as I must do, that the principle of parity applies in all aspects of a sentence, including the non-parole period, the principle is concerned with ameliorating a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender. If a disparity is occasioned by the operation of the law, there can be no justifiable sense of grievance arising simply because a proper application of the law in two different cases has given two different results. Specifically, s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act mandates that a non-parole period be not less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence unless there are special circumstances for it being less. I do not believe that there is any breach of the principle of parity, simply because different non-parole periods are specified for different co-offenders because of different findings as to the existence, or extent, of special circumstances. 
      
       
     16    There is nothing in either Lowe v The Queen( 1984) 154 CLR 606 or Postiglioni v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 to suggest otherwise. Quite the contrary, in the latter case even the majority of the High Court were of the view that there was no disparity by reason of the different non-parole periods specified between the two offenders. Disparity only arises when the difference between the two sentences cannot be justified by a difference in the degree of the culpability of the offenders or in their personal circumstances. A difference in a finding as to whether special circumstances exist is a difference in a finding as to the personal circumstances of the co-offenders, and, if justified on the material before the sentencing judge, there can be no basis in my view upon which any sense of injustice can arise either in the collective mind of the community or in the individual mind of a co-offender. 
      
       
     17    It was submitted, on behalf of the applicant, that two decisions of this Court authorise appellate intervention where there is a disparity resulting from a difference in the finding of special circumstances even if the difference in the findings were justified. In my view, neither of those decisions are authority for such a proposition, but, if they were, I would not be prepared to follow them. But in both R v Bell [1999] NSWCCA 423 and R v Muavae [2000] NSWCCA 88 this Court only held that the personal circumstances of the appellant required a finding that special circumstances existed and the failure of the sentencing judge to do so was an error. In each case the disparity in the minimum terms of the sentences imposed upon the appellant and the co-offender simply highlighted the error that had been made. 
      
       
     18    As it transpires that is what has happened in the present case. In determining whether special circumstances existed Judge Phegan did not avert to the fact, although there was evidence to support it, that the applicant had been in protection for a significant part of his custody prior to sentencing. The applicant had himself requested that he be placed on protection because he feared that he might suffer harm from particular prisoners who had been creating difficulties for him. It was the prisoner’s first time in custody and he is a young man. 
      
       
     19    Although the fact that the applicant had placed himself into protective custody in the gaol was a matter relevant to the question of special circumstances, it was not decisive. It will not always require the sentencing judge to find special circumstances justifying a reduction in the non-parole period. Much will depend upon the particular circumstances such as the reasons for the prisoner being in protection, the prospects of his remaining in protection throughout the sentence and the actual effect that it has upon the prisoner and his prospects of reform. What weight such a factor will have will also depend upon the objective seriousness of the offence for which the sentence is passed and the extent to which other factors such as general and specific deterrence must be reflected in the non-parole period. 
      
       
     20    But it is a matter which should be considered and taken into account on the question of whether in the particular case special circumstances exist which warrant a lesser non-parole period than the statutory relationship prescribes. His Honour, with respect, does not appear to have considered it in the present case, and it is such an important matter in the case of a young man serving his first term in custody that there should have been some reference to it so that this Court could safely assume that his Honour took it into account. The failure to refer to such a matter in the circumstances of this case indicates to my mind that leave should be granted to the applicant. 
      
       
     21    Further material has been placed before the Court today in the event that the Court may have to sentence the applicant. It indicates that to a significant extent the fact that the applicant is on protection is impeding his ability to obtain assistance to address the drug addiction which has been at the basis of his offending on other occasions and which underlies the present matter. The relevance of this material is that it no longer seems apparent that a period of 12 months parole will be sufficient to assist him overcome his problems as Judge Phegan believed. It indicates that a shorter non-parole period is appropriate so that the applicant can be released into a more intensive rehabilitation programme than that available to him at present. 
      
       
     22    Of course the applicant will only be released to parole at the end of the reduced non-parole period if he has proved to the Parole Board that, notwithstanding his earlier offending, it is appropriate that he be released into the community. In my view there are special circumstances justifying a reduction in the non-parole period notwithstanding the seriousness of the offence. 
      
       
     23    I propose that the application for leave be granted and that the appeal be allowed. The sentence of Judge Phegan be varied to the extent that the non-parole period is quashed and in lieu a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months should be specified. The non-parole period is to expire on 19 July 2002, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
      
       
     24    WOOD CJ AT CL: I agree. The order of the court will be as Howie J proposed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
       SIMPSON J :  
        
       
     1    On 12 November 1999 the applicant entered pleas of guilty to one count of detaining a person for advantage, two counts of sexual intercourse without consent and one count of aggravated break and enter and commit a felony. In addition he asked that three further counts of sexual intercourse without consent, one count of break, enter and steal, one count of stealing a motor vehicle and one of driving in a manner dangerous to the public be taken into account pursuant to s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (now s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (1999).  
      
       
     2    On 2 March 2000 Judge Nield sentenced the applicant. Having regard to the requirements of Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610, his Honour considered and fixed sentences in relation to each individual offence and then determined the questions of concurrence and totality. The precise mechanism by which he resolved this aspect of the sentencing will be detailed below. The total term of imprisonment he imposed was of thirteen years and four months made up of a minimum term of ten years and an additional term of three years and four months. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences. 
      
       
        
       The offences 
        
       
     3    The most convenient way to outline the applicant’s criminal episode is chronologically. It began on 2 May 1999. At about midnight on that day the applicant went to the home of a man he had known for ten years, and from whom he had, from time to time, received money for sexual favours. I will refer to this man as the first victim. The first victim was not at home. The applicant entered the house, he claimed by an open back door, and took and consumed some soft drink. He was still present when the first victim arrived home two hours later.  
      
       
     4    The first victim claimed that the back door had been forced, causing damage. The sentencing judge did not find it necessary to resolve the factual contest so presented. A physical altercation developed between the two men, during which the applicant sustained an injury to his head requiring eighteen stitches. The first victim gave the applicant the keys to the front door of the house and the applicant left. He later lost consciousness as a result of the head injury and was taken to hospital where he was treated. From there he was taken to the Merrylands Police Station, interviewed and charged. This was the offence of break enter and steal not separately charged but taken into account. By s 112(1) of the Crimes Act  1900 if separately charged the offence carries a maximum term of imprisonment for fourteen years. 
      
       
     5    The next group of offences were committed on 7 and 8 May 1999. On 7 May, a Friday, the applicant met the second victim (RG) in a bar. RG was twenty-two years of age. She and the applicant had a meal together and the applicant invited her to his home. She agreed to go. RG was somewhat intoxicated. The two travelled by taxi to a house at Castle Hill, the home of the applicant’s mother and step-father. The applicant did not live in the house. His mother and step-father had that day left for a holiday. RG told the applicant that she was tired and wanted to sleep. The applicant removed her clothes. He made it plain that he wanted to have sexual intercourse with her. She made it equally plain that she was not agreeable. He persisted and completed the act of intercourse. With his penis in her vagina he ejaculated. This constitutes one of the offences of sexual intercourse without consent taken into account. By s 61I of the Crimes Act, if charged separately it carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for fourteen years.  
      
       
     6    The applicant then obtained three pieces of rope, which he used to tie RG’s ankles and wrists. He tied a piece of rope in and around her mouth and then tied up her head. The applicant left the room for a time, but returned and told RG that he was taking her to the mountains. Using a hacksaw, he removed a steering wheel lock from his mother’s car. He carried RG out of the house and put her inside the car. He drove off at high speed, drinking bourbon from a bottle as he did so. He told RG that he was going to Lawson. When RG asked if there was anything there he said there was nothing but water and the river. He drove for some time and arrived at a bushland area. At some point in the journey he released the ropes binding RG. He made RG alight from the car onto a gravel track and walk on while he investigated whether he could take the car further. He then told her to get back into the car, drove off, stopped the car and pushed her into the back seat. He removed her clothing and his own and, from behind, inserted his penis into her vagina. RG was crying, asking him to stop, and telling him that he was hurting her. He continued to force his penis into her vagina. He again ejaculated whilst his penis was in her vagina. He left her naked in the back seat. This is the offence charged as the second count on the indictment, again laid under s 61I of the Crimes Act, and again carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for fourteen years.  
      
       
     7    A short time later the applicant raped RG in a similar fashion to that just described. This gave rise to the third count on the indictment and also carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years’ imprisonment. 
      
       
     8    RG told the applicant that she wanted to ring her father. The applicant said he would take her to a service station but not until it was dark. She begged him to allow her to go home but he threatened to tie her up again. In order to avoid this she promised not to run away and she engaged the applicant in conversation about his personal life.  
      
       
     9    The applicant then drove to Lawson and told RG that he was going to take her to a place that involved four hours’ walk. She suggested that they go to a hotel for some water before setting off; he agreed to this, and drove to the Lawson Hotel. RG went to the ladies’ toilet. On her way she told a man (possibly a patron of the hotel) and a female employee of what had happened and asked them to get help. She remained in the toilets. The applicant realised that she had sought help and that police had been called, and left the hotel.  
      
       
     10    This occurred at about 2 pm on Saturday 8 May. RG had been, in effect, the applicant’s prisoner since sometime the previous evening. The act of holding her captive for his own sexual gratification constitutes the offence of detaining for advantage, the first count on the indictment. By s 90A of the Crimes Act it carries a maximum term of imprisonment for twenty years. 
      
       
     11    After RG secreted herself in the hotel toilets the applicant drove west until the car ran out of fuel. He slept in bushland and in fact remained in the bush for about four days. 
      
       
     12    On Thursday 13 May the applicant broke into the house of his third victim, PH. PH was a fifty-six year old woman who lived with her husband in a rural area near the Hunter Valley. She left her house during the morning of that day. When she returned at about 4.20 pm she found the applicant in the family room. In response to her queries about what he was doing and how he had gained entry he said that he had been watching the house for five days, that he knew when her husband would be home, and told her that he wanted her car. He told her not to do anything and that he was not going to hurt her. She saw that he had in his pocket one of her kitchen knives. He told her he had been in the house since 11 am. It later transpired that he had taken some of her husband’s clothing and a quantity of food and alcohol. 
      
       
     13    The applicant then ordered PH to go into the laundry which she did for a short time before walking back to the kitchen and offering the applicant a cup of coffee. She engaged him in conversation. He ensured that the knife was both readily available to him and visible to her. He told her that he had entered by buckling the screen on the bathroom window, that he had stolen a car in Sydney, and that he had raped another woman.  
      
       
     14    After some more conversation the applicant told PH that he was going to tie her up, and he proceeded to do so, using her own pantyhose and scarf. He took the money in her purse, $40, and drove off in her car, leaving her tied hand and foot. He took with him the clothing, food and alcohol in his possession. This offence is the offence of aggravated break enter and steal to which the applicant pleaded guilty. An offence of break enter and steal committed in circumstances of aggravation as defined in s 105A of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty years. There were, in fact, at least two circumstances of aggravation: the applicant was armed with an offensive weapon (the knife) and he deprived the victim of her liberty by tying her up. It was the latter on which the Crown relied. 
      
       
     15    The theft of PH’s car is the offence of stealing a motor vehicle taken into account. If charged separately it carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years.  
      
       
     16    About 7.15 pm that evening Highway Patrol Police at Scone recognised and followed PH’s vehicle which the applicant was driving. They signalled to him to pull over. He ignored their signals and continued to drive. On the outskirts of the town he accelerated and was pursued by police. The vehicles reached speeds in excess of 150 km per hour. Other police vehicles joined the chase. The applicant led police through a number of country towns at high speed until he extinguished the lights on the vehicle and then skidded across the roadway and down an embankment. This was the offence of driving in a manner dangerous to the public taken into account. Such an offence, where charged separately, in accordance with the legislation then in force (the Traffic Act 1909) carried a maximum penalty of a fine together with imprisonment for nine months in the case of a first offence or a fine together with imprisonment for twelve months for a second or subsequent offences. The applicant had, in fact been twice previously convicted of such an offence. Following this incident the applicant was arrested. He immediately told police that he had tied up PH and had taken her car. Without identifying his earlier crimes, he acknowledged that he had done “something” in Sydney about which they would learn. He identified the clothing and other items he had stolen from PH’s house. 
      
       
     17    The applicant voluntarily participated in two interviews, each of which was electronically recorded. The first, which commenced at 1.12 am on 14 May, concerned the offences against PH. He told police that, after leaving the Lawson Hotel, he had spent four days in the bush before breaking into PH’s home. During that time he had used PH’s outside tap to supply himself with water and had made observations of her husband’s movements. This equipped him with sufficient information to break into the house with relative safety.  
      
       
        
        
        • • • 
        
        
       
     18    As the foregoing account clearly demonstrates, the applicant embarked upon a most horrifying criminal episode. There was quite extensive subjective material placed before the sentencing judge.  
      
       
        
       Subjective circumstances 
        
       
     19    The applicant was born on 30 December 1970. He was twenty-eight years of age when he committed the offences. He already had a substantial criminal record which, significantly, included three separate convictions for assault, two of which involved the infliction of actual bodily harm. In January and November of 1997 he committed assaults upon his then de facto wife. He has also been convicted of a number of driving and other offences. He has served four previous terms of full time imprisonment, one term of periodic detention (which was subsequently cancelled and converted to a term of full time imprisonment) and, according to his mother, a period of home detention. 
      
       
     20    The applicant himself did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. His mother gave evidence on his behalf. She is the Director of Nursing at a large Sydney Hospital and holds specialist qualifications in psychiatric nursing. She recounted a troubled family history. From her evidence, together with histories taken by Dr Robert Lewin (a psychiatrist), Ms Anita Duffy, (a psychologist), and a pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service, the following can be derived. By the age of eighteen the applicant had a history of abusing alcohol, to which he was introduced by his alcoholic father at the age of fourteen. In 1990, aged nineteen, he was diagnosed as having a mixed Personality Disorder with anti-social and borderline character traits. On four separate occasions he has overdosed on alcohol and/or other drugs. In 1999, in Long Bay Prison Hospital, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood was diagnosed.  
      
       
     21    The applicant has made some attempts to deal with his obvious alcoholism, having undertaken a detoxification course in 1989, the William Booth Programme in 1995, and having intermittently attended Alcoholics Anonymous. While alcohol is his principal drug he has also used tobacco, marijuana, amphetamines, and occasionally heroin, without developing an addiction to the last. He has made a number of suicide attempts. 
      
       
     22    The applicant lived with his family in country NSW until the age of six, when his mother left her husband and brought the applicant and his sister to Sydney. This caused quite intense resentment in the applicant. In recent years he has told his mother of certain incidents of sexual abuse committed on him in his youth by the husband of a friend of hers.  
      
       
     23    He has two children, now aged about twelve and nine, the result of a previous relationship, with whom he has no contact. He has had at least one other de facto relationship, with the victim of the assault offences earlier mentioned. At the time of the offences he was in a de facto relationship with another woman. She was away on holiday at the time of the these offences. 
      
       
     24    He has commenced, but not completed, an apprenticeship as a motor mechanic but has been able to hold down employment at different times. He has, however, lost employment on many occasions because of his alcohol consumption. 
      
       
        
       The remarks on sentence 
        
       
     25    The sentencing judge had regard to all of the material before him, including the psychological, psychiatric and pre-sentence reports. He found no causal connection between the applicant’s background and upbringing and the commission of the crimes. He recognised that the applicant has psychological problems, particularly related to the sexual abuse as a child, but found that, except for his consumption of alcohol before the rapes of RG, these were not the cause of his behaviour. 
      
       
     26    He recognised, correctly, the need to discount the sentence by reason of the applicant’s pleas of guilty and that the discount was to be significant because the pleas obviated the need for the victims to relive their ordeals. He observed also, again correctly, that the value of the pleas was to be seen in the light of the strength of the Crown case, which was, in relation to each victim, very substantial indeed. However, sentencing before the decision of this court in R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] 40 NSWLR 383, his Honour did not quantify the extent to which he discounted the sentences as judges are, post Thomson, encouraged to do.  
      
       
     27    The sentencing judge firstly determined the sentences appropriate to each of the counts to which the applicant pleaded guilty. These he specified as follows: 
      
       
       1 The offences against RG: detain for advantage: imprisonment for a total term of nine years;2. each of two counts of sexual intercourse without consent: imprisonment for a total term of nine years;3. The offences against PH: aggravated break enter and steal: imprisonment for a total term of six years. 
       
     28    He determined that since the offences against RG and PH represented two quite separate incidences of criminality, no reason existed to make the sentences concurrent, and that, therefore, the sentences in relation to the offence against PH should be served cumulatively upon those imposed in relation to the offences committed on RG. Wholly cumulative sentences of the length previously mentioned would have resulted in a total term of fifteen years. 
      
       
     29    His Honour then considered the question of totality. He concluded the overall sentence appropriate to the entirety of the applicant’s criminality, balancing the subjective and objective circumstances, to be a minimum term of ten years with a total term of thirteen years and four months. This represents a reduction of the overall sentences, for totality considerations, of one year and eight months. 
      
       
     30    His Honour considered whether special circumstances existed justifying departure from the ratio mentioned in s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989, but concluded that there were none. 
      
       
     31    The sentences he accordingly imposed were: 
      
       
        
       1 aggravated break enter and steal (PH): imprisonment for a fixed term of four years and four months, to commence 14 May 1999 and expire on 13 September 2003; 
        
        
       2 for the offence of detaining for advantage, and each of the offences of sexual intercourse without consent (RG): imprisonment for a total term of nine years, with a minimum term of five years and eight months and an additional term of three years and four months, these sentences to commence on 14 September 2003. 
        
       
     32    The sentences imposed for the offences relating to RG were therefore to be served concurrently with one another, but cumulatively upon that in relation to the offences relating to PH. 
      
       
        
       The application for leave to appeal 
        
       
     33    On behalf of the applicant it was argued that the overall sentence is manifestly excessive, having regard both to the objective criminality and the subjective circumstances. Counsel for the applicant relied upon a number of individual arguments. Firstly, he argued that the sentencing judge overstated the applicant’s criminal history. 
      
       
     34    His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Although the prisoner has assaulted a number of women, I cannot say that it is typical of the prisoner that when he is affected by intoxicating liquor that he has consumed he is prone to assault women. However, it is clear that the prisoner has learnt nothing from the previous convictions that he has suffered and the penalties imposed upon him for the offences that he has committed. 
          
         … 
          
          
         His criminal record contains convictions for assaults upon women and I fear that, as history has the habit of repeating itself, his assaults upon women will continue when he wants something that he does not have or has been denied.  
          
         … 
          
          
         The prisoner has shown in a past that he is prepared to assault women, particularly if things do not go his way.” 
         
        
       
     35    From these passages, it was argued, it can be seen that the sentencing judge perceived a “continuity” or “pattern” of offences not warranted by the record. I accept neither of the propositions contained in the submission. The first passage extracted in particular shows that the judge was stopping short of concluding that such a pattern existed. And, in any event, I do not think it could be said that, if his Honour had reached a conclusion that the applicant engaged in a pattern of such conduct, that conclusion would have been unwarranted by the evidence. In this respect it would be proper to have regard, not only to the offences against RG and PH, but to the statements of facts relating to the two assaults on the applicant’s former de facto wife in 1997. 
      
       
     36    I perceive no error in this respect. 
      
       
     37    Second, counsel argued that the sentences do not reflect a real discount for the pleas of guilty. In particular, he argued, recognition should have been afforded to the applicant’s very early confessions, coming as soon as he was apprehended, and in circumstances in which the applicant could not have known of the strength of the Crown case. There is some, but limited, force in this argument. True it is that the applicant did not know what evidence the police had accumulated, but he had committed the offences against RG at his parents’ home (which she was able to describe, and at which she had left a note seeking help), he had driven her off in his mother’s car (the registration number of which she had had ample opportunity to take), and he had not attempted to disguise himself from any of the victims. He was apprehended in the act of driving PH’s vehicle, and in possession of property stolen from her home. 
      
       
     38    Notwithstanding this, it is true that the applicant is entitled to a real discount. A trial (or trials) would have been lengthy and traumatic for the victims.  
      
       
     39    Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that inadequate account was taken of the pleas of guilty. His Honour specifically referred to his pleas at the earliest appropriate opportunity, to their relieving the victims of the burden of giving evidence, and to the savings of the time and costs a trial would have involved. 
      
       
     40    The third matter raised by counsel concerned the applicant’s expressed remorse. In this respect he referred to a letter written to the applicant’s solicitor by the woman who was his de facto wife until his incarceration (and who still apparently perceives himself in that role) and which was tendered in evidence on his behalf. She recounted her first visit to the applicant in prison, describing him as looking: 
      
       
        
         
         “so depressed, he couldn’t look at me, he didn’t speak for about ½ hour or so, and when he did, he was just start crying (sic), saying he was so ashamed, for what he had done he said he ‘was out of control’ and so remorseful, wish he could take it all back and start again.” 
         
        
        
       She claimed that he still cries and is ashamed of his actions. 
        
       
     41    There were also some expressions of regret in the reports of the interviews with the various professionals. In the Pre-Sentence Report the applicant is said to have to indicated “that he felt extremely remorseful after committing the offences”. However, these expressions of regret have also to be seen in the light of the applicant’s own words when interviewed. Particularly in relation to RG, these statements were not made in the immediate aftermath of the crime. His answers make clear that his intention was to have intercourse with RG regardless of her views. Perhaps most telling is an answer he gave after acknowledging that RG had told him to stop. He said he did not stop straight away and when asked why he said it was because: 
      
       
        
         
         “Just, I hadn’t finished yet.” 
         
        
       
     42    Notwithstanding this, the sentencing judge did find that there was some remorse, and he recorded his acceptance that the guilty pleas were an indication of remorse, he noted the expressions of remorse made to the applicant’s mother, to his de facto, and to Dr Lewin. His Honour noted, however, that in the absence of evidence from the applicant, he was in no position to assess for himself the genuineness of the stated remorse. He added that he did not reject the earlier such expressions. 
      
       
     43    In my view the evidence permitting a finding of real remorse was qualified, and this, in effect, is what his Honour observed. In any event, in my view, the value of remorse as a component in any sentencing decision for the purposes of mitigation lies primarily in its capacity to offer encouragement that the offender will not repeat the crime, and as evidence of insight into the offending behaviour, again, as a predictor of a reformed outlook. Here the judge was plainly not satisfied that the applicant’s expressions of remorse were of that character. In my view he was correct in that assessment. The remorse expressed was of limited relevance in this sentencing exercise. 
      
       
     44    The final matter argued on behalf of the applicant related to the medical and psychological opinions as to his emotional, psychological or psychiatric condition. Counsel for the applicant relied upon the principles stated in R v Letteri (unreported, CCA 18 March 1992) and similar cases. The nub of those cases is that, where an offender is shown to have been affected by reason of some disability in the commission of the offence, reduced weight may be given to the need for general deterrence as a factor in the sentencing decision. In my opinion this is not such a case. In a passage to which I have already referred, his Honour rejected the proposition that his emotional problems were the cause of this episode of criminality. Even without that express finding, I would not accept the proposition that the applicant’s culpability was in any way reduced, or that the need for the sentence to reflect the element of general deterrence was reduced. These offences were of a most serious kind. In my view, taking into account all relevant circumstances, the sentences imposed were well within the range available to the sentencing judge, and properly structured to take account of the requirements stated in Pearce. 
      
       
     45    I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

        REGINA v STEVEN KALITI 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
       
     1   WOOD CJ at CL: Following a plea of guilty to one count of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation, contrary to s 52A(4) of the Crimes Act, the applicant was sentenced by Kirkham DCJ to five years imprisonment. A non-parole period was fixed of three years and nine months. He now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     2   The circumstances of aggravation were that, when the vehicle driven by the applicant struck the victim, who was at the time standing alongside a box trailer, he was under the influence of alcohol. The victim suffered catastrophic injuries in the accident including traumatic amputation of one leg, and subsequent surgery amputation of his remaining leg, as well as brain damage. Breath analysis of the applicant following the accident, returned a reading of .2 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, a reading four times the prescribed limit. 
     3   No issue is taken with the head sentence, nor could it be, having regard to the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. It was then made clear that, among the circumstances relevantly to be taken into account in sentencing for this offence - and here expressly referred to by his Honour in his reasons for sentence - are the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted, and the degree of intoxication involved. The latter is relevant to the determination whether the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her conduct.  
     4   The present case is one where there was a clear and significant abandonment of responsibility, as was made clear, not only by the quantity of alcohol involved but also by the frank admission by the applicant that he knew he was over the limit but, nevertheless, elected to drive the motor vehicle. 
     5   Rather, this application is directed to the question of whether or not special circumstances should have been found justifying a departure from the ratio between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence prescribed by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     6   His Honour made no express reference, in his reasons for sentence, to the question of whether special circumstances had been established or not. Whilst it is unlikely in the extreme that his Honour, as a very experienced trial judge, overlooked this issue, particularly as he set the ratio in accordance with the section, and whilst a failure to make reference to the provision does not automatically establish appellable error: Mason [2000] NSWCCA 207 and McIntyre NSWCCA 18 April 1995; this Court has emphasised more than once the desirability of sentencing judges making it clear that there has been advertence to the issue. (See Brindley (1993) 66 A Crim R 204 at 207 and Jenkins (1999) NSWCCA 110). 
     7   I would be minded in the circumstances outlined, that is, in the absence of express reference to the section, to grant leave to appeal and then to consider whether the case is one in which such special circumstances should have been found. 
     8   The matters identified by the applicant as constituting special circumstances are five in number. They concern: 
      
      (a) the age of the applicant, thirty years at the time of the offence; 
       
      (b) his previous good character, including his clear driving record;  
       
      (c) the fact that he had what was said to be long history of alcohol abuse which, it was also said, had been occasioned by a need to help him cope with the grief and depression associated with the death of his parents during his late teenage years; 
       
      (d) the asserted need for counselling and psychotherapy referred to by Ms Kusch, a consultant psychologist; 
       
      (e) the fact that this would be a first period of custody for him. 
       
     9   Although Mr Dalton has said everything that can possibly be said in support of the appeal, I am unpersuaded that special circumstances have been shown. In order to make the application good, the applicant would need to demonstrate that there were circumstances that would justify a larger non-parole period than that specified by the Act: See Bloomfield NSWCCA 15 July 1998. Although that decision related to the precursor to the present Act, the principle expressed is equally applicable, in my view, to the present case, which would relevantly require attention to be given to two central factors: 
      
      (a) whether or not the case is one where, in the interests of the offender and of society, the applicant should have been given the opportunity of an extended period of release subject to supervision so as to enhance his prospects for rehabilitation; see  
      Moffitt 
       (1990) 20 NSWLR 114;  
      Morrissey  
      NSWCCA 15 July 1994;  
      Lett 
       NSWCCA 27 March 1995; and  
      Silver  
      (1999) NSWCCA 108; and 
       
      (b) whether the non-parole period to be imposed is one that would reflect the objective gravity of the offence, taking into account not only the objective, but the substantive circumstances of the offender; see  
      McIntyre 
       (1988) 38 A Crim R 135. 
       
     10   In Kama (2000) NSWCCA 23, Spigelman CJ questioned whether the age and lack of antecedents of an offender and the fact that the sentence is one involving a first occasion of custody are, of themselves, special circumstances within the meaning of the legislation. 
     11   I share that doubt, save to the extent that in an appropriate case, those circumstances may be reasons why, in conjunction with the remaining subjective circumstances, an assessment was justified that the applicant required a longer period than usual subject to a supervised release. Some care does need to be taken to avoid automatically elevating subjective circumstances of this kind, which are properly taken into account when fixing the term of the sentence, into special circumstances when consideration is given to s 44(2) of the Act. 
     12   Neither the age of the applicant, nor the fact of his prior clear record, or the absence of any previous custodial experience, point in that direction in this case, and I am not satisfied that they would here, themselves, constitute special circumstances. 
     13   Where special help is needed to overcome an alcohol or drug problem, or where some form of psychiatric assistance is needed to deal with the underlying circumstances which generate those problems, and where that help cannot adequately be provided within the corrective system, or where it would require an extended period of release subject to supervision, then it may be accepted that special circumstances do exist. 
     14   However, I am unpersuaded, in the present case, that such factors are present to the degree necessary to justify such a finding. In particular, it is by no means clear to me that the applicant did have the problem, either of the nature or to the extent to which Ms Kusch referred to in her report. In fact, it would seem from the thrust of all the remaining evidence that his problem, if it was a problem, was that of a social drinker at weekends, it being his choice or practice to attend hotels with friends and, on occasions, to drink to a significant extent. Certainly, it was not a problem noticed by his employer, who spoke favourably of his responsibility and reliability, and who was totally unaware of him having any drinking problem. Additionally, it appears that his partner was unaware of any such problem, and he himself disclaimed any acceptance of his level of consumption of alcohol as being problematic. 
     15   Accordingly, it appears, notwithstanding the history taken by Ms Kusch, that there is a significant absence of any proper basis for her making the connection between his earlier childhood problems and his consumption of alcohol, or of his need for particular assistance in that regard. 
     16   It is the case that drug and alcohol counselling is available within the prison system. Although Ms Kusch thought that there may be a need for psychotherapy to address any problem he may have had, including what she referred to as “poor coping skills”, that was a somewhat vague opinion. Indeed, it does not seem to me to be one that could support the finding of special circumstances which needs to be demonstrated in this case for the appeal to succeed.  
     17   In fact, the highest her report seems to reach, so far as any underlying problem is concerned, is encompassed in a paragraph which suggests that his personality testing indicated that “he was quite defensive and reluctant to reveal any psychological or inter-personal difficulties”.  
     18   That, I observe, seems to be altogether too vague a proposition to support the finding which is sought to be made. 
     19   I am not persuaded that the potential period of release on parole which is allowed for in the sentencing order, would be insufficient to meet the needs of the rehabilitation of the applicant. Otherwise, to reduce the non-parole period would be to result in a sentence which would be disproportionate to the objective gravity of the offence, and to undermine the very strong deterrent aspect which must accompany any sentence for this kind of offence. 
     20   I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal. 
     21   HOWIE J: I agree, but I simply want to add that in my view the finding of the personal circumstances which will permit a reduction in the non-parole period must be purposeful. The purpose to be achieved by a reduction of the non-parole period or a lengthening of the parole period must be something other than simply to relieve the offender of the burden of serving a minimum sentence of imprisonment as would be required by the operation of s 44. In my view, there is no purpose for which the longer parole period or a lesser non-parole period would serve in this particular case, and, therefore, there are no special circumstances.  
     22   WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will be as I have proposed.

       COFFS HARBOUR CITY COUNCIL v Theodore BACKMAN & ORS 
       
      
      
      The first respondent, Mr Backman, was injured when he fell into an open sewer access point on vacant land owned by the second respondents. Due to the long grass on the land, he did not see the open access point. The Council was joined as a defendant as they had issued an Order under s 124 of the  
      Local Government Act 
       1993 in 1995 to have the owners slash the land. It appears that the land was slashed after the notice was served, however there is no direct evidence of this. There is no evidence of any further complaint being made. If there was an inspection by the Council, a visual inspection from the street frontage would probably have sufficed. It would have been unnecessary to traverse the whole of the land, particularly the corner where the sewer cover was located, to determine whether the vegetation had been slashed. 
       
       
      Mr Backman sued the appellant and the second respondents for damages for negligence, and was successful against both. The appellants and the owners were both granted leave to appeal conditional upon them paying the first respondent’s costs of the appeal in any event. The Coffs Harbour City Council appeal from the judgment of Delaney DCJ. The owners of the land cross-appealed. 
       
      
      
      Held: 
       
       
      Per Handley and Stein JJA, and Grove AJA: 
       
      
      
      1) There was no evidence that the Council had removed the cover of the sewer access point, nor was any inference to that effect available. 
       
      
      
      2) It is not difficult to infer that Mr Featherstone, one of the owners of the property in question, displaced the cover of the sewer access point when slashing the land in response to the Council Order. There is no other plausible or rational scenario available. 
       
       
      3) The danger of the open access point was not one which the Council could have reasonably suspected to exist or known to arise. Therefore, there was no breach of duty of care owed by the appellant.  
       
       
       -  
      Brodie v Singleton Shire Council  
      [2001] HCA 29 applied 
       
       
      4) The owners should have reasonably expected that a person may cross their land up to the rear boundary and into the south-east corner, where the sewer access point is located. The owners would know, or ought to know, of the likely presence of trespassers on their land. 
       
       
      5) Once the owners knew of the danger created by the displacement of the sewer access point cover, there was a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to anyone entering this part of their land. The first respondent’s technical status as a trespasser did not diminish the content of the duty of care owed.

      Introduction 
       
     3    On Sunday, 1 October 1995 the plaintiff, then 75 years old, injured himself when he fell into an open sewer access point on land owned by the second respondents, Mr and Mrs Featherstone. He sued the appellant, the Coffs Harbour City Council, and the owners of the land, for damages for negligence and succeeded against both. Delaney DCJ entered a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $24,000 and apportioned it equally between the defendants. The appellant and the owners were both granted leave to appeal conditional upon them paying the plaintiff’s costs of the appeal in any event. 
      
       
      Facts 
       
     4    The accident occurred at Woolgoolga, north of Coffs Harbour and within the appellant’s local government area. The second respondents owned vacant land at 44 - 46 Clarence Street (also called the Pacific Highway) being lots 5 and 6 in DP 805637. The lots are subject to an easement to drain water 2.5m wide in favour of the appellant Council. The line of the easement runs from the street frontage straddling the boundary between lots 5 and 6 and, at a point about 35m into the land, turns to the south east and runs diagonally across lot 6 and crosses into the adjacent lot to the east close to the rear corner of the land. On this boundary there is a chain wire fence. At the rear of the land is a paling fence and, behind it, a number of dwelling houses. 
     5    The subject land was vacant and, so far as the evidence disclosed, had never had any buildings erected on it. To its south was a fruit barn and, to the north, a motel. 
     6    Lots 5 and 6 together have an area of a little over 2000m2 with a combined street frontage of about 42m, which was unfenced and open to the highway. The depth of the land varies but averages around 50m. 
     7    Within the easement is a sewer line which had been in place for 20 to 25 years prior to the accident. In 1992, or perhaps 1993, a manhole access point situated towards the south-east corner of Lot 6 was replaced. Apparently it had become buried and difficult to locate. The replacement system was an H type Humes Precast Concrete Manhole system, which was raised 190 to 200mm above the ground. It consisted of a number of components. Importantly for this case, it had a lid which fitted into a surround. The lid and surround had a combined weight of 230kg. These two units sit in a ‘make-up ring’ and are affixed with an adhesive or sealant. The system allowed for visual access by the removal of the lid with a specially designed tool used to raise it. If physical access was required to the sewer, the lid and surround would be removed by a backhoe equipped with a lifting device. 
     8    According to the evidence, it would take at least four able bodied men to lift the weight of the lid and surround without mechanical assistance. In addition, this would be a difficult task because of the problems of obtaining a grip. 
     9    On the day of the accident the plaintiff entered the land to carry out his Neighbourhood Watch duties. A neighbour was away from home and had asked him to check on her backyard, about 350m from his house. Mr Backman intended to check by looking over the fence, presumably the paling fence at the rear of the subject land. He walked through the vacant block of the second respondents. He had done this before. At one stage in his evidence he said three or four times. At another time he said ‘many times’. 
     10    The grass on the vacant land was, he said, very thick and had not been cut for a long time. He fell down the sewer hole which he had not seen, injuring himself. There was, he said, no top on the hole. He did not see the hole before he fell because it was covered with grass. Nor did he see the cover or lid. He described the grass as overgrown ‘wire’ grass which crept. It was ‘as thick as anything’. He estimated its height at 6 to 9 inches.  
     11    The plaintiff then went to see a Mr Elliott, who was apparently a council employee. Mr Elliott noted that Mr Backman was injured. The two of them returned to the land and ‘scratched around’ before they located the manhole and lid. To find the manhole Mr Elliott needed to pull the grass away. He said that the grass was ‘fairly long’. The lid was found about two feet to the southern side of the manhole.  
     12    Mr Elliott informed a council overseer, a Mr Third, and they returned to the land. Mr Third put a barricade around the hole. Mr Elliott confirmed that the entire crown (surround) and lid had become dislodged. It was off to one side of the hole - 18 inches to two feet away although ‘very close’. Mr Elliott did not think that its edge was at the hole. 
     13    The Council’s Risk Co-ordinator, Mr Quinn, gave evidence that after he was made aware of the accident, he made inquiries of council officers. He then telephoned the owners. This was on 4 October 1995. He asked Mrs Featherstone who had slashed the block. She said that her husband had done it. He was nearby so she put him on the telephone to speak to Mr Quinn. 
     14    Mr Quinn’s evidence was that: 
      
       
        
        Mr Featherstone said that he knew why I was calling, that he was aware of the accident to Mr Backman. He said that he hadn’t slashed the block, he said he had engaged a contractor to do it. I asked him what the contractor’s name was and he wouldn’t give me the contractor’s name.  
        
       
     15    Apparently the Council had received a complaint in early 1995 from a Mr Jarman, a resident, about the overgrown vegetation on the subject land. This lead the Council to send a letter to the owners on 27 February 1995 referring to a complaint about their property being ‘overgrown with vegetation and [is] not in a safe or healthy condition’. The letter recorded that an inspection by a Council officer had revealed that the complaint was justified.  
     16    An Order under s 124 of the Local Government Act 1993 was enclosed which, so it said, would apply after 14 days from 27 February 1995, viz 13 March 1995. The accompanying Order gave the owners of the land 28 days from 13 March 1995 to slash ‘all vegetation’ on the land ‘so as to render the land in a safe and healthy condition’. The stated reason for the order that ‘the land was not in a safe or healthy condition’ as it was overgrown with vegetation. 
     17    The Order, expressed to be under Order No 21 to s 124, noted that failure to comply was an offence and that, failing compliance, Council may undertake the works itself and recover the costs from the landowner. 
     18    There was no direct evidence of any subsequent Council inspections, although it appears inferentially that the land was slashed at some point of time after the notice was served.  
     19    Certainly the owners acknowledged this, Mrs Featherstone telling the Council officer that Mr Featherstone did it himself and Mr Featherstone saying that he had a contractor, whom he refused to name, do it on his behalf. 
     20    There was no evidence of Council receiving any further complaint about the condition of the land from Mr Jarman or from anyone else. If the Council had checked for compliance, a visual inspection from the street frontage would probably have been sufficient. Clearly, it would have been unnecessary to traverse the whole of the land, including the south eastern corner where the manhole was located, to ascertain whether the vegetation had been slashed. 
     21    Mr Green, the foreman of the Council’s Sewerage Department, gave evidence about the sewer inspection covers in the council area, saying that there were 7,390. Other evidence indicated that 70% of the access manholes were on private land. Council had 20 men in its sewer department. 
     22    Mr Jones, the operator in charge of the Woolgoolga Sewerage Treatment Plant, testified as to a change in the manhole in 1992 or 1993. He visited the land following the accident and saw that the lid was ‘completely off’, exposing the sewer access hole. It was, he said, ‘pushed off, it seemed’. The edge of the surround was just on the lip of the hole. A backhoe lifted it clear and it was placed back over the hole after new sealant was applied. He described the vegetation in the area as ‘pretty dense’ with high grass over the whole of the land. Although he conceded that he was guessing, he estimated its height at about two feet. The grass, he said, was growing over the lid and hole, concealing them. 
     23    Mr Jones was asked if it was his opinion that the lid and collar had been lifted. He answered: ‘No. I’d say it’d been pushed’. He was then asked why he thought that and he said: 
      
       
        
        Just the way it was sort of off on that angle, as though it had just been hit with something or pushed with something. …  
        
       
       
      The critical question 
       
     24    The question arises as to who removed the lid and surround from the sewer access hole. Bearing in mind its weight and the evidence about the need for four men to move it without machinery, one may put to one side a casual act of a third party malefactor. That can only leave two possibilities, the Council or the owners. There was no evidence that the Council had removed it nor available inference to that effect. The situation with the Featherstones’ is different. They did not testify before the District Court. Mr Quinn’s evidence of the conversations with Mrs Featherstone and Mr Featherstone may be accepted. He spoke to them within three days of the plaintiff’s accident. Mrs Featherstone told Mr Quinn that her husband had slashed the land. She put her husband on the telephone and he then contradicted his wife and told the Council officer that he had not slashed it but had engaged a contractor to do it. He was asked, but refused, to provide the name of the contractor. He was aware the plaintiff’s accident and knew why Mr Quinn was calling.25    There is no cogent reason why Mr Featherstone should refuse to name the contractor unless there was, in fact, no contractor and Mrs Featherstone was telling the truth when she said that her husband had slashed the land himself. 
     26    To slash the land, given its size and overgrown state, would in all probability require a tractor and slasher. It was not a job for a suburban lawn mower. At the time of the accident the lid and surround were in a position either touching or very close to the manhole and to its south. That is, pretty close to the south eastern corner of the block, an area difficult to slash with a tractor because of the angle of the boundaries and existence of fences. Jones’ evidence is compelling, that the lid was not lifted but pushed off at an angle ‘as though it had been hit with something or pushed with something’. 
     27    It is not difficult to infer, in the absence of any evidence from the owners, that Mr Featherstone accidentally pushed the lid off the manhole when he was slashing the land, knocking it off to the southern side of the manhole. Further, that he knew he had done this. There is just no plausible and rational alternative scenario available. It is otherwise difficult, if not impossible, to explain Mr Featherstone’s evasiness when questioned by Mr Quinn. 
      
       
      The Council’s position 
       
     28    His Honour found that the Council had breached its duty of care to the plaintiff. He said: 
      
       
        
        … I am satisfied that they did not do sufficient in all the circumstances after having found it necessary to give a notice to ensure that the land was sufficiently cleared, in accordance with its notice, it having knowledge that the sewer line went through that land, to enable the line to be noticeable to ordinary persons entering upon that land whether they be trespassers or otherwise.  
        
       
     29    It is clear that the primary cause of the plaintiff’s accident was the removal of the lid and surround from the sewer access manhole. If it had not been removed, the plaintiff would not have fallen into the manhole. 
     30    While the long grass obscured the hole and the separated cover, it was the open hole into which the plaintiff fell and injured himself. The Council was unaware that the lid and surround had been removed from the manhole at any time prior to the accident. It had no reason to suspect that it had been removed. In the absence of any further complaint about overgrown vegetation on the land I do not consider that the Council could be seen to be negligent in not continuing to follow up the matter and inspect the land. In any event, Council did not need to access the north-eastern corner of the site to check on compliance with the ‘slashing’ order it gave to the owners on 27 February 1995. A visual inspection of the state of growth on the land could be reasonably made from observations at the street boundary, or a small distance into the land. Such an inspection would not have revealed that the lid was off the manhole. 
     31    The danger of the open manhole was not one which the Council could have reasonably suspected to exist or known to arise. Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ noted in Brodie v Singleton Shire Council [2001] HCA 29, 31 May 2001 that: 
      
       
        
        Where the danger could not reasonably be suspected to exist, or could not be found except by taking unreasonable measures, generally there will be no breach of duty by the authority. On the other hand, there will be a breach of duty where an authority fails to take reasonable steps to inspect for such dangers as reasonably might be expected or known to arise, or of which the authority has been informed or made aware. (at 165) 
        
       
     32    It follows that there was no breach of the duty of care owed by the appellant and its appeal should be allowed. 
      
       
      The position of the owners 
       
     33    The second respondents cross-appealed against his Honour’s finding of liability on their part. Reliance is placed on the status of the plaintiff as a trespasser. 
     34    I have already found that, on the balance of probabilities, the lid and surround on the manhole became dislodged when Mr Featherstone carried out a slashing operation on the land in order to comply with the Council’s order. It was this action which created the danger of the open hole into which the plaintiff fell. The risk of accident was not far-fetched or fanciful, but a real one. 
     35    The real question is whether it was reasonable for the second respondents to expect anyone to come onto the corner of the land where the manhole was situated. Why would anyone be reasonably expected to visit this part of the land? I think there are a number of reasons why the owners should have reasonably expected that persons may cross their land up to the rear boundary and into the south-east corner, where the sewer access point was located. The land had always been vacant and completely open to the street, where the frontage was wide. Family pets, especially dogs, could wander onto the land and be followed by their owners. Young children might be expected to play on any part of the land. A number of residences are situated behind the paling fence at the rear of the land. Children could lose a ball over the fence and seek to retrieve it. It is possible that the land may be traversed as part of a ‘short cut’. There are many such possibilities. 
     36    In my opinion, it cannot be said that the owners would not have reasonably expected anyone to come onto their land and into the area where the sewer access manhole was located. 
     37    In Hackshaw v Shaw (1984) 155 CLR 614 at 662 - 663 Deane J said: 
      
       
        
        … it is not necessary, in an action in negligence against an occupier, to go through the procedure of considering whether either one or other or both of a special duty qua occupier and an ordinary duty of care was owed. All that is necessary is to determine whether, in all the relevant circumstances including the fact of the defendant’s occupation of premises and the manner of the plaintiff’s entry upon them, the defendant owed a duty of care under the ordinary principles of negligence to the plaintiff. A prerequisite of any such duty is that there be the necessary degree of proximity of relationship. The touchstone of its existence is that there be reasonable foreseeability of a real risk of injury to the visitor or to the class of person of which the visitor is a member. The measure of the discharge of the duty is what a reasonable man would, in the circumstances, do by way of response to the foreseeable risk. Where the visitor is lawfully upon the land, the mere relationship between occupier on the one hand and invitee or licensee on the other will of itself suffice to give rise to a duty on the part of the occupier to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to her or him. When the visitor is on the land as a trespasser, the mere relationship of occupier and trespasser which the trespasser has imposed upon the occupier will not satisfy the requirement of proximity. Something more will be required. The additional factor or combination of factors which may, as a matter of law, supply the requisite degree of proximity or give rise to a reasonably foreseeable risk of relevant injury are incapable of being exhaustively defined or identified. At the least they will include either knowledge of the actual or  
        likely presence of a trespasser or reasonable foreseeability of a real risk of such presence 
        . (emphasis added) 
        
       
     38    In my view, the requirements specified by Deane J have been satisfied on the evidence and inferences open to be properly drawn. Once the owners knew that the manhole was exposed by the dislodgment of the lid and surround, there was a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to anyone entering this part of the land. The occupiers would know, or ought to know, of the likely presence of trespassers on their land. 
     39    The majority in Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna (1987) 162 CLR 479 applied Deane J in Hackshaw. Their Honours said (at 487) that: 
      
       
        
        … There remains neither warrant nor reason for continuing to search for fine distinctions between the so-called special duty enunciated by Willes J. [in 
         Indermaur v. Dames 
        ] and the general duty established by  
        Donoghue v. Stevenson 
        . The same is true of the so-called special duties resting on an occupier of land with respect to persons entering as licensees or trespassers. 
        
       
       
        
        So long as these alternative formulae are retained, courts and others concerned with the application and administration of the law are committed to pursuing the “barren exercise” to which Brennan and Dawson JJ. referred. We are unable to see sufficient justification for their continued recognition. It is a mistake to think that the failure of an occupier of dangerous premises to take reasonable care does not encompass an act or omission on the part of the occupier which suffices to attract the general duty.  
          
        
       
     40    See also Samuels JA in Phillis v Daly (1988) 15 NSWLR 65 at 67 - 68. 
     41    The circumstances of the plaintiff’s entry on the land, while constituting a trespass, was but a technical one. He was there for a laudable purpose as part of his neighbourhood watch duties. He was not on the land for any nefarious, illegal or mischievous purpose. The land was vacant and open to the roadway. It almost invited entry by a variety of persons for a variety of reasons. The circumstances of the plaintiff’s entry on the subject land do not, in my opinion, diminish the content of the duty owed, which was to take reasonable care. On the facts as I have found them, that duty was clearly breached. 
     42    It follows that his Honour was not in error in finding against the second named respondents. Their cross-appeal should be dismissed. 
     43    Since the appellant Council has been successful and the cross-appellants unsuccessful, it follows that they must bear the whole of the plaintiff’s damages. 
      
       
      Proposed orders 
       
     44    I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Pursuant to the undertaking given to the Court on the granting of leave to appeal, the appellant to pay the costs of the first respondent. 
       
       
      3. Verdict and judgment entered in the Court below against the appellant be set aside and a verdict for the appellant entered. 
       
       
      4. In substitution therefor, a verdict and judgment be entered for the first respondent against the second respondents in the sum of $24,000. 
       
       
      5. The second respondents pay the costs of the first respondent and appellant in the Court below. 
       
       
      6. The cross-appeal be dismissed with costs.

        FRIDAY 29 JUNE 2001 
        
        
        REGINA v TREVOR CLIVE GREENE 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    HOWIE J: The applicant Trevor Clive Greene seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Judge Ducker on 15 December 2000 to a charge of using an offensive weapon with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm contrary to the provisions of s 33B(a) of the Crimes Act. The charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty was an alternative to a count which alleged the applicant had attempted to murder the victim. The Crown accepted the plea to the less serious offence in full discharge of the indictment. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 12 years. 
      
       
     2    The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. The sentences were backdated to commence on 30 October 2000 in order to give the applicant credit for the period served in custody before he was released to bail. The non-parole period specified is to expire on 29 October 2002, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
      
       
     3    The factual basis upon which Judge Ducker had to sentence the applicant was contained in an agreed statement of facts. None of the statements of witnesses was placed before him. The facts can be summarised briefly. The victim of the offence then known as Ms Smidt, and the applicant had been in a relationship for about 5 years and lived together as man and wife since July 1998. On the evening of 17 July 1999, they went together to licensed premises in Ballina. They left those premises after having consumed a quantity of alcohol at about 9.30pm and hired a taxi. The two began to argue as to whether they should proceed on to the RSL Club. Ms Smidt’s wishes prevailed and they went home. However, they continued to argue both before leaving home to go to the RSL club and on their return about an hour later. 
      
       
     4    Ms Smidt went to bed and sometime later awoke to find the applicant standing alongside her. He twice lifted the bed up tipping her on to the floor. The applicant then on three occasions, one after the other, lit a cigarette and threw it at her. The applicant then left the room and returned with a bottle of what Ms Smidt thought was mineral turpentine. He splashed it over her saying “This is the end. It is over. I warned you before.” The applicant then physically assaulted her. Eventually he pinned her to the bed, kissed her telling her it was the last kiss she would receive from anyone. 
      
       
     5    Ms Smidt pushed herself free and went to the bathroom intending to remove her clothes to rid herself of the turpentine but before she could do so, the applicant pinned her against the bathroom sink and attempted, three times, to set fire to the jumper she was wearing with a cigarette lighter. However, the applicant’s attempts to produce a flame failed. Ms Smidt then removed her clothes and got into the shower. 
      
       
     6    Eventually she was able to leave the premises. She was still naked but dressing as she fled and made her way to the police station. She immediately reported the incident. The applicant was then arrested and took part in a recorded interview. Although he accepted some of what Ms Smidt had told the police, he denied that he had attempted to set fire to her. The applicant was heavily intoxicated by alcohol at the time. 
      
       
     7    The applicant remained in custody until 2 September 1999 when he was granted bail by the Supreme Court. In November 1999 Ms Smidt and the applicant were married. 
      
       
     8    Ms Smidt gave evidence before Judge Ducker to the effect that she had wanted to have the charge against the applicant withdrawn by both the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Letters that she had written to the applicant while he was in custody and statements she prepared for the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions were tendered. In a statement she gave to the police on 18 August 1999 she indicated that she would not be willing to give evidence against the applicant. She stated that the applicant had an alcohol problem and that it was a matter that should be addressed in a rehabilitation centre. She expressed similar sentiments to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It was the evidence and attitude of Ms Smidt which apparently persuaded a judge of the Supreme Court to grant the applicant bail. 
      
       
     9    In her evidence before Judge Ducker Ms Smidt, who now refers to herself as Mrs Greene, explained that she had a gambling addiction and that in order to support it she had been following the profession of a prostitute from the home where the applicant and she were living. She attempted to explain her complaint to the police on the basis that she was intoxicated by drugs and alcohol. 
      
       
     10    The attitude of Ms Smidt to the prosecution of the applicant was largely irrelevant except insofar as it impacted upon the importance of the applicant’s plea of guilty. Judge Ducker recognised the significance of the plea in these circumstances and gave it due weight. 
      
       
     11    The applicant was 51 years of age at the time of the offence and was considered by his Honour to have no prior convictions. The applicant generally works as a self-employed painter and decorator. His Honour accepted that while the applicant was in custody Ms Smidt had taken and sold or pawned a large amount of his property including his work tools in order to obtain money for her gambling habit. 
      
       
     12    In a psychological report tendered in the sentencing proceedings it is stated that the applicant had been drinking alcohol all his life since the age of 3. His parents divorced when he was aged 14 and his father had been violent both to the applicant’s mother and the applicant himself prior to the separation. The applicant was at one stage married for 26 years and had 2 children but the relationship ended due to his alcoholism. He was described as being just above the borderline intellectually handicapped range in relation to his intellectual capacity and general knowledge. It was predicted that he would sometimes be out of his depth in dealing with complex interpersonal social situations. 
      
       
     13    The applicant told the psychologist that since being released from custody he undertook alcohol counselling for 3 to 4 months and that since being charged with the offence he had not consumed any alcohol at all. The psychologist was of the view that he was not by nature a violent man and that the court might look to the extremity of the situation in order to understand his behaviour. There was support for the applicant’s claim that he had been attempting to address his long term alcohol abuse in a reference from a dependency counsellor at the Ballina Community Health Centre. 
      
       
     14    In a pre-sentence report the officer expressed the opinion that both the applicant and his wife displayed a tendency to minimise the seriousness of the applicant’s offence and the potential consequences. The officer believed that the applicant required counselling and group work to develop an understanding of what triggered his loss of control and to find a method of controlling his feelings of aggression. Because of the officer’s strong opinion that conflict might occur in the relationship between the applicant and his wife in the future he believed that the applicant would require techniques designed to assist him to deal with feelings of frustration, rage and jealousy. 
      
       
     15    Only one ground of appeal asserts that there was a patent error made by his Honour during the sentencing remarks. All other grounds assert that by reason of his Honour’s failure to give weight to some particular factor or other the sentence was excessive. Those grounds can only be determined by a consideration of the sentence imposed in the light of the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant’s subjective circumstances. 
      
       
     16    It is asserted that his Honour erred in giving weight to the need for general deterrence because of what his Honour perceived to be “a growing tendency of offenders to resort to the use of corrosive and inflammatory substances as a means of inflicting death and injury upon other human beings”. The complaint is that his Honour had no evidentiary material to justify the particular emphasis he placed on general deterrence. The short answer to that submission is that general deterrence was a significant matter in sentencing the applicant simply because of the prevalence of violence by men against women in domestic relationships: R v Glen (NSWCCA, 19 December 1994). The means by which injury is sought to be inflicted upon the other person does not seem to me to matter greatly once it is accepted that the means could have resulted in death or serious injury, particularly where the latter harm is intended. In any event, a judge is not disentitled from giving significant weight to general deterrence simply because a particular type of offence, or the manner in which an offence is carried out, is rare or unusual: Nekuda (1989) 39 A Crim R 5. There is no merit in this ground, even though it was also submitted that by reason of the limited mental capacity of the applicant general deterrence was not appropriate in this particular case. In my view, his Honour was entitled and was required to give it significance. 
      
       
     17    The other grounds relied upon contend that the sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the pleas of guilty or pitched the starting level too high before the discount was given; that he gave insufficient weight to provocation and the emotional stress of the applicant arising from the conduct of the victim; and that insufficient regard was had to the applicant’s low intellect, his depression and incapacity to resolve interpersonal difficulties. Because it is not suggested that his Honour failed to mention any of these matters or made any other error of principle in relation to them, they are really encompassed in the assertion that the sentence is manifestly excessive having regard to these subjective matters and, therefore, his Honour must have erred in relation to the weight or use he made of them. 
      
       
     18    The difficulty with that submission is that I am unpersuaded that the sentence imposed was outside the range of a proper exercise of his Honour’s discretion. I accept that having regard to the value of the plea in this particular case because of the attitude of the victim, and the attempts at rehabilitation by the applicant, a sentence of 5 years is high if not at the top of the range. But because of the very real potential for appalling injuries and even death to the victim, the offence was a gravely serious one. The offence was not an instantaneous reaction to some act of provocation on the part of the victim. The applicant had to deliberately obtain the bottle of what is thought to be turpentine, splash it over the victim and then restrain her in order to prevent her from ridding herself of her clothes so that he could set them alight. 
      
       
     19    Notwithstanding the strong matters of a subjective nature the offence required a severe sentence if for no other reason than to bring home to the applicant the seriousness of what he attempted to do. Although it was submitted that this was an exceptional case, those matters relied on, if truly exceptional, were to be addressed, if at all, in the minimum period to be served by the applicant in custody. The non-parole period is in my view a relatively lenient one having regard to the head sentence and the objective seriousness of the offence and, in my opinion, no lesser period of custody could have been imposed. 
      
       
     20    I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     21    WOOD CJ AT CL: I agree. The order of the Court will be as proposed by Howie J.

     Regina v Nedjelko Bikic 
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    Remarks on Sentence1     HIS HONOUR: The offender, Ned Bikic, was tried before me on an indictment charging the murders of Orhan Yildirim and Mehmet Unsal at Bankstown on 5 April 1998. Manslaughter was left to the jury as an alternative verdict in respect of each count. In the event, the jury found him guilty of the murder of Mehmet Unsal and the manslaughter of Orhan Yildirim. 
     
      
       
      
    2     He had earlier faced trial with six other men but, for reasons which I need not recite, it was necessary to discharge that jury from giving any verdict in respect of him. The trial of the other six men proceeded and each of them was found guilty of manslaughter in respect of each count. I sentenced those men on 30 March 2001: R v Puta & Ors [2001] NSWSC 225. I summarised the facts briefly in those remarks on sentence and it is unnecessary to set them out here. The present offender is the ninth man referred to in para 1 of those remarks.  
     
      
       
      
    3     It was not the Crown case that Mr Bikic himself shot either of the deceased. There was evidence from which it might be inferred that he had a gun at the house, but I do not find that evidence satisfactory and I would not make that finding against him. When sentencing the other six offenders, I did not find that it was Mr Nitrovic who shot Mr Yildirim and I dealt with each of them upon the basis that he contemplated that a gun might be fired but without the intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
       
      
    4     The verdicts in the present case necessarily lead to different conclusions of fact for the purpose of sentence. The jury must have been satisfied that Mr Bikic was aware of the presence of a gun or guns and contemplated that a gun might be fired with the intent requisite for murder, but thought it reasonably possible that Mr Nitrovic shot Mr Yildirim under provocation. No other view of the facts is compatible with the verdicts and I propose to pass sentence upon that basis.  
     
      
       
      
    5     I am no better equipped than I was when sentencing the other six offenders to determine who shot Mr Unsal or in precisely what circumstances. Nor, apart from Mr Nitrovic, can I make any finding about who among the offenders had guns. Equally, I remain unable to determine who struck each of the deceased upon the head with the butt of a gun. From the nature of their gunshot wounds it is easily inferred that both deceased were shot with the intent to kill. On that, senior counsel for Mr Bikic did not wish to be heard to the contrary.  
     
      
       
      
    6     Implicit in the verdicts is the jury’s acceptance that Mr Bikic was present at the 777 café when the offenders gathered there earlier in the evening, and that he was one of those who travelled via Mr Vincent’s home at Marrickville to the house at Bankstown. I heard competing submissions about his role in the planning of the ambush, as I did in relation to the other six offenders prior to sentencing them. Again, I am no better placed than I was then to determine the motive for the ambush and I am unable to arrive at any firm conclusion about Mr Bikic’s involvement in the planning and direction of it. In any event, I do not consider that it is a matter which needs to be resolved for the purpose of assessing his culpability for these crimes of homicide, for the same reasons I gave when dealing with the other six men: see paras 12 & 13 of those remarks. I remain unable to conclude who made the decision to carry guns or that that decision was made any earlier than after the offenders had gathered at the house. 
     
      
       
        
       Subjective case 
        
       
      
    7     Mr Bikic was forty-five years old at the time of the offences and is now forty-eight. He has a brief criminal record, the only matter of significance being a conviction in 1989 for supplying heroin for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. He was born in Croatia of Serbian parents, and has an older brother and a younger sister. He came to this country in 1977 but maintained contact with his family.  
     
      
       
      
    8     His sister married in 1979 and has two sons. Their comfortable lifestyle in Croatia was shattered by the civil war in Yugoslavia and Mr Bikic encouraged them to migrate to Australia. Written statements by his sister and her husband attest to his kindness and to the practical assistance he afforded them in settling in this country. They speak also of his devotion to their sons and his support of them, emotionally and financially. I have no doubt that he will enjoy the continuing support of his sister and her family. 
     
      
       
      
    9     I received two other testimonials from people who appreciated Mr Bikic’s compassion and assistance during difficult periods in their lives, one of them being the wife of one of his co-offenders. I have no evidence about his personal circumstances or his employment (apart from such evidence as there was about his involvement in the 777 café). Nevertheless, the material which has been presented is to his credit. 
     
      
       
        
       Sentence 
        
       
      
    10     Mr Bikic was in custody from the date of his arrest, 14 November 1998, until 10 July 2000, when I granted him bail following the discharge of the jury in respect of his case in the previous trial. The verdicts in this trial were given on 14 May 2001, and he has been back in custody since that date. Accordingly, his periods of pre-sentence custody aggregate something in excess of one year and nine months. I shall recognise this by backdating the first sentence which I pass by one year and ten months.  
     
      
       
      
    11     I have regard to the fact that the bail to which he was subject contained stringent conditions. In addition, during his earlier period in custody he was classified as a “high risk” prisoner, which rendered the conditions of his custody more onerous and subjected him to exceptional security when travelling to and from court during the earlier trial. That is a matter properly to be taken into account, as it was in relation to those of his co-offenders who were classified in the same way: see para 57 of my earlier remarks on sentence. There are special circumstances warranting of departure from the usual proportion between head sentence and non-parole period, for much the same reasons as there were with the co-offenders (para 59). Now, as then, the Crown prosecutor has made no submission to the contrary. 
     
      
       
      
    12     As I observed when sentencing the other offenders (para 58), the plan to assault the two victims whilst some of the participants were armed with loaded guns was extremely dangerous. There was a very great likelihood that death or serious injury would result. I accept that homicide occurs in a wide variety of circumstances and that there can be a degree of overlap between the criminality of offences of murder and manslaughter. Nevertheless, I cannot accede to the submission of senior counsel for Mr Bikic that his objective criminality is less than that of his co-offenders, Arben Puta, Zeljko Nitrovic and Raymond Curry. The fact that he has been found guilty of one count of murder necessarily elevates his overall criminality significantly above that of all his co-offenders.  
     
      
       
      
    13     For the manslaughter of Orhan Yildirim he stands for sentence on a different legal basis from his co-offenders. The various forms of manslaughter do not necessarily dictate different ranges of sentence, the range of sentencing available for that crime being “notoriously wide”: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 381. For the same offence I sentenced Zeljko Nitrovic, Raymond Curry, Goran Mackic and Russel Oldham to imprisonment for nine years. (Arben Puta and Satuala Nanai were sentenced differently, in each case for reasons which have no application here. However, I consider that Mr Bikic’s contemplation of the use of a gun to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm renders his culpability for the manslaughter somewhat greater than that of the other four men. The jury classified that killing as manslaughter rather than murder because of the circumstances in which Mr Yildirim met his death, not because of any conduct of Mr Bikic. 
     
      
       
      
    14     I propose to pass a sentence on each count reflecting the criminality of the offence charged, directing that one be served partly cumulatively upon the other. This is the course which I adopted with the other offenders: see para 61 of those remarks. In this way I believe that effect will be given to the principle of totality, recognising that the two offences were components of one brief episode. 
     
      
       
      
    15     Ned Bikic, for the manslaughter of Orhan Yildirim you are sentenced to imprisonment for ten years, to date from 6 September 1999, with a non-parole period of seven years. For the murder of Mehmet Unsal you are sentenced to imprisonment for sixteen years, to date from 6 September 2000, with a non-parole period of eleven years. 
     
      
       
      
    16     Effectively, you have been sentenced to imprisonment for seventeen years, with non-parole periods aggregating twelve years, dating from 6 September 1999. You will be eligible for release on parole on 6 September, 2011.

     70058/98 - REGINA v STEPHEN DARCY CHEATHAM 
      
      
      
     SENTENCE 
      
       
      
      
     1     
     HIS HONOUR: Stephen Darcy Cheatham appears for sentence following a conviction by jury on two counts of murder and one count of wounding with intent to murder. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The victims were, respectively, his wife and one of his daughters in relation to the murder counts and another daughter in relation to the last mentioned count. This was a second trial. 
      
       
      
     3     
     It is appropriate to relate some details concerning the previous proceedings because they will explain the brevity of what I intend to say. The prisoner was presented for trial upon identical counts and raised a defence of mental illness. This was rejected by the jury and the prisoner was sentenced by Newman J. At the first trial it appears to have been common ground that there was no basis for leaving the possibility of an alternative verdict of guilty of manslaughter on the counts of murder. An appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal held that this deprived the prisoner of an opportunity for a jury to consider whether or not he should be not so considered and the matter was sent back for retrial. 
      
       
      
     4     
     I observed in the absence of the jury during this trial that an order had been made sending back all three counts for retrial although technically the defence of diminished responsibility did not apply to the count of wounding with intent to murder. Although unexpressed, it is easy to understand why a Court of Criminal Appeal would wish to avoid the possible paradox of leaving intact a conviction on the third count and having a jury find that the defence of mental illness was made out in respect of the others, bearing in mind that all three counts arise out of activity within a very short span of time on the one occasion. 
      
       
      
     5     
     After the conviction at the first trial, Newman J made a series of findings. I have indicated to counsel that I have this morning examined the transcript of his remarks on sentence, and Mr Zahra SC for the prisoner indicated that he had little dispute of any finding of fact therein made. So far as I am able to detect he has no dispute with any finding that was there made. Of course, to a limited extent, his Honour was dealing with the matter in a slightly different context in that evidence potentially relevant to diminishing the murder counts to manslaughter was not before him. It does not seem to me that I need elaborate upon these matters and the detail of his remarks may be deemed incorporated for present purposes.  
      
       
      
     6     
     As was his Honour, I am satisfied that to some degree the prisoner was suffering from a delusion at the relevant time that he was suffering from AIDS. However, the finding of the jury is such, and my own finding is, that at the time of the various critical events he was aware of the nature and quality of his acts, which in each case involved stabbing, and that he knew that his acts were wrong. 
      
       
      
     7     
     It was necessary for me to direct the jury in accordance with Australian law that wrong should be understood in the sense of morality. The evidence would satisfy me that this was so. 
      
       
      
     8     
     I should add if it be relevant at all that it was clear on the evidence in my view, and I would find that, in addition, at all relevant times the prisoner was well aware that what he was doing was against the law. In a rather convoluted sense this series of events were a type of claimed euthanasia. It seems to me that the culpability of the prisoner for this, given the findings which the jury must have made and which I have made, is not significantly reduced. 
      
       
      
     9     
     I have had some evidence from Dr Milton that the prisoner feels a sense of guilt and depression but he is no longer deluded. The evidence of psychiatrists is that he does not present a risk to society. 
      
       
      
     10     
     I have also had some evidence from his brother who gave evidence at the trial. He has given evidence of some particular incidents which have occurred during the prisoners incarceration. He is the son of a prison officer and the brother of a police officer. He himself has worked for several years in the juvenile justice system. It is said that he was recognised by one of his former juvenile justice clients who is now an adult and in custody with him. Therefore he is in strict custody. 
      
       
      
     11     
     When the prisoner appeared for sentence before Newman J this situation was explicitly anticipated. The evidence I have before me in my view is no more than a manifestation of some particular events in accordance with that anticipation. 
      
       
      
     12     
     Mr David Cheatham gave evidence that his brother had expressed a view that he believes that he deserves the worst form of punishment. I indicated to counsel and I would simply note that and I would not take it literally. 
      
       
      
     13     
     I have already indicated to counsel my view that it would not serve the ends of justice to increase a sentence following a retrial which was made necessary only as a result of a successful appeal by the prisoner. I am conscious that I must exercise a discretion independent from that exercised by Newman J, and the question for me is not whether or not I should reduce that sentence but what sentence I should properly impose in all the circumstances. 
      
       
      
     14     
     As I have already said the relevant facts are for all practical purposes identical as they appeared before his Honour and as they appear before me. Although, as I have said, it is not my task simply to reapply what was done before, I have reached the conclusion that the appropriate sentence is identical to that imposed by Newman J. I acknowledge the submission by Mr Zahra that there have been stresses involved in the repeated proceedings. However, these in reality pale into insignificance having regard to the seriousness of the offences committed.  
      
       
      
     15     
     I have refrained from restating the details of the offences. This was done on the last occasion. It suffices for present purposes merely to observe that although on the night of the killings the prisoner had a telephone conversation with one of his superiors in which he appeared to be in good spirits, some time in the next few hours something happened to cause him to kill his wife with multiple stab wounds, to kill his three year old daughter with multiple stab wounds, and to attempt to do the same to the baby. I have not overlooked the circumstance that thereafter the prisoner made a genuine attempt himself to suicide. 
      
       
      
     16     
     I take that into account, as did Newman J, in coming to the conclusion that this is not a case which falls into the worst category. Since the sentence in 1998 there have been some technical changes to the method of imposition of sentence, but in substance I propose to impose the same. If you would stand up please Mr Cheatham. 
      
       
      
     17     
     On the first count, the murder of Sandra Marie Cheatham, you are sentenced to 24 years imprisonment to commence on 6 March 1998. I specify a non-parole period of 16 years to commence on the same date. For the murder of Briahna Marie Cheatham I sentence you to imprisonment for 16 years also to commence on 6 March 1998. For the wounding with intent to murder of Tahnee Jade Cheatham I sentence you to 12 years imprisonment to commence also on 6 March 1998. All of the sentences will be served concurrently. 
      
       
      
     18     
     It is manifest in the orders that I have made that I have, like Newman J, come to the conclusion that there are special circumstances justifying departure from the proportions set out in the relevant sentencing statute.  
      
       
      
     19     
     I recommend to the Corrective Services Department that there be made available to the prisoner psychiatric treatment and the like in accordance with his needs as assessed from time to time.

     SENTENCE 
      
      
       
      
     1     
     HIS HONOUR: On 23 April this year Alvina Joyce Fox pleaded guilty at Coffs Harbour before me to an indictment making available plea to the offence of manslaughter. She stands convicted of that offence. As I have formed a firm view as to the course I should take I propose to proceed to sentence forthwith even though I might express myself more felicitously were I to stand the matter over. But it seems to me in the interests of all concerned, and in particular for overall justice, that I proceed now. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The prisoner is a young woman now aged 33 years. She is of Aboriginal or Pacific Islander extraction. Her life has been one of significant tragedy. She was born in Townsville in North Queensland and spent a lot of her young years on Palm Island, which is located off the coast near the township of Cardwell. Over the years a lot has been learned about conditions for residents there and it is not my present function to comment upon them beyond finding that the prisoner was considerably disadvantaged by reason of her residence at that place. 
      
       
      
     3     
     However, in later years things have changed manifestly for the better, and there is considerable material before me that indicates that it is desirable that she be able to fulfil her wish to return there where she has children presently in the custody of her sister and other family support. 
      
       
      
     4     
     I should turn however to the facts of the offence. The prisoner has had an almost lifetime addiction to alcohol. Numerous attempts to overcome this have been unsuccessful. The killing occurred in a park in the township of Moree and the victim was in a de facto relationship with the prisoner. They had recently been discharged from an obviously failed attempt at alcohol rehabilitation in a nearby township. However, they were resided together at what is called Byamee Proclaimed Place, which is a shelter for homeless and intoxicated persons in Moree open between 4:00pm and 8:00pm. 
      
       
      
     5     
     On the day in question, 12 November 1999, they had been in the park where they consumed a considerable amount of methylated spirits together with apparently an amount of wine. I am satisfied that the prisoner had no intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the victim. Indeed I am satisfied that in an alcohol haze she was attempting to wake him by kicking him about the head. I am satisfied she has no real recollection of the circumstances. 
      
       
      
     6     
     It is true that some witnesses give evidence of things that she apparently said at the time, but I am satisfied that whatever she did and said was to a significant extent outside of any control or intent by reason of her enormous ingestion of insidious intoxicating liquor. The vulnerability of the victim was later discovered and, whilst this is not directly relevant, it is nevertheless a circumstance which I feel ought be taken into account. 
      
       
      
     7     
     I am satisfied that she had no appreciation of the serious harm which might befall the victim. I should note in passing that although she used her feet they were not shod with shoes or anything of the sort at the time. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted on the basis of the Crown's assertion that nevertheless she was engaged in an unlawful and dangerous and act and, despite the alcohol which I have mentioned, had sufficient capacity to form the intention which was necessary to constitute that offence. 
      
       
      
     9     
     She was taken into custody on 13 November 1999. Shortly thereafter she was released to bail but the conditions of bail were such that she was in what I would regard as effective although different custody. More tragedy occurred during her period on bail. There was an attempt at suicide by hanging. She was taken to a women's refuge, but I accept the submission by Mr Ramage of Queens Counsel on her behalf that she was in fact sent back to prison at Mulawa in September last year because there simply seemed to be nowhere else to send her. For present purposes I regard her custody as being continuous since 13 November 1999. 
      
       
      
     10     
     I have already made some reference to the tragedy which is to be found in her background. Mr Ramage has helpfully reduced his submissions to writing. I have already indicated how helpful I have found them and I do not propose to take up time this morning by repeating what can be read there. The written submissions will remain with the papers and I would simply indicate that I regard those submissions as compelling in all the circumstances. From it I have gleaned some of the facts that I have mentioned. 
      
       
      
     11     
     The problem arises then what is the appropriate course? It is acknowledged, as Mr Ramage necessarily acknowledged, that the taking of human life must be regarded seriously in any circumstances. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the prisoner is truly contrite in every sense that expression bears. She had no intention to cause the harm that followed her actions. 
      
       
      
     12     
     I have had tendered to me, from a former de facto wife of the deceased, a document in the nature of a victim impact statement. It is not necessary for me to elaborate upon the limited use that can be made of such a document and it suffices for present circumstances merely to say that I have noted what is contained in that document. 
      
       
      
     13     
     I have already indicated that I believe that the interests of justice will best be served by the prisoner being able to return to Palm Island where she has some family support. I have not noted, but perhaps I should specify, that the prisoner, despite the gloomy past affectation by intoxicating liquor, is nevertheless before a court virtually on the first occasion; she has no prior convictions on her record. That stands in good stead and is, in my view, a considerable indication of her basic good character. I am satisfied that it is unlikely that she would offend again. I have taken into account the reports that have been tendered and the analysis that, in particular, Dr Westmore has offered. 
      
       
      
     14     
     I return then to the order that I should make. I believe that I should impose a sentence which reflects the seriousness with which the community regards the taking of human life. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have adumbrated, there are obviously special circumstances, and I would describe them as very special circumstances in this case. 
      
       
      
     15     
     It is not necessary for me to elaborate upon the general disadvantage that has been recognised as having been inflicted upon Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens in this nation. Nevertheless, to the extent that this is a matter of notoriety, the particular facts in this case show that the prisoner has suffered in an extreme way throughout her life. It will not be in her interests, in particular, for me to make an order for her immediate release. It is obvious that she will need assistance in the future and, for that reason, the assistance of authorities such as probation authorities will be necessary. 
      
       
      
     16     
     I wish to indicate for the information particularly of the Parole Board that it is my view that the prisoner should in fact be released to parole as soon as possible after the non-parole period which I am about to specify, and I would strongly recommend that parole be granted upon conditions which would enable her to resume her life in Palm Island where, as I have said, she could have some family support. 
      
       
      
     17     
     For the manslaughter of Brian Leslie Gardiner I sentence you to 5 years imprisonment to date from 13 November 1999. I specify a non-parole period of two years dating from 13 November 1999 thereby making you eligible for release to parole on 12 November this year.

        JUDGMENT 
         
        
       
     1    POWELL JA: This is an application by the Crown to extend the time for appealing, and, if that extension be granted, an appeal in respect of a Judgment delivered, and order made, by Moore DCJ on 14 November 2000, by which Order his Honour stayed conditionally the further prosecution of an indictment which had been found against the Respondent as long ago as August 1997. 
      
       
     2    By that indictment, the Respondent was charged with three offences, they being: 
      
       
        
       1. that on 15 February 1997 at Tahmoor he did cultivate prohibited plants, being a number of plants not less than the commercial quantity; 
        
        
       2. that on 15 February 1997 at Tahmoor he did possess a firearm namely a .22 calibre Jennings self loading pistol, without being licensed to do so by licence or permit; and 
        
        
       3. that on 15 February 1997 at Tahmoor he did possess a firearm namely a 12 gauge Mossberg repeating shotgun, without being licensed to do so by licence or permit. 
        
       
     3    As outlined in the Crown's Written Submissions, the proceedings the subject of the order arose from a search of what is said to be the Respondent's property at Tahmoor on 15 February 1997. On that day, so it is said, a Police helicopter flew over the property whilst investigating another matter. Police in the helicopter saw a large number of cannabis plants growing on the property. The Respondent was seen standing on the verandah of the house on the property. When police attended the house the Respondent was found hiding in the roof. A search warrant was obtained and police found, in addition to those plants which had been seen growing: 
      
       
        
       (a) a large number of cannabis plants growing in a shed fitted out with hydroponic equipment; 
        
        
       (b) cannabis leaf inside a greyhound kennel; 
        
        
       (c) a loaded pistol and ammunition in the Respondent's car in the garage; and 
        
        
       (d) a loaded shotgun and ammunition under what was said to have been the Respondent's bed. 
        
        
       Following the search, the Respondent was then arrested and charged. 
        
       
     4    As best as I can judge it from some of the statements made by the Respondent during the course of the hearing of this application the Respondent asserts (inter alia): 
      
       
        
       (a) that the property was not then his property but a property which his wife had contracted to purchase; 
        
        
       (b) that, at the time, he - who seemingly was a licensed real estate agent as well as an accountant - was, on behalf of his wife, conducting a final inspection of the property prior to completion of the purchase; 
        
        
       (c) that neither the pistol nor the shotgun was his; and 
        
        
       (d) seemingly, that, at the time, he was not aware of the existence of the pistol or the shotgun, or of the location of either of them. 
        
       
     5    On 24 July 1997, the Respondent was committed for trial to the Campbelltown District Court. 
      
       
     6    According to the Crown's Written Submissions, between 29 August 1997 and 10 May 2000, the Respondent made various applications to Moore DCJ seeking orders that: 
      
       
        
       (a) the Director of Public Prosecutions be restrained from proceeding on indictment; 
        
        
       (b) the proceedings be stayed because of a lack of legal aid; 
        
        
       (c) the proceedings be removed to the High Court for interpretation of what were said to be constitutional matters; 
        
        
       (d) the indictment be quashed because of a denial of civil rights under the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
        
        
       (e) the indictment be quashed because the charges were said not to constitute a criminal offence; 
        
        
       (f) the indictment be quashed because of a breach of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution; 
        
        
       (g) the District Court lacks jurisdiction. 
        
        
       Further, according to the Crown's Written Submissions, Moore DCJ, during that time, granted the Respondent a number of adjournments to enable presentation of his applications and for legal aid to be obtained; dates for the hearing of the trial on the hearing of the various Notices of Motion were vacated; on some occasions Moore DCJ was not available and, on one occasion, following the hearing of a number of applications by the respondent, his Honour reserved his Judgment for a period of time. During that time, so it is said, all applications made by the Respondent were dismissed. Finally, according to the Crown's Written Submissions, the Respondent also made various applications in the Local Court, the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia, none of which has been successful. 
        
       
     7    On about 30 September 1999 - the relevance of which date will shortly appear - the Respondent caused to be filed in the Common Law Division of the Court, a Summons he which he sought against a number of defendants - including Det. Snr. Const. Rodney Grant - the following (inter alia) relief: 
      
       
        
         
         ""9. A declaration that the presence of the fifth defendant (Rodney Grant) being the informant in another matter currently before the Courts, involving the plaintiff, and with the fifth defendant having sighted and/or having had the opportunity to sight confidential case notes relating to the matter, does prejudice the plaintiff to the point where to maintain the indictment would be a miscarriage of justice."" 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     8    Thereafter, on or about 30 November 1999, the Respondent caused to be filed in the High Court of Australia a Notice of Motion and an Affidavit in Support seeking the removal into the High Court of what was said to be ""The constitutional issues contained in the above Summons"". In consequence, the proceedings commenced by the Respondent in the Common Law Division of the Court were placed in a holding list to await a hearing date from the High Court. The materials which are before the Court do not reveal the fate of that application or of like proceedings in the Common Law Division. 
      
       
     9    Although it would appear from a Judgment delivered by Moore DCJ on 1 August 2000 that no formal Notice of Motion or sworn Affidavit in support of it was ever filed in the District Court - facsimile copies of draft Notices of Motion and of unsworn Affidavits only having been forwarded to Moore DCJ's Associate - a Judgment delivered by Moore DCJ on 10 May 2000 records that what was then thought to have been a Notice of Motion filed in the District Court at Campbelltown by the Respondent was listed for the purpose of fixing a hearing date. That Notice of Motion sought a multiplicity of orders of which the following provide a sufficient example: 
      
       
        
         
         ""1. An order that the Director of Public Prosecutions has no right of appearance in this matter. 
         
        
        
         
         2. An order that the Director of Public Prosecutions has no standing on the ground that any attempt by the Director of Public Prosecutions to exercise the executive powers and functions of her Majesty is in breach of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 ('the Constitution'), s.2. 
         
        
        
         
         3. An order that the current Letters Patent to the Governor General issued by Elizabeth the Second by the Grace of God, Queen of Australia and her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth are invalid by reason of a breach of the Constitution section 2."" 
         
        
        
        
       In addition, that form of Notice of Motion sought the following (inter alia) order, the relevance of which will shortly appear: 
        
        
         
         ""7. An order that the indictment presented by the respondent against the applicant in respect of the offences the subject of the above numbered proceedings, be quashed on one or more of the following grounds: 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
          
           
           (i) the actions of the informant in this matter, Rodney John Grant, participating in an unlawful seizure of property from the applicant on 23 September 1999; prime facie having access to that property seized, such seized property including, but not limited to: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (1) All correspondence between the appellant and his legal advisers. 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (2) The originals of all statements by witnesses for the defence, including contact details. 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (3) Computer files recording all possible defences available to the appellant, in the event that the matter proceeds to trial. 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (4) The appellant's defence strategy if and when the matter proceeds to trial,  
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          has so contaminated the conduct of the prosecution case that no neutral observer could pereceive (sic): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (5) That the prosecutor is neutral; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (6) That the appellant's defence strategy to the charges having now been, or possibly been, made available to the prosecutor, that the appellant: 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
               (a) could now receive a fair trial according to law; 
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
               (b) has not been prejudiced to an extent that a miscarriage of justice is likely to occur if the matter proceeds to trial. 
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (7) that the appellant being unlawfully deprived of material essential to his defence, such material having taken over two years to compile, unable to be accurately reconstructed; the appellant has been unlawfully deprived, by the informant for the prosecutor, of the appellant's means to defend himself at any trial."" 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
       
     10    The facts upon which the Respondent sought to rely to support the application which was ultimately dealt with by Moore DCJ were set out in a form of Affidavit which the Respondent claimed to have sworn in May 2000. So far as is relevant that Affidavit was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""3. On 23 September 1999, Detective Constable Rodney Grant, in company with Federal Officer Stephen Graham McTackett and numerous other persons, executed a search of my then premises at 70 Spinnaker Way, Corlette and then business premises at 251 Soldiers Point Road, Salamander Bay. The searches were conducted under the stated authority of search warrants."" 
         
        
        
       then, after a reference to certain Property Seizure Records of which the Respondent had been given copies, it continued 
        
        
         
         ""5. I have caused a reconciliation to be made which itemises property seized and receipted, which property was not authorised by the warrant. It also soon became apparent that not all property taken has been properly receipted. 
         
        
        
        ………"" 
        
        
       A little later, after referring to what occurred when Det. Grant and the Federal agents first appeared, it continued: 
        
        
         
         ""11. Det. Grant and other persons then disappeared into various rooms out of my sight. I saw Det. Grant enter the study and open the cupboards where all the material relating to my defence in this matter was stored. On the evening of 22 September 1999, I had filed some material and noticed that all the property mentioned below was safely stored in one of the cupboards. After my release on bail on 23 September 1999, I was extremely concerned as to the whereabouts of the material vital to my defence in these subject proceedings. As a result of this concern, I searched the relevant cupboard, and then the rest of the house, but all material vital to my defence had disappeared during the above search and seizure. The material prepared for my defence included: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) Names, addresses, contact details and in at least one instance, a statement, of witnesses for the defence, including details of the evidence which they would be prepared to give at trial. This evidence was critical to my defence as it came from persons who exercised on a daily basis around the Port Stephens area, and their evidence placed myself and my blue heeler dog in Port Stephens at the times I was supposedly in Tahmoor. These were independent witnesses, not known to myself, but who came forward as a result of my canvassing the Port Stephens area for witnesses immediately after the event whilst the matter was fresh in their mind. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) Statements from the tenants of 71 Greenacre Drive, Tahmoor (the subject property) as at the date of the search and seizure. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) Original documentation relating to the lawful possession of $30,000.00 which disappeared during the search by Det. Grant at Tahmoor on 15 February 1997. 
           
          
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) Sensitive and privileged correspondence between the deponent and his legal advisers; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (e) Photographs of the person whom it would have been put for my defence was the person wrongly identified by various neighbours to the property; as the deponent. This was critical to the defence as one or more of the neighbours to the subject property identified the deponent as being in the vicinity of prohibited plants. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (f) Statement from the person referred to in (e). He is the only witness that I have been able to locate, and he is now in a nursing home with advanced alzeimers (sic) disease. He is no longer capable of giving a statement. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (g) Sound recording of threats made by police attending the premises 71 Greenacre Drive, Tahmoor on 15 February 1997, to wit: ""Shoot the bastard and plant a gun on him'. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (h) 141 page Affidavit of Helen Christine Langley sworn 3 February 1999. The DPP (sic) have offered to replace this document.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         12. On 23 September 1999, I noticed one of the persons involved in the unlawful search of my home 'downloading' data from my computer. I said: 'I will show you how to download the data so that it is not corrupted'. He said: 'No, you will probably delete all the data with one keystroke. I see from the computer books here that someone has a substantial knowledge of computers.' I said: 'That computer has an encryption program written into it. If you attempt to download without the code you may corrupt and destroy most or all of the data'. He said: 'I know what I am doing. Piss off!' On my return to my home later that day, I started up the computer and noted that many of the files were corrupted. The hard drive on the computer was making grating noises. It was found to be beyond repair, little of the data was recoverable and I was forced to replace a computer. 
         
        
        
         
          Information lost from the hard drive included: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) Draft of the statements referred to in 11(a) and (e). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) Contact details of all witnesses for my defence. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         13. I verily believe that the main purpose of the unlawful search and seizure of 23 September 1999 was to allow Det. Grant access to my home so as to allow him or persons associated with him to remove all material relevant to my defence to a point where I am left defenceless.""  
         
        
        
       
     11    In the Judgment which he delivered on 10 May 2000, Moore DCJ recorded that, on 8 May 2000, there had been two matters involving the Respondent listed before him, they being, first, an application by the Respondent to have Moore DCJ certify that a number of Judgments which he had delivered on 14 April 2000 were proper for determination by this Court on appeal; and, second, the Notice of Motion to which I have earlier referred which it was thought had been filed in the Registry. So far as the first matter was concerned, his Honour declined to give the Certificate sought. Having done so, his Honour then turned to the question of the Notice of Motion and recorded his view that, with the exception of the relief prayed in paragraph 7(i), the matters sought to be raised were without merit but that there appeared to be available to the Respondent an argument in relation to the relief sought in paragraph 7(i), albeit that that argument would not support quashing the indictment although it could be a ground for seeking a stay of proceedings ""possibly conditional on the material (if it was wrongly taken) being returned"". His Honour therefore indicated that he would at a later date entertain that application. 
      
       
     12    Before the Respondent's application came on for hearing before Moore DCJ, there had been filed on behalf of the Crown, the following: 
      
       
        
       (a) an Affidavit sworn by Federal Agent McTackett deposing to the fact that he did not partake in either the search or subsequent seizure of any documents or property which might come within the descriptions contained in paragraphs 7(i)(1) to 7(i)(4) of the Notice of Motion; that all documents and/or property seized by police or Australian Taxation Officer personnel during the search at either 7 Spinnaker Way, Corlette or 251 Soldiers Point Road, Salamander Bay were delivered to, and recorded by either Federal Agent Barnes or Federal Agent Jones; that, on occasion, those documents and property had been delivered into his custody from the secured premises of the Australian Taxation Office at Newcastle when required for investigative procedures and/or court proceedings; and that on no occasion had those documents or that property been shown, or provided, to members of the New South Wales Police Service or staff or Crown Prosecutors of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (New South Wales); 
        
        
       (b) an Affidavit sworn by Det. Snr. Const. Grant deposing to the fact that at no time did he take, seize or retain any documents or items which might come within the descriptions contained in paragraphs (i)(1) to (i)(3) in the Notice of Motion upon which the Respondent sought to rely; and that at no time had he seen any such documents or items or shown any such documents or items to staff or Crown Prosecutors of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (New South Wales); 
        
        
       (c) an Affidavit sworn by Ms. Kay, the solicitor in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions having the carriage of the prosecution file, deposing to the fact that at no time had she been provided with any item or document which may have been seized by Federal Agents on 23 September 1999; and that, as the result of inquiries which she had made, she believed that no member of the staff of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions nor any Crown Prosecutor had had access to any item or document or information contained therein which might have been seized by Federal Agents on 23 September 1999; 
        
        
       (d) an Affidavit sworn by one Rodney Brown an employee of the Australian Taxation Office in which he identified the documents and other items seized by him at 70 Spinnaker Way, Corlette, which documents he deposed were handed to Federal Agent Barnes; and further deposing to the fact that none of the items and documents seized on 23 September 1999 had been shown or provided to members of the New South Wales Police service or staff or Crown Prosecutors of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (New South Wales); 
        
        
       (e) an Affidavit sworn by Ms. Randell, also known as Ms. Rodgers, an employee of the Australian Taxation Office, identifying the documents and other items seized by her at 70 Spinnaker Way, Corlette, which documents and other items she deposed she had delivered to Federal Agent Barnes; none of which documents or items, so she deposed, fell within the descriptions contained in paragraph 7(i)(1) to 7(i)(4) of the Notice of Motion upon which the Respondent sought to rely; and deposing to the fact that she had provided none of the items or documents to members of the New South Wales Police Service or staff or Crown Prosecutors of the office of the Director of Public Prosecution (New South Wales); and, further, that on 24 September 1999 she attended at the Australian Federal Police Headquarters at Newcastle and took possession of the documents and other items which had been seized at 70 Spinnaker Way, Corlette, and 251 Soldiers Point Road, Salamander Bay, which documents and other items were then taken to the secured premises of the Australian Taxation Office, Newcastle where they were being used to investigate whether the Respondent and others may have committed any offences under the laws of the Commonwealth; 
        
        
       (f) an Affidavit by one Peter Ryan, an employee of the Australian Taxation Office, identifying a number of items of property which he had seized at 70 Spinnaker Way, Corlette, which items of property he deposed to having delivered to Federal Agent Barnes, and which items of property, so he deposed, he did not show to any member of the New South Wales Police Service; and further identifying a number of items of property seized by him at 251 Soldiers Point Road, Salamander Bay, which items of property so he deposed he delivered to Federal Agent Jones; 
        
        
       (g) an Affidavit sworn by one Roger Steel, an employee of the Australian Taxation Office, in which Affidavit he deposed to having copied the information held on a home computer at 70 Spinnaker Way, Corlette, which information, when copied, he delivered to Federal Agent Barnes; and which information, so he deposed, he did not show to any member of the New South Wales Police Service; and further deposing to having copied information held on a computer at 251 Soldiers Point Road, Salamander Bay, which information, when copied, he delivered to Federal Agent Jones; and which information, so he deposed, he did not show to any member of the New South Wales Police Service;  
        
       (h) an Affidavit by Federal Agent Barnes, in which she deposed to having been the Property Recording Officer at the time of the execution of the search warrants at 70 Spinnaker Way, Corlette, and identified the Property Seizure Record which she had completed and a copy of which she delivered to the Respondent's wife at the completion of the search; and further deposing to the fact that, on the completion of the search, all seized items were taken to the Australian Federal Police office at Newcastle where, on the following day, the property which had been seized was ""signed over to the custody"" of Ms. Randell;(i) an Affidavit sworn by Federal Agent Jones, in which Affidavit she deposed to having been the Property Recording Officer on the search at 251 Soldiers Point Road, Salamander Bay, identified the Property Seizure Record which she then completed and a copy of which, upon the completion of the search, she gave to the Respondent's son; and further deposing to the fact that, on completion of the search of the premises, all the items seized were conveyed to the Australian Federal Police office at Newcastle where, on the following day, that property was ""signed over to the custody"" of Ms. Randell. 
       
     13    The hearing of the Respondent's application commenced before Moore DCJ on 31 July 2000, on which day the Respondent was cross-examined before the matter was adjourned until the following day. On the following day after the Crown Prosecutor then appearing informed Moore DCJ first, that none of the material which had been seized in the search or which was alleged to have disappeared was in the possession of the New South Wales Police Service and, further, that she had been instructed that all material which had been seized was in the possession of the Australian Taxation Office or the Australian Federal Police in Newcastle where the Respondent might inspect all that material under the supervision of the Australian Federal Police and that if he were able to identify any material which he said formed part of his defence on the State charges that material would be copied and provided to him. The hearing was further adjourned in order to permit the Respondent to inspect that material.  
      
       
     14    According to a form of Affidavit which was prepared by the Respondent and which was verified by him when the hearing before Moore DCJ resumed on 10 August 2000, on 8 August 2000, in company with his wife and son, he attended the premises of the Australian Federal Police, Newcastle, for the purpose of examining material seized on 23 September 1999 and ascertaining if any of the material removed on that date, which material he said related to the defence of the State proceedings, was in the custody of the Australian Federal Police. In that form of Affidavit, the Respondent asserted that none of the material which was produced for his inspection contained the missing defence evidence. 
      
       
     15    By the time the hearing resumed before Moore DCJ, the Respondent had prepared a fresh form of Notice of Motion which sought the following orders: 
      
       
        
         
         ""1. The indictment against the applicant be permanently stayed on the grounds that the applicant had been unfairly and irrevocably prejudiced on the following grounds: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) The actions of the informant in this matter, Rodney John Grant, participating in an unlawful seizure of property from the applicant on 23 September 1999; prima facie having access to that property seized; such seized property including, but not limited to: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) All correspondence between the appellant and his legal advisers; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (ii) The originals of all statements by witnesses for the defence, including contact details; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (iii) Computer files recording all possible defences available to the appellant, in the event that the matter proceeds to trial; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (iv) The appellant's defence strategy if and when the matter proceeds to trial 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) The actions of the informant in this matter, Rodney John Grant; participating in an unlawful seizure of property from the applicant on 23 September 1999. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) having collaborated and/or colluded with Federal Agent Stephen Graham McTackett prior to and during the said search and seizure, and 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (ii) having trespassed on the applicant's property, in particular the applicant's study which held all the applicant's material relating to his proposed defence to these proceedings; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (iii) having unlawfully arrested the applicant. 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          has caused the applicant irrevocable prejudice to an extent that no directions from a trial Judge could make good and/or undo that prejudice. 
         
        
        
         
         3.(sic) Such further or other orders that this Honourable Court deems appropriate."" 
         
        
        
       
     16    When the hearing before Moore DCJ resumed on 10 August 2000, the Respondent was not further cross-examined. The Crown Prosecutor then appearing tendered the Affidavits which had earlier been sworn on behalf of the Crown, only Det. Snr. Const. Grant, Federal Agent McTackett and Ms. Randall being cross-examined - in the case of Ms. Randall only very briefly and then not in relation to the events of 23 September 1999. In the course of the Respondent's cross-examination of Det. Snr. Const. Grant, it emerged that a video tape record had been made of the premises at 70 Spinnaker Way, Corlette while the search of the premises was in progress, which video tape record, so Det. Snr. Const. Grant asserted, revealed that he made no search but stood in and did not move from the family room in the Respondent's house. Despite the existence of that record, and the Respondent's assertion that Det. Snr. Const. Grant had left the family room and gone into the study in the house, the video tape record was not tendered in evidence. The Respondent's cross-examination of both Det. Snr. Const. Grant and of Federal Agent McTackett makes it abundantly clear that he claimed that the purpose for which he was arrested on 23 September 1999 at 70 Spinnaker Way, Corlette was to remove him unlawfully from the premises so that Det. Snr. Const. Grant would be free to remove from the premises evidence said to be vital to the Respondent's defence to the matters for which he had been indicted. At the conclusion of the hearing on 10 August 2000, Moore DCJ reserved his Judgment. 
      
       
     17    It is clear from what I have recorded that critical issues of fact to be determined by Moore DCJ was whether the materials which he identified in paragraph 11 of his Affidavit of 18 May in fact existed, and were in the premises at 70 Spinnaker Way, Corlette at the time of the commencement of the search; whether, when the Respondent returned to those premises following his arrest and later release on bail, those materials ""had disappeared"" and if so, whether the ""disappearance"" of those materials occurred on that day and because of the actions of the Det. Snr. Const. Grant or persons acting in concert with him. A further critical issue which arose was whether, as the Respondent asserted, those materials, if they had ""disappeared"", were materials vital to his defence of the charges upon which he had been indicted and whether, in consequence, if the trial were to proceed, the result would be an unfair trial.  
      
       
     18    It seems clear enough that Moore DCJ concluded that the determination of the first group of critical issues depended upon his assessment of the relative credibility as witnesses of, on the one hand, the Respondent and, on the other, of Det. Snr. Const. Grant and Federal Agent McTackett. That this was so appears from the following passages in his Honour's Judgment: 
      
       
        
         
         ""16. The starting point in the applicant's application is his assertion that the materials were at his house immediately prior to the search. The only affirmative evidence of this comes from Mr. O'Meara, by affidavit. It was the deliberate choice of counsel for the respondent not to cross-examine Mr. O'Meara on his affidavits. The learned Crown Prosecutor for the Respondent elected 'to call some evidence in response to Mr. O'Meara's affidavits and have the matter determined on that basis.' Failure to cross-examine a witness can lead a Court more readily to accept the evidence of that witness although this is not a necessary result. I do not take the Prosecutor's general election not to cross-examine, as any concession of the truth of this part of Mr. O'Meara's assertion. The various interlocutory applications brought by Mr. O'Meara have led to acrimony with the different Crown Prosecutors who have appeared from time to time. I take the present Crown Prosecutor's election as being one, deliberate, technique to attempt the speedy resolution of the matter…… 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         20. There is evidence from people engaged in the search, that none of them became aware of any of the District Court materials, either at the search or at any time later, and that the Australian Tax Office still has all the material taken away in the search. That does bear on this issue. However, for that to be probative, it is necessary to examine the intermediate step, namely whether it is likely that there has been a coincident loss of that material due to the activities of Det. Grant or any person acting in concert with him. That is one of the ways in which all the issues are to some extent bound up with one another. 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         21. Det. Grant swore an affidavit and was cross-examined by Mr. O'Meara. Because of his calling, he was home in the witness box. His demeanour was not such as would cause me to disbelieve his evidence. However, he clearly was antagonistic to Mr. O'Meara. 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
          However, I formed an unfavourable impression about the way in which he changed his answers as to his purpose in being in Mr. O'Meara's residence. 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         22. The purpose for Detective Grant's presence at the search, asserted by him, which I believe was his purpose in being there, and which I quote in full, was - 'I was requested by the officer from the Tax Department. He actually sent a letter to my commander asking for me to attend because I had knowledge of Mr. O'Meara's background and they believed that New South Wales offences may be detected.' 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         27. ……… 
         
        
        
         
          There is a noticeable absence of detail from any source, as to the activities of Detective Grant or Detective Sergeant McTackett while the search was taking place. This may be a defect of drafting technique by the lawyer who drafted the documents. I assume a lawyer did so, on instructions. 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
          No attempt was made by the respondent to introduce the video tape into evidence or otherwise corroborate Detective Grant's evidence. Detective Sergeant McTackett was cross-examined by way of one 'omnibus' question and replied in kind. Thus, apart from general denial, on the affidavits, of any knowledge of anything relating to the Applicant's allegations, there is no specific evidence of the activities of Detective Grant or Detective Sergeant McTackett during the search, apart from the very limited detail which came out in cross-examination. Mr. O'Meara was arrested soon after the search started. I assume that from then, he had no opportunity to observe the search. At some unspecified time, Detective Grant left Mr. O'Meara's house by car, alone, and reached Newcastle Police Station before Detective Sergeant. McTackett and Mr. O'Meara, under arrest, in another car. 
         
        
        
         
         28. No doubt Mr. O'Meara's wife and son, who were somewhere at the house during the search, remained behind when the search party left. Mr. O'Meara did not present any evidence from them. There was no explanation for that. They had access to material, if any, not taken in the search, until Mr. O'Meara returned home that evening."" 
         
        
        
       His Honour then recorded his findings of fact as to the critical issue as follows: 
        
        
         
         ""29. I find on balance, and on balance only that - 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (i) the materials set out in paragraphs 6 and 9 were removed from the applicant's residence during the search, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (ii) they were taken by either Detective Grant or Detective Sergeant. McTackett, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (iii) if taken by Detective Sergeant McTackett, they were taken with knowledge, at the time or soon after, of Detective Grant, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (iv) they have not been returned to Mr. O'Meara, and  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (v) the evidence does not permit me to elaborate on (ii) or (iii) and I do not speculate about that. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Insofar as these findings are inferential, each is the only reasonable inference to draw."" 
           
          
         
        
        
       (The materials referred to in paragraph 6 of His Honour's Judgment were those set out in paragraph 11 of the Respondent's Affidavit of 18 May 2000, while the materials referred to in paragraph 9 of his Honour's Judgment were those set out in paragraph 7(a)(i)-(iv) of the original form of Notice of Motion.) 
        
       
     19    Moore DCJ concluded his Judgment in the following way: 
      
       
        
         
         ""39. The findings made in paragraph 29 do not necessarily mean that there should be an order for a stay. I cite an oft repeated passage from the Judgment of Gleeson CJ in  
         R. v. McCarthy and Ors 
         . (unreported CCA 12 August 1994).  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'Time and again it happens in criminal proceedings that for any one of a variety of reasons witnesses who may be regarded as important by one side or the other die, or become ill, or lose their memory, or lose documents. If the result of that were nobody could obtain a fair trial, and the proceedings had to be permanently stayed, it would go a long way to solving the problems of delay in the criminal list in this State. However the position is that it is well recognised that an occurrence of that kind does not of itself mean that a person cannot obtain a fair trial or that proceedings need to be stayed. In this connection I refer to what was said in  
           R. v. Adler 
            (unreported CCA 11 June 1992) and  
           R. v. Goldberg 
            (unreported CCA 23 February 1993).' 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          The materials removed from the applicant's residence are as set out in paragraph 6. Some of that material may be able to be replaced and in respect of some of it secondary evidence could be received. However, I feel that it would not be possible to relieve against the unfair consequences of the loss of that material, by way of directions for the jury. Such secondary evidences (sic) as can be obtained is (sic) of less effect than the primary evidence. This is particularly so in relation to the sound recording referred to in 6(g). There is a complete loss of evidence referred to in paragraphs 6(e) and (f). It is a fair comment by the applicant, that the evidence referred to in 6(a) is critical to his defence. It cannot be effectively replaced. There is no challenge to the applicant's evidence that such material as was duplicated on his computer hard drive, has been corrupted and is irretrievable, as a result of the activity of one of the searching officers. In the affidavit of Marianne Randall, Australian Taxation Office Officer of 20 June 2000, she says that in the material presently held at the ATO, there is one diskette which contains (in effect) material which the applicant has described 'all possible defences available to the applicant'. Even if this material has been saved, it does not remedy the other deficiencies. I observe that it is strange, to say the least, that where the material was seized on 23 September 1999 it had still not been examined on 8 August 2000. If it turns out that the material at the Australian Tax Office, if returned, will remedy the applicant's detriment, then that can be dealt with by way of an application to rescind the stay, in accordance with its terms. 
         
        
        
         
         40. I order a stay of proceedings, until there is returned to the applicant, such of the material referred to in paragraph 6 as is adequate to ensure that a fair trial can be conducted."" 
         
        
        
       
     20    As will be apparent from the contents of paragraph 39 of Moore DCJ's Judgment, his Honour appears to have accepted uncritically the Respondent's assertion that the materials referred to in paragraph 11 of his Affidavit of 18 May 2000 were critical to his defence of the charges in respect of which he was indicted and that in the circumstances he could not receive a fair trial, and did not appear to examine the validity of the former assertion.  
      
       
     21    His Honour's approach to that question appears to have coloured his approach to the appropriate form of order for a stay to be made, which stay, as is apparent, is intended to operate until such time - which time appears to be incapable of being determined by reference to objective criteria - as there has been returned to Mr. O'Meara such of the material - the form of, and the detail contained in it, which is for the most part unknown - contained in paragraph 11 of Mr. O'Meara's Affidavit of 18 May 2000 as is adequate to ensure that a fair trial can be conducted.  
      
       
     22    The ground of appeal taken in the Notice of Appeal which was filed on behalf of the Crown was: 
      
       
        
         
         ""That his Honour erred in exercising his discretion to grant a conditional stay of proceedings in respect of the charges of cultivate prohibited plant (not less than the commercial quantity) and possess unlicensed firearm (x2). 
         
        
        
       the orders sought being: 
        
        
       1. An order vacating the order made by Moore DCJ; and 
        
        
       2. Such further or other orders as this Court might think fit. 
        
       
     23    Before the appeal came on for hearing - indeed, before the Crown's Written Submissions had been filed and served - the Respondent filed what was described as a ""Submission"" which contained the following (inter alia): 
      
       
        
         
         ""1.1 The respondent submits that the applicant is not competent to bring the appeal. 
         
        
        
         
          The applicant (sic) submits that the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986, s.4(1), providing that 'the Governor may appoint a Director of Public Prosecutions',  
         
        
        
         
          is invalid under the Constitution s.109 
         
        
        
         
          by way of inconsistency with the 
         
        
        
         
          Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983, s.5(2) which provides that 'There shall be a Director of Public Prosecutions' (and an Associate Director of Public Prosecutions) 
         
        
        
         
         1.2 The inconsistency meets the cover-the-field test, which was formulated by Isaacs J, in  
         Cowburn's  
         case in 1926 and re-formulated by Dixon J, in  
         Ex parte McLean 
           
         in 1930. In fact the test appeared inchoately in  
         Amalgamated Society of Engineers v. Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd. 
          (1920) 28 CLR at p.154, referring to: 'repugnant Commonwealth legislation operating on the same field (then) the legislation must give way'. 
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
         1.4 It is also submitted that the Director of Public Prosecutions does not have right of appearance for the following reasons; 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the Business Names Act 1962 ('the Act'), s5 provides that it is an offence to carry on business in New South Wales without being registered under the Act. 
           
          
         
        
        
        ……… 
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) if the Court is to allow the Director to appear then it would condone an illegality. It is submitted that the Court is under an obligation not to condone an illegality.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'In part it is necessary to ensure that the Courts are not themselves demeaned by the uncontrolled use of the fruits of illegality in the judicial process.'"" 
           
          
         
        
        
       
     24    In the light of the matters sought to be raised by the Respondent in paragraph 1.1 of that ""Submission"", a Notice pursuant to the provisions of s.78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 was given and the Attorney-General for New South Wales - but not the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth - intervened in the appeal, filing submissions in respect of both matters sought to be raised by the Respondent in his ""Submission"". In the event, the Respondent did not, on the hearing of the appeal, seek to advance any oral submission in support of the matters raised in his ""Submission"". 
      
       
     25    Both in its Written Submissions and in the oral submissions advanced on the hearing of the appeal, the Crown accepted that, as the making or refusal of an order for a stay involved an exercise of a judicial discretion, the manner in which an appeal against the exercise of that discretion was to be determined is governed by the principles discussed in the well known passage in the joint Judgment of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v. The King  (1936) 55 CLR 499, 504-505 - in its Written Submissions the Crown drew the Court's attention to the Judgment in R. v. Alexandroaia  (1995) 81 A.Crim. R. 286, 290. 
      
       
     26    In the present case, so the Crown submitted, there was error by reason of: 
      
       
        
       (a) failure to give weight to relevant considerations whilst giving undue weight to other considerations and making findings not available on the evidence; 
        
        
       (b) the misapplication of the relevant principles relating to stay applications; and 
        
        
       (c) the making of an order in terms unjust to the Crown. 
        
        
       
     27    Although the matters upon which, in the course of its submissions, the Crown sought to rely as establishing the first of the alleged errors to which I have referred in the preceding paragraph were far more extensive, it seems to me that the matters to which I refer below are sufficient to establish that Moore DCJ, in his Judgment, did err in the respect alleged. Those matters, in my view, demonstrate that, as I have earlier (para. 20 (above)) suggested, his Honour appears to have accepted uncritically the Respondent's assertion that the materials referred to in paragraph 11 of his Affidavit of 18 May 2000 were critical to his defence of the charges in respect of which he was indicted and that, in the circumstances, he could not receive a fair trial, and did not appear to examine the validity of the former assertion. 
      
       
     28    It is appropriate here to recall that the offences with which the Respondent was charged are three, they being: 
      
       
        
       (a) that on 15 February 1997 at Tahmoor he did cultivate prohibited plants, being a number of plants not less than the commercial quantity; 
        
        
       (b) that on 15 February 1997 at Tahmoor he did possess a firearm namely a .22 calibre Jennings self loading pistol, without being licensed to do so by licence or permit; and 
        
        
       (c) that on 15 February 1997 at Tahmoor he did possess a firearm namely a 12 gauge Mossberg repeating shotgun, without being licensed to do so by licence or permit. 
        
       
     29    It is also appropriate to recall that, as I have earlier (para. 4. (above)) noted, the Respondent does not appear to dispute: 
      
       
        
       (a) that on 15 February 1997 he was at the property at Tahmoor; and 
        
        
       (b) that the pistol and shotgun were in fact found on the property on 15 February 1997; 
        
        
       nor - although the Respondent disputes that he owned either the pistol or the shotgun and asserts that he was not aware of the existence of either pistol or shotgun or of the location of either of them - that the pistol was found in the Respondent's car in the garage and that the shotgun was found under what was said to have been the Respondent's bed.  
        
       
     30    The first group of materials said by the Respondent to have been removed from the premises at 70 Spinnaker Way, Corlette was said to contain names, addresses, contact details and, in at least one instance, the statement of witnesses for the defence, the evidence of which witnesses was said to ""(place the Respondent and his) blue heeler dog in Port Stephens at the times (he) was supposedly in Tahmoor"". Given that, as I have just noted, the Respondent does not dispute that he was at the Tahmoor property on 15 February 1997, it is clear, so it seems to me, that the evidence of those alleged witnesses could not bear on the firearms charges with which the Respondent stands indicted, a fact to which Moore DCJ, as is apparent, made no reference in the course of his Judgment. At best, as it seems to me, that evidence might be said to bear upon the charge of cultivating prohibited plants and then only if part of the evidence upon which the Crown would seek to rely on the hearing of that charge was evidence that the Respondent had been seen at the premises at Tahmoor at times prior to 15 February 1997 and in places at or near the place or places where the plants were being grown. No attempt appears to have been made by the Respondent on the hearing before Moore DCJ to direct his Honour's attention to the evidence sought to be relied upon by the Crown to establish that charge and still less to indicate to his Honour how the evidence of those witnesses was said to be ""critical"" to the Respondent's defence to that charge. Finally, it is to be observed that, despite the fact that it is almost four years since the Respondent was committed for trial, he has at no time given notice of, nor sought leave to tender evidence in support of, any alibi based upon what is said to be the evidence of those witnesses (see Criminal Procedure Act 1986 s.48). 
      
       
     31    The second group of materials referred to in the Respondent's Affidavit are said to be statements from the tenants of the Tahmoor property as at the date of the search and seizure, the Respondent's Affidavit containing no indication as to the contents of those statements nor any suggestion that the identity, or whereabouts, in May 2000, of those tenants were not known to the Respondent. In the absence of some indication as to the contents of those statements it is difficult to see how the Respondent would be disadvantaged by the loss of the evidence of the tenants, as it is quite impossible to know whether, and, if so, to what extent, the tenants or any of them would be able to give evidence directed towards any of the three charges upon which the Respondent stands indicted. Further, in the absence of an indication that the identities, and the then current whereabouts, of those tenants was not known to the Respondent, it would be difficult, indeed, to accept that, by reason of what was alleged to have been the taking of those statements, the Respondent had been deprived of any relevant contact details. It seems clear enough that the Respondent was aware of the identity of the tenants of the Tahmoor property as at 15 February 1997 - indeed, if, as he has asserted, he was on the property on that day carrying out a pre-completion inspection of the property, one would have thought that the names of the tenants and the nature of their tenancy or tenancies would have been included in the contract for sale and they would have attorned tenant to the Respondent's wife on completion - as also does it seem clear that the Respondent was able to obtain the alleged statements from those tenants after 15 February 1997. 
      
       
     32    The third group of materials alleged to have been taken from the property at Spinnaker Way, Corlette was said to have been original documentation relating to the lawful possession of $30,000.00 which disappeared during the search at Tahmoor on 15 February 1997. The relevance of that documentation - unless it is said that the presence of such a sum of money at the subject property at the time bore, in some way, upon the charge of cultivating prohibited plants - to any of the three charges upon which the Respondent stands indicted does not appear to have been the subject of any evidence tendered, or any submission advanced, by the Respondent on the hearing before Moore DCJ, nor, as is apparent from what I have recorded above, was the question of the relevance of that material to any of those charges examined or determined by Moore DCJ. 
      
       
     33    The fourth group of materials alleged to have been taken from the property at Spinnaker Way, Corlette is described as ""sensitive and privileged correspondence between the (Respondent) and his legal advisers"", a description which, if I may say so, I find decidedly curious as what I have earlier (para. 6(above)) recorded would suggest that, at least between 29 August 1997 and the hearing before Moore DCJ, the Respondent did not have legal advisers but acted for himself. But even if it be the fact that at some time the Respondent did have legal advisers, in the absence of evidence to the contrary - and there appears not to have been any such evidence - one would be entitled to think that those advisers would have retained, and would be in a position to make available to the Respondent, the originals of any correspondence from the Respondent to them and copies of any correspondence from them to the Respondent. 
      
       
     34    The fifth and sixth groups of materials are said to be photographs of, and a statement by, the person who, so it would be put on any trial, was the person wrongly identified by various neighbours as having been the Respondent - I assume - although the validity of the assumption may be questionable - that part of the evidence to be relied upon by the Crown on the hearing of the charge of cultivating prohibited plants was evidence by neighbours placing the Respondent on the subject property at or near the place or places where the plants were being grown at various times prior to 15 February 1997. Two things might be noted about these materials, they being, first, that they would not appear to bear upon the firearm charges in respect of which the Respondent stands indicted; and, second, that it appears clear enough (T.10/8/00 pp. 57, 60) that the person referred as the subject of the photographs is the Respondent's father-in-law, a fact which, in my view, would make it improbable in the extreme that the Respondent would not have another photograph or other photographs of him, which photograph or photographs could be used for the purpose of cross-examining any neighbour who would be called on the hearing to give evidence of the type suggested. Despite the matters to which I have just referred, Moore DCJ in paragraph 39 of his Judgment (see para. 19 (above)) wrote (inter alia): 
      
       
        
         
         ""There is a complete loss of evidence referred to in paragraphs 6(e) and (f)"". 
         
        
       
     35    The seventh of the materials said to have been taken from the property at Spinnaker Way, Corlette is described as ""sound recording of threats made by police attending the premises 71 Greenacre Drive, Tahmoor on 15 February 1997, to wit: ""Shoot the bastard and plant a gun on him""'. While, if it were to be suggested that, on 15 February 1997 the Respondent had been shot during the course of the search and a weapon had been ""planted"" on him, the facts, first, that no such suggestion appears at any time to have been made, and, second, that, as I have noted above, the Respondent does not appear to deny that on the occasion of the search the two weapons were found, makes it difficult for me, in the absence of any explanation - for none was offered - by the Respondent to understand what is the relevance of the tape, even if it ever existed.  
      
       
     36    The various matters to which I have referred lead me, as I have earlier noted to conclude that, in uncritically accepting the Respondent's assertion that the materials referred to in paragraph 11 of his Affidavit of 18 May 2000 were critical to his defence of the charges in respect of which he was indicted and that in the circumstances he could not receive a fair trial and in failing to examine the validity of the former assertion Moore DCJ did err in the respects firstly relied upon by the Crown.  
      
       
     37    In seeking to demonstrate that Moore DCJ erred in the second of the respects which I have set out above, the Crown submitted: 
      
       
        
       (a) that his Honour failed to consider whether the Respondent had discharged the onus to which, in a case such as this was, he was subject to demonstrate actual prejudice due to the unavailability of evidence (reference was made to  
       Gill v. Director of Public Prosecutions 
         
        (1992) 64 A Crim. R 82, 94 
       ) which prejudice was incapable of being cured by an appropriate direction to the jury (reference was made to  
       Barron v. The Attorney-General 
         
        (1987) 10 NSWLR 215, 219, 233 
       ;  
       R. v. Basha 
         
        (1989) 39 A Crim.R 337, 338 
       ) so that, if he were required to stand trial, he would be deprived of his right to a fair trial; and 
        
        
       (b) that his Honour made no reference whatsoever to the community's right to expect that persons charged with criminal offences are brought to trial (reference was made to  
       Jago v. District Court (NSW)  
        (1989) 168 CLR 23, 33 per Mason CJ, 49-50 per Brennan J, 60-61 per Deane J and 71-72 per Toohey J 
       ), which right, as Mason CJ pointed out in his Judgment in  
       Jago v. District Court (NSW) 
         
        supra 
        is a matter to which regard must be had when an accused person makes an application for a stay of proceedings. 
        
       
     38    The power which, so it seems now to be accepted, all courts, be they Local Courts (Director of Public Prosecutions v. Shirvanian  (1998) 44 NSWLR 129) or District Courts (Jago v. District Court (NSW)  supra) or superior courts (Barton v. The Queen  (1980) 147 CLR 75) have to stay proceedings, whether those proceedings be civil or criminal nature is, so it seems now to be agreed, derived from the power impliedly granted to every court to prevent its processes being abused or being used to bring about injustice. The circumstances in which it might be said a court's processes are being abused or used to bring about injustice include the commencement or maintenance of proceedings for an improper purpose (Williams v. Spautz  (1992) 174 CLR 509), the commencement of proceedings which would, or the conduct of proceedings in a manner which would, lead to unjustifiable vexation or oppression (Barton v. The Queen  supra) or the commencement or maintenance of proceedings in circumstances where the defendant will be deprived of his right to a fair trial. The power to grant a stay to prevent, or to rectify the consequences of, an abuse of process permits the grant of both permanent and conditional, or limited, stays, the nature of the stay granted depending upon the circumstances which have given rise to the application. Thus, a permanent stay may be based upon the court's determination that the proceedings will inevitably fail (Ridgeway v. The Queen  (1994-1995) 184 CLR 19, 43) or that the proceedings involve irremediable prejudice to the accused person which interferes with the conduct of a fair trial (Jago v. District Court (NSW)  supra) which cannot be overcome by appropriate directions to the jury; or that the proceedings have been brought for an improper purpose (Williams v. Spautz  supra). A limited or conditional stay may be granted until such time as the prejudice to which the defendant would otherwise be subjected if the proceeding were to continue has been removed (Barton v. The Queen  supra). 
      
       
     39    What must be established in order to justify the grant of a stay will vary in accordance with the basis upon which the stay is sought. That this is so is made clear by the following passage of the joint Judgment of Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ in Williams v. Spautz  supra at 518-519: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The jurisdiction to grant a stay of a criminal prosecution has a dual purpose, namely, 'to prevent an abuse of process or the prosecution of a criminal proceeding … which will result in a trial which is unfair'. This does not mean that the prosecution of proceedings in such a way as to make them an instrument of oppression will result in unfair trial stands outside the concept of abuse of process. That term has been applied on various occasions to describe the situation just mentioned as well as the more traditional case where the prosecution is brought for an improper purpose. 
         
        
        
         
         However, in the light of the particular object sought to be achieved by an exercise of the jurisdiction in each class of case, it is important to distinguish between them. If a permanent stay is sought to prevent the accused from being subjected to an unfair trial, it is only natural that the court should refrain from granting a stay unless it is satisfied that an unfair trial will ensue unless the prosecution is stayed. In other words, the court must be satisfied that there are no other available means, such as directions to be given by the trial judge, of bringing about a fair trial.  
         Jago 
          was such a case. Consequently, the judgments in that case gave emphasis to the necessity that the court should satisfy itself upon this point before granting the relief sought. 
         
        
        
         
         If, however, a stay is sought to stop a prosecution which has been instituted and maintained for an improper purpose, it by no means follows that it is necessary, before granting a stay, for the court to satisfy itself in such a case that an unfair trial will ensue unless the prosecution is stopped. There are some policy considerations which support the view that the court should so satisfy itself. It is of fundamental importance that, unless the interests of justice demand it, courts should exercise, rather than refrain from exercising, their jurisdiction, especially their jurisdiction to try persons charged with criminal offences, and that persons charged with such offences should not obtain an immunity from prosecution. It is equally important that freedom of access to the courts should be preserved and that litigation of the principal proceeding, whether it be criminal or civil, should not become a vehicle for abuse of process issues on an application for a stay, unless once again the interests of justice demand it."" 
         
        
        
       
     40    The relevance of the community's interest in seeing that persons charged with criminal offences are brought to trial is made clear in the following passage in the Judgment of Mason CJ in Jago v. District Court (NSW)  supra at 33-34: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The test of fairness which must be implied involves a balancing process, for the interests of the accused cannot be considered in isolation without regard to the community's right to expect that persons charged with criminal offences are brought to trial: see  
         Barton 
         ;  
         Sang 
         ;  
         Carver v. Attorney-General (NSW) 
         . At the same time, it should not be overlooked that the community expects trials to be fair and to take place within a reasonable time after a person has been charged. The factors which need to be taken into account in deciding whether a permanent stay is needed in order to vindicate the accused's right to be protected against unfairness in the course of criminal proceedings cannot be precisely defined in a way which will cover every case. But they will generally include such matters as the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the accused's responsibility for asserting his rights and, of course, the prejudice suffered by the accused:  
         Barker v. Wingo 
         ;  
         Bell v. Director of Public Prosecutions 
         , as explained in  
         Watson 
         , and  
         Gorman v. Fitzpatrick 
         . In any event, a permanent stay should be ordered only in an extreme case and the making of such an order on the basis of delay alone will accordingly be rare:  
         Re Cooney 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial 'of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences':  
         Barton 
          per Wilson J. Where delay is the sole ground of complaint, an accused seeking a permanent stay must be 'able to show that the lapse of time is such that any trial is necessarily unfair so that any conviction would bring the administration of justice into disrepute':  
         Clarkson 
         ."" 
         
        
        
       
     41    Although paragraph 39 of Moore DCJ's Judgment, which I have set out (para. 19 (above)), would seem to indicate that his Honour appreciated the approach required to be taken to an application for a stay based upon an alleged loss of evidence, and although his Honour appears to have concluded that ""it would not be possible to relieve against the unfair consequences of the loss of that material by way of directions for the jury"", it seems to me that, in the absence of any real analysis of the nature of the materials which were said to have been taken and have not been returned and of the relevance of those materials to the matters upon which the Respondent stood indicted, and in the light of his Honour's uncritical acceptance of the Respondent's statements as to the nature and relevance of those materials, his conclusion that, if the proceedings were to continue in the absence of those materials, the Respondent would be subjected to irremediable prejudice cannot be supported. Further, it is clear that his Honour did not, in the course of his Judgment, carry out the balancing exercise referred to by Mason CJ in Jago v. District Court (NSW) which I have earlier (para. 40 (above)) set out. In those circumstances it seems to me, the Crown has made out the second of the errors charged by it against Moore DCJ.  
      
       
     42    In the light of the matters which I have set out above, I conclude that the discretion vested in Moore DCJ miscarried and that it is necessary for this Court to exercise the discretion. That being so, I do not find it necessary to deal with the third of the errors alleged by the Crown to have been made by Moore DCJ. 
      
       
     43    Even if one is to proceed upon the basis that the materials to which the Respondent referred in paragraph 11 of the Affidavit which the Respondent claimed was claimed in May 2000 were in fact taken from the premises at 70 Spinnaker Way, Corlette by Federal Agents or Australian Taxation Office personnel under the supervision of Federal Agent McTackett and that those materials - other than the Affidavit of Ms. Langley - have not been returned, nor copies of them supplied, to the Respondent, what I have earlier written will, I believe, make clear that it is my view that the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that unless the proceedings be stayed until such time as those materials, or copies of them are returned or provided to him, he will be deprived of his right to a fair trial. 
      
       
     44    For those reasons I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1.  
       ORDER 
        that the time for filing a Notice of Appeal be, and be deemed to have been, extended up to and including 15 February 2001. 
        
        
       2.  
       ORDER 
        that the appeal be upheld. 
        
        
       3.  
       ORDER 
        that the order for a stay made by Moore DCJ on 14 November 2000 be discharged. 
        
        
       
     45    WOOD CJ at CL: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Powell JA. I agree with his reasons and the orders he proposes. 
      
       
        
       
     46    SULLY J: I agree with Powell JA.

       REGINA V. George William PATEK 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1   HODGSON JA: On 27 November 2000 the respondent pleaded guilty to a charge under section 25A of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 that between 13 March 2000 and 7 April 2000 in the State of New South Wales he did on four occasions supply a prohibited drug for financial reward, namely, on 13 March 2000 at Regents Park did supply heroin, on 20 March 2000 at Regents Park did supply heroin, on 22 March 2000 at Regents Park did supply heroin, and on 3 April 2000 at Darlinghurst did supply heroin. 
     2   On 28 February 2001 Judge Sorby sentenced the respondent to a term of imprisonment of twenty-seven months to date from 4 October 2000 and expire on 3 February 2003, and he set a non-parole period of twenty months to commence on 4 November 2000 and expire on 3 July 2002. 
     3   The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed from that sentence pursuant to s 50 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on the ground that it is manifestly inadequate. 
     4   The charge resulted from a police undercover operation which utilised a police undercover operative known as Tony. The evidence disclosed four transactions in each of which Tony obtained a plastic bag containing powder from the respondent in exchange for $140 in cash. The first three occurred at an address in Regents Park, following phone contact between Tony and the respondent, and the fourth occurred at Green Park, Darlinghurst, also following telephone contact between Tony and the respondent. On each occasion the conversation between Tony and the respondent was recorded by a listening device. 
     5   An analysis certificate showed that the quantity of powder involved in the transactions was respectively 0.40 grams, 0.42 grams, 0.40 grams, and 0.32 grams, and that, in each case, the powder contained heroin. 
     6   In the last of the recorded conversations the respondent is recorded as having quoted $270 for ""one weight"" meaning one gram offering to give a definite price for ""three weights"" if Tony telephoned the next day and recommending to Tony that he ""make 50s out of a weight"" to keep customers happy. The respondent is also recorded as saying to Tony, that in order to get it cheap, he should spend over $1,000. In response to Tony's question, ""How much can you do?"" the respondent is recorded as saying, ""As much as you want"". The respondent is also recorded as saying, ""We used to score pounds"", mentioning a price of $55,000 a pound and talking about a price per ounce of $4,000 to $6,000 depending on quality. The respondent is also recorded as saying words to the effect that someone ""found our stash in me mate's garage and took four ounces of rough cut gear"".  
     7   The primary judge noted that the maximum penalty under s.25A was twenty years in prison. I would note that the section also provides, as an alternative or addition, for 3,500 penalty units. The primary judge noted that the maximum penalty was intended for cases within the worst category. He referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal decision in Regina v Smiroldo [2000] NSWCCA 120 for the proposition that s.25A was directed at those who appeared to be indulging in a practice or business of supplying prohibited drugs, that it was relevant to consider the quality of drugs actually supplied, and that although most offenders were presumably involved in the supply of more than the quantity actually supplied there were constraints on how far that could be taken into account on the basis of the High Court decision in R v Di Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. The primary judge accepted the Crown submission that the recorded remarks to which I have referred pointed to a systematic pattern of dealing and supplying drugs for profit, even though the respondent may also have supplied his own addiction.  
     8   The primary judge referred to the respondent's criminal record of offences going back to 1978 resulting in a total of nearly ten years in gaol. He referred to the respondent's life history, including a history of heroin addiction on and off since about 1980, he noted that he was on a methadone programme; and he noted evidence that suggested a definite trend towards improvement in his control over addiction. The primary judge noted the respondent's plea of guilty. He noted that it was not made at the earliest time, that it was made in the context of a very strong Crown case, and that the respondent had not shown much contrition. He indicated that a discount on the head sentence by reason of the plea would be fifteen percent. The primary judge noted that there were no special circumstances to vary the statutory ratio between non-parole period and head sentence, that being the ratio provided by s.44(2) of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999. 
     9   In reasons given on 22 February 2001, the primary judge indicated that the head sentence would be thirty months and the non-parole period twenty months. However, in a supplementary judgment given on 28 February 2001 the primary judge indicated that he made an error in setting the head sentence, which should have been twenty-seven months, resulting in the sentences which I indicated earlier. 
     10   Mr Grogan for the Crown submitted first that there was error in the proportion originally proposed between the head sentence and non-parole period, which should have been three-quarters in the absence of special circumstances, and that there was also error in the unexplained change to the head sentence. However, he accepted that the proportionality between twenty months and twenty-seven months, although not exactly three-quarters, was sufficiently close that the difference was de minimis. 
     11   Mr Grogan submitted that error was shown in the sentence, having regard to the case of Smiroldo to which the primary judge referred. That was a case very similar to the present in relevant respects, he submitted, albeit involving somewhat larger quantities of a different drug, namely, methylamphetamine which is sometimes regarded as being a less serious problem than heroin. In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal expressed the view that a sentence of four and a half years, with a non-parole period of two and a half years, was not excessive, and indeed expressed the view that the applicant in that case merited a significantly longer sentence. 
     12   Mr Grogan submitted that the primary judge failed to have regard to that expression of opinion and to the expression of opinion that there was a pattern of inadequate sentence in related cases. He submitted that the sentence imposed in this case indicated that the primary judge had failed to give proper weight to either particular deterrence or general deterrence. 
     13   Mr Grogan also referred to the remarks made in the case of Regina v Hoon and Pouoa 2000 NSWCCA (19/4/00) to the effect that the criminality involved in offences under s.25A was greater than the criminality of a number of individual supplies of small quantities of drugs, the section being directed to the repetition and system and organisation of regular supply. 
     14   For the respondent, Mr Game submitted that it was inappropriate to build a case of suggested error in comparison with a single sentence. He submitted that, in any event, there were significant differences between the facts in Smiroldo and the facts in this case. The quantities of drugs involved in that case were significantly larger. The transactions were also in the context of a business stated to be open seven days a week, as opposed to the circumstances in this case of four individual sales arranged specifically by the undercover police officer.  
     15   Mr Game submitted that the material in the recorded conversations could not be used to suggest that the operation conducted by the respondent concerned quantities greater than those involved in the individual transactions in this case. At most, they could be used to give context to the particular transactions and to support the conclusion that there was a systematic operation of supplying quantities of this nature. 
     16   Mr Game submitted that there were subjective aspects in this case distinguishing it from Smiroldo and justifying a lesser sentence. In particular, the circumstance that the respondent in this case was in quite desperate circumstances feeding a habit of his own, not in any sense conducting a profitable business, but, in effect, surviving on a disability pension. 
     17   Finally, Mr Game submitted that this was not a case which, on the principles expounded by the High Court in cases such as Griffiths v Regina (1977) 137 CLR 293, would justify the granting of a Crown appeal. There was no general error of principle disclosed and no gross departure from what might be regarded as the norm.  
     18   In my opinion the submissions advanced by the Crown do suggest that the sentence in this case was a light one in the circumstances, but I am not persuaded that any error of principle is disclosed and, in particular, I am not persuaded that there is such an error of principle or such a gross departure from the norm as would justify the allowing of a Crown appeal. 
     19   In my opinion also, the circumstances of the adjustment of the head sentence from thirty months to twenty-seven months is not indicative of such error as would justify the upholding of a Crown appeal. For those reasons, in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
     20   MATTHEWS AJA: I agree. 
     21   STUDDERT J: I also agree. 
     22   HODGSON JA: The order of the Court is, the appeal is dismissed.

      REGINA v GWM 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   HODGSON JA: I agree with Studdert J. 
      
       
        
       
     2   MATHEWS AJA: I agree with Studdert J. 
      
       
        
       
     3   STUDDERT J: The appellant, to whom I shall refer simply as GWM, stood trial in the District Court at Taree charged with four sexual offences. Two of the counts in the indictment charged the appellant with acts of unlawful sexual intercourse in contravention of s 66A and of S 66C(2)(a) of the Crimes Act respectively, and on those two counts the jury found the appellant guilty. The remaining two counts charged the appellant with indecent assaults in contravention of s 61M(1) and of s 61L of that Act respectively, and on those two counts the appellant was acquitted. 
      
       
        
       
     4   The appellant was sentenced on the first count to a period of three years imprisonment with a non parole period of eighteen months. On the third count the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of twelve months imprisonment to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in respect of the first count. 
      
       
        
       
     5   The appellant appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. 
      
       
        
       
     6   In relation to the appeal against conviction, there are two grounds of appeal which require consideration, but before considering these grounds, it is necessary to review the evidence given at the trial. 
      
       
        
       
     7   The complainant was born on 24 November 1982, so that at the time of the trial of the appellant she was eighteen years of age. At the time of the alleged commission of the offence charged in the first count the complainant was nine years of age; at the time of the events to which the second count was directed the complainant was ten years of age; at the time of the events to which the third count was directed the complainant was eleven years of age; and at the time of the events to which the fourth count related, the complainant was sixteen years of age. 
      
       
        
       
     8   The appellant was the step-grandfather of the complainant; the complainant’s mother married the complainant’s stepfather, and their wedding was an event relevant to the second count in the indictment. 
      
       
        
       
     9   The complainant’s evidence concerning each of the offences charged was uncorroborated. No complaint against the appellant was made by the complainant until December 1999. 
      
       
        
       
     10   The complainant’s evidence in respect of the offences charged may be summarised as follows: 
      
       
        
       
     11   Count 1 - the earlier of the sexual intercourse counts: The complainant said that one night she was playing with a dog on the back verandah of the appellant’s home dressed in her nightie and underwear. The appellant came outside and started to touch her, massaging her stomach. He moved his hand up to her chest. The complainant said that she was then touched on the outside of her clothing in the area of the vagina. The complainant said that the appellant then moved her underwear to the side and rubbed her vaginal area and he then committed an act of digital penetration.  
      
       
        
       
     12   Count 2 - the earlier indecent assault count: The complainant gave evidence of an incident that occurred on the date her mother married the appellant’s son. The wedding took place at home and the complainant said that the appellant on that day sat inside the kitchen on a chair and called the complainant to sit on his lap. She said that the appellant asked her to give him a kiss and she did so. The appellant said that he wanted a longer kiss than that and, according to the complainant, he put his tongue in her mouth and his hand on the outside of her under-clothing. The complainant said that her uncle walked into the room and the complainant hopped off the appellant’s lap and went back to the wedding party. In response to a question asked by the trial judge, the complainant further located the area where the appellant had placed his hand as being the vaginal area. In cross-examination, the complainant’s evidence was that this offence occurred after her mother and her stepfather had left the premises and gone to a motel for the night. 
      
       
        
       
     13   Count 3 - the later sexual intercourse count: The complainant gave evidence of events that she outlined as occurring when she was staying with the appellant and his late wife. The complainant said that she was required to sleep with the appellant in a double bed and that during the night he assaulted her by digital penetration and she said that having done this he removed his finger from her vagina and played with her clitoris. 
      
       
        
       
     14   Count 4 - the later indecent assault count: The complainant gave evidence that when she was sixteen she went with her stepsister and two young men to the appellant’s house. Her evidence was that the appellant told her she was putting on weight. The complainant said she was not. The appellant said “Show me”. The complainant lifted her jumper and the appellant grabbed her on the breasts, saying “They weren’t that big last time I saw them.” 
      
       
        
       
     15   I observed earlier that the evidence of the complainant was not corroborated in relation to any one of the four offences to which her evidence was directed. 
      
       
        
       
     16   The appellant, who had made no admissions to the police, gave evidence denying the offences charged in each of the four counts. 
      
       
        
       
     17   In relation to the second count, evidence was given by some of the wedding guests. A daughter of the appellant gave evidence that she attended with her husband, and after the married couple left she saw her husband talking to the appellant, and then the appellant and her mother leaving with their two grandchildren. The husband of this witness gave consistent evidence to the effect that he had remained with the appellant after the wedding speeches until the appellant and his wife left with the two children to walk home. A third guest, the niece of the wedding couple, said that straight after the wedding couple left to go on their honeymoon, she left with “Nan and Pop” (the appellant) to walk home. 
      
       
        
       
     18   In relation to the fourth count, the Crown called the complainant’s stepsister and one of the two young men who was with her. The stepsister’s evidence was that she saw the appellant put his hands on the complainant “below the breast”. At no time did the witness say the appellant placed his hands on the complainant’s breasts. The male friend said he was unable to see from where he was whether the appellant touched the complainant or not but he gave evidence that the complainant was wearing at the particular time a tight white shirt that left her mid-drift exposed. That evidence was in contrast with the evidence of the complainant that she was wearing a loose fitting jumper which she lifted. 
      
       
        
       
     19   Other evidence placed before the jury was directed to proving the appellant’s previous good character. 
      
       
        
       
     20   The jury was directed as to the need for it to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence of the complainant. The jury was also directed that it could accept part of what a witness said and reject some other things said by that witness. The jury was given directions as to the necessity to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with great care and directions about which there could be and has been no complaint concerning the significance of the lack of complaint and the delay in complaining. The jury was directed to consider each count separately and it is clear from their verdicts that they did precisely that. The jury was not told that if it held a reasonable doubt concerning the reliability of the complainant’s evidence on one or more counts, whatever the reason, that doubt should be taken into account in assessing the reliability of the complainant’s evidence on the remaining counts. In this case, that would have been a desirable direction, but in fairness to the learned trial judge he was not asked to give that direction. Indeed, counsel asked for no further directions at the end of the summing-up. 
      
       
        
       
     21   With the above features of the case in mind, I turn to consider the grounds of appeal. They were expressed as follows: 
      
       
        
         
        Ground 1: That the verdicts of guilty in relation to counts 1 and 3 on the indictment (although they are different charges to the ones of which the appellant was acquitted) are inconsistent with the verdicts of not guilty in relation to counts 2 and 4. 
         
         
        Ground 2: The verdicts of guilty are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
         
        
       
     22   At the hearing of the appeal, Mr Healey acknowledged that the principal ground of appeal was ground 2, and, indeed, the nub of the appeal is simply this: given the verdicts which were returned on the second and the fourth counts, was it open to the jury on the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on the first and the third counts? 
      
       
        
       
     23   In essence the submission made by Mr Healey on behalf of the appellant is that the Crown case depended upon the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the complainant’s evidence on each of the four counts. Clearly the jury was not so satisfied by the evidence on either of the two counts on which the appellant was acquitted. Once the jury had a reasonable doubt about the reliability of the complainant’s evidence on the second and the fourth counts, they ought to have had a reasonable doubt about her evidence on the first and the third counts: see M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439. 
      
       
        
       
     24   In an appeal of this nature due regard must be paid to the function of juries and to the advantage they generally enjoy in assessing the reliability of witnesses. I respectfully adopt what Barr J said recently in Mills [2001] NSWCCA 48 at paras 14-15: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “14 The courts have repeatedly expressed reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent, such is the respect that must be accorded to the functions which the law assigns to juries and to the advantage juries have in assessing the reliability of witnesses at first hand. If there is a proper way by which an appellate court may reconcile verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their function as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted.  
          McKenzie v The Queen 
           (1996) 190 CLR 348. If the party contending for it establishes an apparent inconsistency of verdicts, therefore, the duty of the Court is to enquire whether the verdicts may properly be reconciled. 
          
         
         
          
          15 Even if it is not possible to point to circumstances which justify the jury’s discrimination between counts, however, it may not be necessary to set aside a verdict of guilty on one count because it may appear that the jury has returned a merciful verdict of not guilty on another, though satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. The right of juries to return such verdicts is not doubted:  
          McKenzie v The Queen 
           per Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ at 367, approving the judgment of King CJ in  
          R v Kirkman 
           (1987) 44 SASR 591 at 593. See also  
          R v Crisologo 
           (1997) 99 A Crim R 178 per Simpson J at 184.” 
          
         
        
       
     25   The Crown submitted in relation to the indecent assault offences that the jury may have decided that there was scope for confusion or misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the appellant’s conduct; and further that any element of indecency established by the evidence may not have been intentional. The jury may have given the appellant the benefit of the doubt of such charges but may, notwithstanding this, have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the sexual intercourse offences where there was no room for confusion, misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the appellant’s conduct and no room for the appellant’s acts to have been unintended. 
      
       
        
       
     26   Considering the fourth count, the complainant was not supported by her stepsister’s evidence. The jury might have expected her to have seen the appellant put his hands on the complainant’s breasts, if this is what occurred. It does not seem to me to be a likely explanation of the verdict on the fourth count that the jury proceeded to evaluate the evidence in one of the ways the Crown suggests it may have done. However, even if it be accepted that it is reasonable to account for the verdict on the fourth count in this way, the same cannot be said, in my opinion, about the acquittal on the second count. 
      
       
        
       
     27   The complainant’s evidence on the second count was quite specific, namely that the appellant put his tongue in her mouth in the act of kissing and his hand under her dress in the area of her vagina. Such behaviour, if the jury accepted that this is what occurred, could hardly have left the jury in any doubt that it amounted to an indecent assault or that it might have been unintentional. 
      
       
        
       
     28   It is important in considering the significance of the verdict on the second count to heed what occurred at the trial in relation to it. In the course of the summing-up, the trial judge gave the following directions (SU 25-27): 
      
       
        
         
          
          “The second count was the evening where her stepfather married her mother, and they were in the backyard and Pop was sitting at the kitchen table, called her over, sat on her (as said) lap, asked her for the kiss, she gave the kiss. He said ‘I want a better kiss than that’ then he put his tongue in her mouth she said, then his hand down under her dress and started rubbing her on her underpants and over the vaginal area, and saying such things as ‘You’re not going anywhere till I get a proper kiss.’ She said Uncle Paul came into the room and she hopped off his lap. 
          
         
         
          
          Now that again has been denied by the accused that that happened. There was the evidence called that in fact the wedding did take place. That was what enabled the Crown to say that was the alleged date of the offence, but there was also evidence called by the accused to say ‘Well immediately after the speeches and whatnot I left’ and that was supported by his son-in-law and sister and in fact the defence case is ‘It just could not have happened because I wasn’t in the kitchen with her at the relevant time’ and also it has been put to you, and properly put to you, there has been no explanation why he was not called, by the complainant says that Uncle Paul came into the room. Well we certainly haven’t heard from Uncle Paul. There has been no explanation given to us as to why Uncle Paul has not been called and the law says this, that if there is evidence given that some person can throw some light upon the case, and if the party who you might expect to call that witness does not call that witness and there is no explanation as to why they did not call that witness, then you as a jury cannot speculate as to what that person might or might not have said, but you are able to properly draw this inference and that is, that that person would not have assisted the case of the person who you would have expected to call that witness. 
          
         
         
          
          Now it seems to me that you would have expected the Crown to call Uncle Paul if Uncle Paul could say that he came into the kitchen and saw them together, because the accused’s case is ‘We weren’t in the kitchen at the relevant time.’ Well we have not heard from Paul, we do not know why we have not heard from Paul. It is proper for you to draw the inference that Paul could not assist the Crown case.” 
          
         
        
       
     29   After it retired to consider its verdicts, the jury returned with a question, wanting to be informed as to the complainant’s evidence as to the approximate time when she said the incident had occurred. In response, his Honour instructed the jury (SU 35): 
      
       
        
         
          
          “I don’t recall any such evidence being given do you but I’ll just check my notes. I don’t think there was ever any evidence from her as to precisely what time of day or at what part of the proceedings of the wedding. Her evidence was as I read before and she went on to say on that day, and then she said that Pop was sitting inside the kitchen table, called me in to sit on his lap et cetera. Is that your recollection of the evidence? 
          
         
         
          
          COLES: I think that’s so your Honour. 
          
         
         
          
          HIS HONOUR: Mr Healey? 
          
         
         
          
          HEALEY: Yeah that’s right your Honour. 
          
         
         
          
          HIS HONOUR: Okay well I’m sorry we can’t help you any more on that. Please don’t forget what I told you though that it’s for the Crown to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt. If you’ve got any doubt about any of the material you can’t do anything adverse to the accused unless you’re satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. Okay, thank you.” 
          
         
        
       
     30   There then followed further discussion between the trial judge and counsel who were labouring under the disadvantage that there was no transcript of evidence available to them. The jury was then brought back into court and after part of the tape of the evidence in point was played back to the jury, his Honour further directed the jury (SU 37): 
      
       
        
         
          
          “So the evidence from the people who came from Western Australia whatever their names was, they’d said they’d made the speeches and Nanna and Pop went immediately after that, and this is when [the complainant] is alleging that her mother had already gone. So does that answer the query?..."" 
          
         
        
       
     31   Seemingly the jury was satisfied with this further assistance, asking no further questions before returning with its verdicts on each of the counts in the indictment. 
      
       
        
       
     32   In my opinion the most likely explanation of the jury’s verdict on the second count is that the evidence of the wedding guests which placed the appellant elsewhere at the time the complainant said he assaulted her led the jury to conclude that the evidence of the complainant about this assault did not satisfy it beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. This is significant because it means that when the jury was considering the second count and the complainant’s evidence was set against the other evidence I have reviewed, the jury decided it ought not to convict on her evidence. 
      
       
        
       
     33   In Jones (supra), the jury acquitted on one of three counts charging the appellant with acts of sexual intercourse. The High Court determined that the convictions on the other two counts could not stand and in their joint judgment Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said at 455: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “In our opinion, the proper application of the test formulated by the majority of this Court in M required the convictions of the appellant to be set aside on the basis that they were unsafe and unsatisfactory. Given the jury's finding on the second count, it was not open to them, on the whole of the evidence, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on the first and third counts. Once the jury found that the evidence of the complainant with respect to the second count lacked sufficient cogency to convict, the Crown case on the first and third counts wore a different complexion. For it meant that, when her evidence could be set against other reliable evidence, it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard of proof.  
          
         
         
          
          As we have already said, nothing in the complainant's evidence gave any ground for thinking that the quality of her evidence was higher in respect of the first and third count than it was in respect of the second count. When the credibility factor is combined with the uncorroborated nature of the complaints and the effect of the lengthy and unexplained delay in the making of the complaints, the convictions on the first and third counts can only be regarded as unsafe and unsatisfactory.” 
          
         
        
       
     34   Similar reasoning in the present case leads me to the conclusion that the convictions on the first and third counts cannot stand with the acquittal on the second count. I see no valid reason why the jury could have regarded the complainant’s evidence on the first and the third counts as being any more reliable than that on the second count in all the circumstances of this case. 
      
       
        
       
     35   Accordingly, I conclude that this appeal should be allowed and that the convictions and sentences on the first and third counts should be quashed. I would direct the entry of a judgment and verdict of acquittal on each of those counts.

       Wayne Desmond PATTERSON v. REGINA (Cwlth) 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1   HODGSON JA: On 1 May 2000 the appellant appeared in the District Court of New South Wales before Christie DCJ and a jury for trial on a charge that between about 1 November 1995 and 13 January 1996 in Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere he was knowingly concerned with the importation into Australia of prohibited imports to which section 223B(1) of the Customs Act 1901-1905 applied, namely narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of cannabis resin being not less than a trafficable quantity applicable to cannabis resin. He pleaded not guilty.  
     2   The trial lasted 12 days and on 17 May 2000 the jury returned a verdict of guilty. On 25 August 2000 Christie DCJ sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for six and one half years and specified a non parole period of four and one half years. The appellant appeals to this Court against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     3   At the trial the fact of importation and the appellant's involvement in it were not disputed and were clearly proved. The only issue was whether or not the appellant's involvement in the importation was proved beyond reasonable doubt to have been knowing in the sense of the appellant knowing that cannabis was being imported. 
     4   There was no direct evidence of the appellant's knowledge that cannabis was being imported. The Crown case was that this could be inferred beyond reasonable doubt from the circumstances. The appellant gave evidence on oath to the effect that he had no knowledge of the circumstance that cannabis was involved. 
     5   In order to understand the issues on the appeal against conviction, it is convenient first to set out briefly the circumstances which were clearly proved and were not the subject of any contest.  
     6   On 11 January 1996 a cardboard carton was examined by Customs officers at the premises of Federal Express Australia at Mascot Airport. On the cartons was an airway bill which described the contents as ""neon transformer"", identified the sender's account as being ""care of Mr Robert Thompson"" and showed the sender as a company in Bangkok, Thailand, named Estel Company Limited. The recipient was named as Mr S Moore, Nu Tech Communications, 88 Parramatta Road, Lidcombe, with telephone number 7480888. 
     7   Customs officers opened the cartons, disclosing three small boxes. Inside each of the boxes was a metal box, which turned out to be a transformer casing with the internal workings removed to be replaced by cannabis resin, the quantity being just over seven kilograms in all. Taped on to one of the metal boxes, or possibly one of the smaller cartons, was a hand written letter on the letterhead of Dynasty Inn in Bangkok addressed to ""Steve"" and signed by ""George"", referring to meetings, including a meeting at the Estel factory and stating, among other things, ""I have only been able to send you three units with another seven to follow within the next four weeks."" 
     8   Australian Federal Police removed the bulk of the cannabis, and a controlled delivery sample of a little over 300 grams was replaced, together with other innocuous material, and repacked in the carton. Equipment capable of transmitting sound was installed in the carton. 
     9   On 12 January an officer of the Australian Federal Police, posing as a Federal Express employee, telephoned the phone number on the airway bill, spoke to a woman at Nu Tech Communications and was given a mobile telephone number at which, after a number of tries, he spoke to a man who provided the correct airway bill number and identified himself as Stephen Moore. 
     10   Thereafter this man and a woman named Rebecca Jack attended Federal Express premises and collected the carton. Mr Moore and Miss Jack took the carton to a green Statesman vehicle and they were followed by Police to Kings Cross where they parked the car, apparently met one Daniel Hutton in the Bourbon and Beefsteak Bar, and then drove with him around Kings Cross, ending up in the vicinity of a Kings Cross parking station. 
     11   It appears on the way the outer cardboard carton was discarded in a garbage bin. Mr Hutton left the vehicle carrying two of the smaller boxes and went into the parking station. The Statesman car drove off and shortly afterwards Mr Hutton came out of the parking station without the boxes, and returned to the Bourbon and Beefsteak Bar where he met the appellant. A little later Mr Hutton and the appellant went to the parking station and drove off in a blue Mitsubishi hire car. 
     12   There was evidence, with which the appellant agreed, that they did not go to the boot of the car before driving it off from its parking space. After a short time the car was stopped in traffic and Mr Hutton and the appellant were approached by police and arrested. Two boxes containing the transformer casings and the substituted material were found in the boot.  
     13   When the vehicle was searched, other items were also found. Firstly, two Papua New Guinea licences with the appellant's photograph, one with his own name and one with the name Frank Barnett. Secondly, a page on Dynasty Inn letterhead with writing of the appellant and some brown wrapping paper labelled ""sample"". Thirdly, an invoice from Estel Company Limited in Bangkok dated 16 December 1995 for four transformers at $US96.9 each, making a total of $US387.6. with the appellant's hand writing on that invoice with the words ""attention Robert Thompson"", that name being misspelt, ""Regards Frank"". Fourthly, there was a document apparently faxed on 10 January 1996 from ""Kalbo"", identified in the evidence as one Mark Ross from Thailand, addressed to Frank Barnett, referring to, among other things, some engines and stating matters such as, ""I can put the man to work on the boxes right away"", and other material which I need not relate. 
     14   Fifthly, there were a number of orders for the international transfer of money. Sixthly, there was a note in the appellant's hand writing, addressed to Mark Ross, apparently written on 25 December 1995. Seventhly, there was a document with a telephone number and, among other things, words ""money for last lot. Money for next lot"". Finally, there was a piece of paper with the relevant airway bill number on it. 
     15   A search of Mr Moore's home located the third carton and a Papua New Guinea driver's licence with Mr Moore's photograph, but in the name of Stuart Morris. There was uncontested forensic evidence that a fingerprint of the appellant was on one of the cartons found in the boot of the Mitsubishi car. There was also forensic evidence that the sample tape on the Dynasty Inn letterhead was indistinguishable from tape on the imported carton, but also that this was quite a common tape. 
     16   In addition to that material, there was substantial material concerning telephone conversations between the appellant's mobile phone and Mr Moore's mobile and home phones and other relevant phone numbers, and also the evidence of transfers of money shown on the money transfer documents to which I have referred. There was also evidence concerning the hiring of the Mitsubishi vehicle, and the history leading up to the appellant's arrival in Sydney on the morning of 12 January 1996. 
     17   I will briefly summarise in chronological order the effect of this evidence.  
     18   The first relevant transfer of money was a transfer of just under $5,000 on 3 November 1995 to a person named Nittaya Ross, identified as Mark Ross's wife, in Bangkok, the transferor being Stephen Moore, using the name Stuart Morris. 
     19   On 4 November 1995, there were two business class air tickets to the Philippines and return, departing on 5 November, returning on 7 November for the appellant, which Moore purchased at a cost of $3,360. On each of 10 and 11 November 1995 there was a transfer of $5,000, again apparently to Nattaya Ross in Bangkok, this time by the appellant in the name of Frank Barnett. 
     20   Between 26 September and 23 November 1995 there were frequent telephone calls recorded between Mr Moore's mobile phone and Mr Patterson's mobile phone. On 24 November 1995 Mr Moore departed Sydney for Thailand. On 30 November 1995 the appellant departed Sydney for Thailand. On 3 December Mr Moore arrived back in Sydney. 
     21   Between 4 December 1995 and 4 January 1996 there were several telephone calls from Mr Moore's home and also from Mr Hutton's home to the Dynasty Inn hotel in Bangkok. On 6 January 1996 the appellant arrived in Brisbane from Bangkok. On 7 January 1996 the appellant went to Brisbane Airport with one Maureen Brown, where she hired the Mitsubishi car from Thrifty, with the appellant identified as a driver under the name Frank Barnett. 
     22   On 8 January 1996 a further $1,000 was transferred to Bangkok by the appellant to one Mark Dowsley. Between 6 January 1996 and 11 January 1996 there were numerous calls from the appellant's mobile phone and the Mitsubishi car's mobile phone to Mr Moore's mobile phone, Dynasty Inn, Mr Hutton's home and also Ms Jack's home. 
     23   On the night of 11 January 1996 the appellant drove overnight from Brisbane to Sydney, arriving at about 5.30am. A number of telephone calls are recorded, one at 9.17am from the Mitsubishi's car phone to Mr Moore's mobile phone; another at 11.24 am from Mr Moore's home to the appellant's mobile home; another at 14:25 from the appellant's mobile phone to Mr Moore's mobile phone; another at 18:36 from Mr Moore's home to the appellant's mobile phone; another at 5.39am on 12 January 1996 from the appellant's mobile phone to Mr Moore's mobile phone; and another at 9.38 on 12 January 1996 from the appellant's mobile phone to Mr Moore's mobile phone. 
     24   The appellant's case was that he denied any knowledge of cannabis, and that his understanding was that what he was involved in was a legitimate transaction for the importation of transformers. His sworn evidence was that he had been living in the Philippines since about 1988 or '89, following the breakdown of his marriage and his leaving Australia. In late 1995, he said, he was introduced to Stephen Moore by his friend Mark Dowsley, and he agreed with them to take part in a transaction involving the importation of transformers into Australia, in which the appellant was to invest $20,000. 
     25   The three transfers totalling $15,000 in late 1995, the appellant said, were on account of this investment of $20,000 which he was to make. In relation to the documents and other material found in the Mitsubishi vehicle, the appellant's evidence was that he used the name Frank Barnett and the licence in that name so that his wife could not find him. The tape with the Dynasty Inn letterhead document was for wrapping poles for night club, this being to rebut a suggestion by the Crown that it was a sample taken by the appellant to compare with tape on the outside of the carton, to make sure it had not been opened by anyone on the way. 
     26   The appellant's evidence was that the Estel invoice had been given to him by Mr Moore in Bangkok and that Mr Moore asked him to fax it to Robert Thompson, so that that was why the appellant had written on it. The appellant's evidence was that the facsimile message from Kalbo concerned a deal in relation to motor cycle components. 
     27   The appellant said that he obtained the airway bill number in a telephone call around 8 or 9 January. His evidence was that he went to Thailand in mid December 1995 to arrange sand blasting for dancing poles in night clubs. He gave evidence that around this time he saw transformer cases at a meeting with Mr Dowsley at the Dynasty Inn, and on that occasion he picked up a box with a transformer case in it.  
     28   He said he came to Australia on 6 January 1996 to see his family. He hired the car on 7 January 1996 because he was finding it too cold riding round on his motor cycle. He said he sent the money to Mr Dowsley on 8 January 1996 so that Mr Dowsley could come to Australia for the purpose of promoting the sale of transformers in Brisbane. He said he came to Sydney overnight between 11 and 12 January, partly to look at a motor cycle, and partly to collect two transformers and take them back to Brisbane where Mr Dowsley was to take them and promote the sale. 
     29   He gave evidence that he was told on 12 January by Mr Moore that the transformers had arrived, and that he told Mr Moore that he was at the Bourbon and Beefsteak Bar with Mr Hutton. When Mr Moore came there, Mr Hutton offered to put the boxes in the appellant's car because the appellant had cellulitis in his leg. The appellant said that when he got to his car he realised he needed a Ventolin spray and reached back from the front seat through a hatch in the rear seat to get it from a coat in the boot, pushing aside a box in the boot which was in the way. 
     30   Now, in this account of the overall circumstances of the case and the appellant's evidence, I have left out some matters specifically relating to grounds of appeal, which I will deal with when I come to deal with the particular grounds. 
     31   The grounds of appeal fall into four areas. 
     32   The first area concerns evidence given by a Federal agent, Mr Carnell, and a deposition taken at committal proceedings from a Federal agent Yarrow concerning what occurred at the time of the appellant's arrest. 
     33   The second general area concerns directions, or lack of directions, by the trial judge concerning lies. The third area concerns a refusal of applications by the applicant concerning the cross examination and recalling of witnesses. The fourth area concerns criticism by the trial judge of the defence counsel; and the fifth area concerns the application for leave to appeal on sentence. I will deal with these areas in turn. 
     34   In relation to the first area, the Federal agent Carnell gave evidence that when he approached the appellant's vehicle to arrest the appellant, he called out, ""Federal Police. Put your hands out of your window now"" and pointed his revolver in the direction of the appellant. According to Mr Carnell the appellant immediately reversed his vehicle into an unknown vehicle which had stopped in the lane behind him, collided with a loud bang. 
     35   In cross-examination, Mr Carnell said he has not seen any damage caused to either vehicle. No other officer either saw the reversing or heard a collision or saw any damage. Some testified that they did not see any damage. Mr Carnell also gave evidence that at the time of the arrest the appellant said, ""My name is George. What is the problem, officer?""; and that immediately after the arrest, in answer to the question, ""Do you have any weapons in the vehicle?"" the appellant said, ""No, I didn't put any drugs in the vehicle."" 
     36   As regards Federal agent Yarrow, the Crown Prosecutor announced in court on the second day of the hearing that he had been advised at the end of the previous day that Mr Yarrow was absent from Australia. In fact, that he was stationed in Cyprus with the United Nations Peace Keeping Force. An application was made to have his deposition admitted pursuant to section 112 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         112(1) A deposition may be admitted as evidence for the prosecution at the trial of an accused person on proof on oath of each of the following matters:  
          
         (a) that the deponent:  
          
          (i) is dead, or so ill as not to be able to travel or to give evidence without a risk of endangering the deponent's life, or  
           
          (ii) is absent from Australia,  
          
         (b) that the deposition was recorded:  
          
          (i) by or in the presence of the justice before whom it was taken, and  
           
          (ii) in the presence of the accused person or during any period when the accused person (having been excused under section 41 (1B) of the Justices Act 1902) was absent,  
          
         (c) that the accused person, or his or her counsel, had full opportunity to cross-examine the witness, or that the accused person (having been excused under section 41 (1B) of the Justices Act 1902) was absent when the deposition was taken and was not represented by counsel.  
          
          
         (2) The deposition:  
          
         (a) must be in writing, signed by the justice by or before whom the deposition was taken, or  
          
         (b) must be in the form of a written transcript of matter recorded by means, other than writing, authorised by law for the recording of depositions.  
          
          
         (3) If the deposition is in the form of a written transcript referred to in subsection (2) (b), it must be proved on oath:  
          
         (a) that the record so made is a true record of the matter so deposed, and  
          
         (b) that the transcript of the record is a correct transcript of that record.  
          
          
         (4) If it appears from the deposition:  
          
         (a) that it was made in the presence of the accused person, and  
          
         (b) that the accused person, or his or her counsel, had full opportunity to cross-examine the witness,  
          
         the deposition is taken to have been so made and the accused person, or his or her counsel, is taken to have had such an opportunity, unless proved to the contrary.  
          
          
         (5) If it appears from the deposition:  
          
         (a) that it was made while the accused person (having been excused under section 41 (1B) of the Justices Act 1902) was absent, and  
          
         (b) that the accused person was not represented by counsel at that time,  
          
         the deposition is taken to have been so made and the accused person is taken to have not been represented by counsel, unless proved to the contrary.  
          
          
         (6) In this section, ""justice"" includes a coroner holding office under the Coroners Act 1980.  
         
        
       
     37   The trial judge acceded to that application, and the depositions were admitted as the last item of evidence in the prosecution case. Mr Yarrow had made two statements, one on 16 January 1996 and the other on 4 September 1996. The second statement, but not the first, corroborated Mr Carnell in relation to the two conversations. However, the statements and the deposition did not support Mr Carnell on the alleged reversing of the appellant's vehicle and the impact with another car. 
     38   Also, according to Mr Yarrow's deposition, he made no notes of the conversations, but he claimed to have a copy of notes made by Mr Carnell shortly after the event, and signed by him. Under cross-examination at the committal proceedings, Mr Yarrow said he had the notes with him, but it appears the matter was not taken further at that stage. At the trial Mr Carnell denied that he had made any notes and when the appellant's counsel, at the trial, called for the production of notes by Mr Carnell, they were not produced. 
     39   In relation to these matters four particular submissions have been made: firstly, there was error in admitting Mr Yarrow's deposition; secondly, there was failure to direct the jury adequately or properly as to how they might use this material; thirdly, there was error in inviting the jury to consider Mr Yarrow's motivation; and fourthly, there was failure to direct the jury in relation to flight. 
     40   In relation to the admission of the deposition, Mr Ramage QC submitted that section 65 of the Evidence Act, coupled with the definition of ""unavailable"" meant that there had to be reasonable efforts made to secure the attendance of the absent witness before hearsay material could be admitted. At the very least, even if satisfaction of the lesser criterion in section 112 of the Criminal Procedure Act was sufficient, there should have been proper regard paid to the circumstance that the Crown had not made any effort to secure the attendance of Mr Yarrow. 
     41   Mr Ramage advanced further reasons why the admission of this material was an error in the exercise of discretion. He submitted that the first conversation given in evidence by Mr Carnell and corroborated by the Yarrow deposition could only be material in attempting to link the appellant with the apparent writer of the letter found with the cartons, that is the person named George. There was handwriting evidence led by the appellant that this document was not in his writing, and at the very end of the case the Crown disavowed any contention that the appellant had written that letter. In those circumstances the material concerning the name George could only be prejudicial.  
     42   He submitted that the circumstance that Mr Yarrow's material was the last piece of Crown evidence gave it undue prominence; and he submitted that the prejudicial effect of this material outweighed any probative value, particularly the reference to ""drugs"" in the second conversation. In relation to this matter it appears to be common ground, although there was no evidence about this, that a small quantity of other drugs was found in the vehicle. No evidence of this was led at the trial, apparently because it was regarded as being purely prejudicial. However, Mr Ramage submitted that this circumstance made the reference to drugs in the second conversation particularly prejudicial.  
     43   Mr Ramage submitted that insufficient weight was given to the ability of the jury to see Mr Yarrow and to hear him cross examined. He submitted that this was particularly so in relation to the conflict between Mr Carnell and Mr Yarrow in relation to Mr Carnell's notes, and in circumstances where the evidence from Mr Yarrow corroborating Mr Carnell first appeared in a statement made eight months after the event. 
     44   Turning to the second particular submission, Mr Ramage submitted that the trial judge did not warn the jury that in dealing with Mr Yarrow's statement they should bear in mind that they had not seen Mr Yarrow or seen his evidence tested in cross examination, and he referred to cases such as Mendham & Foster (1993) 71 ACrimR 382. Furthermore, in so far as the second conversation was said to demonstrate a consciousness of guilt, directions akin to those discussed in Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193, were required. 
     45   On the third matter, in relation to Mr Yarrow's motivation, Mr Ramage submitted that the trial judge had, in effect, put it to the jury that if Mr Yarrow fabricated evidence to corroborate Mr Carnell, they might think he would have corroborated Mr Carnell more fully; and he submitted that was an erroneous invitation to the jury to speculate and was not a balanced direction to the jury. 
     46   Finally on this matter, Mr Ramage submitted that the trial judge referred to Mr Carnell's evidence concerning the reversing of the vehicle as having been led by the Crown as being demonstrative of at least a momentary attempt to escape. Mr Ramage submitted that this being an intention directed towards an action disclosing consciousness of guilt, a direction of the type discussed in Edwards was required.  
     47   I will deal with those contentions before moving on to the next area of appeal. 
     48   In my opinion, it was not mandatory for the more stringent requirements of section 65 of the Evidence Act to be satisfied. Section 112 of the Criminal Procedure Act was inserted in 1999 after the passage of the Evidence Act, and in my opinion it should be considered as operating in accordance with its terms and authorising the admission of depositions in cases where the requirements of section 112 are satisfied. There was, in this case, no dispute to suggest that the requirements of section 112 had not been satisfied. 
     49   On the matter of exercise of discretion, in my opinion the appellant has not demonstrated any error of principle, nor has it been shown that the result was clearly wrong. The trial judge did take account of the circumstance that the prosecution had not taken practical steps to return Mr Yarrow from Cyprus. This was a case where Mr Yarrow had been cross-examined at the committal, and the point that the corroborating material in his evidence arose only in a statement made eight months after the event was demonstrated by that cross examination and was the subject of appropriate directions by the trial judge. 
     50   The conflict between Mr Carnell's evidence and Mr Yarrow's evidence in relation to Mr Carnell's notes was damaging to the Crown case, and was the subject of appropriate directions by the trial judge in favour of the appellant. The circumstance that more might have been made of this, had Mr Yarrow been available, does not in my opinion mean that there was either an error of principle or that the decision to admit the material was clearly wrong. 
     51   In relation to the possibility of Mr Yarrow's evidence and also Mr Carnell's evidence being misleading because of the other drugs being found in the vehicle, it seems to me that this is a matter that gives rise to a difficult question for trial judges. Where evidence is not led against an accused because of its prejudicial effect, and where an account of events occurring at the time of an arrest could possibly be misleading because that other evidence is not led, it seems to me that there is no easy answer to dealing with the matter fairly. 
     52   In some cases the only appropriate step might be to exclude the evidence that might possibly be misleading. Another approach, it seems to me, is to permit that evidence to be led, but to make sure that use is not made of it which would be misleading by reason of the absence of the evidence prejudicial to the accused. 
     53   In my opinion, matters which might possibly have been misleading in relation to the reference to drugs in the second conversation and the evidence relating to flight, by reason of the absence of the prejudicial material in relation to the other drugs, was dealt with appropriately, in particular by not being given undue prominence and by ensuring that no matter was put to the jury that was likely to mislead them. 
     54   There is some force in the submission that the Crown's reliance on the appellant's alleged introduction of himself as George was a matter that could not rationally support a conviction unless the Crown alleged that the appellant was the writer of the document; but in my assessment this was a very minor part of the case. It was highly unlikely to have misled the jury and it was certainly not given undue prominence. 
     55   In relation to the absence of a warning concerning the jury not seeing Mr Yarrow and not hearing him cross examined, cases such as Mendham & Foster do assert that such a warning should be given as a matter of course. I think it was an error not to have given that direction; but my assessment of the matter again is that this was a very minor part of the case, and my assessment is that it did not deprive the appellant of a chance of acquittal. In the absence of other successful grounds of appeal, in my opinion it would be appropriate to apply the proviso in relation to this matter.  
     56   In relation to the submission that an Edwards' direction was required in relation to the second conversation and in relation to the flight, my view is that these were such minor parts of the Crown case that an Edwards' direction was not required and, indeed, could possibly have given those matters undue prominence. 
     57   In my opinion the trial judge's directions concerning Mr Yarrow's motivation was not gratuitous. It had been put by the appellant's counsel that, because the corroborative material was first introduced eight months after the event, the jury could conclude it was fabricated in order to corroborate Mr Carnell. In those circumstances a comment on motivation was not, in my view, inappropriate, and in my view there is not shown to be such imbalance in the comment to suggest error. 
     58   The second main area of appeal concerns directions in relation to alleged lies by the appellant. The trial judge's summing up refers to lies alleged by the Crown in relation to a number of particular matters. The trial judge referred to alleged lies by the appellant concerning his coming to Sydney overnight from Brisbane for some reasons other than this transaction with Mr Moore, his evidence that he did not know Mr Moore was going to Thailand on 24 November, his evidence concerning his reaching into the boot after getting into the Mitsubishi vehicle, his evidence of inspection of the transformer cases in Bangkok in December 1995, his reasons for giving wrong addresses in various documents and using an alias of Frank Barnett, his explanation of apparent secrecy in relation to bicycle parts in the Kalbo facsimile message, coupled with the circumstance that there was no documentation found in the vehicle referring to bicycle parts, his evidence that his only purpose in connection with the relevant transaction in his activities in Sydney was to pick up two boxes to take them back to Brisbane, so that Mr Dowsley could get them in Brisbane. 
     59   Having referred to those allegations concerning lies, the trial judge went on to say, as he said on a number of occasions, that the accused bore no onus of proof to prove anything, and that in a case depending on circumstantial evidence, the jury had to consider all the evidence, including that of the appellant. 
     60   Mr Ramage referred to the case of Edwards and also to Zoneff v R (2000) 200 CLR 234. He pointed out that the accused's counsel had sought a further direction concerning lies, to the effect that whether or not the jury accepted that the appellant had lied, still the Crown had to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. 
     61   Mr Ramage's submission was that in this case there should either have been a direction of the type discussed in Edwards concerning consciousness of guilt, or a direction that the matter of alleged lies would only affect credibility, or, at the very least, a more general direction discussed in Zoneff. 
     62   In my opinion this is not a case which required any of these specific directions. There was, in this case, no doubt that there had been an importation of cannabis resin and there was no doubt as to the appellant's involvement in the importation. The only question in issue was whether the appellant knew that the importation in which he was involved did include the importation of cannabis resin. 
     63   In order to explain his involvement, the appellant gave detailed evidence of the history of his involvement in what he claimed he understood to be a genuine transaction of importing transformers. The Crown's submission was, in effect, that this whole history was a fabrication, and the Crown gave effect to this submission by pointing to particular aspects of the history which the Crown contended to be unbelievable. 
     64   In my opinion, in submitting that these aspects of the evidence were unbelievable and were lies, the Crown was not relying on the lies purely as going to the credit of the appellant, or as disclosing consciousness of guilt, but rather as part of what the Crown contended to be an unbelievable account of the appellant's involvement. A finding beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty necessarily required a finding that the history he gave was a deliberate fabrication; and on the other hand, a finding that the history was a deliberate fabrication meant, in my opinion, that there could not be a rational decision other than that he knew the importation was of cannabis. Because the other evidence in the case very strongly supported an inference of knowledge, the additional circumstance of a deliberately false account of his understanding and involvement in the transaction could not, in my opinion, be given any rational explanation consistent with innocence. 
     65   So, for those reasons, it seems to me that lies in this case were not relied on either as affecting credibility or as showing consciousness of guilt, but rather as matters going directly to the essential issue. In my opinion it was sufficient in this case that the judge made it abundantly clear that there was no onus on the accused to prove anything, and that the Crown had to prove every element in the case, including the appellant's knowledge, beyond reasonable doubt. 
     66   The next area of appeal concerns alleged error by the trial judge in refusing an application by the accused to cross examine a Federal agent Melrose and refusing the application of the accused to have Federal agents Bell and Price recalled. The matter in respect of which those applications were made was whether the letter signed by George was found taped to a transformer box or to one of the smaller cartons within the main carton. In my opinion this matter was so peripheral to the case that there is no substance in the submission that there was an error of discretion which could provide a ground of appeal. 
     67   The next area of appeal concerns criticisms of the defence counsel. In my opinion the manner of dealing with submissions by defence counsel, with which the trial judge disagreed, is very peculiarly a matter within the discretion of the trial judge, and in respect of which the trial judge is in a much better position than this Court to make an assessment. In those circumstances, it seems to me that a very powerful case would need to be made out of error in relation to such a matter. I think it is sufficient to say in this case that in my opinion a powerful case of that nature is not made out. 
     68   The final matter in respect of which an appeal is brought concerns sentence. As mentioned earlier, the appellant was sentenced to 6.5 years with a non parole period of 4.5 years, back dated to commence on 17 May 2000. It appears that the trial judge referred to some comparative sentences, worked back from those sentences to a starting point of around eleven years, took from eleven years a deduction of one-third to allow for remissions not available in New South Wales; he then reached a figure of either seven or seven and a half years; he gave credit of six months for previous occasions in custody, possibly a credit totalling 12 months, but certainly at least six months. 
     69   Mr Ramage submitted that error was shown, firstly in the starting point of around eleven years; secondly in failing to give sufficient weight to the onerous nature of incarceration in the Philippines and to the circumstance of him having been shot on the occasion of arrest in the Philippines, failing to take into account long and extensive reporting on bail since mid August 1988, and failing to take into account financial hardship suffered by the prisoner and his family. This arose from the circumstance that the prisoner broke bail to go to the Philippines because of illness of his daughter, resulting in the forfeiture of $25,000 put up by his mother, and resulting consequently in loss of the family home. Mr Ramage also submitted that there was failure to give sufficient weight to matters under section 16A, including previous character and good prospects of rehabilitation.  
     70   In relation to the non parole period, Mr Ramage submitted that the appropriate non parole period was approximately 60 to 66 per cent in the absence of special circumstances. The non parole period in this case was in excess of 69 per cent of the head sentence, and exceeded by some 12 months the highest other non parole period imposed in certain statistics provided by Mr Ramage to the court. 
     71   In my opinion no error is shown in the fixing of the head sentence: no error of principle in my opinion is identified in the reasons of the judge, and in my opinion it is not made out that this sentence was so excessive that this Court should intervene. However, I think there is some force in submissions concerning the non parole period. 
     72   In addition to the submissions which I have outlined, it seems to me that, in calculating a non parole period, when credit is given for time previously served in prison, the correct approach would normally be to take the head sentence arrived at before giving credit for that time, work out an appropriate proportion for the non parole period, and then give the benefit of the previous period of incarceration to both periods. That results in a somewhat larger parole period than if one calculates the proportion after one has given credit for the previous period of incarceration. 
     73   In my opinion, when one couples that consideration with the adoption of a proportion in excess of 69 per cent in this case, there is a matter of principle which indicates that a shorter non parole period should have been given. In my opinion the appropriate non parole period in this case is four years.  
     74   For those reasons I would propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed, that leave to appeal on sentence be granted, that the head sentence be confirmed but there be substituted a non parole period of four years commencing 17 May 2000. 
     75   MATHEWS AJ: I agree. 
     76   STUDDERT J: I also agree. 
     77   HODGSON JA: The order of the Court is the appeal against conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal against sentence is granted. The head sentence is confirmed; the specification of the non parole period is set aside and in lieu thereof the Court substitutes a non parole period of four years commencing 17 May 2000, to expire on 16 May 2004.

      JUDGMENT 
     1    STUDDERT J:  I agree with McClellan J. 
      
       
     2    McCLELLAN J: The applicant, David Cuong Giang, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by Sides DCJ. The applicant pleaded guilty to doing an act intending to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act. The offence carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. 
      
       
     3    The offence occurred following an incident which took place at the Mekong Club in Cabramatta on 6 March 1999. A person known as Mark Gabriel, who was working as a security guard at the Club, became involved in an altercation with another security guard. Mr Gabriel struck the other security guard with an extendable baton and was subsequently charged with malicious wounding. That charge was listed for hearing at the Burwood Local Court on 16 July 1999. 
      
       
     4    On that day the case was not completed and it was stood over for further hearing on 7 October 1999. During the period between the hearing dates the police received information that Mr Gabriel had recruited witnesses to give false evidence for him. In fact the applicant had agreed with Mr Gabriel that he would give false evidence to the effect that he observed Mr Gabriel to be acting in self-defence on the occasion which gave rise to the malicious wounding charge. 
      
       
     5    The applicant was present in court on 16 July 1999 for the purpose of giving evidence. However, as the prosecution case was not completed on that day he was not required.  
      
       
     6    After 16 July 1999, the police obtained evidence of the agreement between the applicant and Mr Gabriel by the use of a listening device worn by an informant. On the adjourned date, 7 October 1999, the applicant attended the court but left without giving evidence. On this occasion he was dressed in clothes described as suitable for him to give evidence. 
      
       
     7    On 5 January the applicant was arrested and made admissions to the police of his involvement in the matter. Sides DCJ accepted from the material obtained in the ERISP interview that Mr Gabriel had persuaded the applicant that he had a case for self-defence and that the applicant agreed to go to court to assist him in making out that case. I infer that others, apart from Mr Gabriel, also participated in persuading the applicant to give false evidence. As I have indicated the applicant did not proceed with his intention and did not give evidence. 
      
       
     8    The ERISP interview contains a statement by the applicant that although he had originally gone to court with the intention of giving false evidence, he changed his mind prior to 7 October 1999. He said that although he was aware that the police knew of his intention, this did not influence him in his decision. He said he was ""already planning not to be a witness by that time"". 
      
       
     9    At the sentencing hearing the police Breach Report, which included a statement of the facts, was tendered. That report indicates that on 7 October the applicant left the court before 10am. The report records that ""[the applicant] further stated that after attending court on 16 July, he became aware of the serious nature of the offence and decided not to give evidence."" 
      
       
     10    Sides DCJ did not accept this evidence which he described as self serving. He drew attention to the fact that the applicant had previously indicated an intention to go to court and give false evidence, and that on 7 October went well dressed for the occasion. He found that the applicant only changed his mind once he arrived at court on 7 October after Mr Gabriel told him that the police were aware of the plan. 
      
       
     11    The subjective circumstances of the appellant provide little indication, but for one matter, of any propensity for the applicant to offend. He was born in Vietnam on 3 January 1977 and is the oldest of two boys. He was twenty-two years of age at the time of the offence. He migrated to Australia with his family as a refugee in 1980. His parents separated when he was aged sixteen years and he has had only limited contact with his father who now lives in the United States of America. The applicant remains close to his mother who continues to be supportive of him. 
      
       
     12    The applicant left school at eighteen years of age, having obtained his Higher School Certificate. He then graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce (Management), a three year university degree course. He worked casually during his university years. Prior to his arrest he was employed as a Sales/Marketing representative, and he was undertaking further university courses to improve his position. He earns something in the order of $500 a week. 
      
       
     13    The applicant indicated to both the police when interviewed and the Probation officer, that he was sorry and Sides DCJ accepted that he had demonstrated some contrition. However, his Honour concluded that the plea of guilty was an acknowledgment of the strength of the Crown case which, having regard to the listening device evidence, was obviously strong. 
      
       
     14    The applicant has a previous conviction dating from 1995 when he was eighteen years of age. On that occasion he was convicted for stealing from a person and ordered to perform 200 hours community service. The evidence shows that this service was performed satisfactorily. 
      
       
     15    The applicant did not initiate the offence and did not stand to gain in any way from its commission. There was no evidence that he would gain any reward although he was to receive a modest sum to recompense him for the work that he missed by attending court. His only motive appears to have been to help out his friend. 
      
       
     16    Sides DCJ found that in light of the applicant's work record, the support of his mother and other matters, it was likely that the applicant had good prospects of a successful rehabilitation. 
      
       
     17    His Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of fifteen months imprisonment fixing a non parole period of eight months. In imposing this sentence he remarked that the offence was one which struck at the very heart of the criminal justice system and that although it was not a case near the top of the range of offences covered by the section, it was not at the very bottom. Drawing attention to the need for general deterrence, his Honour found that the imposition of a bond or a community service order would not adequately reflect the seriousness of the matter or serve to deter others. He expressed a similar view about a suspended sentence. He recorded the fact that the applicant had indicated that he did not consent to serving his sentence by way of periodic detention.  
      
       
     18    The applicant submits that the sentence imposed by Sides DCJ was manifestly excessive and failed to have adequate regard to the following matters: 
      
       
        
       (a) the early plea of guilty entered in the local court on the basis of s 51A of the  
       Justice Act; 
        
        
       (b) the youth and academic and work qualifications of the applicant; 
        
        
       (c) the real potential for general rehabilitation based on the contrition shown by the plea and in the evidence generally before the District Court. It is submitted the undue weight placed upon the issue of general deterrence in the face of the apparent excellent prospects for rehabilitation, and; 
        
        
       (d) the fact of the applicant's one prior conviction balanced against the circumstance of an otherwise unblemished record and the fact that the present sentence constituted a first time in custody. 
        
       
     19    It is also submitted that given the lesser role played by the applicant in the commission of the offence compared with that of the principal offender, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Attention is drawn to the available statistics which, from a limited sample, reveal that 53 per cent of the recorded cases resulted in the imposition of a non-custodial sentence. 
      
       
     20    An application was made before the sentencing judge for an assessment to be made as to whether the applicant was an appropriate person to serve his sentence by way of home detention. His Honour rejected this application. As I have indicated, his Honour also recorded the fact that it was indicated to him that the applicant did not consent to serving a sentence by way of periodic detention. It was submitted that before ignoring this possibility, his Honour should have inquired as to the reason why consent was not forthcoming. 
      
       
     21    The offence committed by the applicant is unquestionably serious. As I have already stated, it carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. Section 319 of the Crimes Act and other similar provisions, which have as their purpose the protection of curial proceedings, have been considered by this Court on many occasions. In every case the court has been concerned to emphasise the need to impose a sentence which not only punishes the offender but will deter others from a similar course of action. 
      
       
     22    In R v Purtell, [2001] NSWCCA 21, this Court considered a Crown appeal with respect to a matter where the sentencing judge, finding the charge proved, did not proceed to a conviction and imposed a good behaviour bond for a period of two years. The offender had provided a false reference to support his case on sentence for a conviction on an assault charge. 
      
       
     23    Before the sentencing judge the Crown had accepted that a suspended custodial sentence may be appropriate. However, this Court found that the sentencing judge had erred. Giles JA said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The offence of perverting the course of justice carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for fourteen years. This recognises the importance of protecting the integrity of the criminal justice system, and the offence has been described as striking at the heart of the judicial system (see R v Hakim, CCA, 5 September 1996, unreported; see also R v Taouk (1992) 65 A Crim R 387 at 392). Deterrence is an important consideration in this regard."" 
         
        
       
     24    His Honour concluded that the sentence should be varied and said that he would ""not exclude a custodial sentence as something which could have been pronounced by Judge Gibson."" However, because of the attitude of the Crown before the sentencing judge, a full time custodial sentence was not imposed. 
      
       
     25    In that case, Hulme J said of the order made by the sentencing judge that, ""it was a wholly inadequate way of dealing with the respondent's criminality."" He said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Indeed, in my view, the approach taken by the Crown at first instance was inadequate in that regard. It is to be inferred he benefited by his perversion of the course of justice, and neither the order made by Judge Gibson nor that indeed as originally sought by the Crown would have in any way deprived him of the benefits he received by his dishonest conduct. 
         
        
        
         
         In my view it could be an extremely rare case of which this is not one that the penalty imposed for the respondent's offence should be less than one which hurt significantly."" 
         
        
       
     26    There can be little doubt that when the offender is the instigator of the act which is intended to compromise the integrity of the curial process and benefits or intends to benefit from the doing of the agreed act, extraordinary circumstances will be required before a custodial sentence is not appropriate.  
      
       
     27    The situation may be different when the offender, although a willing participant, neither initiates or stands to benefit from the offence. No doubt it was for this reason that Giles JA remarked with respect to the co-accused in Purtell, who had assisted in creating the false reference, but received the same sentence, that her circumstances were not comparable to those of the principal offender. Hulme J of course, emphasised the need to impose a sentence ""which hurt significantly"" in the context of an offender who had benefited from his dishonest conduct. 
      
       
     28    In R v Chapman, Court of Criminal Appeal, 21 May 1998, unreported, this Court examined the circumstances where a serving police officer gave false evidence in his own defence. The Crown appealed when the sentencing judge deferred passing sentence and imposed a good behaviour bond. Simpson J examined the relevant authorities observing that ""absent extraordinary circumstances, a sentence of full time imprisonment must be imposed."" Her Honour referred to the judgment of Abadee J in R v Bulliman, Court of Criminal Appeal, 25 February 1993, unreported, when his Honour stated ""General deterrence is the point of importance to be particularly emphasised in this type of case."" 
      
       
     29    R v Aristodemou, Court of Criminal Appeal, 30 June 1994, unreported, involved an unsuccessful appeal against a custodial sentence imposed for giving false evidence to an ICAC inquiry. Of significance to the present case is the fact that Badgery-Parker J rejected a submission that the court should look more leniently on false evidence given to protect another as opposed to false evidence given by the wrongdoer. 
      
       
     30    He said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""I would reject that submission entirely. The will of the community which led to and is manifested by the enactment of the ICAC Act is that corruption should be eradicated from the community and that the means to produce that result should include the coercive and inquisitory powers conferred on ICAC by the statute. Where a person acts so as to frustrate an ICAC investigation into corruption, it would appear to me that the community would approve that he should be severely punished. In particular, I do not accept the proposition that the community would regard as in any way a mitigating circumstance that the motive for the applicant's false swearing was not to conceal corruption on his own part but was to conceal the corrupt conduct of others. NO doubt there is an acceptance on the part of those who commit crime that it is dishonourable to inform on others and that there is some nobility in declining to do so. It by no means follows that the same view is taken by right-thinking members of the community and for my part, I refuse to proceed on the assumption that that is so. It is no doubt true that in some circumstances the seriousness of a crime may be seen to be mitigated if it was committed for an honourable, albeit mistaken motive. It is in my view an attempt to press that submission too far if the conduct is such to defeat the purpose of legislation enacted in the public interest."" 
         
        
       
     31    These observations were made at a time when the work of the ICAC was relatively new and its activity subject to considerable controversy. There can be no doubt that the courts must always act to protect the integrity of curial process, the only question being whether a full time custodial sentence is necessary in all cases?  
      
       
     32    Badgery-Parker J recognised that there may be cases when it is not required but that they will be unusual. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Anyone who commits an offence of perjury or false swearing in the courts of judicial proceedings or in proceedings such as a Royal Commission or an ICAC Inquiry should do so in the clear understanding that if his offence is detected he will go to gaol except in very particular circumstances."" 
         
        
       
     33    Badgery-Parker J also considered the significance, if any, of the fact that in at least six cases, which could be identified, offenders had given false evidence denying their own corruption, but were dealt with by magistrates without the imposition of a gaol term. He said that in his opinion, in the absence of extraordinary compelling subjective circumstances, the sentences were inadequate. 
      
       
     34    The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Chad, 13 May 1997, unreported, is to similar effect. In that case the personal circumstances of the offender were said to be relevant to the length of any prison sentence but that a term of full-time custody was appropriate. 
      
       
     35    There are a number of decisions relating to similar offences in both Victoria and Western Australia where a full-time custodial sentence has not been imposed. See R v Healy, Court of Appeal of Victoria, 4 August 1997, unreported; R v Stone, Supreme Court of Victoria, 4 March 1998, unreported; R v Paul Ronald Delio, Supreme Court of Victoria, 23 March 1998; Christian v R Supreme Court of West Australia Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 May 1996; R v Wiltshire, [1999] WASCA 113. These decisions only demonstrate that a non-custodial may be appropriate depending on the circumstances of the particular case. 
      
       
     36    Attention has been drawn to the statistical material which indicates that in many cases a custodial sentence has not been imposed. Whether the sample is adequate may be questioned. However, allowing for some cases in which the circumstances were truly exceptional, it may be that when sentencing for this type of offence the courts have not had sufficient regard to the principles stated and repeated by this Court.  
      
       
     37    There is no doubt that the applicant presented a strong subjective case. He has demonstrated that notwithstanding some earlier disadvantages in his life he is a person with a maturity of purpose and self-discipline resulting in his achieving tertiary academic qualifications and appropriate employment. Although he has now offended on two occasions the first could be viewed as minor and, notwithstanding the gravity of the second matter, he has good prospects of rehabilitation. 
      
       
     38    A challenge is made to the finding by his Honour that the applicant's decision to leave the court on 7 October 1999 and not give evidence, was motivated by knowledge that the police were aware of the illegal agreement. Emphasis was given to the statement in the record of interview that this fact did not influence the applicant's decision, and it was submitted that his Honour should have accepted this statement rather than form a different conclusion. 
      
       
     39    In my opinion it was open to his Honour to reject the applicant's statement in the record of interview and form the conclusion that he did. Accordingly, it was appropriate for his Honour to conclude that this was not a case where an illegal intention had been formed and then abandoned before the intended act was carried out. If that had been the case, it may have been possible to adopt a different view of the sentence which his Honour imposed. 
      
       
     40    With respect to the submission in relation to periodic detention, it is true that it is not apparent as to why the applicant did not give consent to serving his sentence in this manner. However, the documents indicate that he was employed for six days each week and it may be assumed that there was a concern that if he was allowed to serve his sentence by periodic detention he would not be able to continue in his employment. No doubt, after receiving advice, the decision was made to press for a sentence which did not involve any form of custody, rather than take a step which might encourage his Honour to impose a sentence to be served by periodic detention. In these circumstances the applicant's complaint that his Honour should have further pursued this option, cannot be sustained. 
      
       
     41    The present case is a difficult one. It is not clear why the applicant gave in to the request of Mr Gabriel and agreed to give false evidence. It can only be assumed that he took this action from some misguided view that he could be of assistance to a friend. The commission of the offence and the imposition of a term of full time custody is a tragedy for a young man, who from all of the available evidence, has managed to structure a productive and fulfilling start to his life.  
      
       
     42    The Crown draws attention to the objective criminality of the applicant. It is plain that because of the agreement by the applicant to give false evidence, instructions were given to Mr Gabriel's solicitor, and no doubt the initial part of the case against Mr Gabriel was conducted on the basis of those instructions. The applicant having formed the intention to give false evidence, attended court for that purpose and maintained the intention after the matter was adjourned part heard. The intention was only abandoned after the proceedings had commenced and before the adjourned hearing took place. 
      
       
     43    I accept that the subjective matters in this case are significant. Although the applicant has a previous conviction, his record of academic achievement and employment indicate that he has significant prospects of leading a productive and worthwhile life. However, the offence which he committed is serious and in my opinion it cannot be said that the circumstances of its commission fall at the lowest end of the scale of criminality. Having regard to the previous statements made by this Court in relation to this type of offence, his Honour did not err by imposing a sentence of full-time custody. 
      
       
     44    Whatever may be the view of this Court of the sentence which was imposed it can only interfere where error has been demonstrated (see Slander v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 655 and Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 175 ALR 315. Provided the sentence imposed was within the discretion of the sentencing judge this Court cannot intervene. 
      
       
     45    In my opinion having regard to the serious nature of the offence, the sentence imposed by Sides DCJ, although undoubtedly at the top end of the available range, was properly within the discretion available to him and error has not been demonstrated. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOURT OF APPEAL CA 40075/00 MASON P MEAGHER JA GILES JA Friday, July 20 2001 
      
      BELINDA GRAHAM v THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
     1   MEAGHER JA: The Appellant/Plaintiff, Miss Graham is a young lady in her mid-twenties who suffered severe injuries when she was crossing Carlisle Avenue, Dharruk, on 22 February 1988 when she was hit by a motor vehicle. She was then aged twelve years, having been born on 19 June 1975. She was returning from school, that is Mount Druitt High School, which she had attended for about three weeks. She was then in Year Seven. Up till this time she had been in a number of schools; Ashfield Infants School, Hebersham Infants School, Whalan Public School. She was a disadvantaged child, suffering from impaired eyesight and bad balance, the latter condition being possibly related to the former.  
     2   Her mother, with whom she resided, lived about one kilometre from the school. To walk to and from school involved crossing Carlisle Street, the only heavily trafficked street between her home and the school. Normally on her way to school her mother would walk her to Carlisle Street and then allowed her to walk the rest of the way unaccompanied. On her way home her mother usually met her at Carlisle Street and walked her home.  
     3   On the day of the accident her mother was apparently running late, or perhaps the plaintiff was arriving early, and she tried to cross Carlisle Street without assistance. It was at this point that the accident occurred. She sued the defendant, the State of New South Wales, because of the school’s failure to transport her either by bus or by taxi to her home. There was no doubt that the school knew of her afflictions, that it knew it was dangerous for her to walk across Carlisle Street, that it knew that an accident might well occur unless she was greatly helped to get home. It knew that at her previous schools she went home on a school bus. It knew that Miss Graham’s mother had requested transport to be made available for her on the way home. The school knew that the mother’s request had been supported by a doctor. Nevertheless, for reasons of its own, the respondent discontinued the school bus towards the beginning of 1988 and had notified Miss Graham’s mother accordingly.  
     4   In these circumstances Patten DCJ, whilst having the greatest of sympathy for the plaintiff, was of the view that her case against the State had to fail. It would be impossible not to share his Honour’s sympathy. I find it also impossible to see that his Honour was incorrect, and in my view this appeal must fail. 
     5   This is so, in my opinion, because the common law in general imposes no prima facie duty to prevent another person from loss or injury. There are exceptions to that principle but none of them is relevant here. This is probably another way of saying in situations like the present there is no proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant. No doubt the school had a duty to take reasonable steps to protect the child whilst it was at school, and this it apparently did. There may also have been a duty to inform Miss Graham’s parents that neither taxi nor bus was running, and this it certainly did. There is no duty, in my opinion, to go further to take precautions to escort a pupil like Miss Graham to her home. Except in exceptional circumstances the master/pupil relationship ceases to exist at the school boundary. For these reasons, in my view, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
     6   MASON P: I agree.  
     7   Counsel for the appellant took us to passages in Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Diocese of Bathurst v Koffman (1996) ATR 81-399. The judgments indicate that the content of the duty which a school authority owes to a pupil may be affected by the particular circumstances of the pupil or of the vicinity of the school. There will be some situations where the duty extends beyond the school gate, at least so far as enlivening some obligation to give a particular warning to parents or sometimes to effect some added supervision.  
     8   In my view this case falls very clearly on the wrong side of the line as far as the appellant is concerned. The fact that she was twelve, in high school, that the school made plain to her and her parents that the request for transport to and from school was declined, and the general arrangements that were in place for the appellant to walk to and from school all indicate that, whatever the scope of the duty, it was not breached in the present case.  
     9   The appellant sought to gain some comfort from the fact that, following the accident, there was an arrangement made for transport for this particular pupil. I think the fact of the event occurring afterwards shows that transport could have been provided, that in itself is a self-evident proposition. It doesn’t really do anything, on the facts of this case, to assist the plaintiff in showing that the considered decision not to make available this added form of protection was one which was unreasonable in the circumstances. I agree with the orders proposed. 
     10   GILES JA: I agree with both judgments. In short, the State as educational authority owed a duty of care to the appellant as pupil, and the question was, in the particular circumstances of a twelve year-old girl with the disabilities from which the appellant suffered and with the history of the schooling recounted by Meagher JA, whether the content of the duty was such that the State was required to provide bus or taxi transport from the school to the appellant’s home in order to protect her from harm when crossing Carlisle Avenue. In my opinion it was not, and the duty was sufficiently discharged by making known to the appellant’s mother that such transport would not be provided so that the appellant’s mother could herself take such steps as were considered appropriate to see the appellant across Carlisle Avenue, as she generally did but on this occasion for whatever reason, was unable to do. I agree with the orders proposed. 
     11   MASON P: The appeal is dismissed with costs.

     3    SPERLING J: On 27 July 1988, the applicant was apprehended and charged with the murder of Bruce Mannion. Having been committed for trial, he was indicted before Grove J on 9 April 1990. He pleaded “Not guilty”. The trial proceeded before Grove J and a jury. The applicant was found guilty as charged on 22 May 1990. On 10 August 1990, Grove J sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment as he was, at that time, required to do by law in the absence of mitigating circumstances. The sentence took effect from 28 July 1988. 
      
       
        
       
     4    On 14 February 1994, this Court heard an appeal against conviction and an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The appeal against conviction was dismissed on the merits after argument. The application for leave to appeal against sentence was also dismissed. 
      
       
        
       
     5    On 27 November 1998, Grove J heard an application by the applicant for redetermination of the life sentence. The applicant and the Crown were legally represented at the hearing. 
      
       
        
       
     6    The application was made pursuant to s13A of the Sentencing Act 1989, now repealed but, in substance, re-enacted in other legislation. Under that provision, Grove J had power to redetermine the sentence or to decline to do so and, in the latter event, to direct that the applicant not re-apply for a specified period. 
      
       
        
       
     7    The evidence tendered by the Crown included a statement of facts dated 4 March 1997 with annexures (Exh A), a report by the Serious Offenders Review Council (SORC) dated 16 October 1997 (Exh B), and a bundle of indexed documents (Exh C). These exhibits included a report by Dr H Jolly, psychiatrist, dated 20 February 1985, a report by Dr I Ali, psychiatrist, dated 3 October 1997 (Annexure X to Exh B) and a report by Dr T Luu, psychiatrist, (part of Exh C). There was no objection to the tender of these documents. In addition, oral evidence was given by Ms M Anderson, executive officer and registrar of SORC, and by Dr R A Wilcox, psychiatrist. These witnesses were called by the Crown. 
      
       
        
       
     8    The applicant tendered a report by Mr J Moulton, registered nurse, (Exh 1), a statement of facts responding to Exh A (Exh 2) and a bundle of documents (Exh 3). In his response to the Crown’s statement of facts, the applicant denied that he is guilty of the murder of Bruce Mannion, denied that he was or had been mentally ill, and denied much of the histories appearing in the medical reports annexed to the SORC report. 
      
       
        
       
     9    The Crown’s statement of facts (Exh A) provided particulars of the applicant’s trial, his criminal history and the sentencing process. The applicant’s response (Exh 2) and the bundle of documents (Exh 3) disputed a large number of items in the Exh A and presented documentary material relating to studies undertaken while in prison and other matters which the applicant wished to have before the Court. 
      
       
        
       
     10    The SORC report (Exh B) provided details of the applicant’s prison history and of his psychiatric history before and during his imprisonment. It concluded with the comments that “[the applicant’s] eccentric behaviour and general reluctance to associate with other inmates or to participate in meaningful programs have delayed his progress to a lower security classification” and, “Until [the applicant’s] condition has been stabilised by medication the Council will not be in a position to make any firm prediction about his future management or progress”. 
      
       
        
       
     11    The report by Dr H Jolly dated 20 February 1985 was to the following effect. At that time, the applicant had been convicted of an earlier offence and was awaiting sentence. Dr Jolly said that, although there was no evidence of a major psychiatric illness, the applicant had a severe personality disorder. 
      
       
        
       
     12    Dr Ali’s report dated 3 October 1997 was to the following effect. Following a number of admissions to prison hospital with florid psychiatric symptoms, the applicant was certified in July 1997 and had been under psychiatric care since then as a forensic patient. 
      
       
        
       
     13    Dr Luu was Dr Wilcox’s psychiatric registrar. Her report of 26 November 1998 was to the effect that, as at that date, the applicant continued under care as a forensic patient with persisting florid symptoms. 
      
       
        
       
     14    Ms Anderson said in chief that it was still not possible for SORC to formulate a definitive programme for the applicant because of his mental state. In cross examination, she said the most recent review by a SORC committee was in June 1998. That was six months before the hearing of the redetermination application. 
      
       
        
       
     15    Dr Wilcox said she was treating the applicant. She said it was unlikely that the applicant’s condition would change over the ensuing three years, although that was possible. It was also possible he would develop greater insight and that he would become more compliant in relation to his medication. She said the applicant was taking his medication because he knew he could be forced to do so and that, if the applicant continued on medication, he could be expected to become more insightful. In cross examination she agreed that the applicant’s prospects of being placed in a custodial hospital outside prison before he was eligible for release, but still as a forensic patient, would be greater the shorter the period of the sentence remaining to be served. Redetermination of his life sentence would, therefore, she agreed, improve his chances of such a placement. She agreed that inmates generally benefited from the opportunity to have a more normal environment outside prison, and that there was no reason to think the applicant would be an exception in that regard. 
      
       
        
       
     16    Mr J Moulton, whose report dated 3 May 1998 was tendered by the applicant (Exh 1), was a psychiatric registered nurse at the prison hospital. The report included an observation that, in Mr Moulton’s opinion, the applicant displayed a reasonable amount of insight into his illness. The evidence of the psychiatrists to whom I have referred was otherwise.  
      
       
        
       
     17    On 18 December 1998, Grove J gave judgment, declining to redetermine the sentence and directing that the applicant not re-apply for a period of three years from that date. Had the judge given no such direction, the applicant would have been precluded from re-applying for three years in any event, by operation of subs (8B) of s13A. The only complaint that the applicant can have about the direction is, therefore, that the period specified should have been shorter. 
      
       
        
       
     18    On 5 April 2001, the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal from the decision of 18 December 1998 and an application to extend time for that application. The application for leave to appeal should be taken to relate to Grove J having declined to redetermine the sentence and to the period specified in the direction. 
      
       
        
       
     19    In his published reasons for decision, Grove J found - as the evidence before him incontrovertibly established - that the applicant had been transferred to a prison hospital as a forensic patient on 28 July 1997, having been certified mentally ill by Dr O’Dea and Dr Wilcox, psychiatrists, at that time. 
      
       
        
       
     20    His Honour found - again, as the evidence incontrovertibly established - that there was a history of serious crimes being committed soon after the applicant had been released from prison on parole on earlier occasions. 
      
       
        
       
     21    His Honour found that “the Council is not able to formulate a definitive program for the applicant because it will depend very much on his state of mental health”. That this was the opinion of SORC was incontrovertible. 
      
       
        
       
     22    His Honour’s reasons for declining to redetermine the life sentence were expressed as follows. His Honour said that “further investigation should take place before determination of the minimum and the additional term of the sentence.” Concerning any future redetermination of a full term, his Honour said, “Absent any mitigation deriving from the applicant’s mental condition, I would assess a proportionate sentence [that is, a redetermined sentence] in the circumstances manifest at trial at more than twenty years penal servitude”. His Honour went on to say that “[a] decision on minimum term requires more definitive information as to the mental health of the applicant and his [the applicant’s] prognosis” and that “a further three years should enable creation of an information resource from which the extent of mitigation referrable to the applicant’s mental condition and appropriate rehabilitative steps can be gauged”. His Honour said, “the most liberal contemplation of possible factors to be given account would not produce in my estimate a minimum term which would expire before a further application by the applicant may be brought”. His Honour acknowledged a submission by the applicant’s counsel that redetermining the life sentence at that stage, with determination of a minimum term, would “attract favourable consideration for his [the applicant’s] transfer to an ‘outside’ community hospital.”23    The time served in prison as at three years hence, dated from his Honour’s decision, was - by simple arithmetic - about 13 and a half years. 
      
       
        
       
     24    His Honour’s reasons for dismissing the application for redetermination and for the three year direction may, accordingly, be summarised as follows: 
      
       
        
         
        (a) There were problems about deciding the question of redetermination satisfactorily at that stage. 
         
         
        (b) There was the prospect that a better informed decision could be made in three years time. 
         
         
        (c) The minimum term of any sentence as redetermined at a future time would not expire on a date earlier than three years hence. 
         
         
        (d) Implicitly, any prejudice suffered by the applicant in relation to possible placement in a custodial hospital outside prison was outweighed by the advantage of deferring the question of redetermination for three years. 
         
        
       
     25    The applicant was not represented at the hearing of the present appeal proceedings. Of the grounds of appeal filed by the applicant, the Court was informed by the applicant that he wished to press only two of them. These were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
          25. I produce the notes taken by my solicitor at the time a Miss Priscilla Adey and my notes with evidence to show that the evidence of these witnesses is either in disput [ 
          sic 
          ] to prove my guilt and also for me to prove that those witnesses and others are deliberately mistaken or lying about their evidence about me. Also that my legal counsel never properly presented the case before the court with the facts I have produced, which shows the negligence of my legal counsel to present my case properly before the court, thus, forcing me to become convicted on uncredible [ 
          sic 
          ] evidence on the Crown [ 
          sic 
          ]. 
          
         
         
          
          27. That the Honourable K Enderby QC (Chairman) of the Serious Offenders Review Board did authenticate and approve of the SORC report of the 16th of Oct 1997, which went before the Supreme Court for my life redetermination of sentence [ 
          sic 
          ] in Dec 1998. 
           
          The fact is that SORC refused to investigate any of the issues raised in the report or to check if the information is correct and based on  
          true FACTS 
          ! My evidence shows that the SORC Report presented before the Supreme Court is biased towards me [ 
          sic 
          ] for 2 reasons. 
           
          Firstly, No good conduct reports were ever presented only the alleged bad one’s [ 
          sic 
          ] which were all based on lies anyway. This proves that SORC did deliberately lie before the Supreme Court in presenting a report they knew was false, biased and intended to deliberately cause me harm by presenting this report which is not based on FACTS - nor is it beyond reasonable doubt. 
           
          Secondly, the SORC report is incredible, unreliable, false - does not prove anything based on facts and does and is not a report that is beyond reasonable doubt and must become inadmissable [ 
          sic 
          ] as evidence. 
          
         
        
       
     26    Obviously enough, these grounds had been drafted by the applicant personally.  
      
       
        
       
     27    As to Ground 25, we have seen the notes by Ms Adey. They are dated March 1989. That was before the applicant came before the Supreme Court for trial. The witnesses referred to in Ground 25 are those referred to in Ms Adey’s notes. They were trial witnesses of whom the applicant had notice.  
      
       
        
       
     28    The complaint in Ground 25 concerning these witnesses and concerning legal counsel relates to the applicant’s trial and conviction. As explained to the applicant at the hearing before us, the present proceedings relate to the decision by Grove J given on 18 December 1998, declining to redetermine the applicant’s life sentence and the three years direction which he made. For the applicant to succeed in the present proceedings, error by Grove J in relation to that decision has to be demonstrated. Grove J had no power on an application for redetermination of the applicant’s life sentence to entertain a challenge to the applicant’s conviction. Accordingly, Ground 25 as a ground for impugning Grove J’s decision of 18 December 1988 must fail. 
      
       
        
       
     29    In summary, Ground 27 asserts -  
      
       
        
         
        (a) That the SORC failed to ensure that the facts stated in the report were true. 
         
         
        (b) That SORC was biased against the applicant as demonstrated by -  
         
         
        (i) SORC including only bad reports and no good conduct reports. 
         
         
        (ii) The report being incredible, unreliable and false. 
         
         
        (c) That the SORC report did not establish facts beyond reasonable doubt and was therefore inadmissible. 
         
        
       
     30    The applicant’s written argument in support of this ground extends to criticism of the reports by Dr Jolly, D Ali and Dr Luu. The applicant asserts that a good deal of what appears in the SORC report and in the psychiatric reports is factually incorrect; that Grove J was wrong to admit the SORC report into evidence; that, having admitted the reports into evidence, he was required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the ostensible facts stated in them; that he failed to observe that standard of proof; and that he could not have been satisfied of the truth of what was said conformably with that standard. 
      
       
        
       
     31    The trial judge was bound by s13A(9)(b) to have regard to reports of the kind that were tendered. The SORC report and the psychiatrist reports were accordingly admissible. The Evidence Act 1995 does not apply to proceedings in relation to sentencing unless the Court so directs: s4(2). So the histories in the medical reports were evidence of the truth of what was stated. (Even if the Evidence Act applied, the result would be the same, by operation of s60 of that act: Welsh (1996) 90 A Crim R 364.) 
      
       
        
       
     32    There was no rational reason for not accepting what was in the reports, including both the histories and the opinions expressed. The assertion of bias on the part of SORC is not made out. There was no rational reason for such a finding arising from the evidence before Grove J or from the material before this Court. 
      
       
        
       
     33    It is unnecessary, in these circumstances, to consider what standard of proof applied. When the only rational evidence is clear and ostensibly sound, the standard of proof is immaterial. 
      
       
        
       
     34    In essence, the trial judge decided that it was better to defer the question of redetermining the applicant’s life sentence for a period of three years for the reasons he gave. I detect no error as alleged in that decision or in his Honour’s reasons for the decision. 
      
       
        
       
     35    The applicant is free to make a fresh application in December of this year. Nothing in this judgment should be construed as an indication as to what the result of any such application should be. No such indication is intended. 
      
       
        
       
     36    As to the application to extend the time for leave to appeal, I would attribute the delay to the applicant’s mental state and would grant leave. 
      
       
        
       
     37    The orders I propose are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
          (1) Extend time for application for leave to appeal. 
          
         
         
          
          (2) Grant application for leave to appeal. 
          
         
         
          
          (3) Dismiss the appeal. 
          
         
         
         -oOo-
